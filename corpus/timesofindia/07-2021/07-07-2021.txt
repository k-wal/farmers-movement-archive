It took firefighters more than 24-hours to put the fire out initially after it started with an explosion at about 3 am Monday which could be heard for kilometers (miles) and blew the windows and doors out of nearby homes. Despite efforts by firefighters to keep the highly flammable chemical styrene monomer from reigniting by continuing to douse the site with water and foam, flames broke out again and burned for about an hour Tuesday afternoon. Little was left of the Ming Dih Chemical factory other than the twisted metal frames and charred remains of its warehouses that were destroyed in the explosion and fire. More than 60 people were injured in the disaster, including a dozen emergency responders, and more than 30 of them were hospitalized. One man, identified as an 18-year-old volunteer firefighter, was killed in the blaze. Police questioned the factory manager in their investigation of the cause of the explosion, who told them that he and eight staff members were woken from their sleep on the site by a strong chemical smell and fled just before the blast, said Maj. Gen. Chumpol Poompuang, the district's police commander. Authorities ordered a 5-kilometer (3-mile) area around the foam and plastic pellet manufacturing factory, near Bangkok's main airport, evacuated as the factory burned, telling residents to avoid inhaling any fumes and warning that they could cause dizziness and vomiting, and cancer in the long term. On Tuesday, Attapol Charoenchansa, who heads the country's pollution control department, said teams were testing the air quality and water in the area of the factory, and were considering narrowing the evacuation zone to allow some residents to return home. He cautioned, however, that rain which began falling Tuesday afternoon could wash the chemicals into water sources, which would be difficult to control. ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights, a regional advocacy group, urged the Thai government to provide the public with more information on the chemicals that had been released, as well as all of its findings on possible contamination. It also stressed that firefighters and others working at the scene, many of whom wore only the masks required by the government to prevent the spread of Covid-19, or none at all, as they battled the blaze, had to be outfitted with better protective equipment during the cleanup. "Now is the time to understand what the impacts of the fire and explosion might be, and ensure that all those still operating in the vicinity are adequately protected," said group member and Philippine lawmaker Sarah Elago. "Seeing firefighters with surgical masks fighting against potentially cancerogenic chemicals was an atrocious sight. The government should urgently provide adequate material for all those still at risk," she said. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has ordered authorities to gather as much information as possible on contamination of soil, ground water, the city's drinking water and air so as to "mitigate the health impact in both the short and long term." "Although the fire is under control, our work has not yet been completed," he said in a statement posted on Facebook. Officials said shockwaves from the initial explosion damaged about 100 houses and 15 cars. It wasn't clear how much monetary damage the fire caused to the factory. Styrene monomer is used in the production of disposable foam plates, cups and other products, and can produce poisonous fumes when ignited. The chemical itself also emits styrene gas, a neurotoxin, which can immobilize people within minutes of inhalation and can be fatal at high concentrations. Last year in the Indian city of Visakhapatnam, a leak of styrene gas from a chemical factory killed 12 people and sickened more than 1,000. The area around the factory is a mixture of older industrial complexes and newer housing developments that were built after the opening of the airport in 2006. A fire at another factory broke out Tuesday evening in eastern Bangkok, with no casualties reported, said Bangkok Gov. Aswin Kwanmuang. The cause of the fire at the Floral Manufacturing Group Co. in the Lat Krabang Industrial Estate was not immediately known. It was put under control, though not totally extinguished, after several hours. No highly toxic chemicals were involved. Veeris Ammarapala, governor of the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand, was quoted on the website of the Bangkok Post newspaper as saying the fire spread quickly because of the large quantities of alcohol on hand used in making perfumes, shampoo and hand sanitizer. He said his agency needs to review fire protection measures for industrial estates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/fire-reignites-at-thai-factory-as-health-concerns-rise/articleshow/84184226.cms||---

The additional grant will be directed primarily on universal vaccination, Premji said while speaking at the foundation day event of the Bombay Chartered Accountants' Society. In the early days of the pandemic last year, Wipro had announced a Rs 1,125-crore aid for the pandemic, which also included converting its facilities at Pune into hospitals. "As our work as well as our situation evolved, we realised that focus on universal vaccination was just as important as other initiatives. So, we have added that as a key element of our Covid-19 relief strategy, and committed an additional Rs 1,000 crore for it," Premji said. Terming the pandemic as a once-a-century event which led to a resolve to fight it with all the resources at disposal, Premji said a comprehensive set of plans was drawn up in the early days itself to tackle both the humanitarian and health aspects. Grassroot teams were organised consisting of 1,600 full-time employees of the Azim Premji Foundation, 55,000 employees working for its partners, 10,000 teachers and 2,500 alumni of the Azim Premji University. Premji, who has committed almost his entire wealth of over $80 billion to philanthropic initiatives with a special focus on education, appeared to be strongly against the idea of promoting school students to the next class and stressed that adequate attention needs to be paid to the lost schooling days. "The worst thing that we could do is to ignore the past one and a half years and just keep promoting children to the next class without helping them to learn what they should have learnt. We can create an enormous deficit which can never be filled up otherwise," he said. Even as the education system grapples with how to go forward, Premji suggested a graded approach that involves having classes in open areas in neighbourhoods, vaccinating teachers and re-engineering education programmes to ensure that the schooling time lost over the past one and half years is made up. Premji said the foundation's efforts have helped 83 lakh people in rural communities and the most vulnerable pockets regain their livelihoods through field interventions like seed and fertiliser supply for farmers, and working capital for poultry farmers and handicraft industry. He said collaborating with the government is important for extending aid deep into the country and added that if one has the required skillsets, the state will "meaningfully" collaborate. The industry doyen, who now devotes full time to his social sector activities, said his mother who ran a hospital for children and Mahatma Gandhi, who advocated a trusteeship model for wealth, have been his greatest inspirations to take the plunge into philanthropy. Premji exhorted everyone to start giving earlier in their lives, terming the late start to philanthropic activities in his life as a "regret". "It is only when we come together in this way we realise the dream of a just, equitable, humane and sustainable society as envisioned in the Indian Constitution," he said. He asked everybody to go into the real world, get their hands dirty and witness the inequities, injustice and lack of basic dignity in the society first hand to get moved by the contrasts and do some good for the society. "It is not possible to be emotionally detached. Being empathetic and emotional makes much good happen in this world. Please be moved by it," Premji said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/wipro-commits-rs-1000-crore-more-for-covid-19-premji-says-promoting-students-to-next-class-worst-thing/articleshow/84184956.cms||---

J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha inaugurated the virtual platform — developed by SASB and National Informatics Centre (J&K) — on Tuesday. Under this initiative, the faithful can now virtually avail of darshan, hawan and prasad facilities, the Board said in an official statement. Devotees can book their pooja online and priests at the shrine will offer the same in the former’s name and gotra. The devotee can virtually witness the process and see the deity via Jio Meet. The prasad will then be delivered to the devotee’s home, SASB CEO Nitishwar Kumar said. The services can be booked through the board official website — www.shriamarnathjishrine.com — and by clicking on “book online pooja/hawan/prasad” link. The same can also be done using SASB’s mobile application that can be downloaded from Google Play Store. The cost for virtual pooja is Rs 1,100; prasad booking (along with 5g silver coin of Amarnathji) is Rs 1,100; prasad booking (with 10g silver coin) is Rs 2,100 and Rs 5,100 for a special hawan or combination of any of the aforementioned services. Once the booking is done, SASB will share the link, date and time of the slotted service on the registered mobile number or email id of the devotee. SASB is also launching a dedicated channel on My Jio TV app where devotees can get live darshan round-the-clock, the CEO added. Earlier, the Board had put in place a virtual and televised mechanism for live darshan of morning and evening aarti from the holy cave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amarnath-shrine-board-launches-online-services/articleshow/84185359.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||World||Canada names Mary Simon first indigenous governor general||OTTOWA: Canada named Mary Simon on Tuesday as its first indigenous governor general, Queen Elizabeth II's official representative in the Commonwealth country, as the nation faces a reckoning with its colonial history. “Today, after 154 years, our country takes a historic step,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Trudeau told a news conference. “I cannot think of a better person to meet the moment.” Simon, a former broadcast journalist, diplomat and advocate of indigenous rights, has previously served as president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, Canada's national Inuit organization. She was also leader of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, which represents Inuit in all Arctic countries, and Canada's first Inuk ambassador in Denmark. Simon has been credited with helping negotiate a 1975 landmark deal between Cree, Inuit and Quebec's provincial government, described as Canada's first modern treaty with First Nations. Her appointment as viceregal representative, responsible for giving royal assent or making acts passed by parliament law as well as heading Canada's military, comes at a difficult period in the country's relations with First Nations. The discovery of more than 1,000 unmarked pupils' graves at former indigenous residential schools has convulsed Canada, provoking anger and grief in indigenous communities. Until the 1990s, some 150,000 Indian, Inuit and Metis youngsters were forcibly enrolled in 139 residential schools run by the Catholic Church on behalf of the government. More than 4,000 students died of disease and neglect. Others have recounted physical and sexual abuses by headmasters and teachers who stripped them of their culture and language. More than a dozen churches across Canada have been burned in recent weeks and statues of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and Queen Vitoria, who reigned over the country when the first residential schools were opened in the late 1800s, were torn down by protestors. Trudeau last month apologized for the “incredibly harmful government policy” of assimilation, and has urged Pope Francis to do the same. Canada's national holiday on July 1 was also muted as indigenous leaders called for reflection instead of celebration. Born in 1947 in Kuujjuaq, a small hamlet on the coast of Ungava Bay, Simon attended a day school similar to the controversial indigenous boarding schools. “We need to (pause), to fully recognize and memorialize and come to terms with the atrocities of our collective past that we are learning more about each day,” she told reporters on Tuesday. One of her first official tasks, however, might be to dissolve parliament to trigger snap elections as early as September, as Trudeau's minority Liberal government increasingly butts heads with opposition parties. Simon replaces Trudeau's first nominee to the post, Canada's former chief astronaut Julie Payette who resigned in January amid accusations of harassment, and behavior described in a report as “yelling, screaming, aggressive conduct, demeaning comments and public humiliations.” The Supreme Court chief justice had taken over the mostly ceremonial role in the interim. Canada's governor general is appointed by the queen on the recommendation of the prime minister. Payette's sudden departure reignited a debate about the role of the monarchy in Canada, with slightly more than half of respondents in recent polls favoring abolishing the position of governor general. Simon, who is fluent in English and Inuktitut (the principal Inuit language in Canada), said she hoped in the role to bring together all Canadians "to understand our unique histories, our unique culture, and our way of life." “This is a moment that I hope all Canadians feel part of because my appointment reflects our collective progress towards building a more inclusive, just and equitable society,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/canada-names-mary-simon-first-indigenous-governor-general/articleshow/84185163.cms||---

This is the fourth J&K district after Srinagar, Rajouri and Kathua to ban drones in the wake of the June 27 drone attack on Jammu Air Force Station. “Restrictions have been imposed on the use of drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the district. All drones operating in Samba need to be registered with the assistant commissioner (revenue) and sub-divisional magistrate,” stated an order issued by Samba district magistrate Anuradha Gupta. The order added that government agencies using drones for mapping, surveying, surveillance and other official purposes would have to inform the local police station and the concerned executive magistrate. Any violation of the order would attract punitive action as warranted under relevant law and Samba SSP will ensure implementation of the order, the DM warned. Even after the June 27 drone attack, suspected UAVs/drones were seen hovering over different military and defence establishments in Jammu for at least four consecutive days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/samba-4th-jk-district-to-ban-drones/articleshow/84185441.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

"On the day PDP chose not to meet the Delimitation Commission, ED sent a summon to my mother to appear in person for unknown charges. In its attempts to intimidate political opponents, GOI doesn’t even spare senior citizens. Agencies like NIA & ED are now its tools to settle scores," Mehbooba tweeted, posting a copy of the summons. On the day PDP chose not to meet Delimitation Commission, ED sent a summon to my mother to appear in person for unk… https://t.co/10Bl79UIdZ— Mehbooba Mufti (@MehboobaMufti) 1625573076000In his letter to Gulshan Nazir, the wife of former J&K CM Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, ED assistant director Sunil Kumar said she should appear before the agency at its zonal office in Srinagar's Rajbagh under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. The summons was preceded by PDP striking the lone discordant note amid mainstream J&K political parties invited to meet the Delimitation Commission. It dismissed the delimitation move as a "pre-planned" exercise meant to benefit a particular party and "further hurt the interest of the people" of the Valley. "On August 5, 2019, the constitutional and democratic values of our country were trampled upon, with the people of Jammu & Kashmir being robbed of their legitimate constitutional and democratic rights by means of abrogation of Article 370 and 35 (A) of the Indian Constitution, illegally and unconstitutionally," PDP general secretary Ghulam Nabi Lone Hanjura said. "There are apprehensions that the delimitation exercise is part of the overall process of political disempowerment of the people of J&K that the government of India has embarked on. At the very core of these apprehensions is the process through which the commission has been constituted and the fact that while the delimitation process across the country has been put on hold till 2026, J&K has been made an exception." He said PDP's stand had been conveyed to retired Supreme Court judge Ranjana Prakash Desai, who is leading the Delimitation Commission on a four-day visit to J&K. The People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, of which PDP is a part, had left it to its five constituents to take a call on whether to meet the commission. Restore-statehood cry dominates delimitation meetSeven out of nine parties that met the Delimitation Commission in a Srinagar hotel on Tuesday pitched for restoration of J&K's statehood before kickstarting what is supposed to be the first step towards restoration of democracy in the Union Territory. Barring BJP and BSP, all the parties that attended the meeting went beyond the commission's domain to submit memoranda demanding that confidence-building measures in the Valley should start with revoking the changes triggered by the nullification of Article 370. Justice (retd) Ranjana Prakash Desai, the head of the commission, presided over the meeting alongside chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra and J&K election commissioner K K Sharma. In a statement, NC said, "Democratic values are very dear to us, and we strongly feel that issues can only be resolved through dialogue and discussion...So far as the present delimitation exercise is concerned, the party has already communicated its stand to the commission in unequivocal terms." NC reiterated that the J&K Reorganisation Act, 2019, was "palpably unconstitutional" and allegedly enacted in violation of the spirit of the Constitution. "We have already thrown a challenge to the constitutional validity of the act," it said. Congress reminded the commission that PM Narendra Modi had assured everyone during the June 24 all-party dialogue in New Delhi that "transparent methods" would be adopted in carrying out delimitation of constituencies. "We accept this assurance in the spirit of restoration and strengthening of democratic structures in Jammu & Kashmir," Congress said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-summons-muftis-mom-in-laundering-case/articleshow/84185483.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||World||Pentagon cancels disputed JEDI cloud contract with Microsoft||WASHINGTON: The Pentagon said Tuesday it canceled a disputed cloud-computing contract with Microsoft that could eventually have been worth $10 billion. It will instead pursue a deal with both Microsoft and Amazon and possibly other cloud service providers. "With the shifting technology environment, it has become clear that the JEDI Cloud contract, which has long been delayed, no longer meets the requirements to fill the DoD's capability gaps," the Pentagon said in a statement. The statement did not directly mention that the Pentagon faced extended legal challenges by Amazon to the original $1 million contract awarded to Microsoft. Amazon argued that the Microsoft award was tainted by politics, particularly then-President Donald Trump's antagonism toward Amazon's chief executive officer, Jeff Bezos. Bezos owns The Washington Post, a news outlet often criticized by Trump. The Pentagon's chief information officer, John Sherman, told reporters Tuesday that during the lengthy legal fight with Amazon, "the landscape has evolved" with new possibilities for large-scale cloud computing services. Thus it was decided, he said, to start over and seek multiple vendors. Sherman said JEDI will be replaced by a new program called Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability, and that both Amazon and Microsoft "likely" will be awarded parts of the business, although neither is guaranteed. Sherman said the three other large cloud service providers- Google, IBM and Oracle- might qualify, too. Microsoft said in response to the Pentagon announcement, "We understand the DoD's rationale, and we support them and every military member who needs the mission-critical 21st century technology JEDI would have provided. The DoD faced a difficult choice: Continue with what could be a years-long litigation battle or find another path forward." The JEDI project began with the $1 million contract award for Microsoft, meant as an initial step in a 10-year deal that could have reached $10 billion in value. The project that will replace it is a five-year program; Sherman said no exact contract value has been set but that it will be "in the billions." Sherman said the government will negotiate the amount Microsoft will be paid for having its 2019 deal terminated. Amazon Web Services, a market leader in providing cloud computing services, had long been considered a leading candidate to run the Pentagon's Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure project, known as JEDI. The project was meant to store and process vast amounts of classified data, allowing the US military to improve communications with soldiers on the battlefield and use artificial intelligence to speed up its war planning and fighting capabilities. The JEDI contract became mired in legal challenges almost as soon as it was awarded to Microsoft in October 2019. The losing bidder, Amazon Web Services, went to court arguing that the Pentagon's process was flawed and unfair, including that it was improperly influenced by politics. This year the Pentagon had been hinting that it might scrap the contract, saying in May that it felt compelled to reconsider its options after a federal judge in April rejected a Pentagon move to have key parts of Amazon's lawsuit dismissed. The JEDI saga has been unusual for the political dimension linked to Trump. In April 2020, the Defense Department inspector general's office concluded that the contracting process was in line with legal and government purchasing standards. The inspector general found no evidence of White House interference in the contract award process, but that review also said investigators could not fully review the matter because the White House would not allow unfettered access to witnesses. Five months later, the Pentagon reaffirmed Microsoft as winner of the contract, but work remained stalled by Amazon's legal challenge. In its April 2020 report, the inspector general's office did not draw a conclusion about whether the Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft Corp. was appropriately declared the winner. Rather, it looked at whether the decision-making process was proper and legal. It also examined allegations of unethical behavior by Pentagon officials involved in the matter and generally determined that any ethical lapses did not influence the outcome. That review did not find evidence of White House pressure for the Pentagon to favor the Microsoft bid, but it also said it could not definitely determine the full extent of White House interactions with the Pentagon's decision makers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/pentagon-cancels-disputed-jedi-cloud-contract-with-microsoft/articleshow/84185481.cms||---

S Balu alias Chinni, 26, of Andhrahalli Main Road and S Ashit Gowda, 18, and M Ravi Kumar, 22, of Peenya I Stage were first-time offenders and decided to rob people to fund their vices, police said. Sub-inspector HL Krishna, 59, of RT Nagar traffic police station, was riding back to his Rajagopalnagar residence in northwest Bengaluru when the trio blocked him on Sunday night. Krishna was in plainclothes and was wearing a police helmet. “They were standing in a corner of the Post Office Road in an industrial area at 10 pm and suddenly blocked my scooter. The roads are mostly poorly lit or don’t have street lights. Two of them held my hand and demanded I give them my mobile phone, wallet and gold ornaments. They threatened to stab me if I raise an alarm,” Krishna said. Krishna, who had worked for 35 years in the police department, did not reply or react. He remained silent which surprised the youths. Irked by his reaction, the third youth put his hand in Krishna’s shirt pocket. That’s when he saw my helmet and realised that I was a cop. He shouted to others and they all ran away. Reacting quickly, I jumped off my scooter and grabbed the keys of their bike,” Krishna said. Alerted by Krishna, police personnel rushed to the spot. “We brought the bike to the station and traced one of the suspects. Later, with his help, we arrested the remaining two,” an investigating officer said. They are in judicial custody now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/three-men-try-to-rob-si-in-plainclothes-land-in-soup/articleshow/84185587.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

---||Bengaluru||Cabinet reshuffle ups hopes of Karnataka MPs||BENGALURU: Amid strong buzz about a Union cabinet expansion on Wednesday, political circles in Karnataka are expecting the induction of one or two BJP MPs from the state in PM Modi’s ministry. Among the names doing the rounds are Anekal Narayanaswamy (of Chitradurga), Ramesh C Jigajinagi (Vijayapura), Bhagawant Khuba (Bidar) and Shivakumar Udasi (Haveri). While Khuba and Udasi belong to the Lingayat community, Narayanaswamy and Jigajinagi are from among scheduled castes. Party sources said Narayanaswamy and Jigajinagi were both called to Delhi on Tuesday and either might get a green signal. While Narayanaswamy is a first-time MP, Jigajinagi is a six-time MP and has served earlier as minister in the Modi cabinet. Narayanaswamy, who has reached Delhi, said he has not got any information yet, but is ready to take up any responsibility the party bestows upon him. The Union cabinet comprises 52 ministers and it is expected that PM Modi might add 20 more. A senior BJP functionary said the party is keen on inducting a Dalit MP from the state, keeping the 2023 assembly elections in mind. “Since both belong to the left sect among SCs which has emerged as a new vote bank for the saffron party in Karnataka, both stand a better chance than others,” he said. Karnataka has two ministers in the Union cabinet — DV Sadananda Gowda and Pralhad Joshi. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman too is a Rajya Sabha MP from Karnataka. The late Suresh Angadi, a four-term MP, had served as MoS for railways for about 16 months. His wife, Mangala Angadi, was elected Belagavi MP after his death due to Covid in September last year. Sections in the party believe a Lingayat will be included in the Union cabinet to replace Angadi, which turns the spotlight on three-time MP Udasi and first-time MP Khuba. The Lingayat community is a major vote bank of the saffron party in the state. There is also talk of a Dalit candidate being inducted, with poll considerations in mind. Sources said chances of Kalaburagi MP Umesh Jadhav emerging as a dark horse cannot be ruled out. He defeated Congress functionary and former leader of the party in Lok Sabha Mallikarjuna M Kharge in the last polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cabinet-reshuffle-ups-hopes-of-ktaka-mps/articleshow/84185678.cms||---

The last one year has been tough for the 78-year-old CM as he faced discomfiture on many occasions when some of his own party MLAs and ministers publicly attacked him and his son BY Vijayendra on several fronts. Disgruntled legislators like Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, H Vishwanath and Arvind Bellad continued to target Yediyurappa and his son even after BJP national general secretary Arun Singh and Union ministers Pralhad Joshi and DV Sadananda Gowda ruled out leadership change. What has been more embarrassing for Yediyurappa is that some of his own cabinet colleagues, including KS Eshwarappa and CP Yogeeshwara, have accused the CM and Vijayendra of interfering in their respective departments. Though Yatnal has been vociferously targeting Yediyurappa by making personal attacks against the CM and his son, the party so far has made no effort to initiate any action. While a showcause notice was issued to Yatnal some six months ago, the party did not initiate action after he provided a lengthy reply. The BJP brass had deployed Arun Singh to Karnataka after some MLAs sought a platform to air their grievances, but this also failed to ensure a semblance of order in the state unit. Singh, who was on a three-day visit to the state last month, had warned dissidents of stern action, but nothing happened. His effort to resolve differences seems to have been futile as leaders continue to publicly make statements against the CM and his son. Vishwanath had openly accused Yediyurappa in the presence of Singh. On Monday, Yatnallaunched a tirade against Yediyurappa and Vijayendra by making some strong accusations against them. On Sunday, Yogeeshwara said leadership change may happen before Dasara in October. Whenever dissident activities flare up, this has been state BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel’s common refrain: “Dissidents’ statements have been brought to the attention of the party’s disciplinary committee and the high command will take an appropriate decision after considering all issues.’’ Some BJP MLAs said dissidence couldn’t have happened without the backing of the leadership. “We are gathering evidence against dissenters and in due course, they will face the consequences of their actions,” said some party functionaries. Yediyurappa has chosen not to react to statements of Yatnal, Vishwanath or Yogeeshwara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/dissidence-haunts-bjp-even-after-singhs-visit/articleshow/84185685.cms||---

Suu Kyi is under detention and is being tried on several charges, including an allegation that she illegally imported walkie-talkies for her bodyguards' use and used the radios without a license, and violated Covid-19 pandemic restrictions on two occasions during the 2020 election campaign.  She went on trial on June 14 in a closed court in the capital, Naypyitaw, in proceedings that the military-installed government is widely seen as using to discredit her and consolidate its control.  The military took power in February after ousting Suu Kyi's elected government and arresting her and other top officials in her government and National League for Democracy party, which was about to begin a second five-year term in office after a landslide election victory last November.  The sedition charge, which is sometimes called incitement, provides for up to two years' imprisonment for anyone found guilty of causing fear or alarm that could provoke an offense against the state or public tranquility. It has been criticized as a catch-all statute used for political repression.  Suu Kyi's lawyers last month objected to the introduction by the prosecution of two statements that were posted on the Facebook page of Suu Kyi's party after she and President Win Myint had already been arrested by the military on February 1. Win Myint is Suu Kyi's co-defendant under the sedition charge.  One of the statements, issued Feb. 13, accused the military-installed government of trying to restrict the people's right to freedom of expression and the internet and declared that all the orders and laws issued by that government were illegal.  Suu Kyi's lawyers said they contended the statements should not be admissible because neither of the defendants signed them.  The special court that is conducting the trial did not sustain the defense objection but said it would suspend testimony on the point while the defense appeals to a higher court.  On Monday, after a district court rejected the defense appeal without a hearing, Suu Kyi's lawyers said they would appeal to a region-level court, and if necessary to the Supreme Court.  The lawyers objected again Tuesday when the plaintiff, a Naypyitaw bureaucrat, introduced a piece of evidence that had not been formally listed before testimony began, said Min Min Soe, a member of the defense team. The court allowed the evidence, a list of Central Executive Committee members of Suu Kyi's party, and its patrons.  Suu Kyi faces additional charges that have yet to be tried, among them allegedly accepting bribes, which carries a penalty of up to 15 years in prison, and violating the Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum term of 14 years.  The army has said it will hold new polls within two years of its takeover, but a conviction on virtually charge and could result in Suu Kyi being banned from running, which many believe is the military's goal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/suu-kyis-lawyers-fight-over-evidence-in-myanmar-trial/articleshow/84185446.cms||---

The exercise also aims to increase women representation, bring in state leaders with strong administrative experience, reduce the average age of the ministry and induct people with professional background. The exercise, helmed by PM Modi who has held detailed consultations, looks to strike a balance within caste and regional categories. The OBC selections are expected to ensure smaller communities are not left out with the tally of “backward” leaders expected to reach around 25 — from a little over a dozen at present. Similarly, attention will be paid to sub-regional claims within bigger states like UP, Maharashtra, Gujarat or Karnataka. Sources said the first expansion of Modi 2.0 has been scheduled for 6 pm on Wednesday, but the Rashtrapati Bhavan on Tuesday night was yet to receive an official communication from the Cabinet Secretariat. The OBC presence seems set for a big jump, and the move to woo this politically influential and populous section seems intended to further consolidate the support it has offered BJP, helping it emerge as the premier political party in the country. Indications also pointed to the possibility of an increase in representation of Brahmins from UP in the Modi ministry, with party circles speculating Ravikishan, Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’ and Harish Dwivedi as probables. Arjun Meghwal, minister of state for parliamentary affairs, is seen as a possible replacement for Thaawarchand Gehlot in the social justice ministry. The exercise is close to fruition, with the appointment of Gehlot as Governor of Karnataka, which created another vacancy, boosting the possibility of the first restructuring of the Modi-led NDA coalition. The previous Modi dispensation saw two rounds of changes. There may not be much chopping and changing as nine ministers are holding additional charges and the Council has 60 ministers against a maximum of 81. The new look council will have former chief ministers with names like Sarbanand Sonowal and Narayan Rane doing the rounds. The emphasis, said official sources, is on inducting state leaders with solid administrative experience. This would be an important parameter with the council also reflecting a strong representation of ministers with grassroots background and those who have risen despite modest beginnings. Read AlsoAhead of Union cabinet expansion, govt creates a new 'ministry of co-operation'NEW DELHI: Ahead of the much-anticipated Union cabinet expansion, the government has created a new‘ministry of co-operation’. This ministry will provide a separate administrative, legal and policy framework for strengthening the cooperative movement in the country. "It will help deepen co-operativesPost reshuffle, the ministry is expected to have more people with professional background such as medicine, engineering, law, management and post-graduates. As might be expected, an eye will be kept to make sure that the representation of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes is adequate. Many of the new entrants would be in the 40-60 age bracket. The pending exercise follows several ministerial exits and there are enough vacant berths to accommodate leaders who are to be inducted. The party leadership has already reached out to leaders to reach the capital. Some of the likely inclusions are Jyotiraditya Scindia and Narayan Rane. Among allies, leader of breakaway LJP Pashupati Paras, Apna Dal's Anupriya Patel, JD(U) president R C P Singh are in Delhi. The name of former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis is also being discussed, but his performance as opposition leader against the Shiv Sena-led government has been impressive and there is no easy replacement. Pritam Munde and Heena Gavit were mentioned as possible inclusions from Maharashtra. Former Bihar deputy CM Sushil Modi, who has already made a mark in the Rajya Sabha, is a likely inductee. The appointment of Himanta Biswa Sarma as Assam CM had meant Sonowal’s return to the Union cabinet. At present, only Ramdas Athawale of RPI represents a BJP ally in the Council. Shiv Sena’s Arvind Sawant and Shiromani Akali Dal’s Harsimrat Kaur Badal pulled out due to the change in Maharashtra and farm laws respectively. LJP chief Ramvilas Paswan passed away. JD(U), which earlier turned down a solitary cabinet berth in 2019, may see senior leader Rajiv Ranjan Singh ‘Lalan’ and Santosh Kushwaha being considered apart from RCP Singh. Party sources also cite the need to reassure communities like Brahmins in Uttar Pradesh and Matuas and Rajbonshis in West Bengal in the expansion. As many as nine Cabinet ministers have “additional” responsibilities. They are Prakash Javadekar, Piyush Goyal, Dharmendra Pradhan, Nitin Gadkari, Harsh Vardhan, Narendra Singh Tomar, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Smriti Irani and Hardeep Puri.

In an interview broadcast Tuesday on ABC's "Good Morning America," David Jaramillo recounted what happened when the boat capsized Saturday night on the Raging River at Adventureland Park in Altoona.  "When it flipped over, all of us were trapped in the safety seat belts," he said. "I see the silhouettes of my sons trying to grab each other, grab us. They want us to help them. We couldn't do it." Michael Jaramillo died Sunday from his injuries, and the morning news program reported that his older brother was hospitalized in critical condition in a medically induced coma.  "I feel like Adventureland robbed me of my baby," said Sabrina Jaramillo, Michael's mother. "I will never get a chance to see him grow up."  David Jaramillo, 43, referred questions to his attorney, Ryan Best of Spokane, Washington, when reached by phone Tuesday. Jaramillo said the family lives in the Cedar Rapids area.  The ride uses a conveyor belt to move large circular rafts through rapids. After the boat carrying six people overturned, emergency responders and witnesses helped to free the riders. Four family members were treated for injuries.  The cause of the accident, the second deadly incident on the ride in five years, is under investigation by state inspectors.  Iowa Labor Commissioner Rod Roberts on Tuesday ordered the ride to cease operations pending the outcome of the investigation and the correction of hazards, a spokeswoman for his office said.  The office released documents showing the ride had passed its last five annual inspections dating back to 2017. The latest inspection was Friday, the day before the ride reopened for the season. The accident happened hours later.  "No code violations noted at this time," inspector Bruno Burriola wrote, after reviewing everything from its emergency procedures to the seatbelts.  Nationally, the Consumer Product Safety Commission is only aware of 17 deaths associated with amusement attractions since 2016, agency spokeswoman Patty Davis said. Injuries that require emergency room visits are far more common, averaging 34,700 per year from 2017 to 2019 before plummeting during last summer's coronavirus-related park closures, she said.  The Raging River has been closed since the accident, and Adventureland said it is cooperating with the investigation.  "Safety is the number one priority at Adventureland," Adventureland attorney Guy Cook said. "The Raging River ride has been in operation for nearly four decades. It is a safe ride."  The widow of a 68-year-old Adventureland seasonal employee who died on the ride in June 2016 due to an operator's errors said Tuesday her heart breaks for the Jaramillo family, and that their lives will never be the same.  Gladys Booher said the ride's location far from park entrances slowed the emergency response when her husband, Steve, was critically injured. She said she's angry that Adventureland hasn't fixed that problem after fire officials noted it was difficult to reach those injured Saturday.  "I just wish that Adventureland would take it more seriously," she said. "It's just not people walking through the gates to purchase a ticket. They are actually entrusting that park with their lives and their safety."  Steve Booher was working as a loading assistant getting riders out of a boat when the operator started moving the ride unexpectedly. Booher was jerked off his feet, fell and hit his head, and was trapped between a boat and a concrete sidewall as the ride continued.  Booher's head was rammed against the wall several times before the ride stopped. He died of brain and skull trauma days later.  Adventureland's insurer in December agreed to pay a confidential sum to the Booher family to settle a wrongful death lawsuit before a trial. The lawsuit alleged the operator was negligent by prematurely starting the ride in violation of park rules and leaving it in operation even as Booher was injured and patrons yelled at him to stop.  Gladys Booher, a retired teacher, and pastor said Adventureland's lawyers wanted a non-disclosure agreement that would prevent her from speaking about the tragedy but she refused. She said she's grateful she can share her story to help the Jaramillo family get justice and try to prevent future accidents.  The Raging River has been a staple of the park since 1983. Adventureland advertises the ride as a "great way to cool off with the whole family," warning participants may get soaked. The park, which is located just east of Des Moines, expects around 600,000 visitors this year.  "You've had two people die in five years. How safe is that?" said attorney Fred Dorr, who represented the Booher family. "You can try to explain it away, but that's an issue."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/father-recounts-iowa-amusement-ride-accident-that-killed-son/articleshow/84186800.cms||---
---||World||Pakistan rejects naming of PM Khan as press freedom predator||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Tuesday vehemently rejected an international media watchdog's report that lists Prime Minister Imran Khan on a list of the world's 37 worst rulers when it comes to press freedom. The angry reaction from Khan's government came in response to a Monday report titled: "Press freedom predators gallery- old tyrants, two women and a European," released by Paris-based Reporters Without Borders. According to the group, the "cases of brazen censorship are legion since Khan became prime minister" following parliamentary elections in 2018. It said during Khan's rule, the distribution of newspapers was interrupted, media outlets were threatened with withdrawal of advertising and TV channel signals were jammed. "Journalists who cross the red lines have been threatened, abducted and tortured," the media watchdog said. Pakistan's Information Ministry in a statement Tuesday rejected the allegations, saying Khan's government believed in the "freedom of expression and media independence." In a statement, the ministry said it was surprising that Reporters Without Borders "has jumped to the conclusion" that media in Pakistan are under draconian censorship measures by Khan's government. It said the government has been "taking all possible measures to create a congenial environment for journalists to perform their professional obligations." "It appears that the report that (Reporters Without Borders) has issued is an attempt to malign the elected representative of the people of Pakistan, without any corroborative evidence," the ministry said. The ministry said it hoped that the watchdog in the "future will avoid such irresponsible journalism." Critics say Pakistan has long been a deadly place for journalists. In 2020, it ranked ninth on the Committee to Protect Journalists' annual Global Impunity Index, which assesses countries where journalists are murdered regularly and their killers go free. Although Pakistan says it supports freedom of speech, rights activists often accuse Pakistan's military and its agencies of harassing and attacking journalists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-rejects-naming-of-pm-khan-as-press-freedom-predator/articleshow/84187845.cms||---
---||India||No rath yatras at places other than Puri: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed a large number of pleas seeking permission for rath yatra at many famous Jagannath temples across Odisha while agreeing with the state government that this year's chariot festival would be held under strict Covid norms only at Puri and nowhere else in the state. There were applications for permission to hold centuries-old chariot festivals at popular Jagannath temples at Baripada, Nilagiri in Balasore and 'Shabara Sreekshetra' at Koraput. Appearing for a petitioner, advocate Jitendra Mohapatra argued before a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana, and Justices A S Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy that while 149 places across the world would be celebrating the annual rath yatra, the Odias would be deprived of their most important religious festival. Odisha advocate general Ashok Parija said the Puri Jagannath rath yatra, involving pulling of three chariots — 16-wheeled Nandighosha of Lord Jagannatha, 14-wheeled Taladhwaja of Lord Balabhadra and 12-wheeled Darpadalana of goddess Subhadra by devotees—would be held under strict norms imposed last year by the SC. The restrictions included involvement of 500 sevayats, who would be tested for Covid, curfew in the city and closure of city limits for entry of visitors. “Such restrictions are impossible to be implemented at thousands of temples in Odisha where the rath yatra takes place every year,” Parija said. He said that the state government has passed an order that all rituals at other Jagannath temples would be conducted on the temple premises without any pulling of chariots. Appearing for the Union government, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the bench that the Jagannatha temples could be permitted to hold symbolic rath yatras to fulfil the rituals without any public gathering. When the advocates pressed for permission to hold rath yatras, the CJI said, “I am also a devotee of Lord Jagannatha. I want to visit Puri. But, for the last one and half years, I am praying from a distance because of the situation caused by Covid. If gatherings are allowed during rath yatras in all Jagannatha temples, then the devotees could get infected by Covid. We cannot take risk and put many lives in danger. Better to watch the rath yatra on television and pray from a distance.” "We understand the sentiment of the devotees and their desire for holding rath yatra. But, we are not experts. The Odisha government has taken a decision to allow rath yatra at Puri. Let it remain the way the state government feels would be safer," the CJI-led bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-rath-yatras-at-places-other-than-puri-supreme-court/articleshow/84187901.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Further arrests are not ruled out in the coming hours,” the national police service tweeted. The 24-year-old nursing assistant was killed in the early hours of Saturday outside a nightclub. A witness who was interviewed on La Sexta television said one of the assailants shouted homophobic slurs during the attack. Protesters took to the streets of Spain's main cities on Monday night to vent their fury at the killing and to demand better protection for gay rights. Riot police in Madrid baton-charged some demonstrators, prompting the government to open an investigation into their conduct. Government spokeswoman Maria Jesus Montero said it was important to highlight Spanish society's rejection of the crime but the police were justified in their response to restore order. Earlier on Tuesday the cabinet approved a bill to tighten up sexual-assault laws and define all non-consensual sex as rape as part of a broader push to legislate against historically macho attitudes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/spanish-police-arrest-three-over-suspected-homophobic-killing/articleshow/84187882.cms||---

He had been asked by Ghaziabad police to appear in person. Ghaziabad police, meanwhile, came in for some serious questioning from the HC, which asked pointedly how it "connected" Twitter India to the case it was probing. The judge said unless it is shown that the petitioner is responsible for uploading, or not deleting, the content in question, he is a nobody as far as the case at hand is concerned. Justice G Narendar wondered why police could not gather information regarding the company from the Articles of Association, which are in the public domain. "The whole problem is you don’t want to investigate… On what basis are you saying Twitter India is responsible?" he said. Maheshwari’s counsel also argued that UP police have no jurisdiction to issue notice to Maheshwari as he is not responsible for the day-to-day affairs of the company. The Twitter MD had moved the HC challenging the notice on June 21 to appear for questioning on June 24. Citing the example of allegations under IPC Section 376 wherein proving potency is relevant to establishing the case, Justice Narendar asked if any prima facie determination had been made as to how Twitter India was responsible for the publishing of the video clips or how the company could have stopped it. "How does the complainant connect Twitter India to this? What is the allegation against them (Twitter India)? Is it (company) capable of removing the content? Was any preliminary investigation undertaken to ascertain this," the judge asked the special public prosecutor representing UP police. Pointing out that Twitter India and Twitter Inc are two independent bodies, the court also wondered whether Twitter India was even an intermediary. "The complainant is very clear that they are two independent bodies. So, where is the investigation, whether they are required to confirm their compliance with the rules. Where is that material? Unless they are the intermediary... there is no conclusive evidence by you that they are even the intermediary," the court observed. "Where are you heading," the judge said, expressing surprise at the invoking of Section 79 of the IT Act pertaining to social media intermediaries. Regarding the notice to Maheshwari, the court said, "It is not that he (Maheshwari) is defiant. He is very specific, categorical. He says I have no control over the uploading of the video. At least before this court he has placed the material." Senior advocate CV Nagesh, appearing for Maheshwari, said the petitioner is only an employee who has no control over users’ data. He argued that UP police have no jurisdiction to issue notice under CrPC Section 41A as the petitioner’s status doesn’t fit into it. He maintained that even under clause 3 of 41A, which says the petitioner may not be arrested in case of compliance, the investigating officer still can arrest the petitioner after recording reasons and, therefore, that "Damocles’ sword of arrest" is always hanging over the petitioner’s head. Appearing for UP police, SPP P Prasanna Kumar submitted that the notice was issued in a representative capacity and that there was no "witch-hunt". He said Twitter is playing "hide and seek" when police only want the petitioner to disclose who is the person in charge of the company in India. Arguing that a foreign company with so many followers cannot be without a head, he said that the FIR was registered by UP police regarding non-compliance with IT rules. Kumar further contended that the petition itself is not maintainable as none of the events pertaining to UP police case have taken place in Karnataka. Nagesh responded that the petitioner is a resident of Bengaluru city and hence the petition is maintainable. The hearing will continue on Wednesday. On June 15, Ghaziabad police booked Twitter Inc and Twitter Communications India, among other entities and individuals, for circulating a video of an elderly man being assaulted. On June 24, the HC had passed an interim order stating that no coercive action be taken against Maheshwari. However, UP police were allowed to question him over a video link.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ready-to-meet-police-if-no-arrest-threat-twitter-md/articleshow/84188093.cms||---
---||World||Police: 2 neighbors reported white man for racist harassment||MOUNT LAUREL: A white man who called multiple neighbors racist slurs and claimed he forced other Black residents to move, has been charged with harassment and disorderly conduct, according to local police.  A warrant dated Monday and other charging documents show at least two neighbors called police to report Edward C. Mathews, 45, on Friday for harassing them in a Mount Laurel neighborhood.  A Black woman in the neighborhood called police on Friday saying Mathews was harassing her, approaching her front door and shouting racial slurs, according to prosecutors. She had previously told police she suspected Mathews of "criminal mischief" involving her car.  A doorbell camera captures Mathews bringing his dogs to her front yard, repeating a racial slur and thrusting his hips in a vulgar way after police responded and talked to him, prosecutors said.  Police then received a second call from a nearby address and found Mathews using racial slurs to address four people, which appears to be the interaction caught on video that drew widespread attention online.  That confrontation happened after Mathews knocked on a neighbor's door demanding to see her husband, who is Black, and attempted to enter her home, prosecutors said. The woman, who is white, called police and another neighbor came over to find Mathews in the walkway.  A message was left with the public defender's office seeking comment on behalf of Mathews.  Mathews was initially charged with harassment and biased intimidation but was not arrested. On Monday, protesters gathered outside of his home for many hours. He apologized in a video filmed by a protester and posted online.  Police arrested Mathews Monday evening and said he was in jail on Tuesday and will be held until a hearing likely on Friday.  "It is difficult to overstate how vile and despicable the conduct by this defendant towards his neighbors was on Friday night," Burlington County Prosecutor Scott A. Coffina said in a statement Tuesday. "No one should ever have to deal with such hatred thrown in their face anywhere, but especially on their own doorstep."  Police are investigating if protesters who threw objects toward officers and Mathews as they arrested him committed any crimes, Coffina said.  Mount Laurel is located 19 miles (30 kilometers) east of Philadelphia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/police-2-neighbors-reported-white-man-for-racist-harassment/articleshow/84188108.cms||---

Crowds filled a central Madrid square and activists marched down a major street in Barcelona, chanting slogans and waving placards and rainbow-coloured flags. “The response to the wave of LGBT-phobic hatred that ended the life of Samuel in A Coruna is overwhelming,” the left-wing Podemos party that governs in coalition with the ruling Socialists wrote on Twitter. The 24-year-old nursing assistant was beaten near a nightclub in the early hours of Saturday in the town of A Coruna, northern Spain, by several assailants including one who shouted a common pejorative description of a homosexual, state broadcaster RTVE reported. He later died in hospital. Jose Minones, a local government representative in the region where A Coruna is located, tweeted that the police were working to find out what happened and to bring the perpetrators to justice. Local media quoted him as saying the investigation would show whether or not the attack was motivated by homophobia. Interior Ministry data shows 278 hate crimes related to sexual orientation or gender identity were reported in Spain in 2019, an 8.6% increase on the previous year. The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights warns only a fraction of hate crimes are reported to the police. In central Barcelona, 21 year-old Sergio Cuevas said, “I think this crime happened because homophobia kills.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/protests-in-spain-against-suspected-lgbt-hate-crime/articleshow/84188165.cms||---
---||World||Who runs the Vatican while pope is hospitalized?||ROME: The Vatican has detailed laws, rituals, and roles to ensure the transfer of power when a pope dies or resigns. But none of them apply when he is sick or even unconscious, and there are no specific norms governing what happens when a pope becomes incapacitated.  As a result, even though Pope Francis remains hospitalized while he recovers from intestinal surgery Sunday at a Rome hospital, he is still pope and very much in charge. The Vatican said Tuesday Francis had eaten breakfast, read the newspapers, and had a walk, and that his post-operative recovery was proceeding normally.  Still, his weeklong hospital stay, the first of his papacy, has sparked interest about how papal power is exercised in the Holy See, how it is transferred, and under what circumstances.  Here's how it works:  The role of the pope  The pope is the successor of the Apostle Peter, the head of the college of bishops, the Vicar of Christ, and the pastor of the universal Catholic Church on Earth, according to the church's in-house canon law.  Nothing has changed in his status, role, or power since he was elected the 266th pope on March 13, 2013, even while he underwent three hours of surgery Sunday to remove half of his colon.  That status is by theological design.  "The pope's authority is supreme, full, and universal," said canon lawyer Nicholas Cafardi. "So if his authority is at that level, who gets to decide that he can no longer exercise that authority? There's nobody above him."  The Vatican curia  Francis may be in charge, but he already delegates the day-to-day running of the Vatican and church to a team of officials who operate whether he is in the Apostolic Palace or not, and whether he is conscious or not.  Chief among them is the secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin. In a sign that Francis' hospitalization foresaw no change to the governance of the church, Parolin wasn't even in the Vatican during Francis' three-hour scheduled surgery. He was in Strasbourg, France, to commemorate the 1,300th anniversary of the death of the patron saint of Alsace.  Other Vatican functions are proceeding normally. Its daily noon bulletin came out again Tuesday with the names of new bishops appointed by the pope in Nicaragua, Nigeria, and Britain. They presumably were approved ahead of time, although Francis could sign decrees and handle other matters of importance from his hospital bed, as St. John Paul II was known to have done during his many hospitalizations.  What happens when a pope gets sick?  Canon law does have provisions for when a diocesan bishop gets sick and can't run his diocese, but none for a pope. Canon 412 says a diocese can be declared "impeded" if its bishop, due to "captivity, banishment, exile, or incapacity," cannot fulfill his pastoral functions. In such cases, the day-to-day running of the diocese shifts to an auxiliary bishop, a vicar general or someone else.  Even though Francis is the bishop of Rome, no explicit provision exists for the pope if he similarly becomes "impeded." Canon 335 declares simply that when the Holy See is "vacant or entirely impeded," nothing can be altered in the governance of the church. But it doesn't say what it means for the Holy See to be "entirely impeded" or what provisions might come into play if it ever were.  "Really, we have no rules for this," Cafardi said. "There are no canons and there's no separate document that says how you would determine incapacity, whether incapacity could be permanent or temporary, and even more importantly who would govern the church in that time. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. We just leave it up to the Holy Spirit."  What about Pope Paul VI's letter?  In 1965, Pope Paul VI wrote letters to the dean of the College of Cardinals hypothesizing that if he were to become seriously ill, the dean and other cardinals should accept his resignation.  Paul foresaw the possibility that as popes continued to live longer, they could become incapacitated by a stroke, dementia, or some other long-term, progressive ailment that would make it impossible for them to do their job, and unable to freely resign.  In one letter, published in 2018, he cited an infirmity "which is presumed incurable or of long duration and which prevents us from sufficiently exercising the functions of our apostolic ministry."  The letter was never invoked since Paul lived another 13 years and died on the job.  But experts say Paul's letter was unlikely to have ever been used since canon law requires a papal resignation be "freely and properly manifested," as was the case when Pope Benedict XVI announced his resignation in 2013.  The scenario Paul envisioned, laying out grounds for his resignation in advance for a time when he might not be conscious or capable, "is not valid, because for a pope to validly resign from the office he has to be lucid," said Kurt Martens, a canon lawyer, and professor at the Catholic University of America.  What happens when a pope dies or resigns?  The only time papal power changes hands is when a pope dies or resigns. At that time a whole series of rites and rituals come into play governing the "interregnum," the period between the end of one pontificate and the election of a new pope.  During that period, known as the "sede vacante," or "empty See," the camerlengo, or chamberlain, runs the administration and finances of the Holy See. He certifies the pope's death, seals the papal apartments, and prepares for the pope's burial before a conclave to elect a new pope. The position is currently held by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the head of the Vatican's laity office.  The camerlengo has no role or duties if the pope is merely sick or otherwise incapacitated.  "You have two options: Either you have a pope or you don't have one, and as long as you have a pope, and in the case where he's not dead, he governs the church," Martens said. "Even if he's dying, he governs the church."  What about Pope Benedict XVI?  Even though there is a retired pope living on the Vatican grounds, he has no formal role to play, either.  Benedict, 94, ceased being pope on Feb. 28, 2013, when he became the first pontiff in 600 years to resign. He has been living in a converted monastery in the Vatican gardens ever since.  Citing his private secretary, RAI state television said Benedict was praying for Francis' recovery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/who-runs-the-vatican-while-pope-is-hospitalized/articleshow/84187847.cms||---

While Gehlot, a Dalit, has been designated as governor of Karnataka, Bandaru Dattatreya, an OBC, appeared to have secured an elevation in the shift from Himachal Pradesh to larger Haryana. Mangubhai Chhaganbhai Patel, a tribal, has been appointed as governor of Madhya Pradesh while Hari Babu Kambhampati and Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar will be the new governors of Mizoram and Himachal Pradesh, respectively. Kambhampati succeeded P S Sreedharan Pillai, who was transferred and appointed as governor of Goa. Satyadev Narayan Arya, governor of Haryana, has been appointed as governor of Tripura while Tripura governor Ramesh Bais has been transferred to Jharkhand. With these appointments, a record number of SC, ST, OBC and women have been appointed as governors, official sources pointed out. Like Gehlot, Rajendra Arlekar, who had represented Pernem in the Goa Assembly, and Arya are also Dalits. Baby Rani Maurya, currently serving as Uttarakhand governor, is also from the SC community. Besides Mangubhai Patel, a tribal leader of long standing who has worked for decades among Dalits, Anusuiya Uikey is serving as governor of Chhattisgarh. The outgoing governor of Jharkhand, Draupadi Murmu, is also a tribal. OBC governors, besides Dattatreya, include Ganga Prasad Chaurasia (Sikkim); Faghu Chauhan (Bihar); Bais, Murmu's replacement in Jharkhand; and Tamilisai Soundararajan, governor of Telangana who also also holds the charge of Puducherry. Jats also have their representatives serving in Raj Bhavans of Bengal (Jagdeep Dhankar), Gujarat (Acharya Devbrat) and Meghalaya (Satpal Malik). The appointment of two Telugus— K Hari Babu and Dattatraya— is seen as a signal to Andra Pradesh and Telangana. Arif Mohammad Khan and Najma Heptulla are representatives of Muslim community in Raj Bhavans of Kerala and Manipur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ahead-of-cabinet-rejig-governors-get-shuffled/articleshow/84188813.cms||Akhilesh Singh
---||World||‘Ben’s babes’: England forced to pick new squad as cricket team isolates||England were forced to select a completely new squad for the Pakistan ODI series after seven of the group returned positive PCR Covid-19 tests on Monday, forcing the entire squad into self-isolation for 10 days. Just as Boris Johnson was announcing the lifting of lockdown restrictions from July 19, in Bristol, three England players and four management staff tested positive for Covid-19 following the third ODI against Sri Lanka. Rather than cancel the series, within 18 hours, the ECB had put together a new squad, which included nine uncapped players, and it confirmed the ODIs and the T20s against Pakistan will go ahead, with the first ODI set for Thursday. Ben Stokes, who has been out with a broken finger, will return to lead the squad the ODI side for the first time. The team is being called Ben’s Babes. Chris Silverwood is back as head coach and Zak Crawley who scored a double century against Pakistan in 2020 is among the uncapped players, all of whom will have to first isolate in hotels until test results come back. The decision threw county championships into disarray as around 11 to 12 players, including Ben Duckett, were withdrawn to join the new squad. "We hoped it would just be a couple of positives and we could isolate them, but given the size of spread in the group the only thing to do was isolate whole group," explained managing director of England Men's Cricket, Ashley Giles. The original team had not been in stringent bio-secure bubbles like last year and were this year operating in what the ECB called "safe environments", sharing certain hotel spaces with the public. A few weeks ago the team could play golf, exercise outdoors and get take-away coffee, Giles said, explaining the team had been under enormous mental pressure under stringent restrictions, but he said he was confident players had not breached any protocols. He said a couple of those in isolation had minor "flu like symptoms" and the rest were asymptomatic. Whilst the three ODIs against Pakistan are not a huge priority for England, they are part of the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup Super League, which will help determine which teams feature in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 in India. "From a performance point of view it is not our best team, we know that, but it is exciting for some of these guys. Some of them would never have thought they would play to England," Giles said. This is the first Covid outbreak within the England team and the last thing the ECB wants is a similar occurrence ahead of the India series in August, which is a very lucrative series. "Pakistan have been extremely understanding of the situation and how we handled it," Giles said, adding the ECB was in regular contact with the BCCI. "I think it’s important we work really closely with BCCI and we are hopeful that as this summer moves forward we will be able to reduce the restrictions around teams and one of the important things is getting everyone double vaccinated," he said, explaining whilst all the team were single vaccinated, not all were double vaccinated. Tom Harrison, ECB chief executive officer, said, ‘‘We have been mindful that the emergence of the Delta variant, along with our move away from the stringent enforcement of bio-secure environments, could increase the chances of an outbreak. We made a strategic choice to try to adapt protocols, in order to support the overall wellbeing of our players and management staff who have spent much of the last 14 months living in very restricted conditions."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/bens-babes-england-forced-to-pick-new-squad-as-cricket-team-isolates/articleshow/84189104.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||India||PM Modi wishes Dalai Lama, sends another message to China||NEW DELHI: In a move that has both spiritual and foreign policy implications, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to the Dalai Lama on his birthday on Tuesday. This is the first time Modi openly acknowledged contact with the Tibetan spiritual leader in years. Coming at a time when India-China relations are at their most tenuous, the PM’s action on Tuesday will resonate both in Beijing and other parts of the world. "Spoke on phone to His Holiness the @DalaiLama to convey greetings on his 86th birthday. We wish him a long and healthy life." Modi’s message is innocuously phrased but it carries a lot of weight given India’s unique place in Tibetan affairs and its relations with China. Spoke on phone to His Holiness the @DalaiLama to convey greetings on his 86th birthday. We wish him a long and healthy life.— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) 1625556036000The move took China and Tibet watchers with surprise. Coming as it did from the highest levels, it could be the beginning of a more clearly articulated policy on Tibet. The Dalai Lama said since he became a refugee and now settled in India, he has taken full advantage of India’s freedom and religious harmony. "I want to assure you that for the rest of my life, I am committed to reviving ancient Indian knowledge," he said. China and Tibet expert Claude Arpi told TOI, "I think it is great news. It is a strong message to China, particularly before the 12th round of military talks. It is also a message that India is behind the Dalai Lama for whatever he decides for his succession. To my knowledge it is the first time that an Indian PM has spoken to His Holiness the Dalai Lama for his birthday and makes it known openly. I hope it will herald closer relations between Delhi and the DL as well as with the CTA (Central Tibetan Administration)." India has not yet openly taken a position on Dalai Lama’s succession, but has let it be known that it should be the sole preserve of the Tibetans and nobody should have a role in it. China, in its most recent white paper on Tibet, has emphasised that China would control the reincarnation process of the Dalai Lama. "It’s a welcome step in the right direction and will hopefully lead to affirming that wishes of the Dalai Lama on the issue of his reincarnation will be respected by the government of India," said Amitabh Mathur, former adviser on Tibetan affairs to the home ministry. In 2020, the Trump administration passed the Tibetan Policy and Support Act, where the US asserted that only the Dalai Lama should have control over his reincarnation. That has been continued by the Biden administration. Meanwhile, the president of the Tibetan government-in-exile, Penpa Tsering, told PTI in Dharamshala on Tuesday that the Chinese government should recognise that the Dalai Lama is key to resolving the Sino-Tibetan conflict and should invite him to "Tibet and China on pilgrimage without any precondition". The new Sikyong of CTA has been in touch with the Indian government in recent weeks, according to sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-wishes-dalai-lama-sends-another-message-to-china/articleshow/84189309.cms||---
---||India||Like Rona’s, Gadling’s computer too attacked with malware: US lab report||MUMBAI: Over four months after its first cyber forensic report of alleged malware attack on Elgar Parishad case accused Rona Wilson’s laptop, a US-based consultant recently said the computer of co-accused Surendra Gadling was similarly “compromised”. The June 21 report of Arsenal Consulting said a computer belonging to Gadling, a human rights lawyer from Nagpur, was attacked with NetWire, a “malware”, for nearly two years before his arrest on June 6, 2018. Accused of alleged Maoist links, Gadling was also charged under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Gadling’s defence team had sent electronic evidence seized on April 17, 2018, from his home by Pune Police. According to his lawyers, his computer was “first compromised” on February 29, 2016. The report's ‘executive summary’ said “Gadling’s computer was compromised for just over 20 months by the same attacker identified in Reports I and II”. “It is obvious that their primary goals were surveillance and incriminating document delivery. Arsenal has effectively caught the attacker red-handed based on remnants of their activity left behind in file system,’’ it added. Wilson, also a human rights activist, incarcerated since his arrest in June 2018, had in February approached the HC to quash the criminal prosecution against him citing the February 8 Arsenal report. The report had said his computer was “compromised’’ for 22 months and the “top 10 incriminating documents” delivered to it via malware. His petition is pending before the HC. Wilson said that the 22,000-page chargesheet shows that prosecution against 16 accused— now 15, following Fr Stan Swamy’s demise on Monday—is based “entirely on electronic evidence”. The case had been transferred to the NIA in January 2020. The March 27 Arsenal report had said that Gadling’s computer was first compromised on February 29, 2016. The attacker made three particularly relevant attempts at compromising his computer via email, sending him identical malware, but packaged differently, on February 12 (two emails), and February 18, 2016, it had added. In its June 21 report, the US-based consultant said, “Arsenal has connected the same attacker to a significant malware infrastructure which was deployed over the course of approximately four years to not only attack and compromise Gadling’s computer for 20 months, but to attack his co-defendants…and defendants in other high-profile Indian cases as well.” Arsenal has also recovered communications with the attacker’s command and control server from Gadling’s computer. In conclusion, it added: “It should be noted that this is one of the most serious cases involving evidence tampering that Arsenal has ever encountered, based on various metrics which include the vast timespan between the delivery of the first and last incriminating documents on multiple defendants computers.” Gadling’s defence team had sent electronic evidence seized on April 17, 2018, from his home by Pune Police. The team informed Arsenal that “14 documents” from his computer were “particularly important in this case”. The Arsenal report said it “found no evidence which would suggest that the 14 important documents were ever interacted with in any legitimate way on Gadling’s computer, either in their original location on the tertiary volume or in their current location on the Windows volume.” “Arsenal produced two reports in this case related to Wilson (Report I on February 8, 2021, and Report II on March 27, 2021) and was then asked by Gadling’s defence team to produce a report regarding our analysis of electronic evidence seized from his home,” said Mark Spencer, president of Arsenal in Chelsea, in the report. Senior counsel Indira Jainsing, who appeared for Gadling in a matter on Tuesday, told TOI, “We have seen the Arsenal report. Legal action will be pursued on the basis of remedies available in law.” When contacted, additional solicitor general Anil Singh, who appears for NIA in the various petitions filed by Elgar Parishad case accused before the HC, told TOI, “I have not seen the US forensic report.” Questioning its value at this juncture, he added, “It can be tested or gone into during the trial.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/like-ronas-gadlings-computer-too-attacked-with-malware-us-lab-report/articleshow/84189543.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||World||US calls on Iran to stop nuclear 'brinksmanship'||WASHINGTON: The United States on Tuesday warned Iran to stop nuclear "brinksmanship," saying the country's latest efforts to enrich uranium could complicate its return to talks aimed at restarting the 2015 nuclear accord. "We continue to urge Iran to stop this brinksmanship, to return to Vienna prepared for real talks, and to be in a position to be prepared to finish the work" that jump-started in April, State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported on Tuesday that Iran intended to enrich uranium to 20 percent, in the latest sign the Vienna talks on reviving the joint comprehensive plan of action could be stalling. The move takes Iran a step closer to developing materials that could be used to make a nuclear weapon. "It is worrying that Iran is choosing to continue to escalate its non-performance of its JCPOA commitments, especially with experiments that have value for nuclear weapons research," Price said. "It's another unfortunate step backwards for Iran." European powers also spoke out Tuesday, with the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany expressing "grave concern" and warning that Iran's move endangers the talks in Vienna. While Tehran insists it is only interested in nuclear technology for energy purposes, it has gradually moved away from the terms of the deal it signed with world powers in 2015. Then-president Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the deal in 2018, but the administration of President Biden has expressed readiness to reenter the JCPOA if certain conditions are met by Iran. Price said there was no set timeline for closing the window on negotiations with the Islamic republic. But he made clear that Washington would reconsider if Iran continued with its "provocative steps" aimed at shrinking the breakout time for Iran to produce enough fissile material for a bomb- from a year at the time of the JCPOA to reportedly just months today. "We see negotiations and diplomacy... as, for now, the best means to put Iran's nuclear program back in a box," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-calls-on-iran-to-stop-nuclear-brinksmanship/articleshow/84189647.cms||---
---||World||Dutch crime reporter De Vries shot on Amsterdam street – Police||AMSTERDAM: Celebrity crime reporter Peter R. de Vries, known for his work in exposing the Dutch underworld, was shot and seriously wounded on a street in Amsterdam, police said on Tuesday. “Peter R. de Vries was shot down in Lange Leidsedwarsstraat,” police said in a statement, referring to a street near one of the city's largest public squares, where he had been in a television studio earlier in the evening. He was taken to a nearby hospital in “serious condition”, the police said, calling for eyewitnesses to come forward. Police had cordoned off the area as crowds gathered near the site where the incident took place. De Vries won an international Emmy Award in the current affairs category in 2008 for his work investigating the disappearance of teenager Natalee Holloway in Aruba in 2005. An alleged shooter was arrested shortly afterward, newspaper Algemeen Dagblad reported, citing anonymous sources. Police said they could neither confirm nor deny that report but they expected to update the public later Tuesday evening. Prime Minister Mark Rutte was expected to make a statement after meeting with leading law enforcement officials in the wake of the shooting, news agency ANP reported. Dutch broadcaster RTL said De Vries had just left its studio in downtown Amsterdam and that one of the shots hit him in the head. Amsterdam's Parool newspaper published an image of the scene with several people gathered around a person lying on the ground. De Vries, is a 64 year-old celebrity in the Netherlands, as both a frequent commentator on television crime programs and an expert crime reporter with sources in both law enforcement and the underworld. He is known for his investigative work on countless cases, notably following the 1983 kidnapping of beer magnate Freddy Heineken. He has also been subjected to threats from the criminal underworld in the past in connection with several cases. In 2013 Willem Holleeder, the Heineken kidnapper, was convicted of making threats against De Vries. Holleeder is currently serving a life sentence for his involvement in five murders. In a similar case in 2019 when, Ridouan Taghi, who is currently on trial for murder and drug trafficking, took the unusual step of making a public statement denying reports that he had threatened to have De Vries killed. De Vries has been acting as a counselor, but not lawyer, to a state witness identified as Nabil B. testifying in the case against Taghi and his alleged associates. Nabil B.'s previous lawyer was shot and killed on an Amsterdam street in September 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/dutch-crime-reporter-de-vries-shot-on-amsterdam-street-police/articleshow/84189474.cms||---
---||India||Produce Pune court records: HC to Maharashtra govt on Sudha Bharadwaj bail plea||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Tuesday directed the Maharashtra government to produce relevant records of the 2018 Pune trial court proceedings in relation to the chargesheet filed in the Elgar Parishad case against activist-lawyer Sudha Bharadwaj. Her case is that the Pune trial court judge, K D Vadane, was “not a designated special court judge” and hence his order was not valid and she was entitled to default bail under law. Default bail is granted when chargesheet is not filed within the statutory period — in this case, 90 days —under the Criminal Procedure Code, unless an extension is granted by court. At a virtual hearing on Tuesday before a bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar, Bharadwaj’s counsel Yug Chaudhry and Payoshi Roy said an RTI reply by the HC registry had disclosed that judge Vadane was a district and additional sessions judge and not appointed as special judge by the state government under Section 22 of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act for the period between January 2018 and July 2019. The HC said, “We will not allow the respondent-state to file reply, since we have heard substantially.” In its reply, the NIA said Bharadwaj was “rightly produced before judge Vadane and he rightly remanded the accused to police custody initially and then to judicial custody… and rightly rejected’’ her bail plea. The agency opposed her petition saying her contention would lead to “absurd interpretations of the law”. It said the case was initially registered only under Indian Penal Code (IPC), and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) was invoked only on May 17, 2018. However, Bharadwaj said she was arrested on August 28, 2018, after the UAPA was invoked. Chaudhry submitted that if the RTI information was found correct, then not only would Bharadwaj’s detention, but those of the eight other co-accused in the Elgar Parishad case, would also be deemed illegal. The state has not filed its reply yet. Section 11 of the NIA Act is at the “heart of argument’’, said Chaudhry. It provides that a special court shall be constituted by notification and be presided over by a judge appointed by the Centre as recommended by the HC chief justice. “It cannot be said that a special judge and a sessions judge are the same,’’ he added. Section 22 of the Act empowers the state to constitute special courts for trial of offences, in case one has not been appointed. So, said Chaudhry, there are two questions: One whether the Pune judge was appointed under the NIA Act either by the state or the Centre; second, whether or not the state had appointed any special judge under Section 22?’’ The HC will hear the matter on July 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/produce-pune-court-records-hc-to-maharashtra-govt-on-sudha-bharadwaj-bail-plea/articleshow/84189723.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||World||California delays considering supervised sites for drug use||SACRAMENTO: California lawmakers will wait until next year to continue considering a bill that would give opioid users a place to inject drugs in supervised settings, the bill's author said Tuesday.  State Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco, said he was told the Assembly Health Committee will delay a hearing on his bill until January.  The measure would allow Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles County to start programs giving people a place to inject drugs while trained staff are available to help if they suffer accidental overdoses.  "Safe consumption sites are a proven strategy to save lives and help people into recovery," Wiener said.  Currently the sites are illegal in the United States, but legal in Canada.  Wiener's bill cleared the Senate in April with the minimum number of votes needed for passage there. The Senate Republican Caucus said in a statement at the time that the bill would "establish taxpayer-staffed and funded drug dens."  The proposal is opposed by some law enforcement groups, but Wiener said in a statement that it "is very much alive, albeit delayed."  Similar bills authorizing injection sites have passed both chambers of the Legislature within the last five years, and such bills have repeatedly passed the Assembly Health Committee during that time, Wiener said. Former Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown in 2018 vetoed a bill that would have allowed San Francisco to offer injection sites.  Wiener noted he was disappointed in another delay at a time when he said San Francisco and other cities are experiencing record overdose deaths.  His bill would require workers at the centers to try to get users into drug treatment programs or refer them to medical or mental health care or social services programs.  The former Trump administration sued to block a proposed injection site in Philadelphia, and a federal appeals court sided with the government earlier this year. Supporters have appealed and hope President Joe Biden's administration will drop the lawsuit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/california-delays-considering-supervised-sites-for-drug-use/articleshow/84189911.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Interdisciplinary engineering courses are need of the hour: Experts||BENGALURU: From trying to keep up with the technology evolving in the blink of an eye to meeting the needs of the industry, engineering education is growing to reach several goal posts. The key is evolving an interdisciplinary approach, say experts. Engineering college principals and industry giants were speaking at a session on ‘The changing face of engineering branches - the interdisciplinary nature of engineering education’ organised as part of the webinar, Mission Admission-2021. It was organised by The Times of India in association with Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham (Bengaluru campus) on Tuesday. Prof KN Subramanya, principal, RV College of Engineering (RVCE), said technical education has changed drastically in the last decade. With the implementation of the New Education Policy, everyone is looking towards an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary form of education, he added. “We need more experiential learning and outcomebased education. Interdisciplinary engineering is the need of the hour. We cannot develop good products or systems without them. It is not just in engineering, but even including liberal arts to technology,” he said, adding that “interdisciplinary education is a balancing of depth and spread of disciplines — the one we call the T-Model.” Prof Debabrata Das, director, IIIT-B, said students' focus must be on creating a strong foundation in their domain – be it mechanical, chemical, civil, biology – and then looking at inculcating other disciplines to build on them. “Without strong domain knowledge, students won’t know what they need to do to make it better. If faculties are tuned and the curriculum is designed in that way, students will be prepared to join the workforce,” he said. Vikram Motiani, senior director, Global Learning Services, Red Hat (Asia Pacific), said students must integrate learning from multiple factions and make it more applicable and real. “Students can create an edge for themselves when they bring multiple learning points together and create a better outcome which is more suitable for the industry,” he said, pointing out the employability gap where industries are looking for employable graduates, while graduates are hunting for jobs with no luck. How can this be addressed? “Students must create their own brand, build their own degree and take specialised courses,” he said. Motiani added that every company today is driven by applications and students must look at the software side of things.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/interdisciplinary-engg-courses-are-need-of-the-hour-experts/articleshow/84190020.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

The drug regulator has also asked the company in writing to apply for approvals so that application is processed well in time but Pfizer is yet to apply for the licence, a source said. However, the indemnity issue is not just holding up jabs from Pfizer but other companies like Moderna and J&J are also seeking an exemption from legal liability in the event of severe adverse reaction among vaccine recipients. Talks are currently under way at the government-to-government level between America and India. While the government maintains that it is trying to work out a mechanism, any such benefit if allowed may have to be extended to all companies, irrespective of foreign or a local company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indemnity-issue-holds-up-jj-pfizer-and-moderna-jabs/articleshow/84190024.cms||---

Miami-Dade Assistant Fire Chief Raide Jadallah told families that the number of bodies recovered Tuesday - eight total - are the highest in one day since the collapse on June 24.  Crews in yellow helmets and blue jumpsuits searched the debris for a 13th day while wind and rain from the outer bands of Tropical Storm Elsa complicated their efforts. Video released by the Miami-Dade County Fire Rescue Department showed workers lugging pickaxes and power saws through piles of concrete rubble barbed with snapped steel rebar. Other searchers could be seen digging with gloved hands through pulverized concrete and dumping shovels of debris into large buckets.  Search-and-rescue workers continued to look for open spaces where people might be found alive nearly two weeks after the disaster struck at the Champlain Towers South building in Surfside.  "We're actively searching as aggressively as we can," Miami-Dade County Fire Chief Alan Cominsky said at a news conference. But he added: "Unfortunately, we are not seeing anything positive. The key things - void spaces, living spaces - we're not seeing anything like that."  While officials still call the efforts a search-and-rescue operation, Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said families of those still missing are preparing for news of "tragic loss."  "I think everybody will be ready when it's time to move to the next phase," said Levine Cava, who stressed that crews would use the same care as they go through the rubble even after their focus shifts from searching for survivors to recovering the dead.  "Really, you will not see a difference," she said. "We will carefully search for bodies and belongings, and to catalog and respectfully deal with any remains that we find."  No one has been rescued alive since the first hours after the collapse, which struck early on June 24, when many of the building's residents were asleep.  Officials announced Tuesday that four additional bodies had been found in the debris, raising the death toll to 32.  Up to 113 people remain unaccounted for, though only 70 of those are confirmed to have been inside the building when it collapsed, Levine Cava said.  Severe weather from Elsa threatened to hinder search efforts. Lightning forced rescuers to pause their work for two hours early Tuesday, Miami-Dade Assistant Fire Chief Raide Jadallah said. And stiff winds of 20 mph (32 kph), with stronger gusts, hampered efforts to move heavy debris with cranes, officials said.  However, the storm's heaviest winds and rain were expected to bypass Surfside and neighboring Miami as Elsa strengthened before making landfall somewhere between Tampa Bay and Florida's Big Bend on a path across northern Florida.  "Active search and rescue continued throughout the night, and these teams continue through extremely adverse and challenging conditions," Levine Cava said. "Through the rain and through the wind, they have continued searching."  Crews have removed 124 tons (112 metric tonnes) of debris from the site, Cominsky said.  Workers have been freed to search a broader area since the unstable remaining portion of the condo building was demolished Sunday amid fears that the structure could fall. Officials said the demolition gave rescuers access to spaces that were previously closed off, including bedrooms where people were believed to be sleeping at the time of the disaster.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/4-more-bodies-recovered-from-florida-condo-collapse-site/articleshow/84190123.cms||---
---||World||Tropical Storm Elsa gaining strength, could become hurricane||ST. PETERSBURG: The National Hurricane Center says Tropical Storm Elsa is strengthening and could became a hurricane before making landfall along Florida's northern Gulf coast. The storm has already complicated the search for survivors in the collapse of a Miami-area condominium 12 days ago. In addition to damaging winds and heavy rains, the Miami-based US National Hurricane Center warned of life-threatening storm surges, flooding and isolated tornadoes. A hurricane warning has been issued for a long stretch of coastline, from Egmont Key at the mouth of Tampa Bay to the Steinhatchee River in Florida's Big Bend area. The Tampa area is highly vulnerable to storm surge because the offshore waters and Tampa Bay are quite shallow, experts say. But on the barrier island beach towns along the Gulf Coast, it was largely business as usual with few shutters or plywood boards going up. Free sandbags were being handed out at several locations, and a limited number of storm shelters opened Tuesday morning in at least four counties around the Tampa Bay area, although no evacuations have been ordered. Nancy Brindley, 85, who lives in a seaside house built in 1923, said she has experienced 34 previous tropical cyclones and is not having shutters put on her windows. Her main concern is what will happen to sand on the adjacent beach and the dunes that protect her house and others. She's staying through the storm. "The main concern here is, if it doesn't speed up and decides to stall, there will be enormous erosion," she said. Friends Chris Wirtz, 47, and Brendan Peregrine, 44, were staying put at a beachfront inn with their families. Both are from Tampa, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) across the bay and have been through storms many times. "Before we left, we knew it was coming," Wirtz said. Peregrine said the two families had been coming to the Pinellas County beach for 10 years. He noted they have ample supplies and a charcoal grill to cook on if the power goes out. "We can hunker down for days," Peregrine said. Still, some people were taking no chances. Annie Jones, 51, has lived along the Gulf Coast her entire life. She was buying ice and food at a local grocery store in advance of the storm. "I've seen this happen over the years and I decided to load up," Jones said. "I thought it's best to beat the crowd. My vision is to be prepared." Across the Tampa Bay region that's home to about 3.5 million people, events, government offices and schools were closing down early Tuesday in advance of the storm. Duke Energy, the main electric utility in the Tampa Bay area, said in a statement it has about 3,000 employees, contractors, tree specialists and support personnel ready to respond to power outages in the storm's aftermath. Additional crews are being brought in from other states served by Duke Energy. "We're trained and prepared, and we want to ensure our customers are safe and prepared for any impacts from the storm," said Todd Fountain, the utility's Florida storm director. The Tampa Bay Rays game against Cleveland was postponed until a doubleheader on Wednesday, the team announced. Most schools, in their summer terms, will be closed through Wednesday, and attractions such as Zoo Tampa and several museums were closing early. However, the fifth game of the Stanley Cup finals between the Tampa Bay Lightning and Montreal Canadiens, set for Wednesday night, will take place, according to Tampa Mayor Jane Castor. The Lightning lead the NHL's championship series 3-1 and could clinch the title with a victory. Bands of rain were expected to reach Surfside on Florida's Atlantic coast, soaking the rubble of the Champlain Towers South, which collapsed June 24, killing at least 32 people. Search and rescue crews have worked through rain in search of more than 100 others listed as missing, but must pause when lightning threatens, and a garage area in the pancaked debris already filled with water Monday, officials said. Elsa's maximum sustained winds stood at 70 mph (112 kph) Tuesday afternoon. A slow strengthening is forecast through Tuesday night and Elsa could be at hurricane strength before it makes landfall in Florida. Its core was about 155 miles (250 kilometers) south-southwest of Tampa. It was continuing to move to the north at 10 mph (16 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis expanded a state of emergency to cover a dozen counties where Elsa was expected to make a swift passage Wednesday. After Florida, forecasters predicted Elsa would hit coastal Georgia and South Carolina, portions of which were under a tropical storm watch. Tampa International Airport planned to shut down Tuesday at 5 p.m. Elsa's westward shift spared the lower Florida Keys a direct hit, but the islands were still getting plenty of rain and wind Tuesday. Cuban officials evacuated 180,000 people against the possibility of heavy flooding from a storm that already battered several Caribbean islands, killing at least three people. Elsa is the earliest fifth-named storm on record, said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/tropical-storm-elsa-gaining-strength-could-become-hurricane/articleshow/84190142.cms||---

Also, nearly 80% of the total new cases have been reported from 90 districts, official data show indicating the second wave is now limited to certain areas needing focused measures and intensive restrictions to control further spread. Arunachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Manipur, Kerala and Meghalaya are the top five states having maximum number of districts with above 10% test positivity. The northeastern states together also account for 47 districts with high positivity rate. “The second wave has come down in most states. However, some states are still in the midst of the second wave. This heterogeneity, in the large country that we have, has to be appreciated and district specific measures should continue to be guided by test positivity rate,” Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director general Balram Bhargava said. Apart from the 73 districts with above 10% positivity, 65 districts have positivity ranging between 5-10% and rest 595 have below 5% positivity. The overall caseload of active cases have dropped to below 5 lakh cases with only 91 districts now reporting more than 100 cases daily, down from 262 districts in the beginning of June and 531 in the start of May. With average daily tests at 18.30 lakh, the weekly positivity rate now stands at 2.7%. The Centre emphasised on the need for aggressive testing, particularly in states with large number of districts with high test positivity and fresh Covid-19 cases. “Testing has played a key role in our fight against the pandemic and it has to continue. Currently, we are doing 1,400 tests per million, which is 10 times the recommendations of the WHO, but we should continue because during the second wave, much of our public health response was guided by test positivity rate and that really helped us bring this wave down very fast,” Bhargava said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/73-districts-still-have-over-10-covid-positivity-govt/articleshow/84190126.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||World||UK reports 28,773 new Covid-19 cases, highest since late January||LONDON: Britain reported another 28,773 coronavirus cases in the latest 24-hour period, the highest daily increase since late January, according to official figures released on Tuesday. The total number of coronavirus cases in the country now stands at 4,958,868, the Xinhua news agency reported. The country also recorded another 37 coronavirus-related deaths. The total number of coronavirus-related deaths in Britain now stands at 128,268. These figures only include the deaths of people who died within 28 days of their first positive test. More than 45.4 million people in Britain have received the first jab of covid-19 vaccine and over 33.8 million people have received two doses, the official figures showed. Earlier on Tuesday, British Health Secretary Sajid Javid said that from August 16, people in England who have received two doses will no longer have to self-isolate if they come into contact with someone who has tested positive for covid-19. If someone gets their second dose just before, or after August 16, they'll need to wait until two weeks after they get the second jab to benefit from these new freedoms so the vaccine has time to build the maximum possible protection, he told the lawmakers in the House of Commons, the lower house of the British Parliament. The latest data from Public Health England showed that Britain's vaccination program has saved over 27,000 lives and prevented over 7 million people from getting covid-19. Both doses of a covid-19 vaccine can reduce symptomatic infection by almost 80 per cent, according to Javid. He believed “this protective wall” means the odds have shifted “in our favour, and we can look afresh at many of the measures that we've had to put in place”. Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed on Monday that most coronavirus restrictions are set to end on July 19 as part of the final step of England's roadmap out of the lockdown, despite warnings from scientists that lifting all restrictions at this stage will increase the likelihood of dangerous variants. The government is also looking at the self-isolation rules for international arrivals so it can remove the need for fully vaccinated individuals to isolate when they return from amber list countries, according to Javid. More details on this matter will be revealed later this week. To bring life back to normal, countries such as Britain, China, Russia, the US as well as the European Union have been racing against time to roll out coronavirus vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-reports-28773-new-covid-19-cases-highest-since-late-january/articleshow/84190133.cms||---

Research is also going on to investigate for how long the vaccine-induced antibodies persist, Bhargava said. Some studies show that antibodies in a patient who recovered from Covid-19 may remain for seven to 12 months but there is no clarity on vaccine-induced antibodies, he added. Currently, the government is trying to ramp up vaccination coverage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-studying-efficacy-of-third-vaccine-dose/articleshow/84190189.cms||---
---||World||Zimbabwe returns to strict lockdown to fight virus surge||HARARE: Zimbabwe has returned to strict lockdown measures to combat a resurgence of Covid-19 amid vaccine shortages, the country's information minister announced Tuesday.  Infections have dramatically increased in recent weeks despite a night curfew, reduced business hours, localized lockdowns in hotspot areas, and a ban on inter-city travel. The virus has spread to rural areas which have sparse health facilities.  To try to contain the spread, most people must stay at home, similar to restrictions on movement adopted in March last year when towns and cities became almost deserted, Information Minister Monica Mutsvangwa announced after a Cabinet meeting Tuesday.  People will now need letters from employers to justify why they must venture out of their neighborhoods "with immediate effect," said Mutsvangwa.  "Stiffer penalties will be imposed for violations," including revoking the licenses of offending businesses, she said.  Zimbabwe is one of more than 14 African countries where the delta variant is quickly spreading.  Infections are shooting up. Zimbabwe's 7-day rolling average of daily new cases quadrupled over the past two weeks from 2.04 new cases per 100,000 people on June 21 to 8.39 new cases per 100,000 people on July 5, according to Johns Hopkins University.  Previously the country's crowded cities were the centers of infection, but now rural areas are hard hit, said Mutsvangwa.  Government officials reported shortages of personal protective equipment, misinformation discouraging people from getting vaccines, and shortages of health care workers. Some rural district hospitals require bulk oxygen tanks, while others need "functional" isolation centers, Mutsvangwa said.  Zimbabwe is one of many African countries suffering a resurgence of the disease, in contrast to other parts of the world where vaccines have allowed a return to something like normal life. To date, 9% of Zimbabwe's 15 million people have received at least one vaccine dose and 3.7% have received two doses. Across Africa, less than 2% of the continent's 1.3 billion people have received at least one vaccine jab, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/zimbabwe-returns-to-strict-lockdown-to-fight-virus-surge/articleshow/84189205.cms||---
---||India||Antibodies fall against Delta, may require booster: Experts||PUNE: Recent findings by the Indian Council of Medical Research indicating lower levels of neutralising antibodies against the Delta variant in a small portion of Covishield recipients might just tip the balance in favour of a third booster shot, experts have said. The ICMR study has indicated a 4.5-fold and 3.2-fold reduction in neutralising antibody levels against the Delta variant in those who were given one and two doses of Covishield, respectively, compared to an earlier SARS-CoV-2 version that had the D614G mutation (detected early last year). Dr Samiran Panda, chief of the ICMR’s epidemiology and communicable diseases division, said, "These kinds of observations have the potential of informing immunisation programmes, including the possible need for a third booster dose for vaccination against Covid-19." For the study, serum samples were collected from healthy individuals who had received one or two doses of Covishield. Samples were also collected from Covid-recovered patients who had received one or two doses. A fifth category of individuals from whom samples were drawn were breakthrough cases — people who had contracted Covid after vaccination. Dr Pragya Yadav of the National Institute of Virology, a member of the research team, said the study indicated that serum of Covid-recovered participants (given either one or two doses) and the breakthrough cases had higher neutralising antibody titres compared to non-Covid participants who had received one or two shots of Covishield. "This indicates that neutralising antibodies in the serum of individuals who had contracted Covid, in a way, worked like the first dose. A full vaccination schedule after that resulted in higher levels of neutralising antibodies. Similarly, people who had received two doses of Covishield and contracted Covid after that (breakthrough infections) had higher levels of neutralising antibodies," Dr Panda said. In both cases, Dr Panda said, the immune system was exposed to the viral antigen thrice, generating a greater immune response. "The ICMR study could then help support discussion on whether or not a third Covishield booster dose could be needed in future for some cases." Dr Yadav said, "Another important aspect of the study was the finding that breakthrough cases have significantly less severity and mortality. Also, it showed that even one dose is sufficient for long-term protection in case of those who have recently recovered from Covid-19." She added that a majority of healthy individuals vaccinated with one or two doses of Covishield did show neutralising antibodies, while only a small portion did not have any detectable antibodies. For the study, serum samples were collected four weeks after vaccination for all categories of participants, except breakthrough cases. In the case of the latter (tested via RT-PCR), samples were collected two weeks after completing a two-dose schedule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/antibodies-fall-against-delta-may-require-booster-experts/articleshow/84190228.cms||Neha Madaan

The CNDH said 88 migrants are being kept under leaky roofs at a detention center designed to house only 30 people, run by the National Migration Institute (INM) in the northern city of Saltillo in Coahuila state. It also said worms had been spotted in the food.  INM declined to comment on conditions at the site.  "The foreigners housed at the migration facility said they are not provided with medicine when they get sick, the food they are offered is scarce, of poor quality and on some occasions, they notice the presence of hair and/or worms," CNDH said in a statement on Monday evening.  "The people housed there don't have the means to prevent and avoid Covid-19 infections," it added.  Some migrants told the CNDH they have epilepsy and diabetes and had not received their medications or corresponding medical treatment, the statement added.  The CNDH, a government watchdog agency, said it has asked INM to improve conditions and not house more people than its intended capacity.  At the current pace, total border arrests made by US authorities of migrants at the border with Mexico for the fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, is set to be the highest since 2000, when nearly 1.7 million migrants were apprehended by US authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/mexico-watchdog-says-migrants-overcrowded-no-masks-or-medicine/articleshow/84190307.cms||---

The spike comes on the back of a 7% increase in fresh cases in the state last week as compared to the previous seven days. Kerala logged 14,373 new cases on Tuesday, the highest in the state since June 10, when 14,424 infections were recorded. This wasn’t a one-off spurt in infections. In the June 28-July 4 week, the state had posted 84,791 cases, the highest in three weeks. The spike had broken a falling trend in pandemic numbers that had held for seven weeks and could be pointing to a resurgence of the virus in the state. Kerala accounted for nearly a third of the 43,994 fresh cases recorded in the country on Tuesday. With Maharashtra logging 8,418 new cases, the two states together made up more than half of India's Covid count on the day. India recorded 703 deaths from the virus on Tuesday, up from 491 reported on the previous day. Not included in the count were 224 older deaths added to the overall toll by Maharashtra. With this, India's official toll from the pandemic rose to 4,04,228. Apart from the "backlog" deaths, Maharashtra reported 171 fresh fatalities, the highest in the country on Tuesday. Kerala recorded 142 deaths, followed by Karnataka (92), Tamil Nadu (73), Odisha (51), Assam (34) and Andhra Pradesh (28). With four new deaths from Covid-19, Delhi's toll crossed the 25,000-mark on Tuesday. The capital has the fourth highest Covid toll in the country after Maharashtra (1,23,531), Karnataka (35,526) and Tamil Nadu (33,132). Delhi's populous neighbour Uttar Pradesh has reported 22,653 deaths so far. Meanwhile, active cases of the virus continued to decline in the country, although the fall has slowed considerably in the past few days. There were less than 4.7 lakh active cases of Covid-19 in the country on Tuesday night, a drop of around 4,000 in the the past 24 hours.

The Delta Plus (AY.1) variant has been detected in 56 samples so far from 13 states and UTs since last week of March, the bulletin published on June 28 says. These states are Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Punjab, Gujarat, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chandigarh, Jammu and Karnataka. “As of now, number of cases with AY.1 infection is not increasing faster than that with Delta. However, INSACOG is keeping a close watch on the situation, since any Delta sub-lineage is a variant of concern,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/impact-of-plus-may-be-less-in-delta-hit-areas/articleshow/84190371.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||India||Germany welcomes vaccinated Indians||NEW DELHI: Starting Wednesday (July 7), Germany open its doors to fully vaccinated travellers from India — those who have got Covishield jabs as Covaxin is yet to get WHO approval — without any need for quarantine. While neighbouring Switzerland took the same decision late last month, Germany has gone a step ahead by accepting proof of recent convalescence from Covid also. These changes come as Germany will from Wednesday reclassify India, UK, Portugal and Russia as “high (Covid) incidence areas” — down from the higher travel restriction level of “virus variant areas” list which India was on from April 26, 2021, to July 6. Now, eligible travellers from India can also transit via Frankfurt to other Schengen states. “Travellers who spent time in a high-incidence area may end quarantine prematurely by submitting proof of recovery or a vaccination certificate via the travel portal or, after five days, by opting to 'test themselves free’ and presenting a negative test result,” German health ministry website says. German ambassador to India, Walter J Lindner, tweeted Tuesday: “Promised to work hard on easing travel restrictions for travellers from India and update you immediately. And voila: from (July 7) Germany is removing entry ban and easing travel rules for five countries where the Delta variant is widespread, including India!” The change comes just in time for the fall academic session with large number of Indian students requiring to join German colleges. However, the backlog of visa applications will mean it will take some time before the same is processed — something witnessed by Indian students headed to US also last month. “Due to ongoing Covid repercussions and precaution measures, the restart of our visa services will be gradual, so we ask for your patience and understanding as we cannot process all applications immediately,” Ambassador Lindner tweeted Tuesday night. To seek exemption from quarantine, travellers must have received the second Covid jab — or only one dose in the case of a person who has recovered from coronavirus — at least 14 days before the date of travel, says website of Germany’s federal interior ministry. A positive PCR test result carried out at least 28 days but no more than six months previously will be proof of recovery. All travellers from high Covid incidence areas like India have to register on www.einreiseanmeldung.de before entering Germany. A Covid negative is needed to be allowed to board a fight to Germany, taken within 72 hours (RT-PCR) before scheduled arrival time in Germany. Children below 6 years are exempt from the testing requirement. “Violation of registration and quarantine requirements can lead to a fine of up to Euro 25,000,” the website says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/germany-welcomes-vaccinated-indians/articleshow/84190404.cms||Saurabh Sinha

Times ViewThose indulging in ‘revenge’ travel seem to have abandoned both common sense and self-preservation. Covid-appropriate behaviour in public places is mandatory even for those who are fully vaccinated. Hill station authorities must enforce the rules in the strictest possible way.Daily new cases have come down significantly in the last few weeks. “The pictures (from hill stations) that we have seen today are very frightening. Covid-appropriate behaviour is absolutely essential,” Indian Council of Medical Research director general Balram Bhargava said. Officials cited an online survey involving 33,000 respondents indicating gross violations in terms of use of masks and physical distancing. The survey shows that 69% respondents were not complying with proper use of masks, whereas compliance to physical distancing norms were completely missing in 63% while 24% showed limited compliance. Only 11% said they fully comply with physical distancing norms. “Now, with lifting of restrictions people are inferring that virus is over. Virus is still around. Gross violations of Covid-appropriate behaviour can nullify the gains achieved so far,” Lav Agarwal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-warns-against-revenge-travel-as-tourists-throng-hills/articleshow/84190427.cms||---

If you keep promoting children to the next class, you are creating an enormous deficit that cannot be filled up,” he said at an event organised by the Bombay Chartered Accountants Society. Schools across the country have been closed due to the pandemic and state governments have been wary of re-opening them, fearing for the safety of children. Premji said that children should be exposed to the real world of India – inequitable distribution of income, injustice and indignity of millions – to help grow a sense of humanness within them. “Go out and engage with the real world. Get your hands dirty, see the problems all live with, and that will move you to do whatever you can,” he said. The Wipro promoter added people needed to start giving back to society early. “Just like you need to work on your physical fitness now rather than later, similarly, start work on your social fitness early. I wish I had started it much earlier.” Premji’s Foundation, set up in 2000, has been working with the elementary education system in rural government schools. He said that to ensure maximum reach, it was necessary to partner with the government and public systems. Public officials, he said, by and large have the right intention, incredible reach and unmatched resources, though they are often handicapped by lack of domain capability and bureaucratic processes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/jab-teachers-open-schools-fast-premji/articleshow/84190448.cms||Avik Das

How long will your process take? Does Twitter think it will go on taking as much time as it wants in our country? I won’t permit that,” Justice Rekha Palli observed, giving the company two days to convey a time frame “Come up with clear instructions, otherwise you will be in trouble,” Justice Palli told the counsel for Twitter. “Let the government and everybody else know your stand,” the judge said after the company sought more time to inform the court by when it would appoint a resident grievances officer (RGO) and fill other key posts. The HC was hearing a plea alleging failure by Twitter to comply with the Centre’s new Information Technology Rules and took exception to the company’s stand that it was in the process of appointing an RGO. The HC pointed out that only an interim RGO was appointed by Twitter and a wrong impression was given to the court on May 31 as it was not informed that it was an interim appointment. When the Centre, represented by additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma, said the rules were notified on February 25 and a three-month window was given to the intermediaries to comply with the rules, the HC wondered why it took no action. “We are not giving any protection, you are free to take any action. If they are in violation, you know what to do. ...if they want to work, they have to follow the rules,” the judge said. Shift IT rules cases from HCs to SC: GovtThe Central government has approached the Supreme Court seeking transfer of all petitions challenging the constitutionality of the Information Technology (IT) Rules, 2021, from various high courts to the top court. The Centre has filed a transfer petition saying several HCs including Delhi, Bombay, Madras and Kerala, are seized of the issue, and the issue be adjudicated by the apex court. According to the case status shown on the apex court website, the Centre's plea, which was filed earlier, is likely to be listed for hearing on July 9. Several pleas challenging the validity of the new IT rules are pending adjudication in the Delhi high court which had sought response from the Centre on these petitions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-govt-free-to-act-against-twitter-for-it-rules-violation/articleshow/84190484.cms||Abhinav Garg

A proposal in this regard was recently approved by the empowered standing committee members of the civic body. Vinay, councillor of ward number 28, said holding tax is being collected for the services that the municipal body has been providing, such as sanitation and solid waste management. “Levying additional charges for door-to-door garbage collection from commercial establishments is unlawful,” he said. He said the civic body and Patna mayor passed a “sarcastic” resolution of fee collection from the commercial establishments even though they remained closed for most of the time last year. “A private company has been given a free hand to collect garbage fee forcibly from all commercial property holders. This is absolutely wrong,” former deputy mayor said. PMC commissioner Himanshu Sharma said the notification for garbage collection fee was issued by the state government in 2018, but the civic body has implemented it this year. “Across the country, all municipal bodies charge separately for garbage collection. So, we are not doing anything new or unlawful. Instead, we have given rebate to commercial as well as private properties on garbage collection and charging even less than what the government has notified,” he said. The PMC has included schools, colleges, cinema halls, malls, shopping complexes, petrol pumps, showrooms, restaurants and hotels as commercial properties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/fee-for-garbage-collection-illegal-former-deputy-mayor-of-patna/articleshow/84183558.cms||Faryal Rumi

The farmers are being given exemption from stamp duty and registration fee to get their land registered. The state government has decided to return 2,180 acres land taken from farmers for the SEZ in 2007. A committee headed by minister for agriculture, K Kannababu, had gone through the issue, held several rounds of interactions with farmers and had submitted its report to the government in March 2021. The government had accepted the recommendations and issued orders in March 2021 to return the land. On Tuesday, the government issued orders exempting stamp duty and registration fee for the farmers to get back their land. Similarly, the government also issued orders on Tuesday extending the same benefits to the YSR Steel Corporation Limited (YSCL) to get 3148.68 acres of land in Sunnapurallapalle and Peddandluru villages of Jammalamadugu mandal in Kadapa district. This would clear the hurdles for the proposed steel plant in the district. The government had alienated 3148.68 acres land for the steel plant at the market value of Rs 1.65 lakh per acre. It was estimated to cost Rs 3,89,64,915 towards stamp duty and registration fee which the government exempted in the name of incentives to YSCL. The measure would also help YSCL speed up the process of establishing the steel plant, official sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/stamp-duty-exemption-for-kadapa-kakinada-lands/articleshow/84181643.cms||Gopi Dara

This is third port to be grounded in the last two years. A greenfield port at Machilipatnam will be taken up with Rs 4,000 crore investment. The judicial preview committee headed by former high court judge Dr B Siva Sankara Rao has suggested a few amendments to the draft tender document readied by AP Maritime Board after taking suggestions and objections of the public and bidders into consideration. The port project would be taken up under Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) mode. The Maritime Board said that the selected location was ideally suitable for development of the port, as the coast near Machilipatnam was quite stable and erosion is almost negligible, as well as the stability of the coastline during cyclones, proximity of operating area, sufficient land and water area, adequate water depths, limited exposure to sedimentation and shoaling. It said the proposed backup area available in the port site is well suited for future expansion. “The proposed port location is close to NH-65 and Indian Railway network of Chennai-Calcutta route and is part of Vizag-Chennai Industrial Corridor. Even the port location is well connected with agriculture, aqua, minerals and cement-based products hinterlands within the district in particular, and in general with the hinterland of AP, Telangana and other neighbouring states, which will facilitate in reduction of transportation and maintenance costs and reduce pollution,” said the Maritime Board. The state government is of the view that the grounding of the new port at Machilipatnam will have a considerable economic impact on livelihoods in the region, create employment opportunities, increase earnings and boost commercial activities in surrounding areas. The new port is expected to help in the rapid growth of industries in the district and neighbouring areas. “Realising the port at Machilipatnam is a boon to the industrially backward district of Krishna,” said minister Perni Venkatramaiah (Nani).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/judicial-preview-panel-nod-for-machilipatnam-port-tenders/articleshow/84182224.cms||Samdani MN

G Ramana Reddy, a secondary grade teacher in Kadapa district, was surprised when he was posted to Pittigunta village of Kasinayana mandal four years ago as only three students were on the rolls. He knocked at each and every door in the village and identified school-going children. He held meetings with parents and prevailed upon them to send their wards to school. “In an attempt to convince the parents, I have spent from my pocket to provide books and stationery to the children as the parents were unable to bear the costs,” said Ramana Reddy. Turnout started improving from the academic year after Ramana Reddy joined as teacher. He requested the district administration to sanction additional teacher posts after the strength crossed 70 in 2019. He engaged the services of two ‘vidya volunteers’ to hold classes for primary students, an expense he bore from his salary. “Ramana Reddy transformed the thinking of parents as he used to take classes even at night in his residence,” said K Nageswara Rao, a farmer. Ramana Reddy continued classes even during the peak of the second wave with the support of parents and locals. He provided masks and sanitizers to the children and took only one class per hour. “I have continued classes till mid-May with adequate safety measures. I took classes in rotation as I do not want the children to miss out on school. I owe a lot to their parents for their support,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/in-kadapa-village-teacher-takes-student-enrolment-from-3-to-104/articleshow/84181772.cms||Samdani MN

Chief secretary Tripurari Sharan held a virtual meeting with senior officials of different departments, state DGP and those in field assignments in this regard on Tuesday. The CM secretariat has also issued directives to all the heads of the departments, divisional commissioners, IGs, DIGs, DMs, SSPs and SPs in this connection. The venue of the janata darbar has been shifted from the CM’s 1, Aney Marg official residence to a new building at the CM secretariat, also called 4KG. Last week, Nitish visited the venue and took stock of the preparations. A big hall with proper sitting arrangements on both sides has been readied for the programme. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh and SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma on Tuesday inspected the site. “The visitors will be allowed inside the hall after proper screening at the entrance gate,” they said. The DM said the arrangements were being made to maintain social distancing and other Covid norms. Authoritative sources said the officials concerned would be present at the meeting. “All the officers in the field assignments have been properly intimated about the programme. They are supposed to remain present in their respective offices during the meeting,” an additional chief secretary rank officer told this newspaper. The programme is set to restart after a gap of almost five years. “It was a big hit from 2006 to 2016 when people used to narrate their woes to the CM directly and the officials concerned were asked to look into their grievances fast,” recalled a retired DGP, who used to attend the programme. The programme was stopped after the introduction of Public Grievance Redressal Act, 2015, which provides right to know about one’s grievances within a stipulated time frame.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-to-hold-janata-darbar-from-july-12/articleshow/84183672.cms||Ramashankar

The court made the observation after hearing a PIL filed by representatives of a regional television channel, alleging that CID has not followed due process in filing FIRs. PVG Umeshchandra, counsel for the petitioners, told the bench of Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya that the state government is not publishing the FIRs in the online portal within 24 hours of filing it, due to which the accused are losing the chance to get anticipatory bail. He also submitted to the court that the government is ignoring Supreme Court judgement in the Arnesh Kumar case, which states that those arrested in cases with imprisonment of less than 7 years are eligible for station bail. Despite advocate general S Sriram arguing that the PIL is not maintainable, the court expressed its dissatisfaction and recalled some cases in which some of the arrested people were presented in court only after their family members filed habeas corpus petitions. The court also directed the government to file a counter with details of how many FIRs were uploaded on the online portal within 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/suppression-of-voices-wont-be-tolerated-hc/articleshow/84181845.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Business||Japan’s Sumitomo to buy Fullerton India for Rs 19k cr||Mumbai: Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, the Japan-headquartered global financial major, is buying out Fullerton India, the Indian non-banking financial arm of Singapore-based Fullerton Financial, for about $2.6 billion, or nearly Rs 19,300 crore. This is the largest Japanese buyout in the Indian financial services space. Moreover, this is the first time that a Japanese firm is getting into general retail lending in India. Initially, Sumitomo will buy 74.9% in Fullerton India and the balance 25.1% at a later date, a release from the company being acquired said. Although both the companies did not disclose the deal value, sources said Sumitomo will pay $2 billion initially for the nearly 75% stake in Fullerton’s India arm, and the balance once it becomes a fully owned subsidiary. Japan is one of the top investors in India. According to government data on foreign direct investments (FDIs) into the country, between 2000 and 2021, Japanese companies had invested $35.4 billion, making it the fifth largest contributor of funds from abroad for this period. Over 1,000 Japanese companies currently operate in India, industry sources said. In the manufacturing space, Suzuki (in Maruti Suzuki), Toyota (in Toyota Kirloskar Motors), Honda and Sony are large Japanese conglomerates having substantial presence in India. Also, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, Mizuho Corporate Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group have presence in India’s corporate banking space. These banks have very strong relationships in some of the leading sectors and with industry houses in India, especially in oil refining and explorations segments. In the financial services space, global insurance major Nippon Life is one of the largest FDI contributors. After entering the insurance and mutual fund sectors through its investments in Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group’s arms, it is now the majority owner in the fund house and has 49% in the life insurance joint venture. Mitsui Sumitomo is a minority shareholder in Max Life Insurance. Veterans in the financial services space said that Sumitomo’s entry into the NBFC sector is a major step for a Japanese company. “There are thousands of NBFCs in the country. Some Japanese companies may have some presence through minority stakes, but Sumitomo’s entry through this (Fullerton) deal is the biggest,” said a financial services sector analyst. At present, unlisted Fullerton India offers auto, personal and business loans, mortgage finance, loans against properties and securities. The buyout is part of Sumitomo’s Asia strategy to expand into the consumer and MSME lending space and, through this buyout, the Japanese major intends to leverage Fullerton India’s “expertise in serving mass-market consumers and MSME customers in India”. The transaction reaffirms the strength of the Fullerton India platform underpinned by best-in-class corporate governance, risk management, prudent liquidity management, agile technology, and advanced analytics, the release said.Citigroup, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, and Allen & Overy were financial and legal advisers to Fullerton Group in this deal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/japans-sumitomo-to-buy-fullerton-india-for-rs-19k-cr/articleshow/84186122.cms||---

We too have tightened the security in and around the civil enclave. Thus, issuing of the visitor’s pass has been temporarily suspended,” said regional director (Prayagraj) of Airport Authority of India Ltd (AAI), Achal Prakash. The family members or taxi drivers will be permitted to enter the main gate and drop the passenger at the entrance. Beyond that, the entry is only for the traveller. Several family members, who are coming to receive the passengers, are having a harrowing time waiting in the sultry weather. “It is difficult due to scorching heat... But when I was told that the pass is not been given due to security concerns after the Jammu attack, I had no complaints,” said Avinash Gupta, a local. “The step has been taken as a precaution from the point of view of security and the visitor pass counter will remain closed until permission is received from higher authorities,” said the regional director. After a sluggish business, in terms of air-travellers and number of flights coming to Prayagraj during the peak of Covid-19 pandemic, the civil enclave of Prayagraj is back to routine business. Presently, the airport is catering to over 1,000 passengers on a daily basis and the number of flights are around 14 or more. In fact, on June 4, the airport catered to 1,355 passengers and 18 flights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/jammu-air-base-attack-visitors-pass-facility-suspended-at-civil-enclave/articleshow/84184625.cms||---
---||Business||Tata Steel sees 73% of business from India over 10 years||MUMBAI: Tata Steel expects India to account for 73% of its business over the next decade as it moves to double production capacity and broaden offerings. A decade ago, Europe accounted for the bulk (63%) of its business, while India comprised 29%. Its growth outlook has changed after it adopted an inward-looking strategy following its overseas adventure, which began with the purchase of NatSteel Singapore in 2004, Millennium Steel Thailand in 2005 and Corus in 2007. Over the last few years, it bought local assets (Bhushan Steel, Usha Martin Steel) to expand its play here even as it reduced its European footprint. On Tuesday, Tata Steel said it will raise its India capacity to as much as 40 million tons per annum by 2030 from about 20 million now. While organic growth is the way forward for flat products (sheets and plates), for long products (wires and bars), it will be inorganic growth, said CEO T V Narendran at the investors’ conference organised by the company. India’s share in the overall business has been going up. From 29% in 2010, its share has almost doubled to 57% in 2020. India has been one of the most profitable businesses for Tata Steel. It is also one of the lowest cost producers of steel in the world, said Narendran. While the company will continue with the European and Southeast Asian businesses, those operations will not be financially supported by the India unit, said Narendran. Southeast Asia is cash-neutral and doesn’t require money from India, while Europe became cash-positive in fiscal 2021. “There is no pressure to sell these businesses,” said the CEO. Assuming the two units remain where they are now, Europe’s contribution to Tata Steel’s business will reduce to 23% in 2030 from 36% in 2020. While Southeast Asia will shrink to 4% from 6%. The company will spend as much as Rs 12,000 crore on capital expenditure annually in India over the next five years. This spend will not include potential acquisitions. It has shown an interest to buy Neelachal Ispat Nigam, a PSU based in Odisha, and is evaluating Rashtriya Ispat Nigam, in which the government plans to sell its stake. At the same time, the company has targeted to reduce gross debt by Rs 15,000 crore this financial year. Its gross debt in fiscal 2021 was Rs 88,501 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tata-steel-sees-73-of-biz-from-india-over-10-years/articleshow/84187089.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Councillors of Azaad group alleged that the mayor remained a mute spectator during the virtual house meetings, with his supporters answering queries on his behalf. Azaad group councillors Sarabjit Singh Samana, Sukhdev Singh Patwari and others alleged that the mayor has been evading a physical house meet despite the fact that even the government had eased Covid-19 restrictions. They said that when Covid was at its peak, the mayor held the oath taking ceremony, where over 200 Congress supporters gathered at the MC building and now when everything had normalised, Congress was afraid of holding a physical meeting. Sarabjit Singh Samana said, “The mayor has no experience of holding any chair and now when he has been elected mayor, he has no confidence in answering queries or taking decisions and is dependent on his supporters. Whenever we ask a question or have any objection, his supporters answer and the mayor has left the meeting many times without uttering a word.” Sukhdev Singh Patwari said he has been demanding a physical meet but the mayor is avoiding it. He said it seemed that he was scared to face the opposition. Refuting all allegations, mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu said, “The Azad group is left with no powers and is resorting to excuses to save face. They are getting frustrated as people of Mohali have brought them to minority in the MC house because of their ill-deeds in the last term.” He said they would hold a physical house meet very soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mayor-is-scared-to-hold-physical-house-councilors/articleshow/84184654.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Patna||Schools, colleges to reopen with new guidelines in Bihar on July 12||PATNA: After the state government on Monday allowed the colleges and universities as well as the schools to resume classes XI and XII, the education department on Tuesday issued a fresh standard operating procedure (SOP) for the safety of students and staff against the Covid-19 infection. Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said all government and private schools, colleges, polytechnic and training institutes would reopen from July 12. “As of now, schools and colleges will only reopen with 50% attendance and hold classes for each batch on alternate days or rotational basis to avoid overcrowding on the premises. The teaching progress will be slow as the teachers have to teach the similar topic for two consecutive days, but something is better than nothing,” he told this newspaper. “If the Covid-19 situation keeps on improving in the state, we may allow physical classes with full capacity from next month,” he added. As per the new guidelines, such education institutes in which enrolment is high should operate the classes in two shifts. Staggered timings should be maintained for entry and exit of staff and students in schools and colleges. A letter issued by additional chief secretary (education) Sanjay Kumar states that customized seating plans in classrooms and staffrooms, sanitisation and emergency plans have to be chalked out before the reopening of schools and colleges. “Arrangements of face masks, thermal scanners, hand sanitisers or soaps should be made beforehand. Temperature screening of students and staff should be done at the entry point every day,” he said. The department has directed the officials concerned that Covid appropriate behaviour should be maintained with social distancing and proper hygiene. The institutes have been asked to constitute a task force (including students, teachers and academic staff) for the strict implementation of mask rule, social distancing, sanitisation and cleanliness. Desks in classrooms and staffrooms must also be placed accordingly to maintain six feet distance. If classrooms are not spacious, classes may be held in library and computer laboratory. Morning assemblies should be conducted in the classrooms. Sanitisation of campuses and transportation should be a regular exercise. As per the SOP, schools and colleges must avoid functions, cultural events and celebration of festivals. Posters and banners should be put up at appropriate places reminding students about distancing. There will be a total ban on spitting on the campus. At the time of admission in schools, the institutions should only call parents while the admission process will be conducted through online mode. With the help of health department, special arrangements will be made for the vaccination of adult students, teaching and non-teaching staff at schools and colleges. The teaching staff of cases I to X would also attend the schools with 50% capacity on alternate days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/schools-colleges-to-reopen-with-new-guidelines-in-bihar-on-july-12/articleshow/84182893.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: All universities to have common entrance test for PG courses||VISAKHAPATNAM: For the first time in its history, Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education (APSCHE) has in-principle decided to conduct a common entrance test to fill postgraduate seats in all universities of the state. Even admissions will be conducted through a single window counselling mechanism, doing away with varsity-wise separate entrance tests, admission notifications and counselling processes. So far, students seeking admissions into conventional science, arts and commerce postgraduate programmes would have to apply separately for each university. There are 14 conventional universities in the state with a total intake of about 15,000 PG seats. The APSCHE is currently aggregating data as the universities would drop some courses and add a few new courses for the next academic year. The common entrance test is expected to offer a lot of convenience to the students in terms of choice of courses and universities, in addition to saving money and time. Other than these regular programmes, state-wide common tests are being conducted for the remaining courses. For example, ICET (integrated common entrance test) is held for giving admissions into MBA and MCA courses. Likewise, APPGECET (Post Graduate Engineering Common Entrance Test) is held for PG engineering seats. There are also state-wide entrance tests for teacher education, engineering, law and other courses at the graduation level. Chairman, APSCHE, Prof K Hemachandra Reddy, said APSCHE is seeking appropriate permission from the state government to go ahead with the common entrance test. “Today, the world has become a global village due to technological advancements. In the existing scenario, for instance, if a student from Rayalaseema wants to take admission in Andhra University, he needs to appear for a separate entrance test. If the same candidate has a second preference for another university, he/she is compelled to take another test. That’s why the APSCHE has in-principle decided to roll out a single entrance test and single window admission system for all varsities,” said Prof Hemachandra Reddy. The APSCHE chairman added that a single entrance would make it easier for the students to choose their preferred courses and educational institutions. “The APSCHE’s major objective behind this move is to decrease the discomfort of the students and ensure transparent admission process. The APSCHE is proposing to conduct the entrance test in September,” said Prof Hemachandra Reddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/all-varsities-to-have-common-entrance-test-for-pg-courses/articleshow/84181470.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The questioning was continuing at the time of going to the press. In January last year, the ED had recorded Khadse’s statement in the case. In 2016, it was alleged that when the Khadse was revenue minister in the Devendra Fadnavis government he had misused his position to purchase a 3.1-acre MIDC plot at Bhosari in Pune at a throwaway price of Rs 3.7 crore as against the value of over Rs 31 crore. Last year, he joined NCP. The plot belonged to Abbas Ukani from whom the MIDC had acquired it in 1971, though the issue of compensation to Ukani is pending in court. Khadse convened a meeting on April 12, 2016, and directed officials to take a quick decision on whether to return the land to the Ukanis or give them higher compensation. A fortnight later, the Ukanis executed the sale deed in favour of Khadse’s kin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-quizzes-khadses-kin-in-pune-land-deal-case/articleshow/84186925.cms||Vijay V Singh

The bench of Justice Battu Devanand imposed the fine after hearing a contempt petition filed by 36 village horticulture assistant post aspirants alleging that officials ignored the court’s directions. The job notification for the posts was published in January 2020 but rules for the selection process was changed midway. Opposing the move, the candidates moved the high court, which, September 28, issued orders in favour of the petitioners. After officials did not implement the HC’s orders, the candidates filed another petition, demanding contempt of court proceedings to be issued against then horticulture commissioner Chiranjeevi Choudary and current panchayat raj commissioner Girija Shankar. The court, in its earlier hearing, had ordered one week’s jail term but later revised the order following a request by the officials. On Tuesday, the court observed that the counter filed by the government exposed the apathy of the officials and they should be punished for their apathy. After the officials apologized and asked the court to consider their public service and age, the court revised the punishment to a fine of Rs 1,000 and asked the officials to stay in the court till the completion of court hours on Tuesday. The court also said that they should be kept in jail for three days if they fail to pay the fine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-imposes-rs-1k-fine-on-2-ias-officers/articleshow/84181889.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Kolkata||Veggie prices jump by 60-100 per cent from wholesale to retail markets across Kolkata||KOLKATA: The price of vegetables that had shot up in the initial days of the pandemic last year, when lockdown posed severe transportation challenges, has not come down even a year later. “The difference between wholesale and retail prices of vegetables that used to be 20-30% prior to the pandemic has now become 60%-100%. Though the increase in diesel price has led to a hike of Rs 1.50 per kilogram in transporting goods, it does not account for the massive increase,” said West Bengal Vendors’ Association president Kamal Dey. Hence, while the wholesale price of capsicum at Koley Market was Rs 50 a kg on Tuesday, its retail price was Rs 100 in several markets. Similarly, pointed gourd or parwal was sold at Rs 25-30 in the wholesale market but at Rs 50-60 in retail. The wholesale price of ridge gourd or jhinge was Rs 30 but it was sold for Rs 60 a kg in retail. The Enforcement Branch on Tuesday raided four markets — Hatibagan, Sovabazar, Shyambazar and Maniktala markets — to check vegetable prices. Led by DC (EB) Bidisha Kalita, the team found a difference of Rs 10 between the prices of vegetables sold in these markets and those in south Kolkata. Retailers blamed the rise in diesel price and challenges in transportation since local trains are not operating for the hike in the vegetable prices. Common vegetables like brinjal, bitter gourd, coriander leaves, green chilli, ridged gourd and okra are sold for nearly double of what they had been even two weeks ago. While transport cost has gone up, vendors are also bringing smaller amounts so they can sell the perishable items within a four-hour window and return. “The prices of vegetables will cool off only when local vegetable production swings back to normalcy,” said Sealdah market wholesaler Gopal Sonkar. The rains and subsequent waterlogging in the fields have also destroyed standing crops. Dilip Kumar Mondal, a trader at Gariahat, said the farmers were trying to sell whatever they could save. “Some middlemen are trying to maximize profits. It needs to be curbed,” he said. EB officers said there was a proposal of a redressal mechanism on days when multiple factors contributed to high prices. “We have spoken to the buyers and asked them to lodge any grouse they might have. We will continue our vigil in bigger markets and conduct surprise checks so that no one takes undue advantage,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/veggie-prices-jump-by-60-100-from-wholesale-to-retail-markets-across-city/articleshow/84184659.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Cases of molestation have gone up by 39%, while cases of cruelty by husband and in-laws have shown a massive rise of 107%. The cops attribute the increased criminal attacks against women to the Covid-19 pandemic and the conditions it created and pointed out that in most of these cases, the accused were family members or relatives of the victims. The number of rape cases reported up to June 15 this year was 833 compared with 580 last year. Similarly, cases of molestation rose dramatically from 735 cases between January and June 15 last year to 1,022 cases this year. Cases under the Dowry Prohibition Act and those related to abduction of women and cruelty by husband and in-laws saw, respectively, a whopping increase by 239%, 133% and 107%. TOI spoke to senior police officers who attributed the rise to the lifting of the lockdown. Explaining the rise, one officer said, “If we look at rape, in 2020 of the full year’s 1,699 cases, only 580 were reported till June 15. This was the period of the Covid lockdown. You can then see that after the lockdown was lifted, the number of rape cases rose. This year, there was a shorter lockdown and only restrictions and night curfew were imposed, explaining the larger number of cases.” The officer revealed that in most of the rape cases, the accused were known to the women or were their relatives.” However, heinous crimes like murder saw a decline of 13% up to June 15 in 2020. While 226 cases were reported last year, the number of cases reported in the same period this year was 196. Total heinous crime similarly recorded a decline of 4%. In contrast, snatching saw a rise of 43%, with 3,829 cases up to June 15 this year against 2,612 cases last year. The cops said several criminals were released from Delhi prisons to decongest jails as an anti-Covid measure and even till now some hadn’t reported back and remained missing “We have been making efforts to rein them in. Some of them were re-arrested after committing new crimes,” said an officer. Balaji Srivastava, newly appointed police commissioner, in his meeting with the brass soon after his takeover, emphasised on curbing street crime, promoting direct interaction of cops with the public, women’s safety and welfare of the members of the uniformed force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/crimes-against-women-up-43-in-6-mths/articleshow/84186988.cms||Sakshi Chand

Educational institutes are also working out plans to welcome everyone back and ensure their safety. All the Covid-related protocols, including the 50% attendance rule, will be followed at Litera Valley School (LVS) in Patna. Classes will be held in two shifts on different floors so that the students remain safe and do not miss out on anything. “The education department may have decided to resume offline classes, but I am not sure if parents are willing to send their children to schools and colleges,” LVS principal Sharat Kumar Singh told this newspaper and urged the government to ramp up the vaccination drive. Marie D Cruz, the vice-principal of St Michael’s High School, welcomed the government’s decision, saying it was an important step towards bringing the students’ lives back on track. She, however, pointed out, “Children are children. If they meet their friends, they may throw caution to the wind and flout the safety norms.” Meanwhile, the students of classes XI and XII are quite excited to return to their schools after ages. Animesh Kashyap, who studies at St Michael’s High School, said he preferred offline classes to the virtual mode of education. “Students and teachers can interact with each other openly in offline classes,” he added and promised to follow all the Covid safety protocols on the school campus, carry a sanitizer, and maintain social distancing. Others are eager to meet their classmates after a long time and have fun. “Online classes no longer interest me. I am happy that offline classes will begin soon because I’ll be able to meet my friends,” Naman Kalra, a student of New Era Public School, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/keeping-safety-in-mind-schools-buckle-up-to-welcome-students-back/articleshow/84183029.cms||---

Sources close to Sahni, the JD(U) MLA from Bahadurpur in Darbhanga, said he visited 1, Anne Marg residence of the CM with his resignation letter in the evening. He had returned from New Delhi earlier in the day. After listening to the minister’s grievances, the CM summoned additional chief secretary of the social welfare department, Atul Prasad, at his residence to know his side of version. Prasad, however, left the CM’s residence without making any comment. Sahni came out of the CM’s residence after spending about two hours with him. He, however, parried questions from the mediapersons. “What transpired between Sahni and the CM is not known. But Sahni was confident of action from the CM on his complaint,” a close aide of the minister told this newspaper on condition of anonymity. Efforts to contact the minister for his comments, however, proved futile as his cellphone was switched off. On July 1, Sahni had offered to resign from the post of minister alleging high-handedness of the state’s bureaucracy. He had, however, reposed faith in Nitish’s leadership.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sahni-meets-cm-but-keeps-mum-on-his-offer-to-resign/articleshow/84183570.cms||Ramashankar

Dr Vyas said the government wanted to push the vaccination programme further and conduct 10-12 lakh vaccinations in a day to complete inoculation of the targeted group by August-end . The state has been allocated 1.15 crore vaccine doses for July. In his letter to the Union health secretary, Vyas wrote, “ We are reporting approximately 10,000 new cases daily for the last three weeks despite trying to follow all the instructions of containment, isolation, testing and tracking. As a result, the state has the highest number of active cases in the country though the positivity rate in almost all districts has come down below 5%.” Nine districts have higher positivity rate than the state average of 4.5%. The state task force and the public health department have been demanding targeted vaccination in these districts. “In one of the meetings earlier, the state was asked to present the plan for administering up to nine lakh Covid doses in a day. We request for additional allocation of at least 1.5 crore doses for the month of July 2021 over and above what has been allocated,” Dr Vyas wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maha-health-secretary-seeks-1-5cr-more-doses/articleshow/84186865.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Patna||Lalu may still be popular in Bihar, but has limited role in national politics||PATNA: RJD chief Lalu Prasad is back in the political discussions once again at a time when some opposition stalwarts have started trying to bring “anti-NDA, anti-PM Narendra Modi” forces together ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. That Lalu is still a popular leader became evident when both the BJP and the JD(U) reacted sharply to the RJD’s 25th foundation day function addressed by him on Monday. Lalu still holds his anti-BJP (Modi) credentials intact among the traditional opposition camp, but the political equations over the years have changed in many states where young and aspirational leadership has taken the centre stage. In Bihar too, Lalu’s son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has been trying to stitch ‘A-to-Z’ political combination with his father’s caste equations working as the party’s backbone, as was reflected in the 2020 assembly elections. Many, however, feel that had Lalu been out of jail last year, the results would have been more favourable for RJD and its Mahagathbandhan. Lalu has been convicted and released on bail recently in a fodder scam case. But there are others who feel otherwise and say his absence, even from the RJD posters, gave Tejashwi and his party a fresh start and helped it emerge single largest party. On the popularity chart, even in remote areas of Bihar, people across all castes, creed and adult age groups know only two politicians – Lalu and CM Nitish Kumar. The RJD chief, in an interview to a vernacular daily recently, said a leader never retires and he would keep fighting for the rights of the poor and the downtrodden. But the man, who gave voice to the downtrodden, may no longer be able to fetch their votes as he used to in the 1990s with his maverick style and pro-poor image because the Nitish government, in the last over 16 years, has empowered them economically, be it through loan, pension or other schemes. Ramai Kumar Sharma (55), a carpenter from Mangraulia under Chiraiya block of East Champaran district, says all politicians are the same. “All politicians are liars. They did nothing for the poor. What Lalu did in 15 years, except pushing back Bihar to backwardness? I have no pucca house and cannot get one without paying a bribe under the Nitish regime. I will vote neither for Nitish nor Lalu),” he said. But former Union minister and now BJP MLC Sanjay Paswan admits that Lalu was, is and will remain a popular mass leader. Asked whether he is capable enough to play an active role in uniting the opposition camps against the NDA at the Centre, Paswan had doubts. “I wish Laluji good health and a long life, but he is unable to play an active political role due to poor health and age. I listened to his speech on the RJD’s 25th foundation day. He has lost that synergy and energy. Though Laluji may play backroom politics and coordinate the opposition forces, he cannot pose any challenge to PM Narendra Modi,” Paswan told TOI. RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwary said people’s enthusiasm to listen to Lalu proves that he is still very popular among the masses. “As far as his role in national politics is concerned, Lalu joined it by raising the issues and clarifying the party’s stand. Every political party will take its stand after the UP assembly election. Saying anything at this stage will be premature,” he said. JD(U), the BJP ally, believes that the entire politics of Lalu revolves around his sons. “Lalu is busy trying to establish his son Tejashwi politically. He has no other role than managing the family contradictions. That’s why, on Monday, he talked about his two sons and himself. He can be a leader of certain social equations, but Lalu is certainly not a popular leader anymore,” JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said. Congress MLA from Kadwa, Shakeel Ahmad Khan, however, does not see any role for Lalu in the coordination of anti-NDA parties. “RJD is certainly a big party in Bihar, but at the Centre, only a national party can coordinate and strategize against the BJP and the NDA. Our leader Sonia Gandhi has already been in touch with the other parties through virtual meetings with their leaders and the efforts being made by the Congress should reach a culmination,” he said. Only time will tell whether Lalu can be instrumental in cobbling a pan-India, anti-BJP front before the 2024 polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lalu-may-still-be-popular-in-bihar-but-has-limited-role-in-national-politics/articleshow/84184733.cms||Jai Narain Pandey

While on his way to office, Yadav noticed the ragpicker, identified as Routhu Nagaraju, collecting plastic bottles from drains and asked officials to track him. Officials found that Nagaraju was living in a thatched house in Sugali colony with six children. Collection of plastic waste from drains was his only source of income. Nagaraju told officials his family doesn’t have a rice card as he didn’t have a Aadhaar card. After coming to know about his plight, Yadav asked joint collector (welfare and Asara) Sridhar Reddy to immediately take steps to provide Aadhaar and ration card to Nagaraju’s family. The poor family were enrolled for their Aadhaar cards, while the tehsildar got their rice cards sanctioned. The ward secretariat also took his family’s details for a house site and house under ‘Housing for All’ scheme. Yadav himself handed over the rice card to Nagaraju and his wife Bhavani in his chamber on Wednesday. He also directed officials to admit their children at an anganwadi centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/good-samaritan-guntur-collector-helps-ragpicker-family-get-rice-card-house-site/articleshow/84181410.cms||Samdani MN

As per the plan, first term exam will be objective and it will be held in November and December. The second term (subjective) will be held in March-April next year. The final marks will be given on the basis of performance in both the exams, which will carry equal weightage. Besides, there will be no overlapping of syllabus. Abha Choudhary, a chemistry teacher at Notre Dame Academy, hailed the decision and said, “In the present situation, dividing the board exams into two parts is the best solution. It will also reduce the burden on students and teachers. We are awaiting more information from the board to know the distribution of syllabus for objective and subjective exams.” Balram Kumar Singh, a teacher of DAV Public School-BSEB Colony, said the CBSE is reverting to continuous and comprehensive evaluation (CCE) pattern, which was earlier scrapped. “I believe that assessment is always better than test for the overall development of children. The plan will surely encourage children to study throughout the year,” he said. Aparna Singh, a Class XII student, said the CBSE has given the option in first term that if the schools remain shut, exams will be held through online mode. “The duration of classroom exams has also reduced from three hours to 2 hours for subjective and 90 minutes for objective,” she said. Nikhil Ranjan, a Class X student, said the new pattern would definitely ensure a more reliable result and test the students’ competency. A teacher at Litera Valley School, Aditya Pathak, said for teachers, the new pattern may not be an issue, but some children may find it difficult to adapt to the two-term exams as it will be something different. Donald Lawrence, a mathematics teacher at St Michael’s High School, was not satisfied with the new pattern. “I don’t think it is the wise decision. What will be the pattern and format of two term exams they have not been revealed yet. Kids will find it difficult as it will be a completely new pattern for them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cbses-new-exam-pattern-generates-mixed-response/articleshow/84183429.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Will move court if Pashupati Kumar Paras is made Union minister from LJP quota: Chirag Paswan||PATNA: Chirag Paswan lost his father eight months ago and has been ‘betrayed’ by his uncle recently. The 38-year-old Jamui MP and the apparent heir to the legacy of Dalit icon late Ram Vilas Paswan is fighting for his party as well as his own political existence. A day after embarking on ‘ashirvad yatra’, Chirag tells TOI’s Piyush Tripathi that he will move court against the ‘Goliath’ BJP and till recently his ‘Ram’, PM Narendra Modi, if the saffron party-led NDA government inducts his estranged uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras in the Union cabinet from LJP quota. Excerpts:Your uncle has gone to Delhi amid speculations that he may be inducted in the Union cabinet. What do you say?If he (Paras) is inducted in the Union cabinet, then it will become crystal clear that all, including BJP, were involved in this conspiracy against me.  It will be proved that they all conspired to lure him to not only break my party but my family as well. And today when he has successfully executed the conspiracy, then you are making him a minister. What will you do if Paras is made a minister at the Centre?I would like to make it clear that he can be inducted as an independent MP or JD(U) may send him from its quota, but it can’t be from LJP quota. He and four other MPs with him have been removed from LJP by the party’s national executive. If the NDA government inducts him from LJP quota, then I will move court against the NDA government. You mean against BJP and your own ‘Ram’ whom you have you been staunchly supporting till now? I have showed true loyalty to the BJP but if things have come to such a pass, then I’m left with no option. Now that my own people have backstabbed me, I have no expectation left from anyone else. I have already written a letter to PM Modi today that if Paras is inducted in the cabinet from LJP quota, we will oppose it. What do you have to say about people in JD(U) likely to be inducted in the Union cabinet? Though it doesn’t concern me, but I would only say that people in JD(U) have very high ambitions. And as soon as the JD(U) joins the Union cabinet, the party will break as they are not going to get the desired number of berths and those left out will be miffed. Besides, it is also a fact that JD(U) is pitching more for inclusion of Paras chacha in the cabinet. What benefits do you see from your yatra?I don’t see any benefits as such. This yatra is something personal for me as I am reaching out to people of Bihar to seek blessings after having been betrayed by my family members. I am left with no one else than people of Bihar. Was this betrayal spontaneous or brewing for long?Paras chacha was never as cordial and affectionate as my father was to him and the entire family. In fact, he reputedly used to blackmail my father for his ambitions and demands, like a berth in Union ministry. And it is quite evident now with the fact that he has sided with CM Nitish Kumar, who always had complete disregard for my father and our party. You have been mostly against Nitish, while your father was regarded more as a ‘team player’. Your take on this?It wasn’t my decision or me getting impulsive. My father actually provoked me and forced to go against Nitish Ji. Papa told me that Nitish ‘horsetraded’ our 29 MLAs after the first assembly elections of 2005, in which LJP had gone solo in the state. Recently as well, Nitish ji has taken our MLA and MLC. RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has repeatedly invited you to join hands. Will you join him?I thank Tejashwi for his proposals and paying respect to my father. However, I am not at all thinking about any alliance as of now. My complete focus is on the ‘ashirvad yatra’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/will-move-court-if-paras-is-made-union-minister-from-ljp-quota/articleshow/84183498.cms||Piyush Tripathi

While Ant Group continues to have a representative on board, the employee is a US national based in Florida. According to filings with the registrar of companies, Jing Xiandong of Alipay and Guoming Cheng of Ant Financial, both Chinese nationals, have ceased to be directors of the company. Additionally, Micheal Yuen Jen Yao, a US national, and Ting Hong Kenny Ho, a Chinese national of Alibaba based in Hong Kong, also ceased to be directors. The new entrants to the board include Douglas Feagin, a senior vice-president of Ant Group and a US national. Feagin was a former banker at Goldman Sachs. The other two appointees are Ashit Lilani and Vikas Agnihotri. Lilani represents Saama Capital, and Agnihotri is from SoftBank. The changes in the board composition come ahead of the company’s proposed $2.3-billion IPO, which values it at $24-25 billion. The public offering will be a combination of sales by existing investors and primary issue of shares. Ant Group is a significant shareholder in One97 Communications (Paytm’s parent company) with a stake of around 30%. The IPO is expected to bring down its shareholding to below 25%. Last year, the government restricted Chinese investment in Indian companies through Press Note 3. This was done due to fears that Chinese investors would take advantage of the volatility arising out of the pandemic and hike stakes in domestic firms. Given that the IPO will be the largest in the country, the company will have to attract deep-pocketed investors. These will include domestic institutions in addition to foreign investors. The dilution by strategic investors and broad-basing the board of directors is seen as an attempt to assuage those who might have concerns over investing in a company where China’s Ant Group had claimed to have significant influence. The changes were considered in a recent board meeting. The directors also approved the allotment of 5.4 lakh equity shares (post-split of Re-1 face value) to employees and some ex-employees upon exercise of employee stock options by them. According to the company filing, it has 39 subsidiaries including Paytm Entertainment, Paytm Money and Paytm Financial Services. The company has registered subsidiaries with Paytm brand in many countries. Paytm Payments Bank is not a subsidiary of One97 Communications, which holds only 39% in the bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/paytm-ipo-chinese-nationals-exit-board/articleshow/84187006.cms||Mayur Shetty

This gap demonstrates the tremendous amount of work that is required to advance women in India. Inclusion and diversity are at risk of falling further due to the crisis caused by the pandemic, but remain critical for business recovery, resilience and reimagination. This reality has forced many organisations to elevate their discourse about gender equality — a discourse that must continue despite the relative success India has had diversifying its corporate boardrooms within Asia. Within executive and non-executive roles in corporate boardrooms in India, women today occupy 5% of executive chairs and 10% of non-executive chairs — nearly double similar numbers across Asia. Female representation at the highest levels of corporate governance in India has increased in the past decade. However, the increase has not helped to position female leadership in a pragmatic way. Indian regulatory framework demands corporates have at least one female director, but their presence is rarely significant. With only 11% of committee chairs in India currently held by women, compared to 27.3% globally, it’s clear we have a long way to go. India needs to support diversity and inclusion further, and increasing the number of women on a company’s board is critical to this goal. Currently, the average board has 11 members, only two of whom are women. Opening additional seats for women at the board and company level will create a culture that is more supportive of female leadership, in turn creating more opportunities for women to chair the board in the future. A 2019 DDI (Development Dimensions International) India report suggests the gender gap in the country widens as women ascend the corporate structure with 40% seeking first-time leadership opportunities at the individual contributor level. This decelerates to 34% at frontline leader level, and eventually drops drastically to only 12% at C-suite candidates’ level. Countries like Japan have done extremely well in bringing gender diversity to the core. Six years after then Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government-led push for ‘womenomics’, Japan has witnessed a substantial increase in its female labour force. We need to get proactive in ensuring that women have equal representation across all levels of the economic, business, political and social spectrum, and this representation must extend beyond the tick in the box to fulfil legal compliances. While encouraging and motivating more women to take up leadership positions in companies across industries is important, gender diversity is not solely a corporate issue. We should strive for women to have greater participation in all venues where important decisions are made — in Parliaments, legislatures, ministries, boardrooms, and on the boards of global organisations. As former US First Lady Michelle Obama put it succinctly, “No country can ever truly flourish if it stifles the potential of its women and deprives itself of the contributions of half its citizens.” Indeed, the world has much to gain from reducing gender inequality, promoting women’s education and employment, and giving them equal opportunities and leadership roles in every aspect of their lives. While India has prioritised women’s rights and is working assiduously towards reducing gender gaps — in boardrooms, cockpits, legislatures and classrooms — we still have many miles to go.

The outbreak of the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic has led to a series of new reasons towards short-term and small loans such as medical emergency expenses, purchase of new or top up existing health insurance policies, enrollment of upskilling courses, rental deposits, etc. Kunal Varma, co-founder of FREO said loan requirements of people have changed. For example, there are no takers for a travel related loan while loans for medical emergencies are rising. “We have massive uptake in small loans with a 30% increase in the past six months and saw much larger growth in the last one year,” he said. Its average ticket size for short term personal loan products stand at Rs 25,000, and at less than Rs 5,000 for buy now and pay later product. These loans are under severe scrutiny as further sweat in the system can increase defaults. Varma added that people are more comfortable to spend on lower value transactions, especially after extended lockdowns during the second Covid wave. Akshay Mehrotra, co-founder & CEO of EarlySalary, says, “We have recorded a good demand in the second Covid wave, as monthly disbursement of loans return back to the pre-Covid levels of Rs 130 crore. Demand for new loans are equal in both metro and non-metro cities, as financial strain is felt across cities.” With the change in demand and consumer risk profile the rates have become more dynamic in nature rather than fixed in nature Yogi Sadana, CEO of Mumbai-based fintech CASHe, which offers instant loans online up to Rs 4 lakh for working professionals with tenure up to 18 months, says there has been dynamism in how the interest rate charged on loans. The ROI dynamically changes from as low as 0% on BNPL loans to 2.75% pm depending on the product and risk profile of the borrower. Peer to peer lending platform LendenClub, which offers instant short term cash loans for salaried individuals ranging between Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000 and offered for a tenure of 1-3 months, says demand for small loan up 2x since March, 2021. A report by Google and TransUnion CIBIL pointed out that more than 60% of all personal loan originations were less than Rs 25,000 in ticket size in Q42020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/small-ticket-loans-record-2x-7x-rise-in-march-may-on-high-millennial-demand/articleshow/84185586.cms||Mamtha Asokan

The chief minister told district collectors and SPs about his intention and asked them to be prepared. The chief minister held a video conference with district collectors and SPs on the grievance redressal programme, Spandana, from his Tadepalli camp office on Tuesday. He wanted district collectors to visit the village and ward secretariats at regular intervals to monitor the work and inspire the staff. He also told the collectors to have regular meetings of the advisory committees at Rythu Bharosa Kendras across the state. He wanted the committee meetings held on the first Friday of every month at the RBK-level, on the second Friday at the mandal-level and the third Friday at the district-level. He also told joint collectors, municipal commissioners and ITDA project officers to visit four village and ward secretariats per week. He wanted them to keep a check on the functioning of employees and delivery of services to the people. The chief minister also told them to organise farmers’ day across the state on July 8, the birth anniversary of late chief minister Y S Rajasekhara Reddy. He said the government will organise YSR Rythu Bharosa Chaitanya Yatra across the state from July 9 to 23. The chief minister said the government would be delegating another 200 services through village secretariats. With this, village secretariats would be offering 740 services. He wanted collectors to ensure that the list of services are displayed at all village and ward secretariats. The chief minister said every crop should be registered on the e-crop portal, even if farmers fail to report the crop. He also told officials to help farmers at the marketing stage and ensure they are paid a remunerative price.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cm-to-visit-village-sectts-twice-a-week/articleshow/84181526.cms||Gopi Dara

Besides, the teachers are likely to be overstressed due to the increase in number of classes, academics say. Sharing their experience of managing classes with 50% attendance of students during the first two-and-a-half-months of the current year when the educational institutions had reopened after a lapse of about 10 months, some heads of institutions said each class was divided into two halves with odd and even roll numbers and teachers were supposed to teach them the same topic for two days in continuation. “Unfortunately, this system could not continue for long owing to the sudden appearance of the third wave,” they said. Principal of J D Women’s College, Shyama Roy, said it is very difficult to organise the classes regularly if they are divided into two halves. “There is only one teacher in economics and she has to engage all the classes right from Intermediate to postgraduate level. If the number of classes is doubled, how would she manage to hold all the classes. Most science departments in the college are having just one or two teachers to engage the classes,” she said. Roy added it is difficult to maintain Covid safety protocols on the campus even with 50% student attendance. “There are 7,000 students on roll and even if 3,500 girls are allowed to come to the college on a single day, it would be a herculean task to make them follow social distancing both inside or outside the classrooms,” she said. B N College principal Raj Kishore Prasad said the time is not yet ripe for starting offline classes even for senior students. “Coming in closer contact in classrooms will only enhance the risk of the spread of Covid infections which have been controlled after great efforts of the administration. The third wave may hit the state any time,” he said. Prasad said by increasing the number of classes in vocational courses, the college would be spending more money on the conduct of classes and this would ultimately cause additional financial burden on students. Patna University political science department head Shefali Roy, however, asserts that for the time being the department would not face much difficulty in managing classes with 50% attendance as only second semester PG students are supposed to attend their classes. “Fourth semester students are awaiting their final examinations. The only difficulty faced by teachers is that they have to be repetitive in teaching the same thing twice,” she added. Patna Science College principal S R Padmadeo said it would be better if theory classes are allowed to be held in an online mode for some time more for ensuring timely completion of courses. “Practical classes in science subjects may be arranged in batches in offline mode,” he added. St Michael’s School teacher Rahul Kumar Prasad said though students get utmost satisfaction in face-to-face, interactive classes, teachers would have to work overtime in completing the courses if the number of classes is increased. “Engaging classes with 50% attendance means doubling the number of classes and, naturally, teachers do not get sufficient time to cover the entire syllabus. If the CBSE and other boards reduce the course content of Class XII, there would be no difficulty in holding classes||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/more-classes-to-overstress-teachers-experts/articleshow/84182969.cms||B K Mishra

Nitish parried questions on the number of berths the JD(U) will get in the new cabinet and denied any knowledge about the formula adopted for the cabinet expansion. “Pradhanmantri ji jo chahenge wahi hoga aur wo behtar karenge. (It all depends on the PM’s wishes and he will do better),” Nitish told the mediapersons at the airport after returning from an aerial survey of the flood-hit districts in north Bihar. “It is the PM’s prerogative and I am not aware of any development on the issue,” he added. Nitish clarified that he was more focused on the functioning of the state government. “The organisation is being looked after by RCP Singh,” he said. In the meantime, JD(U) national president RCP Singh reached Delhi and said, “Thoda intajar aur kijiye. Sab kuchh clear ho jayega (Have patience. Everything will be clear).” He, however, asserted that there was no confusion on the JD(U) being part of the Union government. He also refused to disclose the names of party MPs to be sworn in as Union ministers. In the evening, he went for PCR test against Covid, which indicated that he was the top runner among the probables for a ministerial berth from his party. Apart from RCP, several names from JD(U) were also doing the rounds, like that of Rajiv Ranjan Singh Lallan and Santosh Kushwaha, MPs from Munger and Purnia, respectively. Sources said though JD(U) was exerting pressure on the BJP leadership for four berths depending on the proportionate sharing of seats, but would have to be contended with not more than three berths. The JD(U) has 16 Lok Sabha and five Rajya Sabha members. Pashupati Kumar Paras, the newly elected LJP parliamentary party leader, may also find a berth in the council of ministers. In addition, Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Modi may also be included in the cabinet from the state’s BJP quota.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-set-to-join-union-cabinet-rcp/articleshow/84183383.cms||Ramashankar

The issue was scaled up after big investors Blackrock and Fidelity stepped in. As a result, the total mop-up has now crossed $600 million and the valuation of Pine Labs has hit $3.5 billion. Half of the $600 million raised is understood to be primary issuance. The company has hinted at a potential acquisition and has said that it will bring to India an app from Singapore-based loyalty cashback startup Fave, which it acquired for $45 million in April. In India, the app will also allow users to make Unified Payments Interface (UPI) payments, for which it is awaiting approval. Unlike many fintechs in India, Pine Labs is profitable in ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) terms due to its strong legacy business of card swipe machines, which are now used by merchants for selling goods on equated monthly instalments. The company is now making an ambitious play in the digital space. Last month, the company raised Rs 285 crore through a combination of fresh issuance of shares and secondary sales by investors. At that time, Baron Capital, Duro Capital, Marshall Wace, Moore Strategic Ventures and Ward Ferry Management were the investors. Ishana, Tree Line, a fund advised by Neuberger Berman Investment Advisers, joined Blackrock and Fidelity. IIFL AMC, via its ‘late-stage tech fund’, and Kotak have also participated in the second round.Hinting at a possible acquisition, Pine Labs CEO B Amrish Rau said that the firm is an ebitda-positive company — the only thing it would have to be to raise money, “if for a potential acquisition”. He said, “Last two times we have done it, we followed it up with an acquisition.” Recent months have seen a spate of startups acquiring established businesses. According to Rau, Pine Labs does not face any pressure of creating revenue lines. “The way we see it is, ‘What is important for Pine Labs’s growth?’ rather than ‘How do we monetise?’,” he said. Rau sees enough headroom to grow 60% annually for the next few years. The growth is being driven by big-box stores expanding nationally, large retailers moving to home delivery and the growing demand for credit. Pine Labs is breaking into new areas by incorporating QR codes into card swipe machines and it has enabled $1 billion worth of payments on its digital QR product. Another high-growth business is the prepaid gift card, which it got into after acquiring Qwikcilver for $110 million in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pine-labs-ends-600mn-round-eyes-acquisitions/articleshow/84186257.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Pune||In June, private hospitals gave more jabs than public hubs||PUNE: More people were vaccinated at private hospital sites than government centres in June. Data shows private hospitals vaccinated nearly 9.84 lakh citizens last month. Around 7.12 lakh citizens got their jabs at civic sites. Officials said the numbers also indicated preference. A more orderly vaccination process, less waiting time and effective crowd management may have worked in the favour of private sites, officials said. Most of the beneficiaries who preferred private sites were from the 18-44 age group. Snehal Porwal, founder of the Healing Hands clinic, attributed the gap in response to demand and supply. “Low supply of vaccines in May had already resulted in increased demand. Once private hospitals came into the picture, and availability of vaccines improved, beneficiary turnouts rose,” she said. Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said they are vaccinating at least 3,000 people daily. Aarti Irani, Jehangir Hospital’s public relations officer, said they have covered over 61,000 citisens since drives resumed in the third week of May. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the IMA’s Hospital Board of India, said, “Unavailability of doses at government sites eventually helped units offering paid shots. Response from firms and housing societies also led to good pace.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/in-june-pvt-hospitals-gave-more-jabs-than-public-hubs/articleshow/84186896.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Cops seized 101 bottles of liquor hidden inside the water container as well as under a heap of fodder and filed a complaint of prohibition violation against brothers Dinesh Thakor, Ambaram Thakor and Ravi Thakor. The complaint filed by LCB assistant sub-inspector Dilipsinh Baldev with the Chiloda police station on Sunday states that 101 bottles of IMFL worth Rs 35,000 were seized from the stable. As per case details, Dinesh Thakor consulted a veterinary doctor in Kunjad village after two of his buffaloes and a calf fell sick. “The animals had stopped eating and were frothing at the mouth. Their behaviour was not normal,” states the complaint. Next day, the buffaloes began jumping uncontrollably even as they continued to froth at their mouths. The Thakor brothers consulted another veterinary doctor. “The doctor paid a site visit and asked about a weird smell emanating from the water in the trough. He also quizzed about the yellowish colour of water in the container. The Thakor brothers told him that some branches had fallen in the trough, causing discolouration,” states the complaint. The veterinary doctor prescribed medication and left, but suspected foul play involving liquor. He tipped off the LCB team, which raided the premises to find broken bottles of alcohol in the trough as well as 101 bottles of whiskey, vodka and other liquor. “The animals probably drank the water laced with liquor from the damaged liquor bottles. The bovines reportedly recovered from the symptoms by Sunday," cops said.  Meanwhile, PSI of Chiloda police station N G Parmar has begun investigating the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/drunk-buffaloes-blow-cover-off-liquor-stashed-in-gnagar-stable/articleshow/84185445.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||Business||Nium buys Wirecard’s India forex dealership co||Mumbai: In yet another case of a fintech startup acquiring an established brick-and-mortar business, remittance platform Nium (formerly InstaRem) has acquired Wirecard Forex India — an RBI-licensed category II authorised foreign exchange dealer with 23 branches across eight cities. With this licence, Nium can directly engage in a variety of payment services activities across the subcontinent, including currency conversion, money transfer and prepaid card issuance. According to Nium co-founder & CEO Prajit Nanu, digital payments have got a big boost during the pandemic and companies are modernising their digital infrastructure to capitalise on the post-Covid economic recovery. Wirecard, a global electronic payments company, had acquired Star Global Currency Exchange some years ago. The Munich-headquartered parent went into insolvency following a financial scandal in 2018, resulting in the company’s global businesses being sold. According to Nium, it is one of the several global players to have recognised the residual value of Wirecard. “More companies are turning to our global payments stack to embed financial services quickly. This acquisition broadens our licensing portfolio, extends the suite of digital payments services we can offer in India, and provides us with a physical footprint to provide more support in metro areas,” said Nanu. He added that while Wirecard had acquired the company in India, it had not taken it to its full potential. Nium expects India’s prepaid card market to boom at a compounded annual growth rate of 40.5% between 2021 and 2026. Driving this growth is an expected increase in adoption by businesses looking for fast and easy payments processing, payments flexibility and elimination of delays related to reimbursements. And, as consumer spending returns after Covid, gift cards, meal cards, travel cards, and payday cards will become increasingly popular with businesses and consumers. Post-acquisition, all of the 190 employees of Wirecard India will join Nium. This acquisition is Nium’s second in just over a month after it acquired UK travel payments firm Ixaris. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021, subject to RBI’s approval.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nium-buys-wirecards-india-forex-dealership-co/articleshow/84187044.cms||Mayur Shetty

As many as 78.7% of students have been placed as of date compared to 70.62% placements in 2019-20. Some of the reputed recruiters include L&T, Deloitte, Accenture, TCS, Infosys, ADP, Cognizant and Modak Analytics, among others. While the average annual package bagged by the students is Rs 6.47 lakh, the highest package stood at Rs 16 lakh. Director, NIT Andhra Pradesh, Prof CSP Rao, said; “Placements provide an opportunity for the students to test their employability skills gained for current industry requirements. Further, this outcome allows them to better their confidence level and decision-making skills towards their professional career. NIT AP emphasises skill development through curriculum and promotes interdisciplinary studies and innovative projects among the student community.” Prof Rao added that the curriculum has been revised for the 2020-21 admitted batch based on the New Education Policy (NEP)-2020 and future industry needs, thereby enhancing the good relationship between academia and industry. Associate dean (training and placements), NIT Andhra Pradesh, Dr Karthikeya Sharma, said; “Due to the pandemic, companies started the recruitment process only when they had a project in hand. This was not the case in the previous years. Identifying this scenario, the training and placement cell reached out to more companies for hiring. During the pandemic, every company scaled down their recruitment numbers compared to previous years. But reaching out to more companies helped NIT Andhra Pradesh secure a good number of placements.” NIT-AP currently has 140 faculty members and 2,025 students, of whom 1,868 are undergraduate students, 54 are postgraduate students and 103 are PhD research scholars.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/nit-ap-sees-increase-in-campus-placements/articleshow/84181582.cms||---

Prasad is charged with raping a minor girl at his official quarter in Gaya during Dussehra in 2017. Prasad was posted as an officer on special duty with Central Selection Board of Constable in Patna at the time of his suspension on June 15 this year. The state police headquarters had recommended Prasad’s suspension on June 4 after an FIR was registered against him with Women’s police station in Gaya on May 27 on the basis of a complaint lodged by the girl’s brother. CID ADG (weaker section) Anil Kishore Yadav on Tuesday said the DSP was evading arrest and Patna and Gaya police were looking for him. “We will soon move court seeking arrest warrant against Prasad. The legal procedure for property attachment will be started after court’s nod,” he added. A senior police officer privy to the investigation said, “Prasad’s present location is unknown. Police are trying to know Prasad’s whereabouts and arrest him,” he said, adding two police teams have already been formed in Patna and Gaya to arrest Prasad. “The Patna police team comprises three inspectors, including one from the technical cell. Gaya police team, on the other hand, has an inspector, two sub-inspectors and an officer from technical cell for surveillance,” the officer said, adding a CID inspector is coordinating with both teams.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: For last of Covid patients, the 2nd wave still persists||AHMEDABAD: Even as the city breathes easy with the second wave of Covid-19 ebbing, the fight for life continues for the 65-year old man who is on ventilator support at Bopal ICU. He is the only one Covid-19 patient on ventilator in Ahmedabad as on Tuesday. “The patient has been hospitalized for the past 35 days and on ventilator support due to Covid complications,” said Dr Niket Shah of Bopal ICU. In another private hospital, two patients on the ventilator in Covid ward got discharged late on Monday evening. They have been put on oyygen support to recover further from the viral illness. In all, the city has three patients on Tuesday morning – two others on oxygen supply. In Civil Hospital, the number of Covid patients under treatment was 23 – the lowest ever. Majority have been battling for life for more than 15-20 days. Just two months back, the biggest Covid hospital in the city had long queues outside. Dr Anish Chandarana, vice-president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that his hospital had two of the last three Covid patients on ventilators. “One patient had a hospitalization period of 20 days. In his late fifties with comorbidities, his lungs were badly affected and thus he needed ventilatory care. He was discharged on one liter oxygen to recuperate from home,” Dr Chandarana said. “The other patient in sixties had an erratic pulse rate as one of the effects of Covid and he needed respiratory support for about 13 days. He also got stable and got discharged.” The last of Covid patients battling the viral disease in government and private hospitals have been there for more than a fortnight. They have the impact of Covid that needs hospitalization and care – a phenomenon identified as ‘Long Covid.’ Dr Kartikeya Parmar, in-charge of the Covid Hospital at Civil Hospital, said that out of the 23 patients with the hospital, 95% are there for over 15-20 days. “Majority are middle-aged men with comorbidities whose lungs were severely impacted by the infection and need long-term respiratory support,” he said. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of AHNA, said that now it’s in the hands of the citizens to decide the course of the pandemic. “We must not invite the third wave by our reckless behaviour – we have seen the worst of the pandemic, and we don’t want to revisit the phase,” he said. “I would request the government to now start contact tracing of all new cases and genomic sequencing to give us some early warning.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/for-last-of-covid-patients-the-2nd-wave-still-persists/articleshow/84185449.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Ahmedabad||Green leap: Gujarat set for 3-fold RE surge||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat is making rapid strides into the renewable energy (RE) sector with a slew of mega green energy projects. These projects relate not just to electricity generation but also to equipment manufacturing. Backed by policy initiatives and strong investor support, Gujarat’s renewable power generation capacity is expected to jump to 38,466MW by 2025 and 61,466MW by 2030, according to the state government’s estimates. At present, the state’s total installed power generation capacity from renewable energy sources — solar, wind, hydel, biomass and bagasse — is about 13,152MW. “In the next 3-5 years, Gujarat will certainly be a global hub for the renewable energy sector. Our installed capacity to generate power from renewable energy sources is expected to surge to over 38,000MW by 2025 and over 61,000MW by 2030,” said Mamta Verma, principal secretary, energy and petrochemicals department, Gujarat government. “These estimates are based on project plans that have already been finalized. The estimates are likely to be revised soon given the influx of fresh proposals.”  Verma went on to say: “With the state and central government’s policies and positive approach, Gujarat’s dependency on non-renewable energy will be negligible or zero in the coming years.” To boost electricity generation from renewable energy sources, several mega projects are being implemented across the state. In December 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for a 30,000MW hybrid (solar and wind) renewable energy park in Kutch, billed as the world’s largest of its kind. Spread across 72,600 hectares, the park is being set up near the Indo-Pak border, around 90km from Khavda. It is estimated that the project will attract an investment of Rs 1.5 lakh crore. Recently, the state-run Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd (GUVNL) affiliated four power distribution companies signed power purchase agreements (PPAs) for 3,979 small scale-solar power projects (0.5-4MW) with the cumulative generation capacity of 2,500MW. These projects are expected to be commissioned in the next 18 months and they will bring in investments worth Rs 10,000 crore in green energy and allied sectors. The state has already been working on developing solar energy parks at Dholera near Ahmedabad, and at Raghanesda and Harshad in Banaskantha. A slew of other solar and wind power projects are being set up in the state, which were auctioned by Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI). Gujarat is the top state in solar rooftop installations. The state’s renewable energy sector received a shot in the arm last month when Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) announced that the company has started developing the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex on 5,000 acres in Jamnagar. This will have four giga factories to manufacture solar photovoltaic modules, energy storage batteries, fuel cells and electrolyser. RIL will invest Rs 60,000 crore in these initiatives over the next three years. The company will invest another Rs 15,000 crore to provide infrastructure and utilities to manufacture ancillary material and equipment needed to support these giga factories. Reliance will establish and enable at least 100GW of solar energy in India by 2030. “With the announcement of mega renewable energy projects over the past couple of years, Gujarat is now poised to become a hub for renewable energy power generation and equipment manufacturing as well,” said Kunj Shah, chairman, renewable energy committee, Assocham Gujarat Council. “Given the size and scale of the projects in the renewable energy space, the state has the potential to become a global hub for renewable energy generation and equipment manufacturing.” Gujarat’s average power demand hovers around 16,500MW and approximately one-third of it is met through renewable power. The state’s average power demand is estimated to rise to 28,500MW by 2030. By then, the state’s installed RE power generation capacity would be more than double the average power requirement. Gujarat is also fast emerging as a hub of solar and RE equipment manufacturing with RIL being the latest entrant. Adani Solar, India’s largest integrated solar cell and module manufacturer, already operates solar PV cells and modules manufacturing facility at Mundra with a capacity of 1.5GW. The plan is to scale it up to 3.5GW. Adani Group already operates solar and wind power projects with a cumulative capacity of 925MW in Kutch, while projects to the tune of 880MW are either under construction or in the pipeline in the district. Surat-based solar panel manufacturer Goldi Solar is also planning to raise its manufacturing capacity from 500MW to 2,500MW in a phased manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/green-leap-gujarat-set-for-3-fold-re-surge/articleshow/84186993.cms||Kapil Dave
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Anil Deshmukh’s PA instrumental in collecting cash from Sachin Waze, says ED||MUMBAI: The ED told the HC on Tuesday that a plea had been made before the special NIA court to record the statement of dismissed cop Sachin Waze to confront him with statements of Anil Deshmukh’s private secretary Sanjeev Palande and Deshmukh’s PA Kundan Shinde. The plea will be heard by the NIA court on Thursday. The ED had recorded Waze’s statement earlier too. Last week, while seeking the duo’s custody, the ED had submitted that Palande, in his statement, said Deshmukh had a role in transfer postings of police officers, specially those in the IPS. The agency added that investigations had revealed a meeting was held to discuss transfers of police and IPS officers and that an unofficial list of candidates was prepared. The ED investigation found over Rs 50 crore suspicious transactions in around two dozen companies associated with Deshmukh. It examined records of these companies and is trying to trace the source of the suspicious money. The ED had also alleged that Palande had coordinated with Waze, DCP Raju Bhujbal and ACP Sanjay Patil to collect money from ‘orchestra bar’ owners in Mumbai and hand it over to Shinde. It was further alleged that Waze had said he had collected Rs 4.7 crore between December 2020 and February 2021 (when the government relaxed lockdown conditions allowing bars to operate) and handed the money over to Shinde. “It is also apparent that Shinde is instrumental in collecting cash from Waze on behalf of Anil Deshmukh, then home minister of Maharashtra government, and assisted him in money laundering,” the remand plea said. Waze’s statements were confirmed by two police officers whose statements were recorded, the investigating agency said. The ED submitted that veracity of the statements of Waze and others is required to be established. Waze is currently lodged in Taloja jail for his alleged involvement in the planting of explosives in a Scorpio near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence at Carmichael Road and the subsequent murder of Scorpio owner Mansukh Hiran.  ED’s submissions were part of a plea submitted during the remand hearing of Palande and Shinde. The court sent the duo to judicial custody till July 20. They were arrested on June 25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-deshmukhs-pa-instrumental-in-collecting-cash-from-waze-says-ed/articleshow/84186958.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh pays homage to Stan Swamy||CHANDIGARH: Civil society members of Chandigarh, on Tuesday, staged a protest in Sector 17 over the death of rights activist Father Stan Swamy (84), in prison. Speakers termed his death a “merciless killing of a political prisoner.” Before his arrest, eight months ago, Swamy had said in a video how he was being falsely framed in the Bhima Koregaon case, said Amandeep of PSU (Lalkaar), a student group which participated in the protest. The protest was a small remembrance meeting. “Swamy also said he was paying the price for raising his voice for falsely imprisoned adivasis (tribals). He stood by his word and fought against injustice till his last breath,” said Amandeep. Amandeep said while they saluted the sacrifice and spirit of Swamy, they condemned government action against him and his incareceration without trial. “Like many others, Swami was repeatedly denied interim bail in spite of deteriorating health. He suffered from life-threatening diseases like Parkinson’s and was denied basic medical treatment,” Amandeep said. Prof Chaman Lal, a former dean (faculty of languages) of PU, equated Swamy's death in prison to the martyrdom of Jatin Das. “The government of India and the entire judicial system should be held accountable for such atrocities and violations of human rights and civil liberties using black laws like UAPA. We should unitedly fight to repeal such draconian laws and for the release of political prisoners,” he added. In the end, candles were lit in the memory of Swamy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-pays-homage-to-stan-swamy/articleshow/84184687.cms||---

Paediatric neurologist Dr Smilu Mohanlal who is treating the kid met the kid’s family members and explained the treatment modalities ahead. She said a single one-time infusion of the medicine Zolgensma was needed for the treatment. The kid was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy type 2 and 3 (SMA), a rare genetic disease that weakens the muscles and leads to walking difficulty, after early childhood.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Nana Patole alleges phone-tapping by previous government, home minister to order probe||MUMBAI: State home minister Dilip Walse Patil on Tuesday assured the legislative assembly a high-level probe would be conducted into the phone-tapping of leading MPs and MLAs by state agencies. He was speaking in response to a question raised by former speaker and state Congress president Nana Patole. Patole alleged that during the BJP’s rule between 2014 and 2019, phones of leading politicians were illegally tapped for political reasons. “I have convened a meeting of senior bureaucrats and IPS officers to seek more information on the complaints of phone-tapping. I have taken serious note of the entire episode,” Walse Patil said. He said that according to rules, it was necessary to secure permission from the competent authority for phone surveillance, and while seeking permission, the name of the person whose phone would be under surveillance had to be clearly stated, along with the purpose of surveillance. But from the statement of Patole, it appeared that no such procedure was followed, he said. Patole alleged, “In 2016-17, my cellphone as under surveillance, along with phones of several MPs and legislators. I found that while the number under surveillance was mine, it was given the name Amjad Khan. It was then stated that Khan was involved in drug smuggling. It was an attempt to create rift between two communities. It’s a serious matter. On whose instructions were the phones tapped? We must reach the mastermind of the conspiracy.” Patole also alleged that threats were being given to senior Congress and NCP leaders. “In the house itself, opposition members were shouting, ‘you will meet the fate of Anil Deshmukh and Chhagan Bhujbal.’ There appears to be a threat to the democratic process and to leading politicians,” he said. In the wake of complaints of phone-tapping, Anil Deshmukh had, during his tenure as home minister, set up a committee comprising the then joint commissioner (intelligence) Amitesh Kumar and additional chief secretary Shrikant Singh to conduct a probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-patole-alleges-phone-tapping-by-previous-government-home-minister-to-order-probe/articleshow/84189046.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The ICMR study indicated a 4.5-fold and 3.2-fold reduction in neutralising antibody levels against Delta in those who were given one and two doses of Covishield, respectively, compared to an earlier SARS-CoV-2 version that had the D614G mutation (detected early last year). Dr Samiran Panda, chief of the ICMR’s epidemiology and communicable diseases division, said, "These kinds of observations have the potential of informing immunization programmes, including the possible need for a third booster dose for vaccination against Covid-19." For the study, serum samples were collected from healthy individuals who had received one or two doses of Covishield. Samples were also collected from Covid-recovered patients who had received one or two doses. The fifth category of individuals whose samples were drawn were breakthrough cases — people who contracted Covid after vaccination. Dr Pragya Yadav, from National Institute of Virology and a member of the research team, said the study indicated that serum of Covid-recovered participants (given either one or two doses) and the breakthrough cases had higher neutralizing antibody titres compared to non-Covid participants who had received one or two shots of Covishield. Dr Panda said, "This indicates that neutralizing antibodies in the serum of individuals who had contracted Covid, in a way, worked like the first dose. A full vaccination schedule after that resulted in higher levels of neutralizing antibodies. Similarly, people who had received two doses of Covishield and contracted Covid after that (breakthrough infections), had higher levels of neutralizing antibodies." In both cases, Dr Panda said, the immune system was exposed to the viral antigen thrice, generating a greater immune response. "The ICMR study could then help support discussion on whether or not a third Covishield booster dose could be needed in future for some cases.” Dr Yadav said, “Another important aspect of the study was the finding that breakthrough cases have significantly less severity and mortality. Also, it showed that even one dose is sufficient for long-term protection in case of those who have recently recovered from Covid-19." She added that a majority of healthy individuals vaccinated with one or two doses of Covishield did show neutralizing antibodies, while only a small portion did not have any detectable antibodies. For the study, serum samples were collected four weeks post-vaccination for all categories of participants, except breakthrough cases. In case of the latter category (tested via RT-PCR), samples were collected two weeks after completing a two-dose schedule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/antibody-drop-against-delta-in-vaccinated-may-suggest-need-for-3rd-dose/articleshow/84186954.cms||Neha Madaan

The state transport undertakings (STUs) strengthened the fleet size in the city, but 1300 buses fell short of the high demand, leaving a large number of passengers stranded. As against the expectation of at least 500 private buses, less than 100 buses could hit the road. “It was easier said than done to start ferrying passengers. The mechanics found a full one-day work in most of the buses remaining parked for the last one and half months,” said Anurag Ghosh, a bus operator of south Kolkata route. “The buses which were parked on the road got weathered and often remained under waist deep water when roads got waterlogged. The tyres are worn out, engines got dysfunctional, brakes lost grips. All these make a recipe for disastrous accidents on the road. Motor vehicles must carry out mandatory CF tests before allowing them on the road,” said Prabir Basu, an automobile engineering expert. Majority of buses belonging to the members of the joint council of bus syndicates, biggest of the operators’ associations, were off the road. “We are convening a meeting on Wednesday to decide our next course of action,” said Tapan Banerjee. Rahul Chattopadhyay of Bengal Bus o Minibus Samannay Committee said, “We are expecting some buses to be on the road from Wednesday.” Commuting woes drove the railway passengers to block lines at Chengail in Howrah. In Kolkata, Citizens and Passengers Forum made an appeal to the chief minister for allowing metro service. In absence of the private buses and metro, the taxis and autos kept fleecing passengers. “It is very difficult to find an app-cab during the peak hours. I managed to get hold of a metered cab, after much bargaining, it settled for Rs 450 for a distance from New Alipore to Theatre Road, which normally does not exceed Rs 160,” Arun Kejriwal, an auctioneer. “From Nature Park to Garia, autos charged Rs 200 per passenger. As police don’t prosecute autos during peak hours, they have become daring,” Anita Shaw, a boutique owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/snags-due-to-long-disuse-force-pvt-buses-off-road/articleshow/84184735.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Sources said that senior officials and magistrates will be posted at key locations at and adjoining the venue to oversee the arrangements and ensure smooth conduct of the hearing. Details about parking arrangements and traffic plans were also finalised at the meeting. An inspection of the venue,the South Goa PDA ground, will be held on Wednesday to review the arrangements. As 500 participants have registered for the event through online mode, and a sizable number of people are expected to attend upon doing spot registrations, five counters will be set up at the venue to facilitate hassle-free admission of the participants. Those who have registered online will be required to collect tokens from a designated counter to get admission into the venue. South Goa police have also done elaborate arrangements to prevent any breach of law and order. Singh said that adequate police force drawn from across the district will be deployed at the venue. Considering the number of participants that are likely to turn up for the hearing, and with every participant allowed to make their submissions for 15 minutes, sources said that the preparations are made for the hearing to last for five days at a stretch. Sources in the district administration said that though they are prepared for the hearing to last for several days, it was unlikely to continue beyond two days as most of the participants – barring representatives of NGOs - are likely to conclude their submissions within even a couple of minutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/security-plans-logistics-in-place-for-czmp-meet/articleshow/84187159.cms||---

A bench of justice Mukta Gupta ordered that the file containing the report on the inquiry be placed before it on the next date of hearing. Jamia Millia Islamia student and riots accused Asif Iqbal Tanha had moved the high court last year, alleging misconduct by police officers in leaking his alleged disclosure statement in the main chargesheet, recorded by the probe agency during the investigation, to the media. Advocate Sowjhanya Shankaran, representing Tanha, told the court that while an additional affidavit on a subsequent leakage with respect to a supplementary chargesheet had been filed, response from the state was not on record. Special public prosecutor (SPP) Rajat Nair sought time of two more weeks from the court to file the report of an ongoing inquiry into the leaks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-riots-hc-gives-two-more-weeks-to-cops-to-complete-probe-into-chargesheet-leak/articleshow/84187035.cms||---

---||Kolkata||63% of tax on petrol goes to Centre, 37% to state||Kolkata: Taxes played a major role behind the spiralling fuel prices in Bengal. The price of petrol approached 100 in the city and crossed the three-digit mark in most of the districts while the price of diesel has also crossed the Rs 90 mark two weeks ago. There are both central and state taxes on petrol and diesel. The petrol price has touched Rs 99.84 in Kolkata. The central tax is Rs 32.90 (around 63% of total taxes on petrol in state) while the state tax is Rs 19.27. Similarly, the diesel price reached Rs 92.27 in the city. On this fuel the central tax is Rs 31.80 and the state tax Rs 13.08. The base price of petrol in the city as on July 6 was only Rs 44.20 while that of diesel was Rs 45.16. Apart from taxes and the base price, the rest of the price components include freight charges and dealers’ commission. Sources in oil companies said that in July 2019, the average price of petrol was Rs 72-75 and diesel was Rs 67-69 in the city. The central tax on petrol was Rs 20-21 while state tax was Rs 15-16. For diesel the central tax was Rs 15-16 and state tax was Rs 12-13. So, the central tax on petrol rose by almost Rs 11-12 in last two years while the state tax went up by Rs 5 during this period. For the almost Rs 24 hike in price from Rs 74-75 to Rs 99 plus, the rise in excise component accounts for almost 50% while state tax accounts for 20%. The state government had reduced the taxes on petrol and diesel by Rs 1 on February 22 for four months, which has already been renewed for another three months through a notification. Incidentally, there was a lump sum (fixed tax on quantity) tax of Rs 1 each in both petrol and diesel across the state along with sales tax of 17% and 25% on diesel and petrol. The sales tax of the state has not changed for the last five years. The lump sum tax was withdrawn first in 2018 by Mamata Banerjee government till March 2020. Now this reduction would be till September. The total demand for petrol in the state is around 1.2 lakh kilo litre (1 KL is 1000 LTR) per month while that of diesel is around 3 lakh KL. The total state revenue from taxes (sales tax) from petroleum products is around Rs 8,000 crore. The state finance minister had earlier alleged while announcing Rs 1 cut in state taxes that a major part of central taxes on petrol and diesel is cess, which is not shared with the states. Mitra had claimed earlier that for petrol Rs 20 is cess that is around 60% of central component while for diesel, the cess is Rs 22, almost 70% of central component.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/63-of-tax-on-petrol-goes-to-centre-37-to-state/articleshow/84184840.cms||---

We found this modality is very useful in treatment of veterinary patients,” said Dr P V Parikh, professor and head of Department of Surgery and Radiology at AAU’s veterinary college. The college received the magnetic instruments — PEMF-PET (for small pets like dogs and cats) and PEMF-TAME (for larger animals like horses, cows) as donation from the researchers who developed the devices at one-fifth cost of similar pulse electromagnetic field (PEMF) devices that are used in European countries. “Our research work was originally motivated by Padma Shri recipient Ramesh Baba of Barsana-based Maan Mandir Seva Sansthan Trust. The trust runs one of the largest ‘gau shalas’ in the country. His disciples had seen the use of PEMF on cattle abroad and had inquired of similar device back home,” said Jha, former director of a self-financed research centre and technical assistant at Sardar Patel University’s department of physics. Jha, who works as an independent R&D consultant now, started using technology at home, before switching over to animals. “NASA had developed this technology for astronauts to increase their sleep and bone density. Further, experiments on this drugless therapy has shown its positive impact on over 100 diseases,” said Jha. Explaining its functioning, Jha said that the device releases pulsing electromagnetic waves at precise frequencies, speeding the body’s recovery at a cellular level.“There is no pain, no pinching, no pressure. The electromagnetic waves directly impact blood cells. They break the bulging of blood cells due to which the oxygen intake capacity at cellular level increases,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/indigenous-physiotherapy-device-for-animals/articleshow/84182237.cms||Prashant Rupera

The grades obtained by students this year are higher than last year despite the pandemic.  DP and CP are equivalent to Class X to XII and 4,945 students in India emerged successful. Across the globe, results of 1,70,000 students were announced. The board allowed a dual route for students who could take the physical exam or be assessed by their teachers (non-exam route). Olli-Pekka Heinonen, IB director general, said in a statement, “We believe that the IB’s approach to the May 2021 examination—in which schools that could sit the exams did so—was the fairest possible solution. The non-exam route for allocating results to students who were unable to take exams was fair, clear and allowed for grades to be distributed that reflect their achievements and abilities.” More students (1,04,275) took the non-exam route than the exam route (65,576). A total of 809 were split between both.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ib-results-better-than-last-years-despite-pandemic/articleshow/84182210.cms||---

The ministry of environment, forest and climate change on Monday approved the proposal to convert the Ramgarh Vishdhari sanctuary into a tiger reserve. After giving nod, union minister Prakash Javadekar said: “Happy to sanction one more tiger sanctuary, Ramgarh Vishdhari Wildlife Sanctuary which will link Ranthambore Tiger Reserve in the Northeast and Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve on the southern side. Increasing numbers of tigers and other apex predators certify our robust biodiversity.” Earlier, the sanctuary received a nod from the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA)’s technical committee. A senior official said, “As all approvals are received the process to notify the tiger reserve will soon begin.” The tigers were believed to have disappeared from the sanctuary in 1999. After CM Ashok Gehlot announced to upgrade the forest into a reserve, the process was expedited. The total area of 1,017 sq. km that has been identified as the reserve area comprising two forest blocks of Bhilwara, territorial forest block of Bundi and Indargarh, which falls under buffer zone of Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (RTR). Prior to the formation of Rajasthan, these forests were a part of erstwhile Bundi princely states and were managed as hunting reserves. After Independence, these forests came under the control of Rajasthan government.  In 1982, a part of the forest was declared as Ramgarh Vishdhari Wildlife Sanctuary under Section 5 of the Rajasthan Wild Animals and Birds Protection Act, 1951. The core area of the Ramgarh Vishdhari has eight villages. The sanctuary has leopards, sambhars, chitals, wildboars, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ramgarh-gets-centre-nod-to-become-4th-big-cat-reserve-of-raj/articleshow/84187083.cms||---

This was in addition to the special prayers that Jesuit priests and Catholic churches in the city organised on Monday evening and Tuesday (morning and evening), remembering the contribution of the Jesuit priest. For nearly 60 years he fought for justice for those who couldn’t fight on their own. The Jesuit priests of St Xavier’s Collegiate School on Park Street organised a private prayer in the evening on Monday, hours after Father Stan’s death at the hospital was announced and again on Tuesday evening, after watching the funeral service. His picture was put up at the chapel and candles were lit up. Father Jeyaraj Veluswamy, the rector of St Xavier’s, said: “We have prayed to the Lord not only for the peace of his soul but for to give us many more Father Stans so that we continue to fight injustice.” He was joined in prayers by Father Dominic Savio, principal of St Xavier’s College and other resident Jesuit priests on campus. At St Xavier’s University at Rajarhat, a similar prayer was organised by Father Felix Raj. “May the Lord and Father Stan’s spirit guide us as we pick up the cudgels and continue to work on the path shown by him,” Father Felix said. The Provincial of the Jesuits of the city (Kolkata province), Father Raphael Joseph Hyde, did not hide his pain when he said that Father Stan was, “deliberately allowed to suffer in the last months of his dedicated life.” At the chapel of the Archbishop House, a special adoration (mass) was done by vicar general Dominic Gomes to pray for Father Stan. The Catholic Association of Bengal has written to all Christian church denominations to join in a special prayer dedicated to Father Stan after July 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-pays-homage-to-father-stan-raises-voice-against-injustice-to-him/articleshow/84184902.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

For me too, it was no different as it gave me the time to finally indulge in something I have always loved – learning different kinds of recipes and baking. Before the lockdown, my routine was set. I used to go to school and was busy all the time. The schedule included waking up in the morning, going to school, coming back from school, freshening up, completing homework and going to bed. Life was boring and monotonous as everyday was much the same. I was fed up with it. Then, all of a sudden, we were faced with an unexpected situation – lockdown. I initially thought it would last for a week or two. But then it got extended and I realised it would last much longer. Since it gave me ample time – something I had never expected before – that I thought that it was the best time for me to learn something I always dreamt of picking up – baking. I came to know about a woman who taught baking and it got me all excited. I told my parents about this and they readily accepted my request. So, I started attending the sessions and learned many cupcake recipes. After coming back home, I tried some of the recipes. The recipes turned out great and were beyond my expectations. My parents and family members were very happy. Especially my sister who ate almost 15 cupcakes! This lockdown, therefore, has been very helpful to me as it gave me the opportunity to learn something new.

Art & craft, gardening kept me busy By G Mohnish Reddy Soon after the lockdown was announced, I found myself irritated and bored most of the time. Because of Covid-19 schools, malls, playgrounds were all shut, and I was not allowed to even step out of the house or the balcony. Instead of spending the summer vacation enjoying in my ancestral home – which is usually the norm every year - I found myself locked in the house all through summer, with nothing to look forward to. I spent most of my time with my parents, younger sister and my elder cousins at home. Then, to beat my boredom, I started investing my leisure time in doing art and craft, reading many books and developed a keen interest in gardening. I also made an effort to improve my computer skills. But, of all of these, I loved spending most of my time on making art and craft. I collected waste paper, covers and some old card boards etc., which I used for my craft. I also borrowed a few old art sets and books, paints and crayons from my neighbour, who was my inspiration, as he had similar interest like me in craft. I created 21 pieces of artwork and 18 crafts, thus putting the waste around me to the best use. As the second wave hit, the government declared another lockdown with stricter restrictions. This time, we visited our hometown to meet my grandparents. I attended my online classes from my small village. I spent my leisure time talking to my grandparents and strolling through the fields, watering the plants and taking care of them. This time I was more interested in gardening than before. I learnt how to grow plants and take care of them and also started to learn more about plants, by researching about them. In all, it’s been a productive lockdown for me.

The forest staff, which saw the carcass, informed the senior staff members, who reached on the spot to take stock of the situation. The carcass was then taken out of water. A forest staff said, “An old tiger T-3 is also living in the same territory. Earlier, there were apprehensions that it could be the old tiger. But later we realised it was T-65.” The male tiger was born to tigress T-19. Though, the forest department did not ascertain the exact cause of death even after postmortem, it was claimed the big cat either died due to a cardiac arrest or snake bite as there were no injury marks on the body. Any kind of foul play was refuted by the forest department. A senior official said, “Samples have been sent to the Indian Vet Research Institute (IVRI), Izzatnagar. The carcass was cremated as per protocol.” As per official records, out of the 68 tigers left in the national park, 52 are adult big cats (30 tigresses and 21 tigers) in RTR-1, the highest in its history.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/carcass-of-10-year-old-tiger-found-in-rbore-waterhole/articleshow/84187102.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: ‘We are prepared to face any challenge during monsoon’, says mayor Vijayalaxmi Gadwal||Quote: Apart from preventing encroachments and protecting the FTL and buffer zones of water bodies, we have also taken up revival of many lakes as part of Mission Kakatiya. Example: The Ramakrishna Puram Lake, where the flow of sewage into the lake has been stopped by constructing an underground drainage system. Q. The 2020 monsoon was hell for residents living across the city – Uppal, Malkajgiri, Meerpet, Kapra, Vanasthalipuram, Mehdipatnam, Banjara Hills etc. What GHMC is doing to avoid inundation of colonies this time? -- from Multiple ReadersA. Our monsoon plan is ready and desilting work of all nalas and every culvert is being taken up. Emergency Monsoon Teams too have been allocated to each and every ward within the GHMC limits while roads, parks and walls damaged in the last year rains are being attended to and repaired. We have also kept our Disaster Management Team ready and geared up to meet any sort of challenges during the monsoon season. Q. What are you doing to protect lakes from encroachment and pollution? Majority of our lakes are shrinking. Do you have a plan to revive them? -- Soni SomarajanA. Protection of water bodies/lakes is a top priority. We conduct periodic inspections and inform the concerned revenue and irrigation wings about any encroachments that are noticed, if any. The GHMC lake preventive force is also in place to keep an eye on lakes and prevent encroachments, protect the FTL of the water bodies (where they have been fixed), the buffer zones etc. Beatification walls of lakes is also under progress in many areas, while revival of lakes has been undertaken as part of Mission Kakatiya, duly diverting sewage flow and desilting lakes. For instance, the Ramakrishna Puram Lake, Neredmet ward where the sewerage was flowing into nalas leading into the lake, causing pollution, is being systematically redressed by constructing an underground drainage system. The estimated cost of this project is about Rs 12 crore and aimed at preventing the entry of wastewater into the lake. Q. With Covid-19 in the air, there is a lot of dumping of used gloves and masks along city roads. Could this not be a health hazard? Is the civic body doing anything to address this? -- Lavanya CharkondaA. GHMC and its sanitation staff are regularly clearing out water from all roads. In this Covid-19 period, all used masks, gloves wherever found are being cleared safely so as not to create any health hazard. Further we are ensuring that all hospitals and nursing homes are linked to bio-medical waste facility management agencies so that they continuously clear all Covid-19 related waste from hospitals and nursing homes directly and in a safe manner. Q. Locals in many colonies are constructing speed breakers randomly in front of their houses that are not only affecting the flow of traffic but also blocking smooth passage of rainwater. This is leading to water stagnation and other ills. Is there no rule to stop this? -- Ajak KA. Certain colonies/slums have existing speed breakers largely due to need expressed by that area locals as vehicles passing through them were leading to accidents, especially involving children. We will look in to the issue of water stagnation that is being caused due to speed breakers and address it systematically. Action will also be initiated against all illegally constructed speed breakers. Q. Parking is a major problem in the city. Due to unavailability of space, we are forced to park on the road, where the traffic police penalize us. Also, despite government orders, many public places are still charging a parking fee. Is something being done to address these issues? -- Raja Sekhar MamillapalliA. The Directorate of EVDM, GHMC is taking all necessary steps for enforcement of parking policy as per guidelines issued through a government order of 2018. The order allows for imposing of penalties against violators and acts as a deterrent among defaulters. The central enforcement cell of Directorate of EVDM is entrusted with the task of enforcing this act and emphasising on citizen participation to address this issue, by enabling public to report violations of parking through social media apart from conventional system of reporting. Q. Many heritage rock formations in the outskirts of Hyderabad are being bulldozed to make way for upscale housing and commercial projects. Is there anything being done to save at least some of these rocks? -- Krithi PrakashA. There are certain rock formations that have been conserved and protected. Further, wherever there is a possibility of protecting and conserving rocks that are heritage, we are doing so. They are even being beautified. Q. Garbage collectors in my area, Nacharam, charge Rs 150 to Rs 200 per house to collect waste from the dumpster nearby. Is this allowed? Are they not GHMC employees? If it’s being done illegally, shouldn’t this be stopped? -- Bharath ThotapalliA. Garbage collectors are supposed to be taking Rs 60 per house to collect the waste and necessary instructions have been issued for strict compliance. Q. There is a 50-year-old neem tree in front of my house (in Vijaya Nagar Colony), which has started tilting towards the premises and poses a risk of damage during the rains. Is the GHMC looking at pruning/cutting branches before the monsoon picks up pace? How can I get my issue resolved? -- J Partha SaradhiA. All grievances received from the grievance cell GHMC, pertaining to such problems are being attended to regularly. Emergency cases which pose a threat and danger to the residents of the locality are being attended as top priority. If details are received regarding the tree in Vijayanagar Colony, necessary action will be taken immediately. Q. The entire Financial District lacks a proper drainage system. This is a serious issue since apart from housing societies, it also has a large populace of office spaces. Are there any plans afoot to strengthen the system here? -- D V GiridharA. As per Shah Consultants, a plan is developed to address the sewerage system in the Financial District. The plan has been prepared with an outlay of Rs 10.25 crore and it falls under the TSIIC. Q. Streetlights in many parts of the city – example: Jeedimetla village near Gandhi Statue -- are found to be dysfunctional. Is the civic department taking up repairs? -- Gunnala Srinivas RaoA. Complaints regarding streetlights are being attended to on a day-to-day basis and rectified immediately. In this particular instance, we have looked into the matter and rectified the problem. Q. Street vendors occupy the majority of the footpaths making them inaccessible to residents and forcing them to walk on the roads. Can something be done to address this issue. -- Sarath C M VeeravalliA. Our team, in coordination with the traffic police, is routinely attending to the issue. Encroachments of footpaths of important roads are being removed regularly for the benefit of pedestrians.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/we-are-prepared-to-face-any-challenge-during-monsoon/articleshow/84187152.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Use FASTag to pay for parking soon||NEW DELHI: To promote the use of FASTags at local parking lots in the city, New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) will be conducting a pilot project at its parking lot at Malcha Marg. It has tied up with a concessionaire who will install boom barriers, FASTag readers, CCTV system and other equipment to facilitate the project. The parking lot has space for 70 vehicles. In NDMC areas, there are 94 parking lots of which 40 are run by the civic body and the rest by a private concessionaire. The civic body has decided to adopt the system at its 40 parking lots depending on the outcome of the pilot project. “The concessionaire will take two weeks to set up the system. After that, we will operate it for two months and based on the usage and demand, we will make a decision for other parking lots,” said an NDMC official. However, the facility for collecting cash parking fees from the visitors will continue to avoid inconvenience to anyone, he stated. “The parking lots run by NDMC are operated manually and have no automatic collection system in place. This will make it easier for the concessionaire to set up the FASTag reader system and other equipment here. Considering the tag has been made mandatory by the ministry of road transport and highways at tolls across the country, installation of the system to deduct parking fees from these tags at local parking lots will motivate all to use the tag. For us also, it will make things easier as keeping the record of daily collection at parking lots will not be a headache,” said the NDMC official, adding that at least 91 per cent people have obtained FASTag in the city. As of now, the parking lots in Connaught Place and neighbouring areas are maintained and operated by the private concessionaire and provide space for at least 6,000 vehicles. Parking lots at Sarojini Nagar, Yashwant Place, Khan Market, Laxmibai Nagar, etc, provide space for around 4,000 vehicles and are operated by NDMC. Officials added that the daily collection from parking lots with FASTag facility will be updated at NDMC’s control and command system automatically and this will minimise chances of error, corruption and bring more transparency to the system. “Each and every amount deducted through FASTag will be immediately credited to the designated account,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/use-fastag-to-pay-for-parking-soon/articleshow/84184934.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Pune||Tech-heavy suburbs dominate realty sales||Pune: A report by real estate consultants JLL has revealed that the city registered more sales in the first half of 2021 than the corresponding period last year, with the north-eastern and north-western suburbs driving the trend. The report stated that the tech-heavy, emerging, and developed suburbs dominated sales in the Pune region, with nearly three out of four homes (74%) sold in the first half of 2021 being in areas such as Vimannagar, Kharadi, Wagholi, Wakad, Hinjewadi and Aundh. It stated that sales in the Pune area grew by 59% from January to June this year over the corresponding period in 2020. This indicate that the second wave of the pandemic and the ensuing restrictions had a softer impact on real estate sales than the total lockdown during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Around 7,284 units were sold in Pune during the first half of 2021, compared to 4,579 units in the corresponding period last year. “There is no denying the fact that the second Covid-19 wave dented the market following a good recovery curve. But the impact was muted when compared to the same period last year. Most of the changes observed in the sector have been structural in nature and demand for homes is only expected to increase,” said Samantak Das, chief economist and head of research at JLL. Observers also alluded to the stamp duty cut that helped the homebuyers until the end of March this year. “Sales were going phenomenally well in the first three months of 2021, because the stamp duty cuts were still there. It increased by 1% from the end of December 2020. Both entry-level and other homebuyers took advantage of the stamp duty cuts. But the expiry of the relief, second wave of the pandemic and and the onset of monsoons slowed down the market,” a Pune-based real estate player.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tech-heavy-suburbs-dominate-realty-sales/articleshow/84184986.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Mumbai||SC: State cannot put healed mental health patients in shelters||The Supreme Court on Tuesday ticked off the Maharashtra government for shifting healed patients from mental health hospitals to either beggar homes or old-age homes instead of creating ‘half-way or long-stay homes’ for rehabilitation and told it to stop.Amicus curiae and advocate G K Bansal informed a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah about the state’s practise that has resulted in the death of three. “There is no question of transferring them from mental health establishments to beggar homes or old-age homes. You will not do it,” said the bench.In 2019, the SC had directed the states to rehabilitate persons cured of mental illness in half-way/long-stay homes prior to acceptance by their families.On Bansal’s request, the bench directed the Union government to extend the Covid vaccination drive to mental health establishments. “They cannot go to hospitals. The governments must ensure that testing, tracing and vaccination of the mentally ill is carried out expeditiously. Otherwise, a large number of persons could be afflicted with Covid,” it said.Appearing for the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment, additional solicitor general Madhavi Divan said the Centre has scheduled a virtual meeting with states on July 12 to ensure implementation of the SC’s 2019 order.Agreeing with Divan that the pandemic has given a whole new dimension to the mental health issue, the bench requested the Centre to impress upon the states to be serious about the order, “otherwise, these people cured of mental illness would end up in the streets”.On Tuesday, Justices Chandrachud and Shah said implementation of the SC judgment and the Mental Healthcare Act has been tardy and said the “time has come to implement the provisions of the law with utmost alacrity”.Bansal told the court every state was mandated to set up a Mental Healthcare Review Board, but only Karnataka has done so. SC directed all states to provide requisite data to the Centre during the July 12 meeting and posted the matter for July 27, with a caveat that from now on, it would monitor the issue every three weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sc-state-cannot-put-healed-mental-health-patients-in-shelters/articleshow/84187237.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The Hadapsar police identified the deceased as Balasaheb Sonar (45), an employee of a construction firm. His wife — Vaishali — a homemaker, sustained serious injuries —both hands fractured and injuries to legs. She is undergoing treatment in a private hospital. The couple was not wearing helmets. On Monday, the police arrested the car driver — Aranjay Budruk (35) of Gadital — on the charge of causing death and injuries due to negligence. The police seized a car registered in Budruk’s name. “Budruk was released on bail after he was produced before the Pune cantonment court,” inspector Vikas Raut said. Raut said, “Budruk, a private firm employee, was on heading towards Gadital at speed. In a bid to overtake a car, he veered to the right side of the road, lost control of the vehicle and hit the motorcycle.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/biker-dead-wife-injured-after-hit-by-speeding-car/articleshow/84185032.cms||---
---||Kochi||Ernakulam: Arjun Ayanki’s custody extension denied||KOCHI: The additional chief judicial magistrate (economic offences), Ernakulam, rejected a petition filed by the Customs, probing the Karipur gold smuggling case, seeking extension of the custody of Arjun Ayanki, one of the key accused in the case, on Tuesday. The court sent Ayanki into judicial custody after the Customs produced him on expiry of the seven-day custody period. The court also denied Customs the permission for joint interrogation of Ayanki and Mohammed Shafi, the convict in T P Chandrashekharan Murder Case, in connection with the smuggling case. Meanwhile, Ayanki told the court that he was tortured by the Customs officials during the custody period. However, the Customs officials denied the allegations. On Tuesday, the Customs sought seven more days of Ayanki’s custody stating that his further custody was needed for recovery of the evidence and also to prevent further destruction and tampering of evidence, considering the criminality involved in this case. Customs also said that Amala Arjun, wife of Ayanki, said her mother has not provided any financial support to her or her husband, which contradicted Ayanki’s earlier statement. However, the court observed that seven days’ time was sufficient for the investigating officer to complete custodial interrogation and collect evidence, considering the nature of the future investigation. The court said all material facts for necessitating the custody of accused were not revealed by the investigative authority. “..I find only a bare statement to the effect that custody of respondent is required to complete investigation before the destruction of evidence. The nature of proposed investigation and kind of evidence expected to the destroyed by the accused etc., have not been stated in the affidavit,” said the court, dismissing the petition. Customs to question Shafi The Customs (preventive), Kochi, asked Mohammed Shafi, to appear for interrogation on Wednesday in connection with gold smuggling case. Shafi, who was sentenced for 12 years rigorous imprisonment, is out on parole. Customs probe found that the gold smuggling gangs operating from Kannur received patronage from N K Sunil Kumar alias Kodi Suni, another convict, and Shafi. Customs said that the gangs project themselves as supporters of a political party through social media and thus lure youth to their fold and further use them for anti-social activities, for which they source their funds through smuggling activities. Earlier on Saturday, Shafi’s residence was searched by the Customs officials which led to recovery of certain electronic devices which need further analysis. Though Customs sleuths had reached the residence of Kodi Suni as well, search could not be conducted there as the house was found to be locked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ayankis-custody-extension-denied/articleshow/84185045.cms||---

Though the state has not issued a fresh order cancelling Monday’s GR, educationists in rural areas are unclear on whether they should proceed with the process of reopening schools. The state on Monday said classes VIII to XII in rural areas free of Covid could start physical classes. A standard operating procedure was laid down for schools too. It included local government bodies taking the decision on reopening schools after obtaining parents’ consent. Education officers said though the GR was issued on Monday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had not given his nod to reopening of schools. The GR is likely to be revisited and will be reissued in the coming days. Teachers in rural areas have been demanding school for all as online learning has not taken off among the children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-question-mark-over-reopening-rural-schools/articleshow/84182431.cms||---
---||Delhi||Keep supplying free ration to non-card holders in Delhi, urges NGO||NEW DELHI: After surprise visits by an NGO revealed that stocks of foodgrains for people without ration cards were over at many school centres, concerned groups and individuals have written to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for continuing the service till the pandemic gets over. According to Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan (DRRAA), nearly 85% of the centres visited had no ration stock. In the letter, the chief minister has been urged to revise the non-public distribution scheme, restock ration at the designated schools and open community kitchens. A DRRAA official said most centres visited on Monday had run out of stocks and were turning away people. “It is crucial that Delhi government immediately take steps to restock ration and do away with the predetermined cap of 20 lakh people and provide ration on a monthly basis,” said an official. “This will also be in keeping with the judgment of the Supreme Court in the migrant workers’ case and with a recent order of Delhi High Court.” The letter stated that in the last week of May, Delhi government had formulated a policy to provide ration to people without ration cards. “It appears that in the past few days, many designated centres have run out of ration as confirmed via ground visits carried out by Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan. As per information collated by DRRAA, on June 30, 2021 and July 1, 2021, more than 85% of the schools checked were found to have exhausted the ration stocks and were, therefore, not supplying ration to people,” it stated. It is crucial that Delhi government immediately take steps to continue with the scheme for the next few months, not just as a one-time relief, the letter stated. “Delay in revising the plan and stocking the schools with ration are exacerbating the distress and hunger among the vulnerable population of Delhi.” Despite repeated attempts by TOI, Delhi government officials refused to comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/keep-supplying-free-ration-to-non-card-holders-urges-ngo/articleshow/84184994.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra to model MPSC on UPSC, fill 15,500 govt posts||MUMBAI: Facing heat over the suicide of a state civil service aspirant, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar told the state assembly on Tuesday that over 15,500 government posts would be filled through MPSC and the state commission will be overhauled on the lines of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). Swapnil Lonkar, 24, had cleared the MPSC exam but was awaiting his interview for two years when he took the drastic step. Pawar later told reporters that the government will not only fill all the vacant posts of members in the state commission but will expand it to at least 11 members from the current six. This will help them dispose of the backlog after the recruitment halt faster. “We will fill 4,417 group A posts, 8,021 group B posts and 3,063 group C posts. This will be done after examining the reservations on the posts,” said Pawar. He added that the government had held several meetings on how to expedite the MPSC recruitment process. The commission will be asked to develop an online platform for details on exams, consultations. Also, the government is considering reviewing the age limit for MPSC exams. “There is a need to re-look at the whole process and we will be sitting with the CM after the monsoon session. A final decision will be taken after that,” said Pawar. On Monday, Pawar had said vacant posts on the MPSC panel would be filled by July 31. However, he had come under criticism from the Opposition, who said Pawar only talked about filling vacancies on the MPSC panel and not about providing jobs for aspirants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-to-model-mpsc-on-upsc-fill-15k-govt-posts/articleshow/84187278.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||The mental trauma of treatment-givers||AHMEDABAD: In April-May, the official death figures of Covid-19 climbed over 100 for the first time during the pandemic. Mortality was colossal at private and government-run hospitals alike. While healthcare staff had witnessed a spike after Diwali, they were not prepared for the tsunami of cases. While citizens lined up for treatment at various hospitals, healthcare workers had few avenues to approach – the majority had not taken leave for more than a year, had stayed away from family for months, and were under constant stress from the reactions of relatives who had to be told that their loved ones were no more. “At the peak of the pandemic, there was also the moral dilemma of who to admit and who to omit, who would get a ventilator for a few more days, and who didn’t have great chances of survival. These decisions and their results have stayed with many doctors,” said a city-based psychiatrist, who carried out counselling sessions for healthcare workers. Several branches such as ophthalmology or dermatology do not routinely deal with deaths. When residents of these branches faced the Covid wards, many took a long time to adjust to the issues associated with the pandemic, including the sudden deterioration of patients and deaths in their arms. Dr Deepti Bhatt, a psychiatrist with the Government Hospital for Mental Health and coordinator for Gujarat Digital Academy for Mental Health (GDAMH), said they carried out several counselling and training workshops for healthcare workers during the pandemic. “Several nurses had emotional breakdowns due to the trauma caused by Covid issues and deaths. At its peak, a doctor deployed at a Covid care centre witnessed four deaths in the matter of hours. Such experiences take a long time to heal,” she said. A senior city-based doctor said that of the staff he worked with, 15% to 20% may be deeply affected by the pandemic. “It’s not just about government or private, junior or senior. Many started self-medication or turned to addictions. I would always tell them not to get emotionally attached to patients and do their best in any condition. If we could save all, we might as well be gods. But there’s a limit to what we could and could not do,” said a doctor working at the Covid ward of a private hospital. Doctors turned to relaxation exercises, psychological counselling and even watching light-hearted movies or web series at the end of the day to de-stress. Seniors also tried to create small groups at some hospitals to ensure that doctors had someone to talk to after a stressful day at work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/the-mental-trauma-of-treatment-givers/articleshow/84156954.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Delhi||Monsoon Wading: PWD Identifies 147 spots in Delhi||NEW DELHI: This year, Delhi government’s Public Works Department has identified 147 vulnerable spots that are most prone to waterlogging during the rains. The Flood Control Order for the 2021 monsoon season has details of suction pumps that have been installed to prevent water logging and claims that the drainage systems have been checked throughout the city. PWD is responsible for 1,260 km of roads in Delhi. The aggregate length of drains along PWD roads is 2,054 km. A PWD official said that when the river Sahibi, which passes through Najafgarh, and river Yamuna are flooded, the drainage system gets overloaded and causes water logging and flooding within the city. The flood control order lists PWD’s action plan for preventing waterlogging, among them desilting of drains, pumping of storm water, keeping tabs on identified vulnerable locations, cleaning of all rooftops and drainage systems. Apart from this, road repair work and covering of potholes have been completed before the onset of the monsoons. Mobile pumps have been kept ready near flooding-prone locations under the charge of the local executive engineer. Some of the vulnerable spots identified are Vikas Marg (Karkardooma courts, Laxmi Nagar metro station), Netaji Subhash Marg (railway bridge at Kashmere Gate), Anand Parbat Road, Rohtak Road, Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg (Tilak bridge), Indraprastha Road (under IP flyover), Hanuman Setu (SP Mukherjee Marg), Minto Bridge and Dwarka More. Suction pumps have been installed at these spots as well as at Moolchand underpass, Lajpat Nagar, Andrews Ganj, AIIMS subway, Nehru Place, Hyatt subway, Hauz Khas and Dhaula Kuan. CCTV cameras will provide footage at vulnerable points to monitor waterlogging and PWD will also conduct night inspections during the rains. These instructions were issued by the PWD engineer-in-chief last month and a circular issued to say, “All chief engineers should ensure installation of cameras at all crucial vulnerable points for which live feed is available on the mobile phones of executive engineers and on the phones of superintendent engineers and chief engineers. Executive engineers should start night visits during the rainy season and ensure that water doesn't accumulate at vulnerable points.” PWD also ordered an increase in the pace of desilting drains to avoid waterlogging once the rains began.

The facility is first of its kind in the country, it said. The exclusively cashless parking facility located at Gate 6 of Kashmere Gate station, which can accommodate 55 cars and 174 two-wheelers, will allow entry and exit of vehicles only after payment through FASTag and DMRC smart card by cars and two-wheelers, respectively, said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC. Entry for two-wheelers will be done by swiping the DMRC smart card, which would be used for registering the time of entry and exit and for fare calculation, he said. The fare will not be deducted from the card but will have to be paid through UPI apps by scanning the QR Code. DMRC said that this was a pilot project and in future, similar systems at more of its parking facilities would be set up across Delhi-NCR. The facility was launched by DMRC’s managing director Mangu Singh, who also inaugurated dedicated lanes for autorickshaws, taxis and e-rickshaws. Dayal said these lanes would enable a smooth movement of vehicles and enhance the last-mile connectivity at the station. In the second phase of the multi-model integration initiative, there will be a food court and a bus terminal, he said. “These facilities will provide a major relief to commuters travelling from/to the Kashmere Gate station,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/use-metro-smart-card-for-2-wheeler-parking/articleshow/84185048.cms||---

Rupesh and the co-accused Ibrahim were facing online trial with the special court for trial of NIA cases. Rupesh filed a petition before the NIA court seeking permission to observe one minute silence to pay homage to the departed activist priest. Rupesh in his petition argued that the commitment shown by Swamy for the poor and downtrodden was a source of inspiration for him. However, the court did not accede to his demands saying there was no such precedence, according to the jail authorities. Rupesh and his friends observed a fast on Tuesday as part of their protests, according to activist and lawyer Shyna, who is also the wife of Rupesh. However, jail authorities said that they have not received any communication regarding the protest. Shyna alleged that Ibrahim is also facing acute health problems and might meet the same fate as Swamy if he is not granted bail for treatment. Meanwhile, the admirers of renowned German Jesuit priest Ernst Hanxleden popularly known as Arnos Pathiri, held a protest in Thrissur on Tuesday against the death of Swamy in custody. Thrissur archbishop Mar Andrews Thazhath and auxiliary bishop Mar Tony Neelankavil in separate messages termed the death of Swamy a “martyrdom”. Organizations like Kerala Catholic Youth Movement also organized protests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/maoists-protest-in-jail-for-fr-swamy/articleshow/84185083.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Doctors now have more drug options to help Covid patients heal faster||JAIPUR: Doctors will have more options of drugs for Covid treatment if the third wave emerges with Sawai Man Singh Medical College issuing recommendations for the use of three drugs – oral powder 2-Deoxy-D-Glucose (O2DG), injection pegylated interferon alfa-2b and cocktail of monoclonal antibodies. All the three drugs are ‘repurposed’ to be used for preventing disease progression and given within 7-9 days of Covid infection, which is a time of growth of virus or replication of virus in an infected person. In the second wave, more than 6,000 people died of Covid in the state. The health department is now aiming to prevent disease progression in such patients leading to deaths. “The new (repurposed) drugs will be given in first phase of Covid infection. The aim is to prevent the patient entering into the phase of inflammation and cytokine storm, which deteriorates the condition of Covid patients. The aim is to treat patients in the first phase of infection, in which virus grows and these drugs will help in preventing replication of virus in the body,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College. Since pegylated interferon alfa-2b and cocktail of monoclonal antibodies are injectables, a patient with mild Covid symptoms may reach the hospital and get any of the two injectable drugs and return home after a short stay at the hospital. While 2DG is an oral drug, just like remdesivir it is recommended for patients in first phase of infection who require oxygen support. “Cocktail of monoclonal antibodies is helpful in patients with mild symptoms,” said Dr Virendra Singh, member of state’s advisory committee on Covid. He added that more drugs will provide doctors an option to choose according to the needs of a patient. During the first and second waves, doctors limited the options of drugs, which they could use in the first 7-9 days of infections. Drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, doxycycline and ivermectin have widely been used in first and second waves along with remdesivir. “Since a lot of people have got infected in first and second waves and also vaccination has been done at a largescale in the state, chances are that if the third wave emerges, many patients will develop mild to moderate symptoms. In such patients, drugs which have been permitted for emergency use in Covid patients will prove beneficial as all the drugs are recommended to be used in mild to moderate patients within 7-9 days of infection,” said Dr Ajit Singh, superintendent, dedicated Covid-19 RUHS Hospital. Since the second wave of Covid has slowed down, doctors are yet to use the new ‘repurposed’ drugs on a more patients to find out how it is effectively treating the virus. Patients treated with cocktail of monoclonal antibodies are few in the state. However, all the drugs have certain limitations and contraindications. All the new drugs are not recommended for critically ill patients having acute respiratory distress syndrome. The 2DG drug and pegylated interferon alfa-2b have not been evaluated in patients with history of one or more known comorbidities such as cardiac failure, ischemic coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, malignancy, chronic kidney disease, pregnancy and pediatric patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/docs-now-have-more-drug-options-to-help-covid-patients-heal-faster/articleshow/84187258.cms||---

The accident occurred near Kudalasangama Cross on NH-50 in Hungund taluk of Bagalkot district, 430 km from Bengaluru, on Monday evening when the deceased, Kudleppa Boli, was returning home on his bike. The farmer was rushed to a hospital, where he succumbed to injuries. Both Laxman Savadi and his son Chidanand have denied that the latter was driving the car. ‘Son stopped driving 10 yrs ago’Based on a complaint filed by a family member of the deceased, we have seized the car and detained its driver,” district SP Lokesh Jagalasar told reporters, adding the investigation is on into the allegations made by the victim’s kin. The victim’s son-in-law Mangalappa alleged that Chidanand Savadi was at the wheel and saw him getting into another car soon after the accident. Chidanand admitted that the car -- MG Gloster --belonged to him, but denied the charge that he was driving it. He told reporters in Athani that he and his friends had been to Anjanadri Hills and were returning to Athani. “I was in my friend’s car, while Hanumanth (driver) was driving his car when the accident occurred.

KCR held a marathon six hours meeting with senior irrigation officials on Tuesday—which was attended by minister V Srinivas Goud, chief secretary Somesh Kumar, chief advisor Rajiv Sharma—to discuss the proposed KRMB meeting, irrigation projects issues on Krishna river and the ongoing high court case. He reportedly said there was no point in attending the meeting if the KRMB goes ahead with it and the state government is planning to lodge a complaint with the Union ministry of jal shakti. “The government would continue uncompromised fight for the rightful share of Krishna waters, hydel power generation and also against illegal projects on Krishna in all fora,” the chief minister’s office said. In the meeting, it was opined that the AP government was pressurising the Centre and strategies to be adopted to counter the AP’s attempts. The Telangana government wrote a letter to the KRMB on Monday seeking postponement of the three-member KRMB meeting and asked the board to convene a meeting after July 20 by incorporating various issues raised by Telangana in the agenda. The CM also demanded a full board instead of just three members (irrigation officials from both Telangana and AP and a KRMB member) at the meeting. The KRMB did not respond to the letter till Tuesday evening, irrigation officials said. KCR reportedly discussed about a delegation to be sent to Delhi to represent the Krishna water issues and directed them to prepare documents in support of Telangana’s claims. “If at all, CM-headed or a ministerial delegation has to make a visit, it has to be in the next one week,” sources in the irrigation department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-set-to-stay-away-from-july-9-krmb-meet/articleshow/84187284.cms||Koride Mahesh

Police sources said that acting on an order of the deputy collector to trim branches or cut trees along Nuvem to Cuncolim, those which have turned unsafe for road users, the PWD engaged a contractor for the exercise. Costa was passing along the stretch on his bike while the tree-cutting work was under way on Tuesday when the tree fell on him. He died on the spot. As the contractor and his personnel fled from the scene, enraged villagers came out on the streets. Senior police officials rushed to the site and tried to pacify them. The protesters demanded that action be taken against the PWD officials for negligence. No offence was booked by the police until late evening. Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat demanded that the PWD minister order a high-level inquiry into the incident and strict action be taken against those responsible. “There is complete collapse of administration in PWD. People are made to suffer every day with bad roads, shortage of water supply, breakdown of pipelines, etc as the department has lost complete control on its administration,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/nuvem-man-dies-in-tree-felling-incident/articleshow/84187476.cms||---

Just over 100 positive cases were reported in entire 2020. Till May 7, the city had recorded only six cases this year. The tally has now crossed 150 in just over one month because of the June surge. Among the 98 new cases, 42 fell in the age group of 0-24 years. The deceased include a seven-month-old boy from Satranjipura, a nine-year-old girl from Dharampeth and a 36-year-old from Hanuman Nagar zone. The NMC medical committee would investigate the deceased patients’ history to ascertain if they had any comorbidity before confirming them as dengue deaths. Serum samples of all three have tested positive in the Elisa NS-I test. NMC malaria and filarial officer Dipali Nasare, along with her team, visited the homes of deceased as well as other patients and found large mosquito breeding spots, mainly in coolers and surrounding areas. Nasare said the 36-year-old was from Rahate Nagar’s slums that are infamous for liquor fermentation. Lots of drums meant for storing water were source of breeding mosquitoes. Construction work was also going on at the deceased’s home, she said. Nasare added that as private hospitals prefer rapid test for dengue, the department treats all reported cases as suspected until they are confirmed through the more reliable Elisa NS-I test at NMC’s Mahal Diagnostics Centre. Regarding the surge, she said, “Our survey found coolers are not being drained every week. We are repeatedly asking people to clean their coolers and storage tanks where Aedes aegypti, commonly known as dengue mosquito, breeds. Discarded items too are posing a hurdle in prevention measures.” She said people need to make similar efforts like they have been doing for Covid-19 prevention. The prevalence of dengue had gone down by half as compared to last year, until May first week. The city had recorded just six positive cases for the vector-borne diseases from the 30 samples between January and May 7. The highest number of suspects (16) were reported to the NMC malaria and filaria department in May. Of these, only 14 tested positive. No positive case was recorded in April, when Covid was its peak. In 2018 and 2019, the NMC had slapped notices on and recovered penalties from schools, hospitals and other commercial establishments after mosquito breeding spots were found on their premises. The department is running short of hands as staff has been deployed for Covid duties and routine surveys are affected to a large extent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dengue-surge-in-nagpur-3-suspected-deaths-98-cases-in-june/articleshow/84187204.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Gehlot,73, a two-time Rajya Sabha member from MP, was among eight new governors appointed by President Ram Nath Kovind. Gehlot will replace Vajubhai R Vala, who has been in office since September 2014, the longest tenure after Khurshed Alam Khan. His experience will help state: CMGehlot, who served as minister in PM Modi’s cabinet after being inducted for second time in 2019, will replace Vajubhai Vala, who has been in office since September 2014, the longest tenure after Khurshed Alam Khan. Gehlot is likely to take charge sometime next week. Hours after being appointed governor, Gehlot said he would resign from the three positions he holds currently — in the cabinet, Rajya Sabha, and BJP parliamentary board — on Wednesday. “President (Ram Nath) Kovind and PM (Narendra) Modi have shown faith in me and appointed me Karnataka governor. I will live up to their expectations and do my job faithfully. I will try to resolve the issues within constitutional limits and with discussions,” Gehlot said. With Karnataka slated to go to polls in 2023, Gehlot’s role assumes significance as the state has endured hung assemblies, coalition governments and political instability in recent elections. Gehlot’s knowledge of the political landscape of Karnataka, as general secretary in-charge of BJP in the state in mid-2000, is expected to come in handy. The CM tweeted: “The state will benefit from Gehlotji’s long experience in public life and commitment to social justice.” Outgoing governor Vala, whose tenure was extended after it ended in 2019, has had an eventful stint after a hung verdict in the 2018 assembly polls triggered high-voltage political manoeuvrings in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/valas-7-yr-innings-ends-union-min-gehlot-next-guv-of-ktaka/articleshow/84190748.cms||---

---||Delhi||Kin of Covid-hit to get Rs 50,000, pension in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal launched a social security scheme for families affected by the pandemic on Tuesday. Called Mukhyamantri Covid-19 Pariwar Aarthik Sahayata Yojana, the scheme aims to support children who have been orphaned and families that have lost their members to the coronavirus. Under the scheme, an ex-gratia amount of Rs 50,000 will be given for deaths, and an additional pension of Rs 2,500 per month if the family has lost its breadwinner. TimesViewThis move will offer short-term help to the beneficiaries. However, Delhi government — and the Centre and other states — must realise that the virus has not only taken lives, but also shattered the economy. Many businesses have been shut and thousands lost their jobs. The need of the hour is to find ways and means of increasing employment opportunities. That’s what many need.At the virtual launch of the scheme on Tuesday, Kejriwal said, “The recent wave of infections in Delhi was very severe and affected almost every family in the city. It was very lethal too and we lost a lot of lives, a lot of children became orphans, a lot of families lost their breadwinners. There’s no one to look after them now.” The CM said being sensitive to the needs of the families, Delhi government had come up with the financial assistance scheme. In the case of the death of any Covid-positive person, either in an institutional setting or at home, Rs 50,000 would be given as ex-gratia to the family of the deceased. “No questions will be asked. If the person died because of the coronavirus, the family will receive Rs 50,000,” Kejriwal asserted. He added, “Additionally, a monthly Rs 2,500 will be given to families that have lost their breadwinner. Plus, all children orphaned by Covid will be given Rs 2,500 every month till they attain the age of 25 years.” Three applications for the ex-gratia amount of Rs 50,000 and five for the monthly Rs 2,500 financial assistance were processed on the first day of the scheme on Tuesday. The social welfare department will be the nodal and implementing agency for the scheme. “We have tried to cover all kinds of sections of society and parameters. Today, we are launching the portal where applications have to be submitted,” said Kejriwal. “There are two options. First, families can register on the portal themselves. Second, a Delhi government representative can visit their home and help them. We will not wait for people to apply, but also approach them on our own as well.” He added that the government representatives visiting homes will not be scrutinising the documents of the grieving families but assisting them. The government has made the application simple. The eligible applicants need to register as “New User” on https://edistrict.delhigovt.nic.in/ using Aadhaar and mobile numbers. On successful submission of the form, a government representative will visit the applicant’s home within a week for verification of the information given by the applicant and to assist in collecting any additional information and documents required, if any.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kin-of-covid-hit-to-get-rs-50000-pension/articleshow/84185401.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Mumbai||Covid rule: Stan Swamy cremated after mass in Mumbai||MUMBAI: A small group of Jesuit priests conducted a solemn funeral mass for Fr Stan Swamy at St Peter’s Church, Bandra, on Tuesday evening. The 84-year-old ailing accused in the Elgar Parishad case had passed away at Holy Family Hospital on Monday. Approximately 20,000 people watched the mass that was streamed live on St Peter’s YouTube channel. Physical presence was discouraged given the government’s Covid guidelines for funerals. Also in keeping with Covid protocol, Fr Stan’s mortal remains were taken for cremation to Shivaji Park instead of burial. His ashes will be repatriated to his home state of Jharkhand, where prayer services will be held in Ranchi and Jamshedpur. At the Bandra memorial, Fr Stan’s priestly colleagues from Jharkhand as well as Bengaluru and Mumbai revealed various facets of his personality. Fr Joe Xavier recalled how he would travel by ordinary coach on a train and decline journey expenses. Fr Joe was all praise for activist Arun Ferreira and other jail mates in Taloja prison who took care of Fr Stan’s daily tasks when he was incarcerated there. Fr Frazer Mascarenhas, parish priest of St Peter’s Church, had attended to Fr Stan during the last month of his life that he spent in hospital. He said he was surprised to see how keen Stan was to receive holy communion during their meetings, and how the sisters would arrange it when Fr Frazer forgot. “He would use the term ‘Comrade’ frequently for his peers, which has nothing to do with Maoist ideology or violence. It is a ridiculous accusation (against him). Comrade simply implies social friendship,” he said. Another priest, speaking online, used the allegory of the cruel Biblical king Pontius Pilate’s tyranny against Jesus. “I have no case against him. Take him yourself and crucify him, ordered Pilate to the mob,” he narrated, in a likely reference to the fact that Fr Stan’s case never came up for hearing despite his prolonged imprisonment. For the second consecutive day, protests were held by civil society groups. Outside the church, members of the Bombay Catholic Sabha as well as the Aam Aadmi Party organised a candlelight vigil and raised placards condemning the manner of his death. The UN Human Rights organisation tweeted on Tuesday, “#India: We are saddened & disturbed by the death of 84-year-old human rights defender Father #StanSwamy after prolonged pre-trial detention. With Covid-19, it is even more urgent that states release every person detained without sufficient legal basis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-rule-stan-swamy-cremated-after-mass-in-mumbai/articleshow/84187322.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

The body was found hidden in a moulded polythene water tank kept on the third floor of a garment factory in Mohan Estate. When informed about the body in the water tank, police rushed there and the woman’s body was taken out with the help of fire brigade personnel who used tree-cutting blades to cut the tank. “While the tank was being cut, utmost care was taken to ensure that the body did not receive any injury or mark,” said a police official. “It seems, the woman was killed a couple of days back. We have alerted all police stations and sought information about any missing woman in their jurisdiction,” said Y S Gamit, police inspector of Khokhra police station. The body is yet to be identified, said Gamit. He said that the cops are yet to get the postmortem copy. “Once we get the postmortem report, there would be more clarity on the time of death and the modus operandi,” Gamit said. According to a senior police official, the woman was identified as a resident of Amraiwadi late on Tuesday night. “The identity has not been revealed as this would impede the investigation process,” he said. The cops said that the terrace on which the body was found was that of the garment factory which was not operational round the clock. Police have questioned the staff of the garment factory and have not ruled out the hand of an insider. “It is possible that the woman was killed after all the workers had left. There is also the possibility of the woman being in relationship with the accused and murdered following any dispute,” said a police official. He said police have zeroed in on three-four persons.

A home guard jawan will be another witness. The home guard jawan was allegedly chasing Parv in a car being driven by Dheer Patel of Ashram Road. Parv’s three friends have been identified as Rishabh Shah and Divya Shah of Mithakhali; and Parth Shah of Paldi. The three were travelling with Parv in his car when he ran over four footpath-dwellers. The sub-inspector in charge of N Division traffic police, B B Vaghela, said: “We have recorded the statements of Parv’s friends before a magistrate.” Vaghela added: “Home guard jawan Parbat Jethalia who chased Parv that night has been included as a witness.” Vaghela said that city traffic police have written to the DGP home guards, Gujarat, seeking a departmental inquiry against the jawan for chasing the car. “He was not on duty the night the accident occurred,” Vaghela said. “He was allegedly chasing Parv’s car from Thaltej Crossroads. When he saw that Parv had run over four footpath-dwellers, Jethalia fled from the scene.” Vaghela said that Jethalia has told traffic cops that he was scared after seeing a huge crowd beating Parv’s friends and decided to flee. Cops have been struggling to get CCTV footage of the accident as one of the cameras at Shivranjani Crossroads has not been functional for many days, said a police officer.

Second-year Graduation students should be promoted to the next class on a temporary basis and online classes should commence from July 10. The examination on objective descriptive pattern should be conducted on convenience of the students and marksheets should be given by end of December. The valuation of the practical examinations will be based on assignments. Examinations for courses and faculty having few students will be conducted online.

---||Ludhiana||MC sub-panel approves increase in tipping fee||GARBAGE LIFTINGLudhiana: To ensure garbage lifting work continues in the city, the municipal corporation is expected to increase the tipping fee of the contractor. A meeting of an MC sub-committee was held on Tuesday, wherein its members gave their consent to increasing the tipping fee from Rs 324 to Rs 425 per tonne.After forming the sub-committee, mayor Balkar Sandhu had said they would implement its decision. The panel will now submit its final report to the mayor. Senior deputy mayor Shyam Sunder Malhotra said, “We do not have an option other than increasing the tipping fee as we do not want garbage lifting to stop. Besides, if we hire a new contractor after floating fresh tenders, the tipping fee will be above Rs 1,000. We require the contractor for lifting waste from secondary garbage collection points for at least one year, during which static compactors will be started at all the points. After that, the company that will install the compactors will be responsible for garbage lifting as well. We are trying to find a solution to start garbage processing at the Tajpur Road plant as well.” The civic body had served a notice on A2Z waste management company after which its contract was terminated in December last. Since February 4, garbage processing at Tajpur Road dump has stopped and the waste lifting work was given to the new firm. The new contractor had demanded hike in tipping fee due to increase in diesel rates. He had threatened to stop trash lifting by June 30. Since then, the authorities were busy finalizing the revision of tipping fee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/mc-sub-panel-approves-increase-in-tipping-fee/articleshow/84182550.cms||---

Thakor has been accused by CID (crime) of corruption and criminal conspiracy along with former dairy chairman Vipul Chaudhary and managing director Nishith Bakshi. Thakor was arrested on Monday and the probe agency sought five-day custodial interrogation to probe her alleged involvement in the scam. In December 2020, CID arrested Chaudhary on charges of siphoning off Rs 14.80 crore from bonus funds of the dairy’s employees two years ago. In 2014, Chaudhary was accused of causing a loss of Rs 22.5 crore to Dudhsagar Dairy when as chairman he decided to send free cattle feed to Maharashtra. He was held responsible for the loss by the cooperatives registrar. When the cooperative registrar ordered him to pay Rs 9 crore, Chaudhary allegedly conspired with dairy’s other office bearers to raise this sum. They allegedly hatched a conspiracy and announced that the dairy would give double bonus to employees. The employees were, however, told to deposit 80% of that year’s bonus amount back with the dairy. They could raise Rs 14.8 crore through this exercise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ex-chief-of-dudhsagar-dairy-sent-to-custody/articleshow/84187444.cms||---

Some supporters showered currency notes on Jaleel while he was on the dias. The Daulatabad police later registered a case against four organisers of this event. The bench of Justices Ravindra Ghuge and Justice Sanjay Mehare questioned Jaleel as to why action should not be taken against him and it did not appear impressed by Jaleel's explanation that he was told that it was a fund-raising event where things went beyond his control when some overzealous supporters crowded the dias. The HC refused to buy Jaleel's explanation that he has always been a soft target for political parties and media. The AIMIM MP had begun his submission by tendering an oral apology and conceding that the violation should not have happened. “I said sorry to the court for the inadvertent violation that took place that night. I submitted before the HC that I was invited for the fund raising event and after I reached there, things were not completely in my hands," Jaleel told TOI on Tuesday. Additional government pleader Sujeet Karlekar told TOI, “The MP tendered an oral apology to the court before explaining his side of the story. He also told the court that he had spoken to the police requesting them to initiate action against those violating Covid-19 norms and that he himself was open to face action, if found violating norms.” Earlier, the HC’s questioning was against the backdrop of a lawyer keeping a set of newspaper cuttings that depicted pictures from the event and highlighted alleged violation of covid-19 norms. Taking cognizance of the same, the HC asked the newspaper cuttings to be kept for the hearing of the PIL filed by Jaleel as the same was listed for hearing in the second half. At the hearing, the HC asked Karlekar to show the newspaper cuttings and questioned why the Qawwali event was held on the weekend lockdown and why nobody was found to be wearing a mask. Responding to the question, MP Jaleel instantly tendered his oral apology and conceded that the violation of covid-19 norms should not have happened.

A well-coordinated operation by cops from Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh saw two of the four robbers being nabbed. Umakant Pandey, the key man, managed to escape. Virendra Yadav and Deepak Tripathi were arrested in the early hours of Tuesday. Pandey, who was in a lodge at Chhapra village which is 40kms from Katni in MP, and another identified man are on the run. After committing the robbery at around 2.10 pm, the four had fled on two bikes. They were trapped exactly 12 hours later. City police checked CCTV footage at 82 locations and reviewed around 400 hours of footages for clues, according to police chief Amitesh Kumar. Cops from Katni, Jabalpur and Nagpur were involved in the operation that ended 240 kms from the jewellery shop. Police have recovered two revolvers and two live cartridges, 1 kg silver and some gold. All four had crime records in Uttar Pradesh. The cops got into action after Naware told them that the voice of one of the robbers was similar to that of a customer who had visited the shop on July 1 along with another woman whose identity has not been disclosed yet. “The two had visited an ATM (Barakholi). The bank helped police get details about the woman account holder. On checking her frequently dialled number, we zeroed down on Pandey and started tracing his number,” said Kumar. CCTV footage had captured the gang passing through Mansar toll naka at 2.56 pm and Khwasa border at 3.45 pm. “After that they were tracked only at the lodge,” said Kumar. After Nagpur police alerted their Jabalpur and Katni counterparts about the tower location of the gang, two teams from MP rushed to the place. On seeing the police, Pandey and one robber managed to flee. Yadav and Tripathi (knee fracture) got injured when their bike collided with an MP police vehicle. Pandey had turned his bike onto Chhindwada Road and headlong into Nagpur police. Dumping their bike, Pandey and aide escaped under cover of darkness in the adjoining thick forest. They had stolen the bike from Durg in Chhattisgarh. For the second time, Pandey gave away his location when he made a call to his girlfriend from a borrowed phone. But he had vanished when the cops reached the spot after tracing the cell tower location. Police said Pandey’s girlfriend, daughter of an ex-paramilitary personnel, was residing at Kushi Nagar. After conducting a recce on July 1, they summoned the other three from Chhattisgarh.  When cops went beyond their official duties Senior cops from Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh went beyond their protocol and duties to coordinate the action. While CP Amitesh Kumar got help from his batchmate ADG (cyber security) Yogesh Choudhury in Madhya Pradesh, Zonal DCP Vinita S co-ordinated with her batchmate, Jabalpur SP. Katni SP, despite being on leave, co-ordinated with his additional SP to ensure that Katni police actively participated in the operation.

---||Mumbai||No vax for under-18 major int’l travel hurdle||Mumbai: In the coming months, as more and more countries open their borders to vaccinated tourists, Indian families travelling with minors would find a major hurdle along their path. With no Covid-19 vaccination program announced yet for those under the age of 18 years, parents from India travelling with kids on foreign holidays would have limited options of holiday destinations they can travel to without facing quarantine restrictions. A case in point is Switzerland which opened its borders to vaccinated tourists, including those from India, on June 26. “Children under the age of 18 years, travelling with fully vaccinated adults, can enter Switzerland but they will have to undergo the mandatory 10 days of quarantine,’’ said a Swiss tourism representative. The quarantine would be followed by an RT-PCR test after five to seven days. A travel agent, requesting anonymity, said: “Switzerland is a popular destination among Indians, especially those travelling with family. But it’s not an option for those travelling with kids. As more and more countries open their borders in the coming months solely to vaccinated tourists, those travelling with kids will find their options limited,’’ he added. Iceland, for instance, demands a vaccination certificate and a negative RT-PCR test report on arrival. Of India’s 1.3 billion population, around 450 million are under 18 and so aren’t eligible yet to be vaccinated. Moreover, according to media reports, India’s first round of vaccination for minors would be limited to for those over the age of 12 years. There are options though for family holidays. Russia, for instance, demands a printed RT-PCR negative test report issued less than 72 hours before arrival and so does Egypt. There is no quarantine on arrival. Serbia too demands a negative RT-PCR report, taken up to 48 hours before departure, but offers an exemption to kids under the age of 12 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-vax-for-under-18-major-intl-travel-hurdle/articleshow/84182698.cms||---

Though it is being popularised as the ‘Prophet Muhammd Bill’ in Urdu press, the draft bill prepared and to be submitted to the government is called ‘Prophet Muhammad and Other Religious Heads Prohibition of Slander Act, 2021’ or ‘Hate Speech (Prevention) Act, 2021’. “It is our suggestion but the government can name whatever it chooses to.

Apart from this, number of flights operating from the airport crossed 800 in June.  While the airport had seen a good footfall in April with over a lakh passengers and more than 2,000 flights, it went downhill before taking the upward curve. According to officials, in the first quarter of the year, the footfall had touched approximately 9,000 passengers which decreased owing to the Covid situation. The travellers were those who are probably residents of the state, though the situation is changing gradually. In April, the total number of passengers was 1,66,878 which dipped to 48,304 in May, but increased to 70,421 in June. “When the lockdown was in place, there were fewer passengers, especially in the international sector where there were no incoming passengers. However, in June, the number of domestic passengers improved and we are hopeful that it would continue to move north in the coming months as well,” added an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipur-airport-sees-rise-in-flights-and-footfall-since-may/articleshow/84187449.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Is govt land executive’s paternal property: Chief Justice||MUMBAI: In a scathing comment on protection provided by successive governments to slumdwellers, Bombay high court Chief Justice Dipankar Datta on Tuesday said it appears that government land is the “paternal property of the executive”. “I am new to all this. But it seems like the State’s property is the paternal property of the executive,” said the CJ who hails from Bengal. He and Justice Girish Kulkarni heard suo motu a PIL on building collapses with a focus on last month’s Malwani crash that killed 12. The CJ’s comment came after advocate general Ashutosh Kumbkhakoni clarified that protection to unauthorised hutments/occupiers is only till January 1, 2001 and the cut-off is not extended till January 1, 2011.“Those in between (these dates) we’ll try to accommodate subject to availability of tenements and on ownership or rent,” he added. The judges said there is “absolute recognition” for slumdwellers from 2001-2011 considering the huge floor space index if the state undertakes redevelopment. They noted that from 1976, the state has been legitimising encroachers on government land. “The moment you bring them under a beneficial scheme, then the government land is written off, corporation land is written off,” said Justice Kulkarni. The bench observed that the biggest planning mistake was to include government lands within Development Control Regulations. Also, while there is the Slums Act, the government brought slum societies, owners and developers under DCR. “It is a fraud on the Constitution. Public largesse cannot be handled by slum societies and others. Government is custodian of public interest. It cannot be done when you have a complete code,” said Justice Kulkarni. The CJ added, “If you create a category of developers under DCR, land sharks come in.” Senior advocate Aspi Chinoy with advocate Joel Carlos for BMC questioned how BMC as an “outside authority” can take action when a structure is protected under the Slums Act. Chinoy said it is only the competent authority—the deputy collector—who has a record of photo passes issued to such structures. “If I go as BMC, I cannot ask them to produce photo pass. Providing water and electricity is not necessarily knowledge of the structure. It will lead to absurdity if we start questioning,” he added. But amicus curiae, senior advocate Sharan Jagtiani, said there is no question of BMC being handicapped about details of photopasses. “What it does in the cases of non-slums will apply in the same fashion,” he added. “This is what has happened here (at Malwani),” Justice Kulkarni said. With this, the hearing on the issue of jurisdiction as to who is the competent authority to act against illegal structures in slum areas concluded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/is-govt-land-executives-paternal-property-cj/articleshow/84189512.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Meanwhile, Shabnam learnt about her husband’s extra-marital affair and asked him to call it off, but he continued the relationship. “She also went to the woman and told her the truth about her husband’s religion and that he was married. But the woman was in love with the accused, so she refused to break up,” said a police official.

The state roadways’ revenue, which had reached around Rs 4.25 crore per day before lockdown, has now slumped by approximately Rs 1 crore. The department hopes that the resumption of the Volvo services would bring in some profit. After the resumption of roadways operations from June 10, buses plied an average of 8.08 lakh kilometre per day ferrying around 3.71 lakh passengers daily. This fetched the roadways an average revenue of about Rs 2.50 crore per day. “In the first four days of Jukly, 700 passengers travelled on Jaipur-Delhi route. We have added new timings as well so now the travellers can choose from eight options. Till April, we were earning over Rs 4 crore daily, but since the lockdown, the revenue dipped. Hopefully, we’ll soon be back on track. We are also starting Volvo services to Chandigarh and Ahmedabad from Jaipur,” said a roadways official. From June 10 to June 30, roadways buses operated for 1.69 crore kilometres ferrying 78 lakh passengers and earning Rs 52.14 crore. This number is almost three times as compared to June 2020. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/700-people-used-jaipur-delhi-volvo-bus-services-in-july/articleshow/84187475.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Sadiq Jamal case: Discharge of 4 cops challenged in HC||Ahmedabad: The special CBI court’s decision to grant discharge to four cops, including retired DySP Tarun Barot, in the 2003 Sadiq Jamal Mehtar encounter case has been challenged before the Gujarat high court.Mehtar’s brother, Shabbir Jamal, has filed petitions in the high court challenging two different orders passed by the CBI court here. The CBI court had in November last year discharged police inspector R L Mavani and police constable Ajaypalsingh Yadav on November 24, 2020. It then discharged Barot and a constable, Chhatrasinh Chudasama, on February 20 holding that there was no evidence against the accused cops in the chargesheet filed by the CBI.The court also took into consideration that the prosecuting agency had not obtained prosecution sanction under provisions of Section 197 of CrPC to conduct a trial against these cops for the charges of murder, illegal detention, abduction and criminal conspiracy.The high court may take up the hearing on Shabbir Jamal’s petitions in the near future, sources said.Eight police officials were booked for killing Mehtar, a youth from Bhavnagar, who the city crime branch had claimed was a trained Lashkar-e-Taiba operative sent to kill the then chief minister Narendra Modi to avenge the 2002 riots. The probe agency, the CBI, found that Sadiq was in custody of Gujarat police, and his custody had been obtained from Mumbai police. Earlier, retired DySP K M Waghela’s discharge plea was rejected. DySP J G Parmar died while the trial was pending.According to the CBI chargesheet, Sadiq used to work as a domestic help for Tariq Parveen, a fugitive and a close associate of Dawood Ibrahim, in Mumbai and Dubai. He left Dubai after an altercation with Parveen’s aide, Pakistan-based gangster Salim Chiplun, and returned India. He was in the custody of SIB, Mumbai and Gujarat police obtained his custody in January 2003. He was killed near Galaxy Cinema in Naroda on January 13.Besides Sadiq’s encounter, Barot was also discharged by a CBI court from charges of murder and criminal conspiracy in the 2004 Ishrat Jahan encounter case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sadiq-jamal-case-discharge-of-4-cops-challenged-in-hc/articleshow/84187481.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: YS Sharmila set to launch her party on July 8||HYDERABAD: The stage is set for the launch of a new regional party in Telangana, YSR Telangana Party (YSRTP), on Thursday at a private function hall in the city. The launch has been timed with the birth anniversary of former chief minister YS Rajasekhara Reddy on July 8. The inauguration meeting will be a low-key affair due to the pandemic. Along with the unveiling of the party flag and theme song, YS Sharmila will announce the agenda of her new party. Though the capacity of the hall is around 4,000, it is expected that around 20,000 loyalists will attend the inaugural meeting at 3pm, which is set to last for five to six hours. Sharmila’s mother YS Vijayamma will be present. Unlike in the past when AP chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and Sharmila pay tributes to their late father at Idupulapaya in Kadapa together, party sources said Sharmila will go directly to Idupulapaya on Thursday morning to pay tributes, while her brother is expected to visit the samadhi in the evening. Invitations were extended to all the political parties, including TRS, Congress and BJP, in the state. Party leaders personally handed over the inauguration invitation to TJS chief M Kodandaram and former TDP leader, BC leader R Krishnaiah. The TRS was launched when Andhra Pradesh was undivided. Kodandaram floated Telangana Jana Samithi in April 2018 and YSRTP will be the second big regional party to be launched in the state. YSR in Jagan’s YSR Congress Party stands for yuvajana (youth), sramika (working force) and rythu (farmer) plus YSR also is the short form of YS Rajasekhara Redddy. “YSR in our party name stands for YS Rajasekhara Reddy,” a YSRTP leader said. The party theme song was written by Epuru Somanna. A book penned by party spokesperson Indira Shobhan on welfare schemes implemented by YSR will also be launched on the occasion.

Meanwhile, Vilesh arrived in his car with Patil and checked Soni’s cold drink bottle. He alleged that Soni was drinking alcohol and thrashed him. Vilesh, who was in uniform threatened Soni with legal action. He forced Soni into his car and drove him around the city for over one hour. Soni alleged that Vilesh threatened to register a case under Prohibition Act and took Rs 5,000 cash from him. Soni was later released and Vilesh warned him of legal actions if filed a complaint against him. But Soni did file a complaint with the Umra police station. “It was confirmed during investigation that the accused transferred money from the victim’s Google Pay account to some other person's account.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Publisher of governor’s biography used Raj Bhavan to sell another book last year||JAIPUR: The forced sale of governor Kalraj Mishra’s biography to 27 universities in the state by the International Institute of Management and Entrepreneurship (IIME) is the second such move by the publishing house. In January 2020, the IIME sent a letter to all state varsities saying that ‘on the instructions from the governor house, 25 copies of each of the coffee table book— Jaipur-The Gem of India and Marwadi Heritage—has been sent with a bill’. The publishing house charged Rs 2,03,750 for the books which had no MRP on them. The letter, followed by a phone call to the registrar of every university from the governor house, directing them to buy the books. The development of receiving a letter by the IIME was confirmed by four V-Cs who were contacted by the TOI. “I was aghast to read the letter directing us to purchase books which are of no academic value to the students. They have given the reference of the governor house and before we could have confirmed with the chancellor office, the registrar had got a call to buy these books,” said a V-C who was left with no choice but to accept the books and clear the bills. A registrar of a state university told that he had received a call from the governor house says that they cannot say no to a call from the office from the chancellor. Another V-C said, “It was absurd to see that how a private entity can dictate terms to us only due to the support he enjoys in the big offices. They forced us to buy a biography of the governor since they know they succeeded in the past.” Sujata Taknet, a researcher at IIME, told TOI on July 5 said that it is a routine practice for them to visit the new governor in the state and present coffee table books to them. “We have paid a visit to the former governors Margaret Alva, Kalyan Singh and Mishra soon after he was appointed here. Since our book Jaipur-The Gem of India is like a bible for Jaipur with having its past, present and future perspective we give to important personalities in the state,’ said Taknet. TOI called the director of IIME, D K Taknet, who refused to comment on the letter sent by them using the reference of governor Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/publisher-of-guvs-biography-used-raj-bhavan-to-sell-another-book-last-year/articleshow/84187507.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt tables amendments to Centre’s farm laws||MUMBAI: Against the backdrop of farmers’ groups demanding consultations on the legislations, the MVA government tabled its amendments to the Centre’s three farm laws on Tuesday in the state assembly and said these would be open for discussion for the next two months. Several farmers’ groups have already criticized the amendments. Agriculture minister Dada Bhuse said, “Our amendments uphold the minimum support price (MSP), require traders to be properly licensed and protect the payments to farmers.” The Central laws had been criticized for making no provision to uphold the MSP. The state’s amendment on the law governing farming contracts says agreements will not be valid unless the price paid is equal to or higher than MSP. However, it says agreements below MSP can be made for two years with the mutual consent of farmers and the sponsor, and that for crops without an MSP, agreements will be decided by mutual consent. “Many crops do not have an MSP. And companies can keep insisting on two-year agreements to get around the MSP rule,” said Kisan Sabha leader Ajit Navle. On the law governing trade in markets outside APMCs, the Central law only requires traders to have a PAN card to begin conducting business. The amendment requires traders to be licensed by a competent authority to protect farmers from being cheated. However, traders dealing in fruits, vegetables, spices and condiments are excluded from requiring the licenses since these goods have been removed from the APMC Act in Maharashtra. While the Central law requires farmers to approach a sub-divisional magistrate in the case of disputes, the amendment proposes a competent authority for dispute resolution. For non-payment of dues, the trader can face a three-year jail term or Rs 5 lakh fine. The Central law on the Essential Commodities Act does not allow states to regulate supply or impose stock limits on food stuff in case of calamity or price rise. The amendment gives the state that power. The BJP had boycotted the state assembly and was not present when the amendments were tabled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-govt-tables-amendments-to-centres-farm-laws/articleshow/84189528.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: ‘Can’t claim privilege for MLAs’ criminal act’, says Opposition leader V D Satheesan||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Opposition leader V D Satheesan has said there is no privilege for the MLAs if they indulge in any criminal activities inside the assembly. The privilege is only for the speeches they make in the House. If they attack an UDF MLA violently inside the House how can they claim privilege, he asked. While referring to the plea submitted by the state government and the MLAs to quash the assembly ruckus case charged against the LDF members in the House, the opposition leader said, “No court in the country will accept the demand of the state government.” It is a fact that no case can be registered based on the speeches made by the MLAs in the House. That is the only privilege an MLA gets. How can a government claim privilege when an MLA engages in a criminal activity, he asked? “These MLAs engaged in destroying the public property of the assembly. It is a criminal activity and cases have been registered for destroying public property. So if the government says that the MLA has a privilege to do anything inside the House, then if an MLA violently attacks another, then also will the government claim the same privilege?” asked Satheesan. It is strange that the state government and the LDF MLAs are claiming special privilege when they have indulged in a criminal activity inside the House. Will such an act inside the Parliament be pardoned, he asked. The LDF has been claiming that K M Mani is the biggest corrupt politician the state has witnessed and even his family was haunted by the LDF raising the bar bribery case. LDF had even claimed that Mani was having a currency-counting machine at this house. In fact, CPM should now publicly apologize for the insulting campaign they had conducted against Mani and his family. “Now the CPM secretary has claimed that they had blocked the entry of UDF in the assembly. Did they block Oommen Chandy or any other leaders during that incident? Their target was none other than K M Mani. The then party secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan had claimed that they will not allow a corrupt leader like K M Mani to present the budget. Now, how can they make such blatant lies before the people who have witnessed everything,” said Satheesan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cant-claim-privilege-for-mlas-criminal-act/articleshow/84185346.cms||---

Several fire tenders were pressed into service and doused the fire. Thick black smoke was billowing from the truck which enveloped nearby tea shacks and other shops. The villagers claimed that they had heard a loud explosion, possibly due to the truck falling from the bridge. The police said that the truck was travelling to New Delhi when the driver was suspected to have dozed off. The speeding truck floundered briefly before falling off the overbridge. The accident brought the entire traffic to a grinding halt. The police said that the driver escaped unscathed. “The truck had crashed on the service lane and no vehicle was passing through the lane when the accident took place,” an official said, adding that the traffic resumed after a few minutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/truck-carrying-chemicals-skids-off-bridge-catches-fire/articleshow/84187538.cms||---

Not only that, central minister Nitin Gadkari has volunteered to be its brand ambassador as Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) seeks out an urban space for the once ubiquitous village paint. After inaugurating KVIC’s cow dung paint plant in Jaipur, Gadkari not only placed an order for 1,000 litres to paint his Nagpur residence but also promised to encourage young entrepreneurs to take up its production. “Inaugurating infrastructure projects worth lakhs of crores of rupees is not as pleasing as I feel today after flagging off the manufacturing unit. Khadi prakritik (natural) paint has immense potential of creating sustainable development for the benefit of the poorest of the poor,” said the minister for road transport and highways & MSME. Indeed, it could be a game-changer for the rural economy if the natural paint garners even a fraction of the Rs 60,000-crore paint market in India. KVIC chairman Vinai Kumar Saxena said that the paint has many things going in its favour. “First, it comes at half the price of regular paints. The paint is anti-bacterial and anti-fungal, and has natural thermal insulation properties besides being eco-friendly, non-toxic, odorless and cost-effective,” said Saxena. So far, KVIC has sold over 11,000 litres through its stores and e-portal. The unit went on-stream in January this year as a prototype project producing 500 litres manually. With the commissioning of the new manufacturing unit using the latest technologies, the production capacity will go up to 1,000 litres a day. Saxena said KVIC is sharing techniques and processes with people who want to set up facilities in their villages and towns. “We are offering a five-day training programme. So far, the Kumarappa National Handmade Paper Institute (KNHPI) in Jaipur trained 418 persons. When these people set up units, they will not only create jobs for others but also help farmers,” added Saxena. KVIC has included this project under the Prime Minister Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) through which entrepreneurs can get loans with subsidies up to 35%. If the paint gets a traction in the market, cattle growers will also make a windfall from cow dung. For example, KNHPI buys dungs at Rs 5 a kg. Saxena said one cow on an average discharges 25kg a day, which means a substantial amount as income for farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/khadis-city-unit-makes-paint-from-cow-dung/articleshow/84187572.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

After the steering committee of the party held at the party headquarters on Tuesday, KC(M) chairman Jose K Mani met the reporters with a copy of the affidavit which was submitted by the government lawyer in the court and said that the name of K M Mani was not mentioned in it. Like Vijayaraghavan, Jose too put the blame on the media and also alleged that the UDF was using the name of Mani for political gains. When it was pointed out to Jose that the lawyer had made the reference verbally, he replied that though the lawyer made a reference about the corruption during the tenure of the former finance minister, the name of Mani was not referred to. “When the judge asked about the circumstances which lead to such a protest in the assembly, the lawyer said about the corruption allegation. However, he never said the name of Mani. At the time of the ruckus the probe on bar bribery case was going on,” Jose said. He also asked whether anyone becomes guilty if an allegation is raised against that person. “Later, Mani was not found guilty in the investigation done by both the UDF and LDF governments, vigilance court too did not find him guilty and the high court has also approved this, he said. On Monday, KC(M) had lodged a strong protest with the government regarding the references made about Mani by the lawyer in the court. Jose had kept mum on the issue and it was party general secretary Stephen George who made a strong-worded protest. However, on Tuesday it became clear that the KC(M) had softened its stand after Vijayarghavan said that Mani’s name was not referred to in the court and put the entire blame on the media. Endorsing Vijayaraghavan’s statement, Jose also said that KC(M) had examined in detail about the court proceedings and affidavit and are convinced that no reference about Mani was made. The lone minister of the party, Roshy Augustine, also said that the lawyer said about the corruption allegation while replying to a question by the judge. Meanwhile, Jose as well as the party appear to be in a mood to close the issue once and for all. At present, the KC(M) has no other option other than to support the CPM and the LDF to come out of the assembly ruckus case. Any setback from the court in the case will put the LDF government in defence. The SC has adjourned the hearing in the case to July 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/manis-name-not-mentioned-in-affidavit-says-kcm/articleshow/84185410.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair
---||Mumbai||Elderly man from Andheri becomes sextortion victim||MUMBAI: An elderly man from Andheri became the victim in a sextortion case recently after he accepted the friendship request of a stranger on social media. The 57-year-old victim was shot in the nude by cyberfraudsters who demanded money against the video clip. When he did not pay up, the video was uploaded online to defame him. Andheri police have registered a case of extortion and defamation and are looking for the culprits. According to the victim's complaint, he had received a friendship request on Facebook from a woman on June 23. He accepted the request though he did not know her. The woman's profile said her name was Riya Verma. Soon after, she sent him a message on Facebook Messenger asking for his contact number. Not suspecting anything, he replied that both his phone numbers were already mentioned on his Facebook profile. On June 26, the complainant had gone for a bath when his phone rang. He asked his grandson to pass him the handset into the bathroom, presuming it would be an important call. "It was a WhatsApp video call. When I answered the call, a woman appeared on screen in the nude. I was baffled and disconnected the line. Thereafter, the caller dialled repeatedly but I did not answer," the complainant said in his statement. The same evening, he received a call from another number. The man on the other end said he had shot a nude video of the complainant and he should pay up to Rs 50000 if he wanted the video to be deleted. The complainant asked the man to send him the video for confirmation. On June 27, the complainant received a video clip that had been shot while he had been in the bath and had answered the woman's WhatsApp video call. The complainant alleged that his face was morphed in the clip. When the caller called back demanding money, the complainant told him he did not have so much cash. At this, the caller negotiated to Rs 21999 and asked him to make a bank transfer. The complainant kept delaying and failed to make the payement. Subsequently, the complainant received a phone call from his friend about his nude video appearing on Facebook. The complainant, on July 3, approached the Andheri police to lodge a complaint. No arrest has been made so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-57-year-old-refuses-to-pay-sextortion-money-nude-video-uploaded-online/articleshow/84187560.cms||---

Sources in the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) said that water supply in the evening will be disrupted on Wednesday. “If all goes well, we are likely to restore the water supply on Thursday morning,” said a senior AMC official. The north-west zone mainly includes areas like Bodakdev, Chandlodia, Ghatlodia, Thaltej, Gota. “We have a team of 35 people who are at the site to speed up the water supply link,” said a senior AMC water supply department assistant engineer.

He did not specify any date this time, meaning that it may take some more time. He played down factional fights and bickering among party functionaries as part of democracy existing in all parties and cited examples of similar incidents in Karnataka BJP. Maken said he would discuss all issues with the CM. Speaking to the media after a review meeting of the Covid victims' outreach programme and party sponsored agitation programme from July 7 to 17 against price rise, he said he would discuss all issues with the chief minister during his meeting on Tuesday night. “It is true that ministerial slots in the cabinet are vacant and political appointments have to be made. District and block-level appointments in party organisations would also take place. It is our endeavour to hold discussions with all,” he said after a meeting with party office-bearers here. Maken, however, trained his guns on the Modi government alleging that the Centre has been discriminating against Congress-ruled states. He asked how the Centre could differentiate a state based on the party ruling that state. "We have seen it earlier in the allotment of oxygen, medicines during the second wave of Covid and, now, in the allotment of vaccines,” he said. Maken said the PM Cares fund was flush with money collected from CSR funds of public sector undertakings and private corporates, but only the prime minister was authorised to spend it. There is no tender and audit of the account of the expenditure incurred from this fund. The common people are thus deprived of information on expenditure. In the last seven years, the Modi government had failed to prove any of the corruption charges levelled against the Congress, he said. Lauding the Congress government for launching the relief scheme for children orphaned and women widowed by Covid, he said the party had launched an outreach programme to spread awareness and collect information on further relief required for victims of Covid in the state. While the people are suffering due to Covid on the one hand, the Modi government policies have resulted in unprecedented inflation on the other. The party will launch a 10-day campaign against it from July 7 to 17 across the country, he said. PCC president Govind Singh Dotasra said on July 7, the Mahila Congress would organise a dharna at all district headquarters. From July 8 to 15, the Congress workers would collect signatures at petrol pumps for the memorandum to be submitted to the central government. On July 16, a 5km cycle rally will be taken out at all district headquarters, followed by state-level functions against fuel price hike on July 17, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cabinet-rejig-postings-in-due-course-maken/articleshow/84187619.cms||---

Katara lost to Suthar in the bypoll to Morva Hadaf constituency, which is reserved for the Scheduled Tribe candidates. On Katara raising question on validity of the MLA’s caste certificate, Justice Nikhil Kariel issued summons to Suthar and others including the ECI on Monday under provisions of the Representation of the People Act. The HC has asked them to appear before the court on August 2. Suthar won the assembly by-election to the Morva Hadaf constituency on May 2. Katara then moved the HC seeking direction to set aside Suthar’s poll victory and alleged that the caste certificate that she had submitted was “false and unverified”. Katara had claimed that Suthar did not belong to the ST community. He alleged that her caste certificate was false and had been submitted without any verification. Katara claimed that he had raised objection against Suthar’s nomination form before the Returning Officer ahead of polling, but his representation was rejected. He alleged that Suthar has usurped the right of a genuine ST person to represent the constituency through her fraudulent act. The by-election in Morva Hadaf in Panchmahal district was held due to the demise of Independent MLA Bhupendra Khant in January. Earlier, Khant'’s caste certificate was invalidated by the state government and he was disqualified as a legislator. Khant had challenged the governor’s decision to disqualify him, but his petition was rendered infructuous because of his death during the pendency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-summons-mla-ec-over-challenge-to-election-result/articleshow/84187615.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Remarks against former finance minister KM Mani; CPM blames the media||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With the government counsel making a statement in the Supreme Court that former finance minister KM Mani was ‘corrupt’ while arguing in the assembly ruckus case, an embarrassed CPM has blamed it squarely on the media alleging that ‘a section of anti-Left media manufactured the news with political motives’. LDF convener A Vijayaraghavan said that not even the name of KM Mani was mentioned in the Supreme Court in this regard. “Media misinterpreted the facts that came up in court. There is an ill-motive in it. KC(M) is one of the main coalition partners of the LDF and coalition partners are functioning with mutual respect. A section of the media is trying to create confusion. In that respect, this is a created news,” he said on Tuesday. Vijayaraghavan said the protest in the assembly was against UDF’s corruption. He added that vigilance had found that Mani was ‘clean’ in the bar bribery case. “KM Mani had a long political career in state and was an experienced public activist. Vigilance had found that Mani had no personal responsibility in the bar bribery case,” he said, adding that KC (M) was part of UDF but had joined the LDF after disowning the former after finding it a corrupt front. The government’s counsel in the Supreme Court had justified the ruckus made by the then opposition (LDF) as a protest against a ‘corrupt politician’ referring to K M Mani. KC (M) – which was then an ally of UDF and currently with LDF –had taken exception to the counsel’s remarks. It had demanded withdrawal of the reference against KM Mani in court. UDF leaders demanded that Jose K Mani should explain his justification for continuing in the LDF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/remarks-against-mani-cpm-blames-the-media/articleshow/84185442.cms||---

Asked about speculation that the erstwhile saffron allies were getting closer, especially after Thackeray’s meeting with PM Modi last month, Thackeray replied, “What happened despite us being together for 30 years? What can be expected now?” He was speaking to the media after the conclusion of the two-day monsoon session of the legislature. Referring to Monday’s incident involving 12 BJP legislators who were suspended for a year for unruly behaviour before presiding officer Bhaskar Jadhav and to the BJP’s boycott of legislative business on Tuesday, Thackeray said, “We feel ashamed of incidents that happened in the last two days. Opposition party members abused Jadhav. Voters have sent someone to the assembly expecting that the elected representative will help change their lives.” He added, “If the opposition is accusing us of throttling or blackening democracy by suspending its members, what are you (BJP) doing by making attempts to put pressure through the ED and CBI? Is it cleaning of democracy?” He further said, “If the opposition could not face the government and could not do what is expected , they (BJP) should publicly state they can’t face the government and will misuse power to put the (state) government under pressure through Central agencies.” On the OBC quota, Devendra Fadnavis had claimed the Centre could not provide empirical data on OBCs as it was faulty.

---||Mumbai||Like Rona Wilson’s, Surendra Gadling’s computer too attacked with malware: US lab report||MUMBAI: Over four months after its first cyber forensic report of alleged malware attack on Elgar Parishad case accused Rona Wilson’s laptop, a US-based consultant recently said the computer of co-accused Surendra Gadling was similarly “compromised”. The June 21 report of Arsenal Consulting said a computer belonging to Gadling, a human rights lawyer from Nagpur, was attacked with NetWire, a “malware”, for nearly two years before his arrest on June 6, 2018. Accused of alleged Maoist links, Gadling was also charged under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Gadling’s defence team had sent electronic evidence seized on April 17, 2018, from his home by Pune police. According to his lawyers, his computer was “first compromised” on February 29, 2016. The report’s ‘executive summary’ said “Gadling’s computer was compromised for just over 20 months by the same attacker identified in Reports I and II”. “It is obvious that their primary goals were surveillance and incriminating document delivery. Arsenal has effectively caught the attacker red-handed based on remnants of their activity left behind in file system,’’ it added. Wilson, also a human rights activist, incarcerated since his arrest in June 2018, had in February approached the HC to quash the criminal prosecution against him citing the February 8 Arsenal report. The report had said his computer was “compromised’’ for 22 months and the “top 10 incriminating documents” delivered to it via malware. His petition is pending before the HC. Wilson said that the 22,000-page chargesheet shows that prosecution against 16 accused— now 15, following Fr Stan Swamy’s demise on Monday—is based “entirely on electronic evidence”. The case had been transferred to the NIA in January 2020. The March 27 Arsenal report had said that Gadling’s computer was first compromised on February 29, 2016. The attacker made three particularly relevant attempts at compromising his computer via email, sending him identical malware, but packaged differently, on February 12 (two emails), and February 18, 2016, it had added. In its June 21 report, the US-based consultant said, “Arsenal has connected the same attacker to a significant malware infrastructure which was deployed over the course of approximately four years to not only attack and compromise Gadling’s computer for 20 months, but to attack his co-defendants…and defendants in other high-profile Indian cases as well.” Arsenal has also recovered communications with the attacker’s command and control server from Gadling’s computer. In conclusion, it added: “It should be noted that this is one of the most serious cases involving evidence tampering that Arsenal has ever encountered, based on various metrics which include the vast timespan between the delivery of the first and last incriminating documents on multiple defendants computers.” Gadling’s defence team had sent electronic evidence seized on April 17, 2018, from his home by Pune Police. The team informed Arsenal that “14 documents” from his computer were “particularly important in this case”. The Arsenal report said it “found no evidence which would suggest that the 14 important documents were ever interacted with in any legitimate way on Gadling’s computer, either in their original location on the tertiary volume or in their current location on the Windows volume.” “Arsenal produced two reports in this case related to Wilson (Report I on February 8, 2021, and Report II on March 27, 2021) and was then asked by Gadling’s defence team to produce a report regarding our analysis of electronic evidence seized from his home,” said Mark Spencer, president of Arsenal in Chelsea, in the report. Senior counsel Indira Jainsing, who appeared for Gadling in a matter on Tuesday, told TOI, “We have seen the Arsenal report. Legal action will be pursued on the basis of remedies available in law.”When contacted, additional solicitor general Anil Singh, who appears for NIA in the various petitions filed by Elgar Parishad case accused before the HC, told TOI, “I have not seen the US forensic report.” Questioning its value at this juncture, he added, “It can be tested or gone into during the trial.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/like-ronas-gadlings-computer-too-attacked-with-malware-us-lab-report/articleshow/84189622.cms||Swati Deshpande

Many speakers said that the party failed to get Christian votes despite trying and it was pointed out that the raising of Love Jihad and Sabarimala issues did not make much of an impact. Also, some office-bearers pointed out that there were shortcomings in candidate selection and factional preferences had come into play in many seats, costing the party dear. Some leaders said that adopting a strident rhetoric in the run up to elections and also during Vijay Yatra had made the minorities wary and steps should be taken to bring them closer to the party. There was a lengthy debate on the issue especially on whether the party drawing lessons from electoral drubbing should change its political strategy from a strident Hindutva posture to a soft Hindutva stand. However, prabhari CP Radhakrishnan told the meeting that BJP being a national party, it cannot take a separate stand for the state and it will not dilute its core values. He also said that the party will not allow the state government to haunt party president K Surendran. The discussions began with party general secretary MT Ramesh presenting the agenda and he touched upon the shortcomings in the party’s election management on a self-critical note. The meeting decided that all the four general secretaries and vice-president AN Radhakrishnan would visit all assembly constituencies by dividing the state into zones to get feedback from the ground-level cadres on where things went wrong. Earlier in his opening remarks, Surendran said that maintaining party discipline was of crucial importance and that the meeting would discuss steps to protect party discipline and it would discuss organizational steps to correct people who violate party discipline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/bjp-leaders-blame-organizational-lapses/articleshow/84185450.cms||---

---||Rajkot||Health dept to probe mask scam||Palanpur: After the then Chief District Health Officer (CDHO) of Banaskantha district, Dr Manish Fancy was transferred around a month ago, a departmental inquiry has been initiated against him in what appears to be huge scam in mass procurement. In a single day, 21,000 masks were purchased at an exorbitant price of Rs 47 lakh meant for 13 talukas of Banaskantha. This figure does not include those masks which were purchased at the hospitals that were started at Palanpur, Deesa and Dhanera to tackle the rising Covid-19 cases. Taking a serious note of Dr Fancy’s inappropriate conduct as well as for harassing employees and initiating punitive action against a few doctors who refused to cooperate with him, the state government has taken the coercive action. Dr Fancy will have to answer the purchase of N95 masks procured at ‘unexplained’ prices. District development officer Swapnil Khare said that the probe is being conducted by Health Department in Gandhinagar.In an order dated March 30, 2020, GMSCL had imposed a ceiling price for the purchase of N95 masks not exceeding Rs 49.61 per unit which it sent to all subordinate offices of the Health Department by Gujarat Medical Services Corporation Limited (public enterprise of Gujarat government).But misusing his official position, Dr Fancy forcibly secured the ID and password of all the taluka health officers under him and procured the masks from a single Sabarkantha agency at a far greater price. Those officers who protested were demoted from taluka health officer level to medical officer. Officers in Dhanera and Lakhni were replaced, while in-charge RCHO, Dr NK Garg, an EMO, was removed from the procurement committee by Dr Fancy. Had the purchases been made as per the government stipulated price, the cost would have been Rs 10.42 lakh. But Dr Fancy spent Rs 47.32 lakh for the same product from public money with total disregard to financial propriety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/health-dept-to-probe-mask-scam/articleshow/84182913.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: 15-day rescue operation goes on for boy to grant mother’s wish||JAIPUR: In one of the longest rescue operations, which has been going on for the past 15 days, the Pali district administration and armed forces worked round-the-clock to recover the body of a 15-year-old boy who was buried while working in an 80-year-old well at Borendi village in Sojat City on June 21. The well is 185 feet deep and eight feet wide. The rescue operations are still going on as the body of the boy, Narendra Nayak, has not been recovered so far. Experts had proposed abandoning the mission seven days after the incident, saying that there were no chances of the boy surviving for so long under the debris.  Narendra NayakThe teenager’s mother, Indira Devi, however, insisted on giving her son a respectful funeral. This moved the rescue teams to go beyond the mandate and they are still digging the porous well with three grinding machines, five JCBs and a 100-member team to retrieve the body. So far, Rs 1.5 crore has been spent on the mission, excluding the daily expenses of the rescue team. Indira DeviThe accident had occurred when Nayak was filling the cracks, developed 40 feet below the surface of the well, standing on a 'machan' (platform) along with another labourer. “A portion of the wall collapsed, leading to sand behind the wall cascading over both of them. They were pushed to the collapsed side of the wall. The other labourer was experienced and held on to a rope and climbed out to safety. But the sand continued to fall on Nayak finally burying him," said Sojat City DySP Hemant Kumar, who is in charge of the operation. The rescue work began immediately as Nayak had the best chance of survival in the first 2-3 days. But the operation was hampered as the site had only sand without any hard rocks. The team also had to work 40 feet below the surface. The army engineers were called after local labourers and experts from the district failed in their initial efforts. The army engineers created ramps for heavy machines to dig, lift the debris and drain the water using two heavy submersible machines. “On the 8th day, we found a slipper belonging to Nayak in mud eight feet below the site of the accident. Thereafter, there were no signs of the victim," said Kumar. When the team started thinking about calling the mission off, the family urged the rescue team to find his body to give him a proper cremation. “Nayak was the only son in his family. He was hired by a local man for Rs 500 to cement the fissures in the well. The site was vulnerable and experienced labourers had refused to work in the past. Nayak's uncle has filed a case against the owner of the well under the relevant sections of child labour,” said village pradhan. TOI tried to contact Nayak's uncle, Dagla Ram Nayak, but failed to get connected. “His mother Devi’s condition is not good. She was given a drip some days ago due to the trauma. It was decided that the mission will continue till we find the boy,” said Kumar. An expert said that the mission may have to be stopped if the rain falls and poses a danger to rescue workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/15-day-rescue-op-goes-on-for-boy-to-grant-mothers-wish/articleshow/84187664.cms||Shoeb Khan

Vikas Yadav, a resident of Nalanda Society, was caught for smuggling Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL). The city crime branch also seized 622 boxes containing IMFL bottles worth Rs 37 lakh from his godown in Narol area. According to the cops, police were tipped off that Yadav had been concealing a large number of liquor bottles in the godown. The police carried out a raid and found liquor and sacks of wheat grains at the godown. They arrested Sandip Jat, 21, who was a security guard at the godown. Jat told cops that Yadav had bought the liquor bottles from a man named Ravindra Jat, a resident of Hisar town in Haryana. Sources in the crime branch said that Yadav had brought bottles from Ravindra many times in the past. He allegedly used to deliver it to various other bootleggers in the city. “Yadav had been in the liquor business for around a year. Since supply of grains was permitted during lockdown and curfew hours, he easily smuggled in large quantity of liquor bottles from Haryana by hiding them in wheat sacks,” said police who have filed a case under prohibition act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/liquor-stored-in-wheat-sacks-1-held/articleshow/84187697.cms||---

On Tuesday, Kalol town reported five cases, prompting Gandhinagar collector Kuldeep Arya to declare under the Epidemic Diseases Act for a period of one month, the area within a 2km radius of Kalol as affected by the ailment. The district health authorities had collected 38 food samples from various parts of the town of which five tested positive for cholera. The disease mainly spreads through water or food contamination. District officials suspect contamination of drinking water due to rupture in underground civic lines. Engineering teams have been formed to identify the leak and rectify them. On Friday last week, Nadiad town in Kheda district was declared as cholera-affected. Here too the process to identify leakage in drainage lines is being carried out to stop the contamination. While one of the four patients detected with the disease has been discharged, a six-year-old boy, a two-year-old boy and a 16-year-old boy with the disease are still under observation.

---||India||India closely watching Xi’s ‘intriguing move’ on LAC||NEW DELHI: India is closely examining President Xi Jinping’s “unusual and intriguing move” to replace the overall commander of the Western Theatre Command (WTC), which handles the entire border with India, barely seven months after he took charge. Xu Qiling (58), commander of the ground forces in the western theatre until now, has been promoted to a full general and replaced WTC chief General Zhang Xudong, in a change that has come amidst the continuing military confrontation in eastern Ladakh since April-May last year. “Zhang (59) had taken over as the WTC chief in December last year from Gen Zhao Zongqi, who retired at the age of 65. Nobody at that rank in the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is removed within seven months. It’s definitely unusual. In effect, this is the third change in the WTC chief since the military standoff with India began,” said a senior official. Apart from Xu, often described as a “rising star” in the PLA and among the youngest to become a full general now, the other three to be promoted on Monday are: Southern Theatre Command chief Wang Xiubin, PLA Army commander Liu Zhenli, and PLA Strategic Support (Missile) Force commander Ju Qiansheng. Indian officials say it’s “premature” to speculate on the change in the WTC, the largest of the five Chinese theatre commands that handles the entire 3,488-km LAC from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh. Incidentally, with no integrated theatre command as yet, India has as many as four Army and three IAF commands for the “northern borders” with China. “Zhang could have been removed as part of the periodic anti-corruption purge by the Chinese Communist Party, which celebrated its centenary on July 1. Or, it could be connected to the border crisis with India. We have to wait and watch,” said another official. The change in the WTC leadership comes ahead of the impending 12th round of corps commander-level talks between India and China, which will be held over three months after the last one on April 9. Xu was earlier hand-picked by President Xi, who is also chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission (CMC) that controls the PLA, to be the commander of the ground forces in the WTC in June last year just a few days before the violent clashes between Indian and Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley. As the overall WTC chief now, he will be the key player in the protracted negotiations between India and China to defuse the border crisis. Sources say that while the PLA is now willing to discuss the stalled troop disengagement at patrolling points (PPs) 15, 17 and 17A in the Hot Springs-Gogra-Kongka La area in eastern Ladakh, it has refused to stop blocking Indian patrols in the strategically-located Depsang Plains.

---||Vadodara||MSU to house dispute resolution centre||Vadodara: If things go as planned, MS University’s Faculty of Law will soon house a centre that will help people resolve their commercial, trade-related or family-related conflicts and disputes. The proposed Sayajirao Centre of Alternative Dispute Resolution (SCADR) will not only help people in out-of-court settlement but also provide free legal aid to the disputants. The centre will be a practical ground for future lawyers to learn alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanism before they join courts. Litigations are often time-consuming and expensive. In Covid-19 era, courts had remained closed for almost more than a year. “Even as they have reopened, they are dealing with only urgent matters. We have proposed SCADR as a centre which can help resolve disputes between parties so that instead of going to court of law, they can settle commercial, trade, family or other civil disputes without going to court. This will also reduce the increasing burden on courts,” said professor Uma Iyer, officer on special duty and director of Baroda School of Legal Studies at Faculty of Law. With importance of ADR techniques including conciliation, mediation and negotiation growing globally, especially in trade, it is seen as a more viable option to sort out disputes. “The Bar Council of India has also made course on ADR compulsory for students of law. For students too it is a new avenue in their career,” she said. The faculty wants to involve all stakeholders including students, teachers, lawyers, district legal services authority, mediation centre and arbitration centre in the centre’s activities. “We are hopeful that we will be able to operationalise the centre in the next three months by roping in all the subject experts on one platform,” she said. The long-term plan includes setting up legal aid cell or legal aid clinic as well. “We are hopeful that the centre will strengthen dispute settlement process and it will lead to win-win situation for disputed parties,” she said. New PhD facilitation centre soon As per directives of education departmSent of Gujarat government, a PhD facilitation centre will be set up at MSU. Vice-chancellor professor Parimal Vyas said that 14 universities in the state have been provided Rs 9 lakh each to set up such a centre in their respective campuses. “We already have research and consultancy cell, internal quality assurance cell and students facilitation centre. Through the PhD facilitation centre, we will have two dedicated persons, who will guide and help students on how to pursue their PhDs right from the time of entrance test,” said Vyas, who has prepared the detailed proposal. Every year, more than 1,000 students appear for the PhD entrance test conducted by university for various departments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/msu-to-house-dispute-resolution-centre/articleshow/84183010.cms||Prashant Rupera

---||Ahmedabad||Warehouse leasing drops in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: Warehouse leasing in Ahmedabad took a beating in fiscal 2021 due to the pandemic-induced slowdown and the high base of financial year 2020. The transactions, however, witnessed a surge in Surat, Vadodara and Vapi on the back of demand from third party logistics (3PL) companies, and e-commerce and industrial players. Warehouse space leasing in Ahmedabad dropped by 42% to 30 lakh square feet (sq ft) in fiscal 2020-21 from 51 lakh sq ft in 2019-20. The details were part of India Warehousing Report 2021, released on Tuesday by Knight Frank India, a real estate consultant. The drop in warehousing transactions in Ahmedabad was largely due to the economic stress caused by the pandemic. “It is to be noted that the decline comes against a very high base of fiscal 2020 which was whipped up by the large space take up by the e-commerce and 3PL segments,” the report said. Meanwhile, warehousing rentals in Ahmedabad corrected by 2-4%. On the contrary, cities such as Surat, Vapi and Vadodara saw an increase in warehousing leasing during the year. Riding on the demand from third party logistics companies and e-commerce players, transactions in Surat’s warehousing market jumped by 80% to 8.27 lakh sq ft. “Third party logistics garnered 50% share of transactions followed by e-commerce at 25%. The rents have largely been stable due to the rise in demand from these segments,” the report added. In the case of Vapi, warehouse leasing volumes galloped by 296% to 6.34 lakh sq ft. About 38% of the leasing demand was from industrial segments which included various kinds of light to heavy manufacturing activities. And 62% was from the warehousing segment, which is generally used for storage. Warehousing in Vapi is largely fragmented. Small clusters are in and around the city and the supply is shared between Vapi, Daman and Silvassa. For Vadodara, warehousing space leasing grew by 2.5% to 4.51 lakh sq ft in FY21 from 4.40 lakh sq ft in FY20. Companies in other sectors (all manufacturing fields except FMCG, such as automobile, electronics and pharmaceuticals) garnered a 77% share of the transactions. This was followed by 3PL and e-commerce. For all four cities put together, the total warehouse leasing in Gujarat was recorded at 48 lakh sq ft, the report added. “Gujarat’s warehousing market during the pandemic has flipped, with established centres not performing to their full potential, primarily because of the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic,” said Balbirsingh Khalsa, national director, industrial & logistics, Knight Frank India. Khalsa added: “Other markets performed better due to the renewed demand from the e-commerce and 3PL segments.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/warehouse-leasing-drops-in-ahmedabad/articleshow/84187734.cms||---
---||Kochi||Journalist Siddique Kappan denied bail by Mathura court||AGRA: A Mathura court, on Tuesday, rejected the bail plea of journalist Siddique Kappan, who was booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). Kappan was arrested, with three others, while they were going to Hathras to meet the family members of an alleged gang rape and murder victim on October 5 last year. After hearing arguments of both the prosecution and defence for two days, additional sessions judge Anil Kumar Pandey rejected the bail plea on Tuesday. The court primarily took into account the alleged material collected against the journalist during the investigation while denying him the bail. Talking to TOI, Kappan’s lawyer Wills Mathews, who argued in the Mathura court on Tuesday, said, “We were expecting to get bail in the light of the Supreme Court’s directives asking us to approach the lower court for getting bail. Though chargesheet was filed, no evidence was produced in support of the allegations levelled against Kappan.” “Our arguments are not reflected in the order and only prosecution allegations are mentioned in today’s order, despite the fact that we had filed a written submission,” said Mathews. In its order, the court noted that allegations against Kappan is that he along with the co-accused ‘committed acts that promoted enmity within the society and affected the communal harmony which are directly related to disrupting the peaceful atmosphere and inciting riots’. It has also been alleged that Kappan ‘had received foreign funding for the purpose of damaging the integrity of the nation’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/siddique-kappan-denied-bail-by-mathura-court/articleshow/84185486.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Man posing as CBI special counsel in cop net||KOLKATA: A lawyer staying at Baranagar and reportedly practising in Calcutta HC and Supreme Court was arrested by Gariahat police for allegedly cheating and posing as a standing counsel of the state government as well as a CBI special counsel. An Alipore court has sent him to police custody till July 16. Cops have alleged that Sanatan Ray Chaudhuri had tried to “illegally” capture a property in the Gariahat area. Ray Chaudhuri was arrested after being intercepted in the Amherst Street area on Sunday. His car with a blue beacon was recovered from the Sinthee area. The cheating complaint against him had been registered on June 30, following which police verified the credentials with both state government and CBI before moving in and making the arrest. A beacon-fitted car used by the accusedPolice claimed Ray Chaudhuri had used the fake identity to call the Taltala OC on June 25 and asked him to help someone. At the court hearing, public prosecutor Sourin Ghosal stated how the accused had prepared forged documents claiming that Calcutta HC had made him the receiver of the property at Gariahat. “He claimed that he was granted permission to promote the property. We need to investigate how he prepared the forged document and need him in police custody,” said Ghosal. Defence counsel Tirthankar Roy said severe charges were slapped on an innocent man. He said the complainant is mainly fighting a property dispute case and it was a civil matter. The wife of the accused said: “I am not aware of any fraud. We have with us relevant documents. I will go to the police station to enquire about the arrest.” The arrest comes within a fortnight of police arresting fake IAS officer Debanjan Deb who had organized false vaccination camps. Another such imposter, Md Asiful Haque, who used to pose as a senior vigilance officer, was arrested from Shakespeare Sarani a week ago. DC (SED) Sudip Sarkar said: “We received the complaint against Ray Chaudhuri a week ago. During investigation, we have prima facie found evidence that indicates that he was involved in forgery, impersonation of a public servant and criminal conspiracy with others to usurp a land and building in the Gariahat area. The accused used to move in a blue beacon-fitted SUV and impersonated as the standing counsel of the state government on social media. The accused had also written on his social media accounts that he is a CBI special counsel.” Just like Debanjan, some of Ray Chaudhuri’s photographs with political leaders have surfaced. One of them is with actor-turned-BJP leader Rudranil Ghosh. “I knew him as an advocate. There are several people I meet everyday. I did not know him personally,” said Ghosh.  Cops have recovered documents which show that Chaudhuri had applied for primary membership of BJP. Trinamool and BJP got involved in a political slugfest over this. TMC MP Saugata Roy said: “The BJP needs to explain how their membership cards are lying in the houses of fraudsters. They also need to explain the photographs of the fraudster with Rudranil Ghosh. BJP leader Joy Prakash Majumder said: “When the money from Saradha dried out, TMC leaders set up a factory to make fake officers. The result is bogus officers across the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/man-posing-as-cbi-spl-counsel-in-cop-net/articleshow/84185475.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The girl and her parents were brought to a house near Amroha railway station by their “influential” neighbours on the pretext of searching for the missing couple on June 28 -- a day after the elopement. But they had other plans, "to teach a lesson to the family". The girl was allegedly gang-raped by the missing woman’s father, brothers and uncles as her parents looked on helplessly in horror. On June 29, the parents were told to leave with a warning that the girl would be killed if they approached the police. The girl was held hostage and raped for another four days before she was released on July 4. Additional superintendent of police (rural) Vidya Sagar Mishra told TOI, “We registered an FIR after the girl came back home and narrated the ordeal. Both the families knew each other for several years and their relations soured after the elder brother of the survivor eloped with the daughter of the accused.” Mishra added: “We will ensure an impartial investigation in this case. Multiple teams have been formed to search for the accused. We are also searching for the couple and an investigation in that case is also on.” The girl’s father said, “My son went missing on June 27 along with the daughter of Rajesh (name changed) who lives in the same village. Next morning, Rajesh along with his son and relatives forcibly took me, my wife and daughter to Amroha claiming that they were searching for my son. In Amroha, all of them thrashed us and gang-raped my daughter in front of our eyes. Later, one of them married her off despite our pleas for mercy. We were sent back home and were threatened to remain quiet. We gave a complaint to police on June 29, but no action was taken initially by police.” Later, when the girl reached home on July 4, an FIR was registered against eight persons under sections 376-D (gang-rape), 342 (wrongful confinement), 506 (criminal intimidation), 354 (attempt to outrage the modesty of a woman) along with relevant sections of the POCSO Act. While seven of them were named, one is unidentified. Police are carrying out raids in search of the accused. The rape survivor’s aunt, who lives in the neighbourhood, told TOI, “The accused are very influential. They can do the same to other girls in our family. We are very scared and want action against them.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/girl-16-raped-by-8-of-family-as-revenge-after-her-bro-elopes-with-their-kin/articleshow/84183087.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The new pipeline is expected to improve the drinking water supply to Puliyakulam and Town Hall areas. A corporation source said, “Presently, drinking water is supplied to Puliyakulam and Town Hall areas from Ramakrishnapuram master storage reservoir through a 450mm diameter asbestos cement pipe via Nanjappa Road, Avinashi Road, Arts College Road and Trichy Road.

The deceased was identified as Tushar Atri, an unmarried sailor hailing from Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh. Atri was found dead around 2:30am at one of the security posts along the boundary wall of the naval base, where he was deployed on guard duty. The bullet was apparently discharged from his service rifle. According to the police, preliminary investigation suggested it to be a case of suicide. Atri who joined the Navy last year is currently ranked seaman II. He was on guard duty on one of the watchtowers near Kendriya Vidyalaya in Katari Bagh. Another personnel on guard duty found him lying unconscious with a bullet injury on his head. Navy later alerted the Harbour Police about the death. “Prima facie it is a suspected case of suicide but we are yet to find whether he accidently pulled the trigger of the service rifle. The duty personnel from other watchtowers tried to contact him over wireless radio but he did not respond after multiple attempts. Later, one of the personnel went to check on him and found him lying unconscious with a broken skull. More investigation needs to be done and we are waiting for the postmortem report,” said police sources. A case of unnatural death has been registered and police are checking the phone of the deceased. The postmortem was done at Ernakulam Medical College, Kalamassery, and the body will be flown to his native in UP in a civil aircraft on Wednesday after completing the procedures at the naval base.

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Fuel price hike hits micro, small and medium enterprises’ revival hopes||COIMBATORE: The constant hike in fuel prices has hit the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the district hard at a time when they are struggling to remain afloat after the lockdown-induced shutdown for nearly two months. On Tuesday, petrol and diesel prices shot up to Rs 101.27 and Rs 94.44, respectively, in the district. J James, district president, Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises, said the hike in fuel and raw materials had dealt a big blow on the MSMEs, which were struggling to revive from the impact of the lockdown. Pointing out that most of the raw materials were brought to the city from other states, especially northern parts of the country, he said the transportation charges had doubled in the past two years. James said, “Logistic companies used to charge us Rs 4,000 to Rs 4,500 for transporting raw materials weighing a tonne to the city from Mumbai about two years ago. Now, they are charging more than Rs 8,000 per tonne because of the rise in fuel prices. Similarly, goods vehicles and autos that had charged Rs 250 to Rs 300 for transporting goods to a distance of 10km have now doubled the fare.” M V Ramesh Babu, president, Coimbatore District Small Industries Association, expressed a similar point and said the product cost had increased significantly because of the rise in prices of fuel and raw materials. “Not all the buyers are ready to revise the prices of products in tandem with the rise in manufacturing cost.” He said most of the workers were using own vehicles to travel to the workplace. “They are now demanding the employers to revise their wages as they are forced to shell out a considerable portion of their wage on the fuel. “We have no option but to consider their demand as the skilled workers are our assets. We cannot afford to lose them.” Many of the industries also use diesel and other lubricants in the manufacturing process. Their expenses have gone up recently, Ramesh Babu said. K Maniraj, president, Kovai Power Driven Pumps and Spares Manufacturers Association, said most of the raw materials for making pump sets were purchased from northern parts of the country. Along with the raw material price hike, he said, their transport cost has also increased. “It has increased our burden. The government should immediately intervene and take steps to control the price rise. If not, it will be very difficult for us to survive.” He said there were times when their margin of profit used to be at least 5%. “But nowadays, we are working only to minimize our loss. Some of us continue to manufacture products by incurring loss just to retain our customers and for the sake of being in the field, while others have left the industry without being able to bear the loss.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/fuel-price-hike-hits-msmes-revival-hopes/articleshow/84185534.cms||Nivedha Selvam
---||India||SC upholds axing of BSF jawan who allowed influx||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday put on record what has been happening at the Indo-Bangladesh border but often denied officially - the armed forces personnel taking bribes to let in illegal Bangladeshi migrants, which has been a huge internal security problem in the entire north-east. This issue came up before a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah, which was hearing an appeal filed by a BSF jawan who challenged a Delhi High Court order refusing to reinstate him. He was dismissed for allowing illegal migrants from Bangladesh into India while on border sentry duty on November 17, 2019. It was alleged that while on daytime duty at border post at Gunarmath, "the jawan failed to perform his duty properly and was negligent enough which resulted in an exfiltration bid by Bangladeshi nationals, wherein a heavy iron ladder was placed on the fence to scale over the fence and attempt was made in his presence to cross the fence in close proximity to his place of duty. He also didn't take any interest in apprehending these illegal migrants, which resulted in few illegal migrants managing to escape." The bench rejected the appeal by Jeevan Singh Bathyal and said, "This is very much happening on the Indo-Bangla border. This is a serious matter and we will leave it to the discretion of the armed forces to deal with the issue." The SC upheld the Delhi HC order. Since 2005, the SC in two judgments on petitions by Sarbananda Sonowal had akined the illegal infiltration of Bangladeshi nationals to India to 'external aggression and internal disturbance" and said, "The report of the Governor (Lt Gen S K Sinha), the affidavits and other material on record show that millions of Bangladeshi nationals have illegally crossed the international border and have occupied vast tracts of land like 'Char land' barren or cultivable land, forest area and have taken possession of the same in the State of Assam." "Their willingness to work at low wages has deprived Indian citizens and specially people in Assam of employment opportunities. This, as stated in the Governor's report, has led to insurgency in Assam. Insurgency is undoubtedly a serious form of internal disturbance and which causes grave threat to the life of people, creates panic situations and also hampers the growth and economic prosperity of Assam though it possesses vast natural resources," it had said. Dealing with Bathyal's case, the Delhi HC had said, "We are further of the opinion that the officers / personnel of the force entrusted with guarding the said border, unless, while on duty, act with complete vigilance and commitment, it will be difficult to guard the border and infiltrations, which to the extent of becoming a political issue, will continue. We are thus of the opinion that the ground of proportionality is not available to the petitioner." "Witness on cross examination has said it was not possible to place the ladder unless the person on duty had connived; the place where the ladder had been put was too close to the point of duty of the petitioner; the petitioner did not show any interest to apprehend the illegal migrants; and, the illegal migrants caught, informed that they had paid money to a tout for crossing over to India," the HC had recorded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-upholds-axing-of-bsf-jawan-who-allowed-influx/articleshow/84191139.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The deceased have been identified as Malini Bahekar of Bhavsarnagar and Shrikant Paddewad of Shivangaon in Umri. The probe has revealed that Paddewad had a love marriage with Mohini (Malini’s daughter) six years ago. He was employed as a warden with a private hostel in Latur, while Mohini served as a clerk with a cooperative bank. The couple has a three-year-old daughter. During the lockdown, he became an alcoholic and would often have heated arguments with his wife. There were even reports of domestic violence. Both their parents tried to resolve the growing issues but failed. Unable to bear the domestic violence, his wife left him and went to stay with her mother in Nanded. Paddewad believed that his mother-in-law was not allowing his wife to return to him. After his pleas asking his wife to return went unheard, he went to his in-law’s house and allegedly bludgeoned his mother-in-law to death. Later, he hung himself in the next room. Bhagynagar police station’s inspector Abhimanyu Salunke told TOI, “When the suspect reached his in-law’s house, his mother-in-law was alone at home. Mohini and other family members had gone to a neighbouring town.” The probe also revealed that he was under the influence of alcohol when he allegedly murdered the woman. The incident came to light after the family members returned home. Bhagynagar police has registered a case of accidental death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/man-ends-his-life-after-killing-mother-in-law/articleshow/84180758.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Aurangabad||Based on son’s account, man held for murdering wife||Aurangabad: Almost a week after the last rites of a woman were performed, her husband has been arrested on the charges of murdering her. He had allegedly strangled his wife and then threatened his son. The registration of the case and arrest of the accused is based on the account of his teenage son, who said that his father had threatened him of dire consequences if he told anyone about his act. The deceased has been identified as Meerabai Dhekale (34) of Balanagar, while the accused is Kailash (40), a farm worker. The alleged murder took place on the evening of June 28, following which, the accused cooked up a story that his wife was unwell and died of illness. The next day, her last rites were performed. Paithan’s assistant superintendent of police Gorakh Bhamre said it was the deceased woman’s 15-year-old son, who after the death of his mother, went to his paternal grandmother’s place and narrated the incident. His grandmother on Sunday brought the matter to the notice of the police, following which, MIDC Paithan immediately registered a murder case against the accused and arrested him on Monday. After being produced before the court, he has been remanded in custody till Thursday. Police said the accused also confessed to committing the crime. “The accused had sought Rs 40 from the woman for alcohol. The woman, who too would help the family by working as a farm worker, refused to give him the money, resulting in a heated argument,” said an officer privy to the probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/based-on-sons-account-man-held-for-murdering-wife/articleshow/84180752.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chandigarh||Mohali MC in a mess as NTPC pulls out of waste mgmt project||Barinderjit.saluja Mohali: The solid waste management project has been hit once again with the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) pulling out. NTPC was to construct and operate a waste to energy plant at Samgauli. The corporation was to construct a 7-megawatt (MW) waste to energy plant under the Build Own Operate (BOO) model. Last year, Punjab government decided to hand over construction and operations of the waste to energy plant to National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC). Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh gave the green signal to build a seven-megawatt (MW) waste to energy plant on an area of 50 acres at Samgauli in Mohali district. The project was to be completed in two years as part of the GMADA-Patiala municipal solid waste cluster. The solid waste management project has been hanging fire for the past decade. The 50-acre land in Samgauli was the centre of a dispute when multiple owners surfaced in the wake of the Golden Forest land scam. The owners went to court but the Punjab government defended its case and got possession of maximum land. Prior to this, the Punjab government had also declared the land as surplus. Mohali Municipal Corporation prepared a detailed project report (DPR) 11 years back at a cost of Rs 100 crore, including the land cost. A senior officer of the local bodies department said, “We have not got any response from NTPC and are now working on the latest technology to process waste, which will help us turn RDF into coal. This can be sold to thermal plants in the state. We will be sending the technology to Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) for approval within a week.” Mohali MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said, “We have constructed the boundary wall of the project land and the state government is in the process of signing an MoU with a new company to use RDF technology to make coal out of waste and sell to thermal plants.” Currently, Mohali generates 150 metric tonnes of garbage in a day. It is being dumped at an unauthorised dumping ground in Industrial Area, Phase 8B. Residents and industrialists are protesting against this. In August last year, Mohali slipped to rank 157 out of 382 cities in the nationwide Swachh Survekshan rankings. In 2019, the ranking was 153, while in 2018, it was 109. Failure to get garbage processing projects off the ground is said to be the reason for the slip in rankings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-mc-in-a-mess-as-ntpc-pulls-out-of-waste-mgmt-project/articleshow/84185568.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Aurangabad||Police recruits’ monthly fitness progress to be noted||Aurangabad: In an unprecedented move, to ensure that the police personnel stay self-motivated about their physical fitness, even after the training period, the state police training department has devised a mechanism to monitor and record each recruit’s progress during the nine months of training and give them a detailed progress card on their passing out. To begin with, the programme has helped in bringing down each recruit’s weight by 12-15 kg at all the police training centres in the state. The earlier average was about 7-10kg. ADG (training and special units) Sanjay Kumar told TOI: “We want the recruits to be reminded of their fitness. By looking at their progress card, they will themselves feel proud of their achievement and we are confident that they will keep making efforts during their long years of service.” The officer said the trainers cannot remain with the policemen for the duration of their entire service, but the training and self-motivation can definitely remain with them. Those privy to the development confirmed that the sharing of each month’s progress with respective recruits has led to the recruits making extra efforts to improve their individual scores each month and by the end of nine months training, exceeding expectations as well as standards. Nanvij Daund-based police training school’s principal Sandeep Atole said, “To take the individual monitoring to the next level, we have procured some readily available machine and equipment. Starting from day one, each month, we monitor every recruit’s fat percentage, visceral fat percentage, resting metabolic rate, body mass index and skeletal mass.” Moreover, at all the nine training schools, every recruit’s physical fitness — in terms of duration taken to cover 100m, 1,600m, number of chin-ups, pull ups, distance covered in long jumps, height covered in high jumps etc. — are being recorded each month. Another training school’s principal said the experiment was started after the imposition of lockdown last year and the results have astonished everyone. “We are exceeding the targets, without even having to punish the recruits, as they are themselves interested in knowing their individual improvements and loss of weight each month,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/police-recruits-monthly-fitness-progress-to-be-noted/articleshow/84180793.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Delhi||Not a movie plot: Man scripts own ‘murder’ in Delhi to trap rival||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police have arrested a man who contrived a fake murder plot against himself to frame another man. According to police, the arrested man was in jail for the murder of the other man’s mother and wanted revenge by having the latter also booked for attempt to murder. Apparently, the man was inspired by similar events in the Bollywood film Drishyam. Amarpal has been arrested and is currently in a hospital, having been shot by his cousin, 30-year-old Anil, in north Delhi’s Majnu ka Tila as part of the conspiracy. On June 29, police were informed that someone had opened fire at Amarpal. A police team that reached the spot found he had sustained pellet injuries on his back. Investigators established that Amarpal had been released from jail on parole a month ago and had been imprisoned for killing the mother of his neighbour, Ombir, in 2019 following a fight. The cops, however, found the statements given by Amarpal, his friends and family members contradictory. “With the help of technical surveillance, we listed the people who were with Amarpal on the day he was reportedly attacked,” said Anto Alphonse, DCP (North). “Many people were questioned and our teams finally zeroed in on one Anil, who was detained for questioning. When confronted with facts, Anil broke down and confessed to shooting Amarpal in a plan hatched by the paroled criminal himself.” Alphonse said that Anil revealed to police how Amarpal had planned to get shot and portray it as an attack by Ombir to avenge his mother's death.  The DCP said, “Amarpal arranged for a country-made pistol and live cartridges with pellets, not real bullets so that he wouldn’t be fatally wounded. He also involved his brother, Guddu, and cousin, Anil, to execute the plan. The accused also included his brother- in-law, Manish, in the conspiracy. It was finally decided that Anil would fire at Amarpal and the latter would accuse Ombir and his family of trying to murder him.” The senior officer added that on June 29, as per plan, Amarpal informed some of his accomplices and others that he was being followed by Ombir and his associates. Thereafter, he instructed Guddu on phone to execute the plan. Guddu, Anil and Manish reached the predetermined spot. On seeing Guddu, Amarpal went to a dark stretch where Anil fired at him. The three men then fled from the area and went to their houses. Amarpal, meanwhile, went to a friend's place in an injured condition and told everyone there that his enemies had tried to kill him. Alphonse said that after interrogating Anil, the cops have recovered the pistol used in the crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/not-a-movie-plot-man-scripts-own-murder-to-trap-rival/articleshow/84185644.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kochi: Authorities fail to remove encroachments on canals||KOCHI: Without taking measures to evict encroachments upon six major canals in Kochi, the authorities are shelling out huge amount from the public exchequer for widening these canals as part of the Rs 1,528 crore Integrated Urban Regeneration and Water Transport System (IURWTS) project. The authorities have set apart Rs 566 crore for “acquiring land” for widening the canals up to 20m while the original width of all these canals is more than this. The original plan was to evict the encroachments on the canals, rejuvenate and make them navigable. “As per a reply given by Kochi corporation authorities to my RTI application, the original width of Thevara-Perandoor canal, which is one among the six canals, was 50m to 100m. Now, the maximum width of the canal is 15m. This means rampant encroachments are there,” said K T Cheshire, RTI activist. “Rather than evicting the encroachments, the authorities are spending a huge amount for acquiring land. Moreover, this move will legalize the encroachments. There is criminal conspiracy in this matter,” Cheshire said. “The revenue authorities with the help of the survey department should have surveyed the entire canal and holdings on either shores of the canal for identifying the encroachments. They should also have inspected the title deeds of holdings on the either side of the canal,” he said. More than one-and-a-half year since the launch of the scheme, the project is yet to gain momentum. “The government issued administrative sanction for acquiring land for the project recently. We have sent requisition letter to the revenue department for acquiring land,” an official with Kochi Metro Rail Ltd, the nodal agency for the canal rejuvenation project, said. According to them, the amount (Rs 566 crore) is required for acquiring additional land required after evicting the encroachments. Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA) had sought clarifications pertaining to an application seeking environmental clearance for the project. Though the KCZMA allotted time for the Netherlands-based agency, which is the consultant, to make a presentation before it for clarifying doubts regarding the application at its meeting held on April 4, 2021, it had to be to be postponed as the representatives of the consultants of the project failed to turn up. “We made the presentation on July 2,” an official with the KMRL said adding that the Metro agency hadn’t got intimation regarding the meeting held in April. The authorities also failed to complete other important paper works regarding the project. The design of the project is yet to be out. “The design is yet to get the final approval from Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), which funds the project,” an official said. The failure in completing even the paper works shows the lethargic attitude of the authorities and on the part of the consultants. The major objectives of the project are beautification of the canals, making them navigable and avoiding waterlogging in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/authorities-fail-to-remove-encroachments-on-canals/articleshow/84185607.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

At the beginning of this month, additional district magistrate Ram Bharat Tiwari started serving notices under the Act to the protesters. Rampur superintendent of police Shagun Gautam told TOI that the Act has been invoked against 67 offenders so far and more notices were underway. A 27-year-old man, Faiz Khan, had died while five people and a dozen policemen had sustained injuries after violence erupted at a protest against CAA in Rampur on December 21, 2019 near Hathikhana square. The crowd was dispersed after police resorted to firing tear gas and rubber bullets at the protesters. Many of the protesters had been arrested and sent to jail. “About 200 protesters had been arrested for the violence back then and we have named 142 in our chargesheet. We have invoked the Goondas Act against those who took part in the violence and sent a report to the court of the district magistrate. Investigation is still on and more protesters will be served notices,” he said. Three separate FIRs had been registered after the incident. Police said they went through video footage and photographs to identify protesters and booked them under several sections of the IPC, including murder, attempt to murder and rioting. The protesters now served notices have been given 15 days to submit replies to the court, said the additional district magistrate. “If they are found guilty, they will have to stay away from the district for six months under the provisions of the Act,” Tiwari told TOI. Muhammad Rehman Ali, the counsel who will appear before the ADM’s court on behalf of the anti-CAA protesters, said that majority of those served notices were labourers, daily wagers and embroidery workers. “They don’t have any criminal history and are innocent. We will challenge the notices after submitting appropriate replies to the court,” he said. Among those served notices was 24-year-old daily wager Sonu (who only uses his first name). “I was not part of the protest but was picked up in 2019. I stayed in jail for nearly two months before I could manage to get bail. I’m already fighting a court case and this notice has added to my worries. I earn Rs 3,000 a month and I can’t afford legal fees,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/2-yrs-on-up-police-invokes-goondas-act-against-67-anti-caa-protesters-most-of-them-labourers/articleshow/84183269.cms||Nazar Abbas

Chander Mohan said residents have been demanding a medical university/medical college for a long time and it should be established on priority basis. He said residents, who had only one hospital catering to the entire city, were facing many issues and cases of trauma were referred to GMCH-32 or PGIMER, Chandigarh. He said more covid care centres were required in the district and health infrastructure needed to be upgraded. Besides more beds and specialists, he sought a dispensary in Sector 15, saying that it had a population of over 20,000, mostly comprising senior citizens. Highlighting issues related to the MC, Chander Mohan said that the MC office is located at Sector-14, 4 and 12/A, which created problems for residents, who had to visit three different places to get their work done. He pointed out that various villages falling under the MC still lacked basic amenities like laying of sewerage, water pipe and electricity connections. The condition of sanitation in urban areas was poor, he said, underlining the need for more staff and machinery. The former deputy CM said area councillors should be allocated development fund of Rs 50 lakh per year per ward. He pointed out that construction of railway overbridge in Sector 19 has been pending for the last three to four years and stray cattle menace was still a major problem. After his meeting with Vij, he said, “We have submitted a memorandum to the minister and he assured us to take necessary action on the issues being faced by residents.” Anil Vij said, “Any Haryana resident can approach me with problems.

The officer has refuted the allegations levelled by the woman. A probe has been ordered by ADA vice-chairman Rajender Pensiya into the matter. In her complaint, the clerk alleged that the senior officer was harassing her for the past few days. On Tuesday, when she went to his chamber, he held her hand, pushed her and tried to kiss her, she claimed. She freed herself from his grip and rushed out of the room. She informed her colleagues what happened and then called her brother and mother for help. ADA vice-chairman Pensiya has constituted an eight-member committee headed by ADA secretary Rajendra Prasad Tripathi to investigate the charges levelled against the officer. After consultation with the district probation officer, a woman representative of an NGO was also included in the probe team. He said, “The clerk has been detached from the finance department. The probe committee has been asked to present its report in two days. Further action will be taken based on its findings.” Sunil Kumar Yadav, Lohamandi police station house officer, said, “A complaint has been received from the ADA clerk against her senior officer. A primary investigation is being conducted. We are looking for evidence supporting the allegations levelled by the complainant. So far, an FIR has not been registered.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/ada-clerk-alleges-harassment-by-officer-probe-on/articleshow/84183327.cms||Deepak Lavania

With no Covid-19 vaccination program announced yet for those under the age of 18 years, parents from India travelling with children on foreign holidays would have limited options of holiday destinations they can travel to, without facing quarantine restrictions. A case in point is Switzerland which opened its borders to vaccinated tourists, including those from India, on June 26. “Children under the age of 18 years, travelling with fully vaccinated adults, can enter Switzerland but they will have to undergo the mandatory 10 days of quarantine,’’ said a Swiss tourism representative. The quarantine would be followed by an RT-PCR test after five to seven days. A travel agent, requesting anonymity, said: “Switzerland is a popular destination among Indians, especially those travelling with family. But it’s not an option for those travelling with kids. As more and more countries open their borders in the coming months solely to vaccinated tourists, those travelling with kids will find their options limited,’’ he added. Iceland, for instance, demands a vaccination certificate and a negative RT-PCR test report on arrival. Of India’s 1.3 billion population, around 450 million are under 18 and so aren’t eligible yet to be vaccinated. Moreover, according to media reports, India’s first round of vaccination for minors would be limited to those over the age of 12 years. There are options for family holidays though. Russia, for instance, demands a printed RT-PCR negative test report issued less than 72 hours before arrival and so does Egypt. There is no quarantine on arrival. Serbia, too, demands a negative RT-PCR report, taken up to 48 hours before departure, but offers an exemption to children under the age of 12 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-vax-for-kids-may-hit-families-intl-travel-plans/articleshow/84187968.cms||Manju V

The final arguments over the sentencing of 35-year-old accused Sunil Rama Kuchkorvi took place in the court of district and sessions judge Mahesh Jadhav on Tuesday. Kuchkorvi has been found guilty of murdering his mother for money. He is also accused of chopping her body and eating parts of it. The locals had found him with a bloodstained mouth when he stepped out of house after the murder. Government lawyer Vivek Shukla sought death sentencing, citing that this is the rarest of rare cases. Speaking to TOI he said: “I demanded hanging till death. The accused is a threat to society. He would have been murdered by the locals if the police did not reach the spot on time. His wife and children have also left him.” Vijay Lambore, the defending lawyer, argued that the case does not fit the ‘rarest of rare’ criteria to be awarded a death sentence. Lambore said, “We pleaded no hanging as the crime was committed in madness. There is no medical report showing he was involved in cannibalism after murdering his mother. Also, there is no evidence to prove it. He has a wife and three children to take care of.” The court has already termed the accused as guilty on the basis of the chargesheet filed by Kolhapur police. The report, however, does not provide direct evidence but provides circumstantial evidence and statements given by 12 eyewitnesses. Kuchkorvi was under the influence of alcohol when he committed the crime as per the police investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/sentencing-on-cannibalism-murder-case-on-thursday/articleshow/84180872.cms||---

The retrieved land belonged to Bala Dhandayuthapani temple administered by the HR and CE department at Sukrawarpet. The temple land measuring a few cents was encroached and a hotel was built in the place years ago. Past attempts of the HR and CE department to evict the enroachers proved futile and the hotel owner refused to vacate. Meanwhile, the HR and CE obtained a court order for retrieving the property. Armed with the court order, the HR and CE officials accompanied by revenue and police personnel visited the spot on Tuesday. Issuing a final warning, they demolished the hotel and retrieved the land. Police protection was given to the land to prevent the encroachers from entering the land. Meanwhile, the revenue officials razed down a clinic built on encroached land at Sundarapuram sparking protest by a group of people opposing the demolition drive. With the help of police personnel, the authorities brought down the encroachment and warned that the encroachers would be brought to book.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/encorached-temple-land-worth-rs-1-crore-retrieved-in-city/articleshow/84185645.cms||---

Despite two waves of the coronavirus infection that has taken a huge toll of lives, the authorities seem to have taken little action to prevent bags full of bio-medical waste from being thrown all over the campus. The situation is grim with overflowing sewers adding to the possibility of an outbreak of an infection. An infection can cause a pandemic-like situation as SNMC, one of the biggest hospitals in the region, attracts patients from both Agra and adjoining districts. Dr Sanjay Kala, SNMC principal, said, “I will look into the dumping of bio-medical waste in the open. Agra municipal corporation has been asked to repair the sewer lines. The work will be completed over the next few days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/bio-medical-waste-on-snmc-campus-poses-threat-to-public-health/articleshow/84183354.cms||Deepak Lavania

The police identified the deceased as Sunita Parakhi of Mann, while her husband Rajendra (45) suffered minor injuries. The accident happened on Monday around 2pm at Tapkir Chowk. “We had gone to a sari shop to get my wife sari and had a plan to visit another garment shop nearby to shop for our children,” Rajendra Parakhi, an employee of Mann gram panchayat, told TOI. Parakhi said, “I had parked my scooter at some distance from the sari shop, so my wife was waiting for me outside the shop. As soon as she sat on a scooter, a speeding truck hit our vehicle.” The couple flung onto the road within seconds and Sunita was dead on the spot as she came under the rear wheels of the truck. “With the help of the police, I took my wife to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead by the doctors,” Parakhi added.

While the work done by local public representatives has been welcomed, what hasn’t gone unnoticed is that many are trying to derive electoral mileage out of it. While there is no certainty on when Cantonment Board polls will be held, aspiring candidates across the eight SCB wards are not leaving anything to chance. Many have organised massive sanitation drives, hired tankers for sanitising localities, helped in arranging vaccination for the needy, and aided people in registering their names through CoWin portal in Cantonment and Secunderabad jurisdictions. However, they have ensured that potential voters know of their work by placing flexies and posters on sanitisation tanks, and social media platforms. Some of the aspirants have helped launch first and second doses vaccination for people in their area through designated state-owned urban health centres and dispensaries. A former SCB ward member, Pandu Yadav, has arranged a transportation facility to pick and drop people to the vaccination centre in Bowenpally. “The transport facility has been provided for elderly people. I have done it on my own accord,” he told TOI. Other aspirants have taken to social media to raise awareness about the pandemic and vaccination facilities in their respective wards. Some former ward members have also assisted residential welfare association in organising vaccination drives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cantt-sanitation-vax-drives-come-with-subtle-pitch-for-vote/articleshow/84187190.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: After losing kin to Covid, they struggle for closure||AHMEDABAD: It was an emotional moment for a Jeevan Aastha psychologist when a man in his late thirties poured his heart out. The caller told him that his wife of 17 years died due to Covid-19 infection and he is still to come to terms with the fact. “They had started the process of adopting a child to complete their family. They were hopeful that they would be proud parents by the end of the year but she succumbed to the pandemic. Her husband was suffering from tremendous guilt, thinking that he could have hospitalized her earlier, detected Covid signs earlier and saved her life,” said a counsellor, adding that they counselled him that all was not in his hands, and her infection could have been fatal in any case. As the pandemic ravaged many families, mental health experts in the city said that it would take a long time for many to come to terms with the demise of their loved ones. Many families lost more than one member, putting the survivors in abject despair. Dr Hansal Bhachech, a psychiatrist, said that for many, the loss of a young life partner was too much to handle. “Loss of those above 70-80 years of age is painful but one can come to terms with it due to age-related complications. But how can one explain the death of a 27- or 28-year-old youth who has been married for 3-4 years? What happens to the partner?” he asked. He said that many thus refuse to come to terms with the loss. In one of the cases, the family videographed the last rites as well as the collection of mortal remains to show the wife who refused to believe that her husband was no more. “Many also experience the presence of their loved ones in both positive and negative ways,” he said. He said that the best way to deal with the loss is to immerse oneself in the activity one loves. “If one ponders over it for a long period, the impact is more. It’s better to help others, socialize, and talk to those whom one you can pour your heart out – primarily to discuss the anxiety of living alone,” said Dr Bhachech, who is based in Ahemdabad. Dr Nehal Shah, a psychiatrist from the city, said that there are different ways in which an individual deals with grief right from denial to anger. “If it takes more than a month, it starts taking pathological dimensions,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/after-losing-kin-to-covid-they-struggle-for-closure/articleshow/84188172.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Hyderabad||Indian Immunologicals Ltd to seek SEC nod for human trials of vaccine candidate next month||HYDERABAD: Indian Immunologicals Ltd (IIL) is gearing up to kick off the process for conducting human trials of its live attenuated Covid-19 vaccine candidate in early August this year. The company plans to approach the subject expert committee (SEC) of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) in the first week of August this year to seek approval for the Phase 1 human trials, IIL managing director Dr K Anand Kumar told TOI. While the company has not yet finalised its proposed Phase-1 trials protocol, Dr Kumar indicated that the number of volunteers could be around 400 as in some aspects the company also wants to try and determine efficacy of the vaccine candidate. “The animal studies are already over and have given expected outcomes. We have obtained a test licence that gives us permission for making test batches. The next step is to begin producing the test batches and parallelly we will apply to SEC for permission to conduct Phase-1 trials,” Dr Kumar explained. Pointing out that the test batches have to be first cleared by Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) Kasauli, he said the company may seek SEC approval for its protocol subject to the condition that the trail will commence only after the test batches are cleared by Kasauli. IIL is already setting up a new facility for making its new Covid-19 vaccine candidate at its Karakapatla facility in Hyderabad’s Genome Valley, where it is also setting up a new facility for producing the drug substance for Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. The company has already begun the process of manufacturing the Covaxin drug substance after repurposing an existing BSL2+ rabies vaccine facility that will produce material for around 3 million doses of Covaxin per month. The new facility will have a capacity to make Covaxin drug substance for over 6-7 million doses per month. IIL is slated to begin supplying the drug substance to Bharat Biotech towards end of July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iil-to-seek-sec-nod-for-human-trials-of-vax-candidate-next-mth/articleshow/84187059.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

The minor is accused of being a peddler and also addicted to drugs. Both “mother” and “daughter” had earlier denied being related to each other. The “mother” later moved court seeking her custody after the Juvenile Justice Board, Dongri, rejected her plea. Rejecting her appeal, the sessions court said it cannot be ignored that whatever had taken place was when the minor was allegedly in the woman’s custody. “In my opinion, the welfare of the CCL (child in conflict with law) is not safe with her alleged mother. There is every possibility that CCL would come in contact with seller of MD,” the sessions court said. The woman had submitted the plea claiming the girl had to give her HSC exams. “Even if a juvenile in conflict with law desires to appear for HSC examination, the appellant can apply to the city juvenile justice board, for directing the observation home to take each and every step, which includes providing the study material,” the court said. The court said releasing the girl in the woman’s custody was not safe for her welfare. “Welfare of a juvenile in conflict with law is one of the objects of the Juvenile Justice Act. Children in observation homes are taken care of in all these aspects.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-denies-mom-custody-of-teen-girl-held-in-drugs-case/articleshow/84181467.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Kolkata||Online admission test, offline exam, virtual interview: JU suggests UG admission methods||Kolkata: There should be some method of screening applicants before admitting them to undergraduate courses this year, suggested several heads of departments at Jadavpur University to the admission committee. The department heads have come up with three possible ways that can be adopted to check the candidates’ aptitude for subjects they apply for. First was a physical admission test, which JU teachers said, was possible if WBJEE and Presidency University could conduct one. The second was an online admission test, and the third suggestion was an online interview or interaction with the applicants. The final decision on how JU will take in UG candidates will depend on the state government’s directive on admissions. “More than one lakh students will appear for the WBJEE on July 11. More than 20,000 students will take the Presidency University admission test in August. If they can conduct offline tests, so can Jadavpur University so that a certain standard can be maintained. If the government doesn’t allow offline tests, at least online tests, like the semester exams, should be conducted. If none of the two is possible, an online interview should be arranged to assess the applicants,” said a head of the department. After the different boards and councils—both state and national— cancelled their Class XII exams due to the pandemic, colleges and university authorities have been worried about how to assess candidates’ aptitude for the subjects they will apply for as the formulae devised will consider the students’ performance in classes X and XI exams and the subjects concerned might be completely left out. Some institutes, such as, Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira, St Xavier’s University and J D Birla Institute, have formulated their own plans for UG admission. At Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira in Belur, authorities will give weightage to Class X and XII marks for admissions to English, economics and political science. “For the rest of the subjects, there will be viva. The decision was taken in consultation with governing body, the admission committee and the heads of the departments,” said Swami Ekachittananda, principal of the college. St Xavier’s University will hold online UG admission tests. J D Birla Institute will hold online interaction with applicants. Lady Brabourne College has requested the heads of the departments to devise a formula to calculate the index marks, which will factor in the marks of the subjects students apply for.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/online-admission-test-offline-exam-virtual-interview-ju-suggests-ug-admission-methods/articleshow/84185700.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Hyderabad||86% mucormycosis cases among unvaccinated, says report||HYDERABAD: An internal report prepared by the Government ENT Hospital, the nodal centre for treatment of mucormycosis (black fungus) cases, indicates a strong link between the fungal infection in Covid-19 patients and vaccination. The analysis of 300 black fungus patients’ cases shows that 86 per cent of these patients had not been vaccinated while six per cent had received only one dose. However, eight per cent of these patients had received both doses but were infected. The 300 patients had presented with severe necrosis of tissue — dead cells in sinus or eye orbit — and have undergone surgical debridement for controlling the spread of the virus. “We have done the analysis to arrive at an understanding on how various factors such as vaccination, use of steroids, oxygen among others are interlinked to mucormycosis,” informed Government ENT Hospital superintendent, Dr T Shankar. Dr Shankar said that vaccination was found to have a big role and it was observed that black fungus attacked non-vaccinated Covid-19 patients more as most of the patients were not vaccinated. “This is yet another indication that people should come forward to get vaccinated as it is an added protection against serious post-Covid-19 complications,” he said. The hospital report also reveals that 51 per cent of the patients had developed diabetes — denovo diabetes or new diabetes — while undergoing treatment for Covid-19 thus confirming that the viral infection did result in the onset of diabetes in many patients. As many 280 of the 300 patients fell in the category of diabetics, both new and pre-existing. It was seen that 43 per cent already had diabetes mellitus when they contracted Covid-19. “This shows that mucormycosis largely affects diabetics who have recovered from Covid-19. Having diabetes under control is therefore recommended for all patients,” the ENT Hospital superintendent said. The internal report also goes on to show that patients who had not been on steroids, oxygen supply or received Remdesivir injections, had also contracted the highly-aggressive fungal infection. Interestingly, what appeared to be aggressive mucormycosis did not turn out to be the infection in 12 per cent of the cases. This was confirmed by the post-surgery histopathology examination and was most likely necrosis of sinus. The condition, however, is treated with the same surgical method as mucormycosis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/86-mucor-cases-among-unvaccinated-says-report/articleshow/84186802.cms||Amrita Didyala

But the watering hole of Gujarat has come to the rescue of the industry. Daman has now established itself as a preferred location for shooting TV serials. Currently, shooting of many shows are being held at resorts in the Union Territory. The arrival of the actors and the shooting crew has also provided a major relief to Daman’s tourism industry which was reeling under the lockdown since March 2020. The tourism industry got a major boost as shootings of over 30 TV series were held at various resorts in Daman. Shootings for some serials were held over a week while few others lasted for over three months. Not only Daman but neighbouring Umargam in Valsad and Silvassa too got business. “More than 30 serial’s shootings have been done at different hotels in Daman. Some were shot over a short period while few continued for over three months. This has helped few resorts and hotels keep the business running during this tough period,” said Harish Tangal, vice president, Daman Hoteliers Association. Tangal also suggested that the Daman administration should promote the Union Territory as a shooting destination as well. “Shootings of two leading serials including ‘Tarak Mehta ka Ulta Chashma’ were held at our resort. Daman’s tourism industry faced a tough time due to Covid but we got some business due to the shootings,” said Gopal Tandel, president, Daman Hoteliers Association and owner of Mirasol Resort. Not only Hindi but Marathi and Gujarati serial shootings were also held in Daman. “A Marathi serial’s shooting was done at our resort for 40 days. The entire crew and actors stayed here,” said Raju Tandel, owner of Princess Park. “When the organizers came to Daman to check locations they also visited studios in Umargam and resorts in Silvassa. Daman has an advantage since some resorts have ample space for erection of sets, quality accommodation and recreational activities too,” added Tangal. Umargam has few studios and scenic locations but it has limited quality accommodation facilities. “Daman has emerged as a shooting destination and the administration ensured that the production houses got the required support. The economy has definitely got a boost. We also ensured that all Covid protocols are followed,” said an official in Daman administration. Outsiders were allowed to enter Daman but hanging out at public places was prohibited. Outsiders holding negative RT-PCR certificates were permitted to stay in hotels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/daman-helps-telly-serial-shoots-get-rolling/articleshow/84183381.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

But then the Anti Terror Squad (ATS) landed at his doorstep and picked him up for questioning. His name had figured on a list of 1000 people who were allegedly converted to Islam by two Delhi-based Muslim clerics. A week later, on July 1, Kumar got a clean chit and returned home to Shitla Kheda. That’s when his actual ordeal began. “The whole village was aware of what had happened. It didn’t matter to them that I was let off. I have become an outcast and have been labelled a terrorist. I hear snide comments from people everywhere I go. Friends I have known for years look at me with suspicion. My life has become a living hell,” Kumar told TOI. The 32-year-old PhD scholar, who works as a cane development officer in a local sugarmill, added that neighbours were staying away from the family out of fear that they would also come under the “radar of ATS”. “People are saying that ATS is keeping a watch over me and that my days are now numbered,” said Kumar. The man's family — parents, wife, two kids and brother — are finding it hard to step out of the house. Kusum Devi, Kumar's mother, said, “We have been a respected family in the village. My husband was a village pradhan in the '90s. But our name has been tainted after this single incident. What is our fault?” The ATS knocked on Kumar’s door on June 23, looking for ‘Abdul Samad’ after the leaked list of alleged converts had a certificate with Kumar’s picture and information on it. It said that Kumar had converted to Islam and was now Samad. Kumar has no idea how his picture and information got on the list. The photo used was published in one of the books authored by him. “I was questioned about this in ATS headquarters in Lucknow. I don’t know how this happened. I was treated nicely by the ATS, though the interrogation was intense and lasted 7-8 hours for five days. But the social stigma that I'm facing at home…I can’t take it anymore,” said Kumar. A senior source in UP ATS has confirmed that the agency has given Kumar “a clean chit as he had not converted nor did he radicalise anyone”. The case ATS is pursuing is against the chairperson of Islamic Da’wah Centre (IDC) Mufti Kazi Jahangir Qasmi and Mohammed Umar Gautam. Their names allegedly came up during interrogation of two men accused in another case — an alleged assassination plot against Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati, head priest of the Dasna Devi temple in Ghaziabad where a Muslim boy was beaten up after he entered the premises to drink water. The ATS has alleged IDC is being used for mass religious conversion, that over 1,000 “vulnerable” people have been converted by the two clerics with the “promise of jobs” or by “inciting hatred” against Hinduism over the past 18 months, and that it was all done with “foreign funding”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/conversion-row-clean-chit-from-ats-but-man-who-wrote-books-on-modi-yogi-now-social-pariah-terrorist-in-up-villag/articleshow/84183457.cms||Sandeep Rai

The Andhra Pradesh government has allowed opening of theatres after easing some curfew restrictions. However, according to the film industry’s calculations, this will not do them any good. The film industry is of the opinion that only if curfew is completely lifted can film releases be planned. In the current scenario, in 11 districts, only three shows can be screened because of the curfew restrictions and in two districts only two shows can be screened. When new films are released, they are generally released with four shows to get maximum profits. Though the Telangana government too allowed reopening of theatres from June 20 itself when lockdown was lifted completely, the response of the film industry has been indifferent. The argument put out was that if films are released, the film industry would benefit if the release happens in both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana simultaneously. With AP easing restrictions, the calculations still will not work out in favour of producers who feel they will not get the desired revenues because of fewer shows. “It is natural for producers to expect good returns for the amounts they have invested. A film cannot be released just for the sake it seeing it hit the screens,” Prasanna Kumar Reddy said. Meanwhile, the threat of boycott by film exhibitors has had little effect on producers. The producers who were ready with their films and who chose not to wait until theatres opened are going ahead with releasing their films on OTT .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/film-industry-to-go-full-steam-with-new-releases-by-mth-end/articleshow/84186919.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

According to the residents, they are using another narrow and dilapidated bridge which connects to South Chilavannoor Road as the one which connects to South K P Vallon Road is still under construction. Residents said that it has been four years since the efforts to reconstruct the bridge at Pandarachira was started. “The contractors demolished the bridge one-and-a-half years ago. Still, the contractor couldn’t even start the work,” said Neptune Country Villa Owners Association president Rajeev Maroli. “More than 800 families in the area are facing the brunt of the negligence of the authorities,” Maroli said. According to P T Thomas, MLA, multiple hurdles delayed the work on the bridge. “When the contractor started the piling work, a concrete slab on the riverbed surfaced. The slab may be the remains of some sort of bund or other construction made years ago. So, work couldn’t be conducted,” Thomas said. “Moreover, there are two poor families residing very close to the bridge. Their houses got damaged in the piling work. When we explored the possibilities of giving compensation to them, it was found that they don’t have title deeds or any such documents. After much effort, we made some arrangements for compensating them. By that time, the second wave of Covid came. Anyway, we will be starting the work on the bridge once the Covid cases dip,” Thomas said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/south-chilavannoor-residents-wait-for-new-bridge-continues/articleshow/84185659.cms||---

He made it clear that the F&CC still holds the said power and would organise a meeting soon. He also accused the opposition of trying to mislead people with false claims. During the press briefing, the mayor, supported by senior deputy mayor Amrik Singh Somal, deputy mayor Kuljit Singh Bedi, municipal commissioner Kamal Garg and SE Sanjay Kanwar said that sections 42/1 and 42/4 of the Municipal Act allow the House to decide on delegating powers to any committee. He said, “The committee has been approved by the house and the decision to delegate Rs 1 crore powers to the committee was also approved by the house. As the house is supreme to take its decisions, F&CC existed yesterday, is present today and will remain tomorrow. We will soon hold the meeting and pass works worth Rs 1 crore. Opponents are resorting to lies and deception to mislead people.” At a press conference held by the opposition, (Azad group) on Monday, councillors of the opposition, including Sukhdev Singh Patwari and Sarabjit Singh Samana issued a letter to the media saying that the local government department had directed the MC to ensure that no work was done in the finance and contracts committee without it being passed beforehand in the house meeting. The opposition termed this as a major setback for minister Balbir Singh Sidhu. Mayor Jeeti Sidhu said opposition councillors were misleading people by misinterpreting the letter issued on June 28. He said the letter clarified the details of the last two letters (2013-14) and also referred to Sections 42/1 and 42/4 of the Municipal Act under which F&CC committees or other committees are formed and given financial powers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/fcc-powers-are-intact-oppn-lying-mayor/articleshow/84185654.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||‘Need to control interactions between humans & wildlife’||HYDERABAD: The Covid-19 pandemic brought to the forefront the emergence of zoonotic disease as well as the need to control human-animal interactions, especially in places like Telangana, where there are various factors that enable the emergence of zoonoses. On World Zoonoses Day, experts TOI spoke to said that zoonoses or zoonotic diseases, which are infections caused by pathogens that have jumped from animals to human beings, are happening because of more and more people getting in touch with animals. “In Telangana, we are seeing an increase in imports of exotic animals and illegal wildlife markets such as Murgi Chowk in Hyderabad. Many of the animals sold in such markets have been associated with a wide array of outbreaks of infectious diseases in humans. Similarly, the increasing number of wildlife poaching cases, growing population and encroachment of forest lands are causes of concern when you come to think of the various factors that enable the emergence of zoonoses,” said environment research scholar M Rajender Reddy. In a country like India, where country-wise, we have the second largest population but are not similarly large in terms of area, experts said that the pressure on wilderness is constantly increasing. “The increasing pressure on wilderness clearly translates into more and more interactions between human beings and wild animals and that could be trouble,” said Dr Chelmala Srinivasulu of the zoology department, Osmania University. To be able to face these challenges, Dr Chelmala stressed on the importance of government run set-ups that would be involved in regular screening of zoonotic agencies. “Although we have a National Institute of Virology (NIV), what is needed is more and more of government run set-ups that would be involved in regular screening of such zoonotic agencies so that we would be ready. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, it has been emphasised quite often that every state in the country needs to have a viral screening lab and a zoonotic screening unit and it needs to be linked with the tribal belts. Also, creating awareness is very important,” Dr Chelmala said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/need-to-control-interactions-between-humans-wildlife/articleshow/84187245.cms||Moulika.KV

A video being widely circulated on social media shows that not only are guests being allowed to take off their masks once indoors, but there is also no social distancing being followed within the premises. The video reveals only about one or two guests with masks. “You can clearly see that people have absolutely no fear of contracting the virus or even the safety of their family members or friends. We should remember that Covid-19 is still not over. Even the staff at some of these places are not wearing their masks properly,” said Ravi Kuma, a communications manager at an IT firm, who recently stepped into a club in Jubilee Hills. Although most of these places’ have checks for masks and temperature in place at entrance, guests say the problem starts once inside. “Right now, there is no monitoring of how many customers can enter. There is also no restriction on dance floors. We have all lost someone we know in the first two waves and that shouldn’t be forgotten,” said Nithin Bharadwaj, who also complained about a pub in the IT corridor being overcrowded. While pub owners refused to comment, authorities assured to take strict action against erring outlets. “We have not received any complaints so far, but since it has come to our notice now, we will definitely check. In case, there are any such places, we will directly book a case against them under Disaster Management Act, 2005, Section 188 of IPC and other applicable laws,” said Gachibowli SHO G Suresh. Meanwhile, doctors said that such violations are ideal for the spread of the virus, destroying the gains made over the past few weeks in the fight against the pandemic. “The second wave happened because many people thought it was okay to not follow Covid-19 norms after the cases came down during the first wave. If we make the same mistake again, there will be a third wave in the next couple of months, even before the second wave is over,” Dr Lohith Reddy, a doctor working at Covid-19 ward in Gandhi Hospital told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/many-city-pubs-not-following-mandatory-covid-19-norms/articleshow/84187124.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Popular Girgaum Chowpatty eatery faces closure after 50 years||MUMBAI: Mhada has declared a building in Girgaum Chowpatty that has housed Crystal restaurant since 1966 as dilapidated and dangerous and has asked all its tenants to vacate. This means the iconic restaurant, known for its north Indian fare, would have to shut shop. The nine tenants, though, claim the building is not dilapidated and can be repaired. A section of tenants moved the city civil court on Tuesday to seek a stay on the eviction notice. Mhada has listed the building number 31C-33 on A R Rangnekar Marg in the C1 category, which means a structure that is dilapidated beyond repair. The tenants then got their own structural audit carried out, which said it was in the C2B category; this means it can be repaired. Crystal is housed in building 33 along with other commercial units. “You are aware that the building has been declared as the most dangerous building in 2020-2021. In view of the dilapidated and dangerous condition of the building, this office has requested to vacate the premises by shifting into alternate accommodation immediately. However you have not vacated your premises also. If you ignore the instructions and continue to reside in the building and if any untoward incident/mishap takes place in the building, then you will be held responsible for the same,” stated the Mhada notice issued last week. Satish Barot, a tenant, and a few others moved the civil court. The tenants said since there were two structural audit reports, Mhada should refer the matter to a technical committee. “We had got our own structural audit report done which clearly said the building is in the C2B category. We have represented Mhada about this already and hope it will consider it. Mhada has sent us an estimated repair cost of around Rs 9 lakh and then in two years it has escalated to Rs 55 lakh,” said Sanjay Mehra who owns Crystal. Vinod Ghosalkar, chairman, Mhada’s Mumbai Repair and Reconstruction Board, did not respond to calls from TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-popular-girgaum-eatery-faces-closure-after-50-yrs/articleshow/84181712.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

STEP’s data for May 2021 showed that its members filed 35 complaints through various grievance redressal mechanisms of the PMC, such as their online redressal system as well as the local WhatsApp helpline numbers. These complaints ranged from broken footpaths and damaged surfaces to obstructions on them of various kinds, such as dumped construction material, lack of street lighting, poorly-placed electricity poles, and pedestrian signals not working, among others. “Of the 35 complaints that were filed in May, ten were tracked through the PMC’s online grievance redressal system. However, only three were shown to have been resolved, and the seven others are ‘processing’,” said Priya Pharande, coordinator of the STEP forum. The STEP also said in a release that the non-redressal of complaints regarding footpaths has been a longstanding issue, dating back to 2020. STEP added that it has been tracking several pedestrians’ complaints about footpaths and related infrastructure, such as pedestrian signals, since September 2020, with many of the complaints often closed or declared as resolved in the PMC’s grievance redressal system, without the issue actually being resolved. “We have written to the chairman of the PMC and to the additional commissioner, among others, that they should address the concern of pedestrians in a timely manner,” Pharande added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pedestrian-advocacy-group-flays-pmcs-footpath-approach/articleshow/84185728.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Kolhapur||12-day break in rain leaves Kolhapur paddy farmers sweating||KOLHAPUR: With the showers taking a break of around 12 days, paddy cultivation in the Kolhapur district has stalled. Farmers fear that if there is no rain soon, then their efforts will go in vain and they will have to resow the fields. Apart from Hatkanangle and Shirol, the Kolhapur district has a high cultivation rate in the hilly areas, where paddy is a major crop. The moisture content in the soil remains low in the hilly region as the water flows down to the low-lying farmlands. Therefore, the farmers in the hilly areas have to depend on rain. Vishwas Chougale, a farmer from Jeur in Panhala village, said, “Paddy sowing in small nursery beds had been done more than a month ago. We were waiting for good rain-caused waterlogging in the farms to carry out paddy transplantation. However, as there have been no good showers recently, our work has halted. If the rainfall doesn’t resume, we will have to redo the entire sowing process.” Of the average 9,700 hectare under paddy cultivation, sowing has been done on 7,269 hectare in Ajara. The local rice variety — Ajara Ghansal — has a Geographical indication tag and is considered even better than basmati. Vivek Mandlik, a farmer in Ajara, said, “Paddy is a crop that requires more water. After clearing the fields of weeds, seeds are sown in small beds and once the saplings grow for about one month, they are uniformly transplanted into the waterlogged fields. The standing water ensures there is low weed growth and the crop takes less time to yield better results. Due to a break in the rain, the entire paddy cultivation process has been prolonged.” Dnyaneshwar Vakure, the district agriculture superintendent, said, “Of the 93,742 hectare under paddy cultivation in the district, sowing has been done on 62,554 hectare. Around 66.7% paddy sowing has been completed. Due to the break in the rain, our farmers are unable to carry the transplantation. We are expecting the showers to resume in the next 2-3 days. There may be no need for resowing yet.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/12-day-break-in-rain-leaves-paddy-farmers-sweating/articleshow/84180941.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Delhi||Delhi: 10-year cat & mouse ends with murderer’s arrest||NEW DELHI: On June 25, 2011, a headless body packed in a sack was recovered from Jhandewalan. Though an investigation was initiated to identify the body and catch the killers, police had few clues to start with. One of the leads was “Decent Tailors”, a tag on the deceased’s bloodstained shirt’s collar, and the other was surgery marks on his hand. Three days later, a family from Najafgarh went to their local police station reporting that their kin, aged about 50, had gone missing. They were directed to Paharganj police station, which had published a hue and cry notice about the torso being found at Jhandewalan. On being asked to identify the torso, the family confirmed it was their kin, Layak Ram, with the help of the surgery mark. Police also traced the tailor, who identified the body too. Meanwhile, a head was recovered almost 20km away in a drain in Aman Vihar. It belonged to Ram, the family confirmed. With identification done, police proceeded towards catching the killers. Ram, who had retired from Border Security Force a few years before his murder, had been working as a financier and a property dealer, the family told cops. There were multiple stab wounds and the whole process of dumping the body parts indicated that it was not a one-person job. Police then started tracking Ram’s friends and acquaintances. First on the list were his business partner Pawan and another acquaintance, Shatrughan. Ram was last seen with them. Even as investigation pointed towards their role in the crime, Pawan was found dead on railway tracks and Shatrughan went missing. Pawan’s death appeared to be suicide. Using technical surveillance, police caught hold of a third suspect, Roop Chand, who helped them unravel the mystery. Chand worked as a driver at Pawan’s factory. Pawan owed Ram money and was unable to return it due to losses in his business. Ram frequently insulted and threatened him, after which Pawan allegedly colluded with Shatrughan to kill him. After the murder, the duo made Chand drive a tempo to dump the body parts. A manhunt was launched for Shatrughan, then aged around 23, but he had gone underground by then. In 2012, a court declared him a proclaimed offender even as multiple raids failed to trace his whereabouts. Chand, meanwhile, was convicted for destruction of evidence and released after serving a three-year sentence. The case became history, but 10 years later police received a tip-off from an unidentified source informing them about Shatrughan’s location in his hometown Begusarai, Bihar. A raid was conducted and he was arrested from his house. During interrogation, Shatrughan revealed how he had assumed another identity, of Mukesh Ram, and changed his looks to hide his tracks. He kept changing his location every six months or a year and made a living by doing odd jobs. In 2017, he was in Bathinda and then fled to Dehradun in 2019. Of late, he was living in Bengaluru and happened to visit his native place when police were tipped off by a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/10-yr-cat-mouse-ends-with-murderers-arrest/articleshow/84185736.cms||Raj Shekhar

The court observed that the investigating agency did not produce necessary electronic evidence to prove the case.Bhanushali was murdered in a moving train in January 2019. The key witness in his murder was his co-passenger Pawan More, a resident of Gandhidham. When Bhanushali was murdered, Patel one of the key accused in the case, was out of India.The court on Tuesday acquitted Patel, Piyush Vasani, Rasik Patel and Komesh Pokar, who were booked under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 115 (abetment of offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) for snooping on More.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Covid on mind, take a call on ZP bypolls, SC tells SEC||MUMBAI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed the Maharashtra State Election Commission to take a call on holding byelections to zilla parishads in five districts keeping in mind the law, the Disaster Management Authority notifications and whether it the conditions are “conducive” to polling amid the pandemic. The SC bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Sanjiv Khanna was hearing a petition by the Maharashtra government for “extending the time frame for concluding the bye-elections” by six months. The state, represented by senior counsel P S Patwalia and standing counsel Rahul Chitnis, cited the new Covid variant and likely third wave in the state as reasons to seek the postponement. The state election commission (SEC), through its counsel Ajit Kadethankar, told the SC that “if the situation on the ground is conducive for conducting byelections in the concerned constituency and there is no prohibitory order or lockdown order operating in those areas, they could proceed with the election program while ensuring that the standard operating procedures and Covid-19 protocols as notified by the competent authorities, including Disaster Management Authority, will be followed in its letter and spirit”. The SC took the statement on record and directed the SEC to “proceed in the matter in accordance with law and report compliance within two months”. The SEC had announced bypolls in five districts — Dhule, Nandurbar, Akola, Washim and Nagpur — and 33 panchayat samitis as they were in unlock level 1, but did not announce the election programme in Palghar district as it was in level 3 on June 22. The state pointed out that since June 25, the Disaster Management Authority has placed the entire state in level 3. Gatherings of over 100 persons are banned. In March, the SC had read down a provision of the Maharashtra ZP and Panchayat Samitis Act of1961 to mean that reservation in favour of OBCs in local bodies can be notified to the extent that it does not exceed 50% of the total seats reserved in favour of SCs/STs/OBCs taken together. That month itself, the SEC announced bypolls in the six zilla parishads and 33 panchayat samitis where the 50% ceiling had been breached. The OBC issue has become a political handle of late, with the state government claiming that the Centre is not providing the empirical data required to give them the reservation. The opposition counters that it was because of the callousness of the state government that the political reservation was scrapped by the Supreme Court. The state assembly on Monday passed a resolution urging the Centre to provide the 2011 census data. The state government has also entrusted the Maharashtra State Commission for Backward Classes to collect empirical data of OBCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-covid-on-mind-take-a-call-on-zp-bypolls-sc-tells-sec/articleshow/84189913.cms||Swati Deshpande

The local public representatives have engaged in a war of words since the government gave an in-principle nod to develop the sub-centre at Tasgaon. The functionaries are divided over for and against the development of the sub-centre at Tasgaon. Some have started demanding to set up the sub-centre at district headquarter, Sangli city instead of Tasgaon. Due to this, the plan of a two-member committee comprising officials of SUK to visit for site inspection, have been cancelled. University registrar Vilas Nandwadekar told TOI, “The visit of site inspection committee has been cancelled. We have requested the government to provide us with the guidelines to select the site to develop sub-centre or sub-campus of the university.” The sub-centre in Sangli district is a long pending demand. Recently, in a meeting with state higher education minister Uday Samant, Tasgaon MLA Suman Patil pitched for the sub-centre to come up in her constituency. Sangli’s BJP MP Sanjaykaka Patil too is demanding the sub-centre at Tasgaon. After in-principle approval, the local representatives, leaders of Khanapur are opposing the centre to come up at Tasgaon as they want in Khanapur. The local leaders are building up pressure on the MLAs and MPs to change the location. On Monday, the students and local leaders from Khanapur blocked the road over the demand The sub-centre is expected to facilitate the students from Sangli district. Three districts are under Shivaji University - Sangli, Kolhapur and Satara.

In two separate such incidents, a 42-year-old man and a 43-year-old man were killed at Sulur and Pollachi, respectively, on Monday night. At Sulur, A Ravi Prasath, a resident of Uppilipalayam, was bludgeoned to death by two of his labourers at Kadampadi. A wall painter, Ravi used to take contracts for work. A police officer said, “Around eight days ago, he had taken a rental house for two wall painters at Kadampadi. On Monday 7pm, Ravi and his workers consumed liquor and fought with each other. The two hit Ravi on his head with a stone, killing him on the spot, and escaped.” Neighbours, who reached the spot hearing the commotion, informed the Sulur police, who sent the dead body to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) for postmortem. The officer said the identity of the murderers was yet to be traced. “We have registered a case and further investigation is on.” At Pollachi, K Arumugam, of Nehru Nagar, was stabbed to death by his younger brother K Krishnamurthy, 42. An investigation officer said the two had consumed alcohol on Monday night. “Arumugam demanded money from his younger brother to buy liquor and the latter refused to pay him. They entered into a quarrel and in a fit of rage, Krishnamurthy stabbed his elder brother. Neighbours rushed Arumugam to the Pollachi government hospital. He was later shifted to CMCH, where he died without responding to the treatment on Tuesday early morning.” The Pollachi East police have registered a case against Krishnamurthy and arrested him on Tuesday. Police had also picked up drunkards for creating nuisance in public places. Among them were Rajendran and Manikandan, from Kittampalayam, who were fighting with each other under the influence of alcohol at Karumathampatti. The Karumathampatti police took the duo to police station, where they continued the fight. “One of them questioned police inspector Shanmugam for detaining them, while the other one said it was a publicity stunt. When we were recording the incident, one of them said he had supplied weapons to forest brigand Veerappan. We took them to the CMCH in an ambulance for medical test,” an officer said. A man, who was under the influence of alcohol, was seen struggling to board a TNSTC town bus at Gandhipuram bus stand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/drunken-brawls-claim-two-lives-in-dist-on-tasmac-reopening-day/articleshow/84185702.cms||A Subburaj

To the astonishment of many, wristwatches featuring traditional Malayalam numerical script are now being manufactured by a few artisans and this initiative is backed by a handful of collectors and enthusiasts. TimeGrapher, a collective of watch collectors and enthusiasts, is launching mechanical watches named ‘Nazhika’ that are built using upcycled parts and eco-friendly materials. To make them indigenous, services of local artisans in Kerala, Rajasthan and Mumbai were sought in addition to the mechanical parts that were sourced from Lucknow to make these watches a reality. The watches follow a 12-hour time format with Nazhika time markings also being a part of the design. Besides the traditional Malayalam script, an orange track has been designed above the script to show Nazhika, each of which is equal to 24 minutes. “The small handle has been calibrated in such a way that it will show both the hour and Nazhika timings. A thin long handle will move as the second hand and a thick long handle as the minute hand. The dials on the 40 watches were hand-painted by local artisans in Rajasthan. We roped in a dealer who had a collection of HMT watches in Lucknow for mechanical components. They were lying unused for some time,” said Sohan Balachandran, admin of TimeGrapher. The script, selected by former Malayalam HoD at Kerala University Desamangalam Ramakrishnan, was etched on the watch in Rajasthan while mechanical components were bought from Lucknow. The mechanical parts were assembled at a shop in Mumbai and calibration was done by local artisans in Thiruvananthapuram. The initial batch of watches was restricted to 40 units and 35 have been sold. Excluding shipping cost, the collective spent Rs 4,800 for making a watch. To run the watch, one has to rotate the knob 10 times and it works for the next 40 hours. Those who purchased the first batch include film stars, collectors and others in Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi. The strap of the watch is made of synthetic leather and the dial of the watch is just 36mm. The official launch of ‘nazhika’ will take place in Thiruvananthapuram on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nazhika-these-traditional-watches-take-you-back-in-time/articleshow/84185696.cms||T C Sreemol

The state’s move comes after the seven-member NHRC panel submitted a “brief” report in a sealed cover to the larger bench on June 30 on the post-poll complaints it had received and sought time from the court to visit places before submitting a comprehensive report. In the recall application, the state submitted that the larger bench had issued some fresh directives to the administration on July 2 based on the interim report though the state was yet to get access to the report. The state, while complying with the HC directives, stated in the application that the larger bench had recorded the government’s “lukewarm response” in its July 2 order without giving it an opportunity to respond to the findings in the report. “It is submitted that the findings in the interim report are required to be supported by evidence and reasons, which the applicants are still unaware of,” the application says. Bengal also prayed to the HC to “expunge the prima facie observations of the special bench which are based on the interim report and annexures attached”, and grant the state an opportunity to file its response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/poll-violence-bengal-recall-petition-in-high-court/articleshow/84191172.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

A few days ago, Pandey was informed about the plight of the elderly, who was spotted setting pyres at the crematorium. Moved by his plight Pandey instructed the officials of the Ambad police station to take all the necessary steps to rehabilitate the elderly citizen. Senior police inspector Seetaram Kolhe of the central crime branch said, “We do not want to disclose the identity of the person. He hails from Washim. He came to Nashik city in 1998 and started taking up temporary jobs as a worker and security guard. Eventually, he got his three sons married. While two sons stay in Nashik, one stays in their native village. The man’s wife went missing and has not been traced and later his children also drove him out of their house, said Kolhe. After Pandey’s instructions, the police traced one of his sons who stays in the Ambad area and warned him of legal action if he drove his father out of the house again. The elderly citizen used to work as a watchman at a residential building near the crematorium and also arranged the pyre to earn a living, said senior PI Kumar Chaudhary of the Ambad police station.Kolhe said as per the instructions from Pandey on Monday, the police wrote a letter to the district social welfare department officer under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act 2007 to take the necessary action against the person’s children. According to the CP, there is a provision in the law to take legal action against children who do not take care of their aged parents. He has also instructed the PIs of all the police stations to take action against people if they come to know that they have deserted their parents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/inform-cops-about-people-deserting-elderly-parents-cp/articleshow/84181013.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Kolkata||Centre of excellence tag for R G Kar for treating tuberculosis||KOLKATA: R G Kar Medical College and Hospital has been granted the status of a Centre of Excellence for treating drug-resistant tuberculosis. The state-run medical college will now not only handle advanced cases of drug-resistant TB but will also coordinate with other medical institutes across eastern India as part of the National Tuberculosis Elimination programme, curated by the Central TB Division under the ministry of health and family welfare. “In 2014, we were given the responsibility of handling all difficult cases of drug resistant TB (DRTB) for North 24 Parganas. After five years, we were made the nodal centre for handling DRTB. Now, we have been selected as the Centre of Excellence for DRTB for the entire eastern region,” said R G Kar respiratory medicine head Susmita Kundu. Under the Centre of Excellence, the respiratory medicine unit at R G Kar will work on building a hub as well as a model for capacity building of nodal and district centres for drug-resistant TB. All the facilities will be linked with R G Kar, ensuring high quality care. The centre will support these nodal and district centres with feedback and referral services for difficult cases. “We expect to take off by September with telemedicine services by connecting with the centres who need our assistance on difficult to treat cases,” said Kundu. In addition to quality patient care, the R G Kar Centre will be involved in various activities, including research projects on the disease and study new drugs in the pipeline. Later, it may also start academic courses. India accounts for 27% of all multi-drug resistant TB globally. According to the data with the central TB division, around 22 lakh TB cases were notified from across the nation in 2019. While UP reported the highest number of cases, with about 20% of its population being affected by the disease, Bengal had about 5% of its population suffering from TB. But health experts said the disease was notifiable, but many did not even come for treatment mostly due to lack of awareness and absence of basic healthcare facilities, especially in the rural areas. So, they added, the number was under-reported. “Also many of those who had contracted TB over the past one-and-a-half year, did not seek treatment as they did not visit any hospital amid the pandemic. So, many more cases were not reported,” said a health department official. “We may require additional manpower, upgrading of the respiratory care unit, adding more cabins for treating patients with multiple drug-resistant TB and a dedicated culture lab. We have started consulting health officials at Swasthya Bhwan,” said R G Kar principal Sandip Ghosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/centre-of-excellence-tag-for-r-g-kar-for-treating-tb/articleshow/84185742.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Agra||In jail for eight months, Kerala scribe Siddique Kappan denied bail by Mathura court||AGRA: A Mathura court on Tuesday rejected the bail plea of Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan, who was booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). Kappan was arrested, with three others, while they were going to Hathras to meet the family members of an alleged gang rape and murder victim on October 5 last year. After hearing arguments of both the prosecution and defence for two days, additional sessions judge Anil Kumar Pandey rejected the bail plea on Tuesday. The court primarily took into account the alleged material collected against the journalist during the investigation while denying him the bail. Talking to TOI, Kappan’s lawyer Will Mathews, who argued in the Mathura court on Tuesday, said, “We were expecting to get bail in the light of the Supreme Court’s directions asking us to approach the lower court for getting bail. Though the chargesheet had been filed, no evidence was produced in support of the allegations levelled against Kappan.” “Our arguments are not reflected in the order and only prosecution allegations are mentioned in today’s order, despite the fact that we had filed a written submission,” said Mathews. In its order, the court noted that allegations against Kappan is that he along with the co-accused “committed acts that promoted enmity within the society and affected the communal harmony which are directly related to disrupting the peaceful atmosphere and inciting riots”. It has also been alleged that Kappan “had received foreign funding for the purpose of damaging the integrity of the nation”. The court stated, “Though Kappan submitted that he was going to Hathras in the capacity of a journalist, an identity card of Tejas News was found with him at the time of arrest and this organisation had been shut down since December 2018. During the investigation, it was also found that the accused worked for Popular Front of India (PFI) and had been indulging in anti-national activities.” During the investigation, it was also found that Kappan was presently associated with an online Malayalam portal, as a contributor and the write-ups which he had sent to the portal were found to be “provocative”. The bail plea of the three associates, who are in judicial custody with Kappan— Masood Ahmad, Atiqur Rahman, and Mohammad Aalam’s – had been rejected by the Mathura court earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/in-jail-for-8-months-kerala-scribe-siddique-kappan-denied-bail-by-mathura-court/articleshow/84183517.cms||---

For the third day in a row, no vaccination camps were conducted for the public in the district. However, there are a few doses of vaccines left to inoculate the pregnant women, who could approach the government hospitals or village health nurses for the jab. Meanwhile, around 50 to 60 representatives of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam (TDPK), street vendors’ association and differently-abled welfare associations protested the “extremely low” vaccine allotment for Mettupalayam municipality on Tuesday morning. They gathered behind the Mettupalayam bus stand in protest and said, even small village panchayats were allotted more doses than that to the municipality. The protesters said it was on Friday that Mettupalayam received its last allotment of 200 doses, that too after a lot of wrangling. They said the municipality was receiving vaccine allotments only once a week and the doses were limited to a few hundreds. S Basha, CITU general secretary, Mettupalayam taluk, said small villages such as S Pungampalayam, K Pungampalayam and Pallepalayam in Karamadai block were getting 500 and 300 each doses, respectively, every week. “In total, Karamadai block receives 1,300 doses. But we get only 200 doses, that too after meeting the collector twice and health officers in person.” Pointing out that the municipality had a population of 65,000, the protesters said the residents were desperate to get inoculated. One of the protesters said some elderly people had been sleeping outside the Mettupalayam primary health centre regularly for weeks to try their chances of securing a token for the second dose of vaccine the next morning, but only to be turned away empty-handed. “They are not on WhatsApp and Facebook and don’t get updates on vaccination at 10pm, when they have already reached the primary health centre in anticipation of the next day’s token. They don’t want to miss a chance to get the final dose.” Basha, meanwhile, said the health department was conducting vaccination camps in remote tribal areas in and around Pillur, where the residents were mostly not willing to get inoculated. “Health officials are forcing the tribals to take the jab against their wishes and turning a blind eye to the people who are desperate and begging for the vaccine.” The protesters also demanded the authorities to arrange more vaccination centres in Mettupalayam, where it is presently limited to the primary health centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/no-fresh-stock-of-vaccine-for-5th-day-inoculation-drive-hit/articleshow/84185747.cms||---

According to data provided in the latest State Level Bankers’ Committee report, the number of enrolments grew from 30.6 lakh in 2019-20 to 37.59 lakh in 2020-21. “The fear of Covid encouraged many people to opt for life insurance policy, especially those who didn’t have it earlier,” said M M Bansal, convener, SLBC-Gujarat. “At the same time, awareness about having a life insurance cover improved among people.” He added: “Of late, bankers have been taking the consent of customers for enrolment in the government-backed insurance scheme right at the time of opening their bank accounts.” As a consequence, Bansal said, number of enrolments saw a significant surge. PMJJBY provides life insurance cover of Rs 2 lakh, as part of the Centre’s social security scheme at a nominal premium of Rs 330. “A lot of people have lost their lives to the pandemic. So more people opted for the life insurance scheme.” The banker said rising uncertainty due to the pandemic was a factor. The number of claims lodged also went up by 38% from 16,327 last May to 22,476 this May. “Clearly, as many people have lost their lives, the number of claims are bound to grow,” said a source in the SLBC. About 4.72% of claims were rejected. The major reason for rejections was death within 45 days of policy initiation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-backed-insurance-draws-record-enrolments/articleshow/84188046.cms||Niyati Parikh

Almost all the 47,000 degrees awarded in 2018 had their addresses mentioned as ‘abcdefgh’. The degrees awarded in other years too had wrong addresses. The agency was supposed to courier degrees of three consecutive years -- 2017, 2018 and 2019. In the midst of the pandemic last year, the university had decided to mail all the degrees directly to the residence of students to save them the hassle. The initiative was advertised as “one-of-its-own-kind in Uttar Pradesh". A sum of Rs 65lakh was sanctioned for it. In a report submitted to the university, the agency said that over 40,000 degrees of the academic year 2017 and 2019 came back from the given postal addresses as “the place did not exist or no such students with the given name was found at the address.” The varsity has now constituted a three-member team to probe the matter. There were problems with two other years, 2017 and 2019 too. “We gave them about 22,000 degrees for the academic year 2017, out of which 5,000 returned as the addresses given by the students were wrong. Also, out of 50,000 degrees for the academic year 2019, over 35,000 came back. So, in all, 40,000 degrees have returned,” said a university official. Vice-chancellor of the varsity professor Narendra Kumar Taneja said that the aim of the university was to ensure that students don’t waste time travelling to get their degrees. “We constituted a three-member team on Tuesday to look into this matter,” the VC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/meerut-varsitys-47000-degrees-in-2018-have-a-common-address-abcdefgh/articleshow/84183555.cms||Ishita Mishra

The banner reads: “They all are liars who swear on Yamuna ji… They are only seen when elections are near…These culprits of mother Yamuna and officials are banned from roaming around the Yamuna river and performing puja…” J J Baba Chaturvedi, a local priest, said, “Several political leaders visit Yamuna ji at the time of elections but disappear after winning polls. But this time we will not let that happen and are making our intentions clear through the banner.” Virendra Chaturvedi, another priest, added, “Political leaders have assured us time and again that Yamuna would be cleared of pollutants but nothing has changed on the ground.” National president of Akhil Bhartiya Teerth Purohit Mahasabha, Mahesh Pathak, also said that the river water was getting worse every day despite the fact that a party which understood the Hindu sentiments attached to the river was ruling the state. Meanwhile, members of Congress also sent a jar of “polluted Yamuna water” addressed to President Ram Nath Kovind to the local administration. “This is meant to convey what poor quality of water is being consumed by local residents. Priests are also forced to take a dip in such polluted waters,” said former leader of Congress Legislative Party (CLP) Pradeep Mathur. He alleged that despite the BJP government in the state and the Centre, the saffron party has done nothing in this regard so far. Commissioner of Mathura-Vrindavan Municipal Corporation Anunay Jha told TOI that soon all drains emptying into Yamuna will carry water treated by sewage treatment plants. “Out of 35 drains in Mathura and Vrindavan that go into the river, 20 have already been connected to sewage plants and work on the remaining will finish by October,” he said. Last month, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had said that sewage and industrial effluents were still being discharged in Yamuna river from Kosi and Vrindavan and directed the UP chief secretary to look into the matter and take remedial steps. The NGT had cited a water quality analysis conducted by the UP Pollution Control Board for January 2021 which found biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) levels, coliform bacteria and fecal coliform in the river water several times higher than the maximum permissible levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/priests-ban-netas-entry-at-yamuna-in-mathura-say-river-dirty-despite-promises/articleshow/84183560.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The man had been agitating in front of the sub-divisional office at Rajgurunagar early on Tuesday morning against the land measurement work for the proposed Eastern ring road project. The proposed 103km-road will pass through 46 villages in Maval, Khed, Haveli, Daund and Purandar tehsils. The protestor Patilbua Gawari remained atop the tank for almost three hours before authorities from Rajgurunagar municipal council and the police convinced him to come down around 10.30am, said the rural police. Earlier, Gawari had demanded that Khed sub-divisional officer Vikrant Chavan should come to the site to hear him out. Local residents had gathered at the site to try to convince him to come down. “Gawari came down only after SDO Chavan promised that he would hear the protestors. We will file a case against Gawari,” said inspector Satish Gurav of Rajgurunanagar police station. The protestor told TOI, “We have been protesting at Khed for the last week but neither political leaders nor government officials were taking cognisance of our issue. We had approached the SDO twice but he didn’t meet us. The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) and district administration should not acquire fertile land for the project. It will make many farmers landless. Instead, they can acquire barren land that is available at 12 villages, where the project is proposed.” Sandeep Patil, executive engineer at MSRDC, said, “We have already discussed land acquisition issue with affected farmers and appraised them about the process but some farmers in Khed are not in agreement with us. We have conveyed this to senior MSRDC and revenue officials, including the district collector. So far, we have measured land in Chimbli village in Khed tehsil. We have stopped the rest of the measurement for now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/villager-threatens-to-jump-off-water-tank-at-rajgurunagar-to-protest-ring-road/articleshow/84185792.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Ahmedabad||June car sales whiz past Covid bump||AHMEDABAD: Vehicle registrations in the state and in Ahmedabad in June saw a steep jump of 60% compared to that in May this year. The sale of two-wheelers registered a 76% increase in June. According to RTO officials, an interesting trend has been witnessed in the car sales in June 2021. “The sales of cars in June this year not surpassed that of May this year, it also crossed the June 2019 figures when there was no pandemic,” said an official. The officials said that in Ahmedabad city (GJ01) and Vastral, car sales in June 2021 was 4,356 which was 3,107 in June 2019, an increase of 40%. The figure in June 2020 was 2,312. Barring Surat, where car sales decline by 0.4%, other districts in the state registered an increase in car sales in June 2021 as compared to June 2019. The data which has been finalized for June reveals a 60% increase in vehicle sales compared to May. In May, 54,695 vehicles were sold which increased to 87,695 in June, an increase of 33,000. The two-wheeler industry, which failed to show any positive sentiment after the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, registered a 78% increase in June as compared to May this year. Analysing the steep rise in sales figures, a senior RTO officer said that apart from reduction in Covid fear, the rural agriculture economy is also on a recovery path. “The farmers had a good rabi and kharif crops. They have been expecting good summer crop yield because of the availability of water in the dams. These factors have led to the spike in vehicle sales,” he said, adding that the sales of car in rural areas have gone up by 60%. Pranav Shah, chairman, Gujarat region, Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA) said that the increase of 40% in car sales may be due to late deliveries as there was a backlog in May. This trend was especially witnessed in SUVs. The overall sales increase in rural area was also because of more availability of funds with the farmers. The sale of tractors and other equipments has increased considerably because of the easy availability of loans and subsidy. A dealer, refusing to be quoted, said that the car sales were not only high in cities but even in small towns. “We have showrooms in several cities and the sales have increased by 15-20% in the four-wheelers section. In rural areas, people have been preferring cash dealings to loans,” he said. An RTO officer said that the car sales have been on the rise after the pandemic as people have been finding own vehicles safer to any shared or public transport. “If two or three members of a family are working in offices, they have purchased cars and using the vehicle for daily commute,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/june-car-sales-whiz-past-covid-bump/articleshow/84188090.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav said that he will hold a meeting with mayor Satish Kulkarni to examine the situation of the city on water front. At present, the commissioner has ruled out any water cut for the city. NMC has a total water reservation of 5,500 mcft for the city, including 3,800 mcft in Gangapur dam complex, 400 mcft in Darna and 1,300 mcft. The water reservation period is between October 15, 2020 and July 31, 2021. The water levels in the Gangapur dam complex, the major source of the water for the Nashik city, has reduced to 27% of the capacity as against 33% during the same period last year. The total capacity of the Gangapur dam complex is around 9,350 mcft. Presently, the dam complex has a total 2,539 mcft water. The water level in Mukane dam, on the other hand, has reduced to 24% so far as against 23% during the same period last year. The total capacity of Mukane dam is around 7,239 mcft water. Presently, the dam has a total of 1,773 mcft of water. Darna dam, which is another source of drinking water for the city, has a total capacity of 7,149 mcft. Now, the dam has 3,248 mcft of water so far that is 45% of total capacity. But, the NMC is unable to lift the water from Darna dam due to water contamination issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-chief-mayor-to-review-water-scenario/articleshow/84181042.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Corp mulls a total solution to household waste management||Thiruvananthapuram: The health wing of the city corporation has pitched the proposal to provide a total solution to waste management by partial introduction of door step collection of bio-degradable waste from households which do not have any alternative mechanism. In addition to making use of existing community aerobic bins, corporation is planning to rope in owners of pig farms whose services could be used for bulk waste collection and overflow waste from aerobic bins. The model is already being implemented at Ambalathara and Rajaji Nagar.The health wing was directed to conduct a survey on feasibility of door to door collection of bio-degradable waste in one ward recently. Later the idea was broadened and it was decided to include 10 wards where door to door collection of perishable waste could be introduced. Units comprising five to eight Kudumbasree workers have been identified for the same. The health wing has been asked to identify 10 wards where the teams could be launched on a pilot basis, most probably from July 15.The corporation also needs to work out a business model for long-term sustainability based on how these units fare in the selected wards for a period of 1 to 2 months. This will also determine the viability gap fund to be diverted from own fund to be distributed among the members of waste collection units. The city corporation has 453 aerobic bins in 46 locations.Although the initial plan was to streamline the services of around 53 service providers who primarily focus on periodic collection of non-biodegradable waste, supply of inoculum and occasional maintenance of kitchen bins, the health wing has stressed the need to integrate community aerobic bins and bulk waste collectors who could transport waste to pig farms.“From our experience, households are inclined to provide user fee only if collection of both bio and non-biodegradable waste is done. When it comes to providing service for source level waste management systems, corporation has always lagged behind. If we could come up with a system by making use of community bins and bulk waste collectors, we would be able to prevent illegal collection of waste,” said a health official.One possible hurdle for the city corporation is getting the clearance from the pollution control board to implement the system. Besides, it will also be against the corporation’s action plan for waste management prepared as per Swach Bharat mission which was primarily based on source level system. However, lack of prompt service has derailed the source-level waste management in the city, forcing the corporation to resume door to door waste collection in selected wards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corp-mulls-a-total-solution-to-household-waste-management/articleshow/84185782.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Clean-up drive in Salt Lake to prevent dengue||KOLKATA: Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities have started cleaning up vacant plots in Salt Lake where garbage was piling up. This is being done after instructions from the North 24-Parganas district administration to conduct dengue prevention measures during the monsoon. BMC ward 31 coordinator Supriyo Chakraborty has taken up the drive in his ward consisting of AE, BE, CE, BF and CF blocks to clean up all the vacant plots lying neglected with garbage and weeds growing, the perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes. A few vacant plots in AE and BF blocks were cleaned up in the last few days. “We are requesting the residents living nearby to maintan the plots,” Chakraborty said. Residents have welcomed this move by the civic authorities during the monsoons when water collects in these plots. A similar drive in other parts of the township too will be held, BMC officials said. BMC authorities had a joint inspection and Covid and dengue stock-taking meeting with the North 24-Parganas DM last week. Officials said all necessary dengue preventive measures are being taken. “Six months ago, around five lakh guppy fish were released in the canals and more will be released. The canals will also be dredged to prevent any stagnant water accumulation. Larvicide will be sprayed and roof tops of households will be checked for stagnant water,” said BMC board of administrators chairperson Krishna Chakraborty. South Dum Dum civic authorities had launched a scheme last week to use speed boats in all its four canals - Bagjola, Sonai, Udaypur and Cantonment - to spray larvicide and clean the canal water. “The speedboats were introduced on the instruction of local MLA and minister Bratya Basu. This scheme will continue for the next six months as dengue prevention measures,” said South Dum Dum municipality’s BoA member Debashis Banerjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/clean-up-drive-in-salt-lake-to-prevent-dengue/articleshow/84185819.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Delhi||‘Inhuman act’: No bail for man in Covid fraud||NEW DELHI: A court has dismissed the bail plea of a man arrested for allegedly being “part of a criminal syndicate involved in duping hapless victims who were frantically looking for life-saving drugs” like Tocilizumab during the “horrible” pandemic. The alleged culprits’ conduct in the case was “inhumane” and “grossly obnoxious”, the court said. Additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana dismissed the bail plea of Rajesh Paswan in whose account Rs 70,000 was allegedly deposited by a complainant for buying Tocilizumab, required for the treatment of Covid-19, but the medicine was not received. “The alleged recovery of mobile phone bearing no… from the applicant/accused connects him with the alleged syndicate. The culprits in the instant case have not only committed a criminal act, but their conduct is also inhumane and grossly obnoxious. Considering the gravity of offence and the nascent stage of investigation, I do not find any merit in the application at hand. The same is accordingly dismissed,” the judge said in his order. The complainant, Rajeev Taneja, has alleged that he was in dire need of Tocilizumab for a relative and had found an advertisement having the supplier’s number on a WhatsApp group. Taneja claimed that he had contacted the person having a fake name, Pankaj Bhadauria, and was offered two vials of the medicine for Rs 70,0000. Taneja claimed to have deposited the amount in two bank accounts, but allegedly neither received the medicine nor got a refund. Additional public prosecutor Irfan Ahmed, appearing for police, opposed the bail plea and said Paswan and his associates were allegedly involved in cheating gullible citizens during the prevailing pandemic situation to earn easy and quick money. Ahmed further submitted that eight mobile phones, including one tablet, bank documents and a note book having customers’ details had been recovered and Paswan was allegedly involved in 12 other criminal cases of similar nature. If he is granted bail, there is every likelihood that he would jump the bail, the public prosecutor claimed. Advocate S K Gautam, appearing for Paswan, claimed that the reported amount didn’t belong to the accused and the co-accused in the case had borrowed his account only to receive the payment. Gautam further claimed that the accused had been falsely implicated. The court also dismissed the bail plea of Siddhant Kashyap, arrested for allegedly cheating multiple people in the name of supplying oxygen cylinders during the pandemic in the national capital. The public prosecutor submitted that Kashyap was also a life convict in a murder case in Goa. While dismissing the bail plea of Kashyap, the court said the allegations against him were serious in nature.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/inhuman-act-no-bail-for-man-in-covid-fraud/articleshow/84185824.cms||---

The matter came to light when the girl managed to escape from the men and narrated her ordeal to her mother. Meerut SSP has ordered registration of an FIR in the matter. The survivor’s mother said, “My daughter has been ill for the past eight months. On the advice of an acquaintance, I met Afzal Malik, a resident of Lisari Gate who promised to treat and cure my daughter within two months.” The woman would take her daughter to the tantrik, who would take her to another room. There, he and his associates, Tariq, Aslam and Kari Zulfikar, allegedly took turns to rape the girl. They threatened her with dire consequences if she dared to mention what was happening to her mother. The woman said every time she took her daughter for “treatment” to Malik, she would be gang raped. On Monday, the girl managed to free herself and told her mother about her ordeal. The woman also alleged that the tantrik and his aides had convinced her into selling off her agricultural land with a promise that they would present her with multiple-fold returns with their “special powers”. Prabhakar Chaudhary, Meerut SSP, said, “I have ordered an FIR into the matter and arrest of the culprits.” Arvind Chaurasia, circle officer of Kotwali range, said, “While the FIR is being written against the accused, several teams have been constituted to detain them.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/tantrik-aides-gang-rape-ailing-minor-on-pretext-of-healing-her/articleshow/84183564.cms||Sandeep Rai

Subhash Sharma and his wife Priyanka have been arrested. To kidnap the 45 days old toddler, Priyanka, impersonating as a healthcare worker, went to her in-laws house in Bulandshahr’s Anupshahr area. According to Sanjay Sharma, the father of the child, “A woman, dressed as a nurse with her face covered with a mask, reached home on Monday afternoon and told grandfather of the child that she is a healthcare worker and wanted to vaccinate the child. She asked my father to bring the child to her car. When he did, she asked him to bring a few things from inside. As soon as he went inside, the woman fled with the baby in the car.” Chote Singh, inspector of Anoopshahr police station, told TOI that they found the number of the car in CCTV footage. “We contacted the driver. He shared the number of the person who had booked the car. On placing the phone on surveillance, we caught the couple who admitted that they were the aunt and uncle of the baby,” Singh said. Santosh Kumar Singh, senior superintendent of police (SSP) Bulandshahr, said that several teams were pressed into service to find the toddler. “Within 8 hours, a team recovered the child and even arrested those who kidnapped him. Our team used phone and manual surveillance and CCTV camera footage. We have announced an award of Rs 20,000 for the police team for this good work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/uncle-aunt-kidnap-toddler-impersonating-as-health-workers-their-cab-turns-them-in/articleshow/84183566.cms||Ishita Mishra

A squad constituted to monitor illegal use of transport water passes had seized a tanker without any valid pass, coming from Aruvikkara. The driver said that he was transporting it to panchayat areas and hence no digital pass was required. The corporation team seized the vehicle and headed towards corporation office for further proceedings. The driver, who was accompanied by his son, meanwhile took the vehicle to RKV Road near Museum police station. A health official who was with the driver asked him to take the vehicle to the corporation office. Instead, the driver just locked the vehicle and walked away. The corporation officials were left with the son of the driver. They then arranged a mechanic to take the vehicle to corporation office. While the officials were preparing a report against the driver, his son received a call saying that his father was in Peroorkada hospital and he had filed a complaint against corporation officials for abducting his son and for manhandling the driver. The corporation officials have now filed a counter complaint against the driver for obstructing a public official from conducting duty and for violating rules regarding operation of water tankers in the city. The officials also took the son to the Peroorkada hospital and left him with his father.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corps-inspection-team-lands-in-a-soup/articleshow/84185839.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Vets battle virus outbreak at Kottur elephant camp||Thiruvananthapuram: A team of veterinarians with the forest department is battling a viral outbreak at the Kottur elephant rehabilitation centre which has already claimed the lives of two elephant calves –– one-and-a-half-year-old Sreekutty and five-year-old Arjun which died this week Both the deaths, due to endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EHV) infection, a rapidly progressing haemorrhagic disease, were characterized by acute onset of illness and sudden death leaving hardly any time for the vets to react. Three calves –– Amina, Kannan and Podichi –– have also been infected and there is a slight glimmer of hope. “In the case of Sreekutty and Arjun, they got ill and died within 24 hours. As for the calves which are under treatment, they have shown symptoms. Clinical intervention may produce results if administered at the time when viral replication may have started. We really hope that they will survive,” said one of the vets. The viral infection in juvenile elephants is catastrophic. There is no vaccine to prevent the disease. The anti-viral drugs help only in arresting the viral replication. The swift progression of viral infection leads to acute haemorrhage in visceral organs. The animal suffers badly till death as the virus goes on a rampage inside the system. It tears the lining of blood vessels causing severe bleeding which further triggers multiple organ failure. The available drugs cannot arrest the bleeding. Both Sreekutty and Arjun died due to the peracute nature (quickest deaths caused by the virus) of the disease, the other types being acute and subacute. Five calves had died of EHV at the Nandankanan Zoologica Park in Odisha in 2019. Of them, four had died within 24 hours of showing clinical signs, says a research paper on the Odisha deaths by Bijita Swain and Niranjana Sahoo. The nature of death in Odisha was similar to that at Kottur. The paper points out that elephant calves are susceptible to this disease because they are deprived of maternal immunity. The calves at Kottur are mostly brought to the centre after being found abandoned by the herd. They have missed the immunity absorbed from their mother elephants and they are prone to viral outbreaks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/vets-battle-virus-outbreak-at-kottur-elephant-camp/articleshow/84185823.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow University crisis worsens as 39% teaching posts are vacant||LUCKNOW: Superannuation of 20 teachers, including 17 last week, has aggravated the shortage of teaching staff at the Lucknow University. The number of vacancies on permanent posts has risen to 200, which is around 39% of the total strength of 516. Appointments are yet to be made on 180 vacant posts that were advertised last year. It may take another 3-4 months to fill these posts. The crisis has not only increased the burdern on existing teachers but has also affected the academic activities. Further, LU will find it difficult to implement the new course structure as recommended by the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020, in letter and spirit. The new policy requires multidisciplinary teaching and research with emphasis on the all-round development of students. The policy has to be implemented from September when the new session begins. It will also greatly impact LU’s bid for a better rating from the National Accreditation and Assessment Council and National Institutional Framework Ranking. According to students and teachers, be it NEP or ratings by two national bodies, the quantity and quality of teachers play an important role. LU had missed A grade in NAAC last time due to a similar problem. A closer look reveals that the crisis is acute in some departments. In chemistry department, 23 out of 36 permanent posts are vacant, while in physics, nine out of 34 posts are vacant. In ancient Indian history, only six teachers are there against 14 posts while in biochemistry, only seven posts out of 12 are occupied. In Sanskrit department eight out of 14 posts are vacant and in anthropology, there are only two teachers against eight vacancies. President of LU Teachers’ Association, Prof Vineet Verma, said: “Vacancies on 39% posts means an increase of 39% workload on existing faculty. Those serving at present will have to share the burden of those who have retired. If a teacher was earlier taking four classes, she/he will now have to take six. Besides, teachers are involved in examinations and administration. All this adversely affects quality of teaching and research.” “There is a need to speed up the recruitment process. Promotion of 150 teachers under the career advancement scheme is also pending. In some cases, pendency is 5-10 years. Promotion acts as a motivating force,” he added. The process for fresh appointments on 180 posts was initiated last year. However, first it was caught in a legal tangle and now the process will be started all over again in July due to an amendment in the selection process. LU spokesperson Durgesh Srivastava said, “Efforts are on to meet the teachers’ shortage. We will re-advertise vacant posts. Ad hoc teaching appointments are being done to meet the immediate crisis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lu-crisis-worsens-as-39-teaching-posts-are-vacant/articleshow/84188127.cms||Mohita Tewari
---||Delhi||Shutdown: Why always us, ask Delhi traders||NEW DELHI: Unhappy over the frequent closure of markets by the district administrations in the past one week for violation of Covid-appropriate norms, traders called a virtual mahapanchayat on Tuesday. Referring to the closure of the Laxmi Nagar, Gandhi Nagar (12 shops), Nangloi, Lajpat Nagar and Rui martkets, traders said the move had created panic among them and argued that the administration couldn’t hold only them responsible for congestion and other violations. Police and civic agencies have equally important roles in checking disorderly behaviour and removing illegal encroachments, they said. TimesViewUnlocking is a tricky business. To make it successful, it requires Covid-appropriate behaviour from all of us. Traders suffered huge losses due to the lockdown. The civic bodies and police must ensure that the visiting public too follow health and safety rules. We need responsible behaviour from all parties if we are to avoid another huge Covid wave.In a letter to Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), they also demanded strict action against police and civic agency officials in such a situation. Chamber of Trade and Industry (CTI) chairman Brijesh Goyal said they had no power to control the crowd on the main road or in public places. “If any market is closed for violation of Covid rules, the police and administration officials related to that market and civic staffers should also be suspended,” he demanded. Joint action committees should be set up at prominent markets with stakeholders from all parties, which will discuss steps if Covid norms are violated. “A joint action committee with representatives from market associations, police and the municipal corporation can take a decision regarding crowd control, pursue shopkeepers for help in implementing Covid norms and approach senior authorities if things go out of control,” suggested Vinay Narang, a trader at the Kashmere Gate market. “They can also follow a roadmap depending upon the specific geography of a market.” Goyal said they would also write to the lieutenant governor for withdrawal of DDMA’s order that had put the onus of controlling the crowd at the markets on the traders and the market associations. Around 950 small and big markets in Delhi have about nine lakh shops involving 15 lakh traders. “The lockdown in Delhi is being withdrawn in phases since over a month and, on Monday, the Covid infection rate was 0.09% and only 54 cases were reported. Despite this, why are traders being prevented from doing business while the business class had to bear the maximum loss due to the pandemic?” asked CTI president Subhash Khandelwal. At the virtual Mahapanchayat called by CTI, traders from Kashmere Gate, Chandni Chowk, Sadar Bazar, Chawri Bazar, Bhagirath Place, Naya Bazar, Khari Baoli, Connaught Place, Karol Bagh, Nehru Place, Sarojini Nagar, Kamla Nagar, Rohini, Pitampura, Laxmi Nagar etc. joined in large numbers. Sudhir Jain, president of Sadar Bazar Deputy Ganj, and Atul Bhargava, president of New Delhi Traders’ Association, said they had often complained to the authorities about the growing problem of illegal street vendors and hawkers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/shutdown-why-always-us-ask-traders/articleshow/84188292.cms||---

The police have already invoked the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against him and 13 others, including his wife, son and lawyer. “Barate’s arrest will give a fresh momentum to the investigation of all the cases we have registered against him and his aides,” Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta said’. Barate’s 13 accomplices include two dismissed police constables, two builders, land agents, and two journalists, among others. A senior police officer told TOI, “After cases were registered against Barate, he moved to different district headquarters in Maharashtra. He also went to Delhi. But for the last few months, he was staying in a village in Pune district. We arrested him after he came to Pune city on Tuesday afternoon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rti-activist-held-in-organised-crime-cases/articleshow/84185863.cms||---
---||Nagpur||BONE DEATH: AVN common in Vidarbha but cases increased multifold post-Covid||NAGPUR: As expected, the cases of Avascular necrosis (AVN) or bone death in Covid-recovered patients are on rise. Doctors are seeing more patients of AVN post-second wave, but they said the number will grow further. “The orthopedic department of GMCH presently has 2 patients of AVN and one of them is a health worker who recovered from Covid-19. Both were on steroid therapy during their Covid treatment. But, this is just a beginning,” said Dr Mohn Faizal, head of the Orthopedic Department of GMCH. “These patients are from the first wave. Steroid use was more rampant in the second wave and the patients who received more steroids will start facing AVN anytime between 6 to 18 months post-recovery. More cases will come from rural and semi-urban areas,” he said. Anticipating this, the GMCH has already started a special Clinic for the AVN patients every Monday at number 65 OPD. Here, expert doctors check the patients who recovered from Covid-19 and suffering from hip joint pain. Hip joint replacement surgery is the final remedy of AVN. This surgery can be conducted for free of cost in GMCH under Ayushman Bharat Yojna, stated doctors appealing that people should not neglect the hip joint pain post-Covid recovery. Unlike other parts of the country, the AVN is not new for Nagpur. As the district comes under the sickle cell belt, the doctors here treat AVN quite regularly. A veteran in orthopedic surgery Dr Sudhir Babhulkar had done extensive research on this subject since 1970s and published many papers which are referred across the world. His son and senior orthopedic surgeon Dr Sushrut Babhulkar told TOI that due to this extensive research, his clinic is considered a reference clinic for AVN patients in central India. “I personally see 5 to 6 patients of AVN daily and at least 3 to 4 of them are due to steroids. A month before, this number was hardly 1 or 2 per day. The cause was alcoholism or sickle cell,” said Dr Babhulkar. “Ours being a referral center, we are getting a more number of AVN patients referred from across central India. But, overall too, the number is growing and will grow. The good news is that you can skip the crucial hip joint replacement surgery if your AVN is detected in an early stage,” he assured. If detected in zero or first stage, medicine treatment can reserve the bone death. In the second and third stage, it requires surgical correction and in the fourth stage, nothing less than hip joint replacement can do. Doctors advised people not to neglect any symptom of hip joint pain post-Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bone-death-avn-common-in-vid-but-cases-increased-multifold-post-covid/articleshow/84185866.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The newspaper, which was launched to mark the beginning of the new academic year, is issued on all days except Sundays. The editorial is handled by the teachers of the school. Besides contributing informative articles on various topics teachers also collect from the students, news and pictures required for the paper. Amidst the busy schedule of online classes, the students prepare news for the online daily with so much enthusiasm. Also, by adhering to Covid protocols, the young journalists managed to interview some of the important figures from various fields, including Dr V Kunjikrishnan, Dr B Iqbal, Murukan Kattakada, Dr Aneesh, R Sreelekha and Dr Amar Fettle. With an aim to bring out the different activities of the school, special segments like ‘Ende Vidhyalayam’, ‘Prathibha’, and ‘Sandharshaka Diary’ too have been started.

Filming of director Tathagata Singha’s ‘Uma’, which was originally set in Benaras, began with Harsh Chhaya and Meghna Malik. ‘Uma’ seems to have thrown open the floor, witrh several other projects being lined up. In August, Tanya Maniktala, who had played the lead in Mira Nair’s adaptation of ‘The Suitable Boy’, will be in town to complete the shooting for Debaloy Bhattacharya’s ‘The Girl’ for Amazon Prime Video. Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury us planning to shoot his next Hindi film starring Yami Gautam in Kolkata and Purulia from the third week of July. The month after that, Ishaan Khatter, who also acted in ‘The Suitable Boy’, will join the unit of Raja Krishna Menon’s war drama, ‘Pippa’, set in the backdrop of the 1971 India-Pakistan war. Three Hindi-language projects’ choice of Bengal as a shooting destination is reason enough to suggest that the state is providing a filming-friendly experience amid the pandemic. “While writing the script, we had wanted to set ‘Uma’ in Benaras. Back then, Covid cases went up and we abandoned that plan. The director and I decided to set the film in familiar terrain. Kolkata’s medical infrastructure is also better than that of a small city, like Benaras,” said producer Avishek Ghosh. Popular south actress Kajal Aggarwal, who shot for ‘Uma’ on Tuesday, said, “It’s scary to shoot anywhere during these unprecedented times but we are all maintaining Covid safety protocols. We are getting ourselves tested regularly and trying to maintain our mini shoot bubble.” “Despite all the time restrictions, I am happy with the outcome here,” Ghosh added. Line producer Sayan Paul of Whitewings, who is currently working on ‘Uma’ and has other projects lined up in Bengal, said the state’s shooting infrastructure and technicians’ skill set had improved over time. “Now, everything, including lights, high-end cameras, makeup vans and silent generators, are available in Kolkata. All technicians have been vaccinated by the federation. That has also helped,” he said. Sources said Menon of ‘Airlift’ fame had cast Khatter in the role of Brigadier Balram Singh Mehta for ‘Pippa’ and that the unit had conducted a recce in Bolpur. For ‘The Girl’, there are talks of 15 days of shooting in Kalimpong. A big-budget Hindi production with big stars will begin shooting in Darjeeling from August 1. From September 3, another Hindi production will be shot in Darjeeling and Takda. Amid this comes the news of Northeast Frontier Railway’s effort to cut short the processing time for shooting permission on the toy train or the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway railway premises. An applicant can submit the documents on their official website (https://nfr.indianrailways.gov.in/) for online processing. Line producer Bablu Banerjee of Movie Crafts Media, who is currently working for a song sequence of a Telugu film in Darjeeling, starring Sai Ram, is excited with the news. “This will be a boon for us. I have to run from pillar to post, trying to get permission even for shooting international films here. I hope the other authorities, too, begin a single-window online permission system,” Banerjee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/curbs-lifted-hindi-film-shoot-starts-in-kol-more-lined-up/articleshow/84185880.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Pune||Pune: Covid wakes up latent virus in some who’ve recovered||PUNE: Doctors in Pune are reporting sporadic cases of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in those who've recovered from Covid-19. The patients are presenting with stomach pain and blood in stool, about 20 to 30 days after their Covid diagnosis. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) affects all ages. Once it gains entry, it remains latent in the body, but can emerge or reactivate to cause illness when the immune system weakens. This is why the infection is mainly seen in patients with solid organ transplants, blood cancer, HIV/AIDS and those undergoing chemotherapy or administered a long course of high-dose steroids. Doctors have said that Covid-19, and the drugs being used to treat it, also suppress immunity of patients, making them susceptible to opportunistic fungal and viral infections such as mucormycosis and CMV. Patients with CMV are currently far fewer than those with mucormycosis. Delhi's Sir Ganga Ram Hospital reported five patients with CMV last week. Doctors in Pune said CMV cases are trickling in. "I have diagnosed two post-Covid patients with the CMV in the last few days. They had complications like pneumonitis (inflammation of lung tissue), colitis (inflammation of the colon), hepatitis (inflammation of the liver), viremia (presence of viruses in the blood)," said infectious disease expert Mahesh Lakhe of Columbia Asia Hospital. Lakhe said both were Covid patients who had increased requirement of supplemental oxygen, bloody diarrhoea and fever whose imaging studies were suggestive of interstitial patterns. "That's the reason why we tested them for the CMV," he said. Experts at Jehangir Hospital also detected three patients with the Covid-associated or post-Covid CMV last week. All of them were in the age bracket of 35-50 years. Jehangir's infectious diseases expert Piyush Chaudhari said, "Prior to contracting Covid, they were healthy and immunocompetent individuals. Two of them had an ulcer of the food pipe and intestines and had suffered gastrointestinal bleeding. The third patient with lung nodules had worsening hypoxia (breathlessness) and it was difficult to wean him off ventilatory support. He ultimately succumbed. Two are still undergoing treatment." Covid-associated CMV, perhaps, is linked to Covid-19's impact on T cell immunity, ranging from absolute lymphopenia (decreased white blood cells) to dysregulation of T cell immunity. "Also, excess activation of innate immunity in Covid, as is observed in severe sepsis patients, predisposes them to CMV reactivation," Chaudhari said. Both SARS-CoV-2 and CMV can affect the inner lining of blood vessels and blood platelets to aggravate coagulopathy (bleeding disorder) and thrombosis (clot formation in blood vessels). Thus, Covid with CMV increases mortality by at least two to three fold. "Before the pandemic, we used to have approximately eight to 10 CMV patients a year, mainly solid organ transplant recipients and few HIV- positive patients," Chaudhary said. Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital (DMH) treated a 60-year-old woman diagnosed with CMV post-Covid recovery. She had other comorbid conditions. "After Covid recovery, she had abdominal pain and fever. She underwent a colonoscopy and was found to have CMV colitis. We treated her with ganciclovir, an anti-CMV drug for about four weeks. She recovered fully," said the hospital's infectious disease expert Parikshit Prayag.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-activating-a-latent-virus-in-some-whove-recovered-experts/articleshow/84190004.cms||Umesh Isalkar

In the first phase of this initiative, the air-conditioned bus service would be started on three routes — Deccan Gymkhana to Poolgate, Swargate to Pune station and Swargate to Shivajinagar. All the Peth areas on these routes would be covered. Citizens would be able to travel in these buses throughout the day against a fare of Rs10 fare, said Hemant Rasane, the chairman of the standing committee of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). “The project announced in the municipal budget aims at providing public transport in densely populated areas,” Rasane said, addressing a news conference on Tuesday. The buses would be available at an interval of five minutes on main roads and every 15 minutes on internal roads. Civic officials said the service would be started with 50 CNG-run buses, each having 25 seats. The number of vehicles would be increased to 300 in the days to come. The objective of the new bus service was to decrease the use of private vehicles in the core city areas and reduce the vehicular traffic in the congested Peth areas, claimed the civic officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/midi-bus-service-in-core-city-areas-from-july-10/articleshow/84185860.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa panels have drawn up crucial plans on khazans, fishing zones in coastal plan, GCZMA clarifies||PANAJI: As the state inches closer to the date of the public hearing for the draft Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP), scheduled on July 8, the state environment department has clarified that many crucial parts of the plan have been drafted by the state committees and not the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), Chennai. “The CZMP for the state of Goa has been prepared by the NCSCM, Chennai. The management plans for khazans, mangroves, turtle nesting, beaches and fisheries have been prepared by the committees constituted by the state government,” the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) said on Tuesday. Many opponents of the draft CZMP for Goa had expressed fear that the NCSCM may not be familiar with the peculiarities of the Goan coastal systems and that not sufficient ground studies were carried out to understand it when preparing the plan. It was feared that this may adversely affect the coastal communities and the ecology once the CZMP is finalised. However, the state environment department has now said that several crucial parts of the plans have been studied and drafted by experts from the state itself. The Goa Foundation, which approached the National Green Tribunal over the Goa CZMP, has held that the reports on fishing zones, khazans etc prepared by the state formed panels have not been incorporated in the coastal plan. It said that the plans prepared by the panels have simply been attached to the CZMP draft. The environment department also stated on Tuesday that the ‘Hazard line’ will only be used as a tool for disaster management and will not be a regulatory line. It was feared by coastal communities that any activities within the hazard line will be prohibited, affecting livelihood of fishermen, as also existing structures. The GCZMA though has said now that the hazard line is meant only for planning for any natural disasters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-panels-have-drawn-up-crucial-plans-on-khazans-fishing-zones-in-coastal-plan-gczma-clarifies/articleshow/84185959.cms||---

Ahmedabad was the only district with over 1,000 active cases till Monday evening. The death of one patient was one of the lowest since March, said experts. Meanwhile, the number of hospitalized patients touched an all-time low at 3 for private hospitals whereas Civil Hospital had only 23 patients, the lowest since last April. Medical superintendent Dr J P Modi said that the 1,200-bed hospital has a few Covid wards, but the other wards have started admitting non-Covid patients. “With a drop in Covid cases, we have also witnessed a declining trend in mucormycosis cases,” said Dr Modi. “Today we have about 95 active patients. At its peak, we used to admit 35 to 40 patients daily. We believe that the drop in cases is directly associated with drop in Covid cases,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/active-cases-below-1k-for-ahmedabad/articleshow/84188190.cms||---
---||Delhi||‘Dhage Wale Baba’ runs out of luck, held for cheating||NEW DELHI: For most people, 52-year-old Rakshit Gautam was the “Dhage Wale Baba” who would bless people with a thread claiming it had magical powers that would solve their problems. However, Gautam was, in reality, a conman who duped unemployed people on the pretext of providing them jobs in the judiciary, cops say. The Dwarka police have finally arrested the conman after tracking him down for weeks in Meerut, UP. Cops posed as area surveyors to conduct a door-to-door search for the accused who was hiding in a residential locality. Police say that he has allegedly duped over a dozen people of around Rs 20 lakh. Cops started tracking the conman after receiving a communication from Special Branch about it having received a forged application seeking verification of a person named Ravinder Singh. The application bore the fake signature of the registrar of Delhi High Court. When cops quizzed Singh, they found that he had been duped by Gautam of Rs five lakh on the pretext of a job. “During inquiry, it also came to notice that Gautam had taken money from many others on the pretext of providing them jobs in Delhi High Court as well as district courts,” DCP Santosh Meena said. The data of the mobile phone recovered from the possession of the accused was scanned and cops found the samples of forged joining letters in district courts. During interrogation, the accused revealed that he learnt the art of fooling people from a conman named Satish. The two were lodged in Tihar Jail in 2005 in separate cases of cheating. More cases were registered against him in Okhla and Janakpuri police stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dhage-wale-baba-runs-out-of-luck-held-for-cheating/articleshow/84185955.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: How mid-day meal was delivered at doorstep amid pandemic||JAIPUR: Providing dry ration as a part of mid-day meal programme to every school in the state has been a challenging task for the state government. Between July 2020 and March 2021, the mid-day meal department and Rajasthan State Cooperative Consumer Federation (CONFED) have distributed more than 59 lakh packets to students in 66,000 government schools. Being a large state, it is a challenege for the Rajasthan government to provide mid-day meal at the doorstep. Mid-day meal department and CONFED charted out a plan to procure the ration, package and transport it. CONFED later invited tenders and gave this responsibility to three agencies — Kendriya Bhandar, NCCF and NSCOF. VK Verma, MD CONFED said, “During transportation of ration, a lot of challenges were faced in Mewar region, Udaipur, Pratapgarh and Dungarpur due to forest and hilly areas. There were areas where we could not reach by trucks, so handcart or bullock carts were used. We had to cover wide distances in Jaisalmer and Barmer, where population density is low especially in summer season.” While transporting ration in Udaipur and Mount Abu region, truck accidents and climbing hills posed a challenge. Mid-day meal commissioner Bhanwar Lal said, “Our focus was to provide ration at the doorstep. Initially, we thought it will be difficult to provide dry ration on such a wide scale but it was made possible.” Box - Social audit of mid-day meals by civil society organisations Soochna Evam Rojgar Adhikar Abhiyan, a network of 100 civil society organisations, conducted a pilot social audit of mid-day meals and ICDS take-home rations during Covid in 11 districts. The results showed how important these are for child nutrition. Now the organisation is demanding a statewide social audit in which all the districts and government schools should be included. According to Nikhil Dey, founder member of the organisation, “In the pilot social audit, results showed that the benefits were highly valued and it was crucially important that they reached the most marginalized homes in full. Now the time has come to conduct a vast social audit including all the districts and schools. Even if one child doesn’t get the ration, that should be recorded.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/how-mid-day-meal-was-delivered-at-doorstep-amid-pandemic/articleshow/84185914.cms||---

The process to prepare the draft DP for 800 villages in the region, including the 23 merged villages, is in the final stages. “The process to call for suggestions and objections and a hearing has to be carried out. The DP will be sent for approval to the state government,” municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar said. PMC officials said the process of collecting the records from the merged villages has started. Government schools, offices and other such properties will be handed over to the PMC by the district administration. However, questions are being raised about the validity of the DP as the April 30 deadline for its approval is already over. Senior urban planner Ramchandra Gohad said the adoption of the PMRDA’s development plan by the PMC is feasible. “The two urban bodies can jointly carry out the process of drafting the development plan. If PMC adopts the PMRDA’s plan it will be helpful. It will reduce the time consumed for drafting the plan and the money to be spent on infrastructure for making the development plan. It is a wise decision,” he said. Some relaxation can be sought from the state government for the deadline in view of the pandemic. The DP is one of the most important documents for planning infrastructure in municipal areas. It lists the existing land use and proposed land use, plan for roads and other public amenities. The planning for a decade or two can be done through the DP. The master plan includes the reservation and amenity spaces for public gardens, parking, municipal schools, bus stations, fire brigade and civic hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmrda-to-finish-drafting-devpt-plan-for-23-merged-areas/articleshow/84185922.cms||---

The Uttarakhand government, already in the dock for allowing the Kumbh Mela in the midst of the second wave of the pandemic, will not be allowing the yatra this year. Sources in UP government said that some of the UP organisers are also reconsidering their decision to hold the yatra this time. The decision will be communicated to the government shortly, they said. “The yatra is scheduled to begin from July 25. The home department has been asked to formulate a detailed guideline for regulating the yatra this year,” said a government spokesperson. “Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has said that UP officials should speak to their counterparts in Bihar, as there is significant movement of devotees between our two states, and ensure that there are no violations of Covid protocols,” said a government spokesperson. He said that even as Uttarakhand was closed for kanwar yatra, Shiva devotees in UP had several holy sites they could visit to bring back Ganga Jal. Taking cue from the previous year, the government is likely to put in restrictions on number of devotees allowed in temples at the same time. For instance, said an official, it is likely that not more than five persons will be allowed inside temples at one time. Social distancing, wearing of masks etc will also be compulsory. The kanwar yatra takes place during the Hindu month of Shrawan spread over July and August. Crores of Shiva devotees travel to places like Haridwar, Gaumukh and Garhmukhteshwar to take a dip in the river Ganga and fill pots with Ganga Jal which is then carried back to their homes or revered temple and poured on the Shivling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kanwar-yatra-to-roll-out-from-july-25-with-covid-19-curbs-in-up/articleshow/84188179.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Satheesan made this appeal after visiting the breakwater in the wake of rising number of fishermen deaths at the breakwater. He was accompanied by Adoor Prakash, MP, local Congress leaders as well as priests and officials of local parish. In a statement issued here on Tuesday, Satheesan said it was the alleged unscientific ways of construction that has turned the breakwater region into a death trap for fishermen. “By implementing a permanent dredging system, the level of danger can be reduced considerably. The government must take immediate measures in this regard. Ever since its construction, around 55 fishermen have died and more than 500 have been injured. The fishermen have also suffered property loss in the form of boats, nets and other fishing equipment that were damaged by the deadly waves. The government must take appropriate steps to compensate these fishermen and their families,” Satheesan said. Prakash said the issue has been brought to the notice of the central government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/oppn-leader-urges-govt-to-solve-breakwater-issue/articleshow/84185943.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Reduce tea import, united planters association of south India requests central government||UDHAGAMANDALAM: United Planters Association of South India (Upasi) has sought the central government’s intervention to reduce the import of tea from Kenya, Nepal and Vietnam as it has been detrimental to the domestic tea sector. In a press release issued in the town on Tuesday, Upasi said during the first quarter (Jan-Mar) of 2020, the amount of tea imported stood at 2.49 million kg while it rose to 5.96 million kg for the same period in 2021, showing a significant jump of 139.36%. The import of tea during 2020 was estimated at 23.40 million kg as against 15.85 million kg in the previous year, an increase of 47.63%. On the other hand, the domestic tea sector has been witnessing increasing cost of production due to high input cost and high wage cost. Any higher intake of teas through import will have a telling effect on this sector which caters to a large segment of population residing in remote areas. On the other hand, tea exports had taken a hit as evident from the decline in the quantity exported and the value realized. For instance, tea export was lower by 42,430 tonnes in 2020 and declining trend continued during the first four months of 2021. The shortage of containers, especially food grade containers, and increased freight charges had turned out to be an obstacle for plantation exports including tea from India, said the release. President of UPASI Prashant Bhansali said, “Tea is an important agro industry that employs 2.12 lakh growers and 11.65 lakh workers. Fifty per cent of the production in the country comes from the small grower sector.” He added, “Under the ASEAN Agreement, the import duties were gradually reduced since 2009 for tea.” Hence, UPASI suggests that the government of India should closely monitor import of tea and implement provisions of Tea (Distribution & Export) Control Order 2005, wherever necessary to safeguard the tea industry in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/reduce-tea-import-upasi-requests-central-government/articleshow/84185938.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Soldier’s wife eyes medal at Tokyo Paralympics||LUCKNOW: She was a preterm baby. Born with semi-developed ears she was kept for seven months in an incubator. Doctors had given up hope and were not sure of her survival. But 22 years later, Simran Sharma became the first Indian woman to qualify for the 100-metre track event in Tokyo Paralympics. For this rare feat, she gives credit to her husband-cum-coach Naik Gajendra Singh of Indian army, who sold a plot and took loans from bank as well as friends to fund Simran’s training. Jawan of the Army Service Corps, Singh (30) is currently posted in New Delhi. The couple spends four-five hours daily in Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium (JNS) practicing for the upcoming mega event. On June 30, during the final trial for the Paralympic Games at JNS, Simran is the first Indian woman who qualified in the 100-metre race in 12 seconds. However, she claims that her personal best has been 11.87 seconds and she will improve before heading to Tokyo. “Never in my dreams had I thought of representing India in the Paralympics. There was a time when people mocked me for my poor vision and called me ‘andhi’. My parents were not financially capable of arranging funds for me to undertake athletic training. But my husband has been a great force and I could reach here only because of his support,” said Simran, who hails from Delhi. She cannot see beyond seven to 10 metres. The couple tied the knot in November 2017. “I met Gajendra during a practice session in JNS. He saw me struggling both physically and mentally. He too is an athlete and used to participate in cross country runs. He is a passionate sportsperson with a never give-up attitude. The very next day of our marriage, he took me to the gym to continue training for the 100-metre sprint. For five straight years we dedicated our lives to training and now I hope to win medals for the country,” said Simran, whose official coach is Antonio Blom. He is level third coach of the IAAF with 19 years of track and field experience up to international level. Simran is the youngest among three siblings and hails from a marginalised family. Her father Manoj Sharma was on a ventilator when she was participating in the world championship in Dubai in 2019. She was among the finalists in the championship. She lost her father just after the event. The same year Simran won a gold medal in the China Grand Prix. Later, in 2021 February, she won gold in world para grand prix Dubai 2021. Talking to TOI, Simran’s husband Gajendra Singh said, “Though Simran has poor vision, she is a good observer and focused athlete. Her hunger for win will fetch medals for the country. Indian army has been immensely supportive, but I had to take a Rs 3 lakh loan, sell our plot and took financial aid from friends to fund Simran’s training session. Monetary help from the government could help us more as the diet and supplements for an athlete are expensive. But everything becomes a secondary issue when we win.” The couple appealed to all struggling athletes, especially women, “to never give up hopes, train hard and believe in yourself.” Gajendra hails from Modi Nagar of Ghaziabad district. His two siblings are in the police department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/soldiers-wife-eyes-medal-at-tokyo-paralympics/articleshow/84188229.cms||Arvind Chauhan

Balbharati has also created a cellphone application (E-Balbharati) for e-learning content, available from std I to XII in Marathi and English. The registration fee to access the content is Rs 50. The state government’s school students get free textbooks and self-study books under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan. “Arrangements are in place for the distribution of books from the godowns to talukas and further on to schools. The taluka level officials have been instructed to take the utmost care of books during transportation to ensure that they are not damaged, especially due to rain,” Dattatraya Jagtap, director of the primary education department, said. The education officers at the taluka level and transporters have been told to adhere to the deadlines in delivering the books. The e-tender for the transportation is given to Mumbai-based Shirish Cargo. The SCERT and Balbharati have digitised their learning content and provided PDFs of the textbooks. Balbharati has developed a cellphone app (E-Balbharati) which can be downloaded on the Android platform. User response and reviews indicate that the application has teething problems which Balbharati is working to resolve. The app also provides a facility for grievance redressal through WhatsApp and e-mail. “The app is fairly new. As our user base expands, we expect to receive more feedback. Our backend team is constantly working to resolve issues raised by the users. We have also established a helpline where users can post their queries or technical difficulties and our experts will help in resolving them,” said Dinkar Patil, director of Balbharati.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/balbharati-books-to-reach-schools-soon/articleshow/84185965.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Nagpur||Nagpur district gets 77,000 Covishield doses, to last 1-2 days only||NAGPUR: After remaining affected for two consecutive days due to shortage of vaccine, Covid inoculation will resume in free-of-cost Covishield centres of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Wednesday. However, it is likely to be hit again from the second half on Thursday as the district has received limited number of doses even though it is slightly higher than earlier days. Inoculation could not happen at 138 centres administering Covishield on Tuesday. Only two Covishield centres of NMC were operational — one for Indian Air Force staff and another for inmates of Central Jail. Three centres of Covaxin — GMCH, Mahal Diagnostic Centre and Dr Ambedkar Hospital — continued administering doses. Vaccination has not taken place on nine out of the last 14 days since resumption of inoculation of 18-44 age group on June 23. As per the data of state’s public health department (PHD), the district got 77,600 doses of Covishield on Tuesday, of which NMC received 46,000 and 31,600 went to zilla parishad. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said, “Doses are sufficient for only one day. There was also no vaccination for four consecutive days between June 29 and July 2. We would continue inoculation on Thursday if doses are left on Wednesday. We need big numbers and then continuous supply.” The demand of vaccination has increased manifold since resumption of vaccination of 18-44 years age group. Guardian minister Nitin Raut had wanted 3.5 lakh doses to be handed over on any particular day to be followed by 3.5 lakh over a week to keep a running stoc. He also claimed district can consume 3.5 lakh doses in a day. He blamed Centre for not supplying required quantity of doses to Maharashtra. The district had received 40,600 doses on June 24, 24,000 on June 26 and 45,100 on July 2. Compared to previous allocation, the district has received some more quantity on Tuesday. The district has received 1,87,300 doses in the last 14 days. On Tuesday, Pune district received 95,000 doses which was less than its earlier allocation. Between June 24 and July 2, Pune district has received 3,73,280, making it 4,68,280 doses in the last 14 days. As per PHD, estimated population of Nagpur district is 52.72 lakh and 1.17 crore of Pune district. The population of Pune district is double compared to Nagpur district and hence the allocation is more. The PHD claimed that doses were being distributed as per vaccination performance in the last three days. Interestingly, Nagpur never got doses as per this criteria in the past. Going by the PHD’s claim, Tuesday’s allocation was against the criteria. The daily average performance in the last three sessions in the district was 41,532, including inoculation in private hospitals. Earlier too, TOI had highlighted discrimination in distribution of doses. Following TOI reports, Raut had raised the issue with the PHD. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B also raised the issue with officials at the state-level. “The district may have received more doses on Tuesday because of complaints by Raut and Radhakrishnan,” said an official. On Tuesday, Spandan Hospital started administering Russian vaccine Sputnik V. Care Hospital was the first to start it. Orange City Hospital and Research Institute resumed corporate vaccination on Tuesday. There are 12 private centrs in city now. A total of 2,874 people took the jab at these centres on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dist-gets-77k-covishield-doses-to-last-1-2-days-only/articleshow/84186006.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The road will pass through the wildlife corridor between Corbett and Rajaji Tiger Reserves. After lot of push and pull in April 2020 the NBWL had given approval for the construction of this road but with three riders - 705 metres passage per kilometre in the wake of dense elephant population, construction of underpass for animals with substantial clearance for elephants of 8m above ground and, clearance under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The minutes show that the NBWL has agreed to the construction of 400-metre-long underpasses of 6 metre height on the stretch. Earlier, scientists in the tiger cell of WII had recommended a “status quo” on the stretch between Chamaria Bend and Siggadi Sot. WII recommendations, a copy of which is with TOI, read, “Status quo should be maintained on the stretch between Chamaria Bend and Sigaddi Sot. Black topping should be avoided on this route considering wildlife movement in the area. However, the forest department may maintain this portion regularly by using ‘murram’ so as to allow passage of vehicles.” Commenting on the forest clearance, chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand forest department JS Suhag said, “The forest clearance doesn’t matter because the road was there in one form or the other even before the 1980s. Hence, there is no need to seek any clearance.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/nbwl-nod-for-underpasses-on-key-ctr-rtr-road/articleshow/84183743.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Kochi||Ernakulam: A single platform for sample testing||KOCHI: The Regional Public Health Laboratory in Ernakulam has extended the Integrated Sample Management System to all government hospitals in the district to collect samples of patients and transport them to the lab. Under the initiative, samples that need advanced clinical testing at the regional lab will be collected from nodal points, where they will be pooled from nearby satellite units. The authorities have identified 31 nodal centres comprising hospitals in taluk, community, primary and district levels. Family and primary health centres have been identified as satellite units that will have to transport the samples of patients to the nearby nodal centre. Seven vehicles have been deployed for the transportation of samples under the system. Laboratories in peripheral hospitals have infrastructure facilities to carry out basic tests only. Currently, patients in peripheral hospitals are either forced to approach private laboratories and pay a lot of money for advanced testing or, bystanders have to travel from transport the samples to the regional lab by travelling. “To reduce the inconvenience for patients and family members and shelling out more money for tests in private labs, doctors in the hospitals in the periphery can send the samples which need clinically advanced tests, including the ones in hormones, to the regional lab under the Integrated Sample Management System. This will help to bring down the financial burden on family members of the patients,” said Dr Nikhilesh Menon, assistant nodal officer, Ardram Project in Ernakulam. Last year, the Integrated Sample Management System was launched to transport samples of Covid-19 tests, tuberculosis, newborn screening, communicable diseases and AMR to the Ernakulam General Hospital. The lab started receiving samples from July 1 under the system. “We will send the test result report to the respective peripheral hospital by mail in three days of collecting the samples. Relatives of the patient need not come here for the result report. Earlier, doctors did not send us samples for C – Reactive Protein (CRP) tests to know the progress of the infection. Now they have started to send us samples under the Integrated Sample Management System,” said Dr Shyla Sam, senior medical officer at the lab. The regional lab has tested around 17,000 samples, including Covid, last month alone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/a-single-platform-for-sample-testing/articleshow/84186021.cms||---

They pointed out that there was no clarity if the course should be taken online or offline, would the government give a booklet, will the course reach all the students if conducted online and when would the standard-wise courseware made by the government that students would receive. The course has been introduced to school students to help them gain the required learning outcomes of the previous year. It will last for 45 days and include specific topics that will be taught through activity with the help of either the parent or the teacher. An assessment will be conducted after 15 days that will help in understanding the success of the course. The bridge course principal at the District Institute of Education and Training (DIET), Ratnagiri, said, “Various associations of teachers and principals have been contacting us with their queries regarding implementation of the bridge course. We have compiled all the queries received from the teachers and submitted them to SCERT.” Revati Rathi, a school teacher from Velhe taluka, said, “The course has to be conducted till August 14. But the SCERT has not made it clear if it should be conducted simultaneously with the regular syllabus or only bridge courses are to be taught. Also, there are still many students without a smartphone so how will the course reach such students? This has not been clarified by SCERT.” Director of SCERT Dinkar Temkar said the issues raised by the teachers will be resolved and they will get proper guidelines. “The district education officers are also available to resolve the queries of the teachers if required and they should not delay the implementation for any reason,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/gaps-in-bridge-course-for-pupils-could-render-effort-a-lost-mission/articleshow/84185995.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Pune||Pune: Man held for posing as army officer, multiple marriages||PUNE: The Bibvewadi police on Monday arrested Yogesh Dattu Gaikwad (26), a resident of Kannad taluka in Aurangabad, on the charge of cheating multiple women by marrying them after representing himself as an army personnel. Gaikwad has taken lakhs of money from at least 20 youngsters by promising them jobs in the Indian Army, police said. Police have arrested his accomplice, Sanjay Shinde (37) of Ahmednagar, who acted as his bouncer wherever Gaikwad went. Police have also seized 12 army uniforms and other incriminating material from his possession. On June 21, a woman (22) from Bibvewadi registered a complaint against Gaikwad. Deputy commissioner of police (Zone V) Namrata Patil, senior inspector Sunil Zavare, and sub-inspector Rajesh Usgaonkar arrested both Gaikwad and Shinde. “Gaikwad has cheated many women and their relatives by impersonating as an army officer,” said Patil. Zavare said, “Gaikwad has married four women -- two from Pune city and one each from Amravati and Aurangabad. Two of these marriages were held at dharmashalas in Alandi and two others in temples, but none of these marriages were registered. At the same time, our preliminary investigation revealed that Gaikwad was dating 53 women. We will record statements of all those women who approach us.” “He used to impersonate as Col Ram or Maj Ram, and on few occasions, he even used his real name without any army designation. He used to claim that he was posted in Jammu and Kashmir and would always be in army uniform while meeting women. We have seized 12 army uniforms, 26 brand new shoes, two motorcycles, two four-wheelers, a trunk, cell phones, rubber stamps, and other valuables, collectively worth Rs5.5 lakh, from his possession,” said Zavare. “Preliminary investigations also revealed that he had cheated these women and others to the tune of Rs 55 lakh,” Zavare said. Police were searching for Gaikwad after registering the cases and had conducted searches in various districts. “We came to know that there was a cheating case registered against him in 2017 with the Topkhana police station in Ahmednagar. We took his details from the police station and contacted his parents, who are farmers. However, his parents said that their son had not visited them for months,” said Usgaonkar. “We finally nabbed him from Aurangabad,” Usgaonkar said. “He keeps moving from Pune to Aurangabad, Mumbai to Gondia or Nagpur to Dhule. He stays in a city for a month or two in a rented room,” Usgaonkar said. Speaking about his modus operandi, Zavare said “He has created a fake profile as an army officer on different matrimonial websites and presented himself as an army officer on social media sites. He keeps walking on roads of different cities and interacts with unmarried women,” he said. “He has made rubber stamps and letterheads of the Indian Army by downloading images from internet sites. He has printed about 22 fabricated joining letters of the army and distributed them to young men in lieu of money,” he said. About 10 women on Tuesday visited Bibvewadi police station after the news of his arrest went viral. He used to follow a good lifestyle. “He hired good photographers to take his photographs, which he uploaded on his social media profiles and matrimonial websites. He also conducted about six to seven pre-wedding photoshoots by employing professional photographers”, Usgaonkar said. “Secondly, he used to take bodyguards with him wherever he went to impress girls and others. He used to pay Rs500 to Rs2,000 to these bodyguards for a day. He always used his four-wheelers to visit the families of the girls,” he said. One of the women, who registered an FIR, told TOI, “In January, 2020 my mother was admitted to a hospital in Bibvewadi. My mother and I used to visit the hospital for follow-ups. I and my mother were waiting for a bus at the Bibvewadi bus stop when Gaikwad, who was wearing an army uniform, stood next to us. His ID card fell on the road and I picked it up and handed over it to him. He then struck up a conversation with me and took my details. After few days, I received a friend’s request on my social media profile and accepted it. A few days later, he met me and then he came to my house. He begged my hand and my family members agreed. We got married in Alandi, but he never took me to his house,” the woman said. “He promised to provide a job to my brother in the Indian Army as jawan and took Rs2lakh from my parents. Similarly, 10 to 15 friends of my brother gave him money,” she said adding, “But he kept on providing lame excuses to us.” Another woman (24), who stays in the old parts of the city, said, “I got in touch with him through a matrimony website where he identified himself as an officer in the Indian Army. He took money on several occasions from me, claiming that he needed money as he was posted in far-flung areas. I transferred him about Rs 1 lakh to him,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-held-on-charge-of-marrying-several-women-cheating-youngsters-with-army-job-promise/articleshow/84186050.cms||---

The deceased are Ashna Nawas, 22, of Perumbavoor, her younger brother Adil Nawas, 18 and a friend Ebin Paul, 20. Another youth, Praveen of Konthuruthy, who was on the boat was rescued by local residents. The incident happened around 4.30pm when they were reportedly going towards Konthuruthy from Nettoor. “The deceased woman had made a cake for a birthday celebration. It seems like the two youths came to Nettoor to pick up the woman and her brother to take them to Konthuruthy, when the tragedy hit,” said an officer with Panagad police. Panangad police have registered a case. Samu, a person residing near the accident spot, said that his daughter spotted the incident and raised an alarm. “My daughter was watering the plants when she saw them drowning. She raised an alarm and some boys who were playing nearby also sounded an alarm. Soon, a man went to the spot and rescued one person,” said Samu. Police said the boat was quite small and it capsized around 15m away from the spot where they boarded.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: 100% plantation in districts, barring two||LUCKNOW: Sunday’s mammoth drive to sow 25.5 crore saplings had Chitrakoot forest division contributing the maximum in terms of the percentage of the plantation done. The division achieved the target of 117%, which was the maximum in the state. Hathras forest division with 116% plantation stood second and Shravasti third with 112%. As far as the number of seedlings planted on the day was concerned, Sonbhadra sowed the maximum — more than 81 lakh. The division was assigned the target of over 79 lakh saplings on Sunday. Lakhimpur Kheri planted around 67 lakh saplings against the target of 67 lakh and Mirzapur sowed more than 58 lakh saplings against the target of over 55 lakh. The two districts were the significant contributors in Vriksharopan Janaandolan 2021. Chitrakoot got more than 55 lakh saplings planted against the target of over 48 lakh and Hathras planted over 21 lakh trees against the target of more than 18 lakh. The other forest divisions that planted more than 50 lakh trees included Bijnor, Sitapur, Hardoi, Jalaun, Jhansi and Shravasti. Lalitpur, Hamirpur, Etawah, Kanpur Dehat, Mahoba, Unnao, Shahjahanpur, Gonda, Bahraich, Barabanki and Azamgarh were other forest division to have planted considerable number of trees. Of the 30 crore saplings to be planted in 2021-22, 25 crore were sowed on Sunday alone. The actual number of trees that were planted on the day, however, was more than the target. The remaining five crore trees will be planted in the monsoon season. The districts that planted lesser number of trees on Sunday might get more to plant out of the five crore remaining trees. Every district reported 100 percent plantation or more except Ayodhya and Balrampur. “There was no target set for the divisions for the day. The target is for the entire plantation period,” said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/100-plantation-in-districts-barring-2/articleshow/84188316.cms||Neha Shukla

Its pinkish eyes indicate that it is an albino. The Himalayan bulbul is a species of songbird in the bulbul family found in Central and South Asia. “The albino Himalayan bulbul [pycnonotus leucogenys] has been clicked by one of our guides deployed in the Dhela zone of Corbett. It is the first such spotting of this bird which has white-coloured body and pink eyes,” said the director of the reserve, Rahul. The officials are now planning to keep a close watch on the animals and birds in albinism and leucism-form. They are maintaining the data. An albino turns the entire body white and eyes red and pink while in leucism some parts of the body get white patches. “The researchers will be able to identify the reasons behind this condition and further explore scientific aspects of both leucism and albinism,” added Rahul. The sighting happened in the Dhela zone while recently in the Jhirna zone, the patrolling team saw white peafowl. The patrolling staff on duty near Kothi Rau of Jhirna zone saw the peacock and then they scanned the camera trap installed in that zone for confirmation. To their surprise, they found one albino peacock displaying its beautiful white feathers while all others were multi-colored common peafowls. Incidentally, the officials of Corbett also saw albino sambar deer in its Pakhro zone and an albino catfish in the Jhirna zone some time ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/now-albino-songbird-spotted-in-corbett-tiger-reserve/articleshow/84183841.cms||Shivani Azad

On Tuesday, two camps were organised, one of which was in Tihar area. On Wednesday, a special drive will be conducted for the transgender community. TimesViewTaking care of the marginals and those discriminated against is among the fundamental duties of any welfare state. In this case, there are health imperatives too. This is a positive step for all.A senior official in charge of the programme said these people were being given priority because in case of a possible third Covid-19 wave, they would be the most vulnerable. Also, since they were out on the streets, they could also become superspreaders. “Many times, the vaccination site is far from the homes of such people. To get there, they have to forego a day’s wages. Mobile sites have been made for them to get vaccinated at their location. Many such drives will be conducted in the future too,” added the official. West district magistrate Kriti Garg said, “My teams are ensuring that vaccination is easily available to all. For this, we have both usual centres as well as special sites. The mobile vaccination team was created for the urban homeless who don’t have ID cards. They are validated by the NGO Sofia, which maintains DUSIB shelter homes.” Tuesday’s drive covered 60 mentally challenged orphans from Asha Jyoti Home in Nirmal Chhaya Complex and 41 people lodged at DUSIB shelter home in Tilak Nagar. While 95 people in the 18-44 years age group got their first Covishield dose, three aged between 45 and 60 years got their first dose and three their second. Vaatsalya Kumar, OSD, vaccination and control room in-charge, said, “Our team has been working round the clock to increase accessibility of vaccines to all groups, especially vulnerable ones like daily wagers, mentally challenged, transgenders, etc. We are trying to prevent any superspreader event ahead of a possible third wave.” Sisodia raises alarm on vaccine shortageDeputy CM Manish Sisodia on Tuesday raised an alarm on shortage of vaccine in Delhi and tweeted that after two weeks of vaccination at a record speed, Delhi now has a shortage and the supply from the Centre was not coming.

---||India||Act against those responsible for framing Stan: Opposition to President||NEW DELHI: A day after Father Stan Swamy’s death in custody, 10 opposition leaders wrote to President Ram Nath Kovind expressing deep anguish and outrage and demanded his immediate intervention. Referring to the death of Swamy, held under the UAPA in the Elgar Parishad case, the opposition leaders said that as President of India, Kovind should direct “your government” to act against those responsible for “foisting false cases” on the activist. They said those responsible for his continued detention in jail and for the “inhuman treatment” meted out to him should be held to account. The letter, signed by opposition leaders, including Congress president Sonia Gandhi, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, former PM H D Deve Gowda, chief ministers Mamata Banerjee, M K Stalin and Hemant Soren, along with Left leaders Sitaram Yechury and D Raja, said the President must act in the case of Swamy’s death. “It is now incumbent that all those jailed in the Bhima Koregaon case and other detenues under politically motivated cases, misusing draconian laws like UAPA, sedition etc, be released forthwith,” the opposition leaders said in their letter to the President. They said the 84-year-old Jesuit priest and activist who championed the rights and causes of tribals in far-flung areas of Jharkhand was jailed last October on “trumped up charges”. “He was denied treatment for his various ailments, including the debilitating Parkinson’s disease. Only after a nationwide campaign was conducted that even a sipper to drink liquids was made available to him in jail,” it said. The signatories, who also included National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah and RJD’s Tejaswi Yadav, also said numerous appeals made to shift Father Swamy out of the over-crowded Taloja jail, which had seen a huge rise in Covid cases, went unheeded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/act-against-those-responsible-for-framing-stan-opposition-to-president/articleshow/84191176.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Perfect honeymoon for Asiatic lions||RAJKOT: The purring of lion cubs in Gujarat’s biggest forest department-run zoo, Sakkarbaug, in Junagadh, is growing louder by the day! Thanks to successful breeding, adopting scientific methods to encourage mating and mood-boosting nutrition, as many as 40 cubs have been born in the zoo in the last 18 months. This is a record of sorts as the average number of lion cubs born in captive breeding every year range between five to seven. Official data shows that 26 cubs were born in 2020 and 14 till July this year. Of these, six cubs were born last week. Abhishek Kumar, Sakkarbaug zoo director, who has specialized in veterinary science and wildlife nutrition, started an experiment of encouraging breeding using scientific approach. Traditionally, the breeding method in the zoo for years had been making pairs of lions and lionesses for breeding, but this yielded limited results. “If both are kept together, the female has to forcibly accept the male’s dominance. But this doesn’t result in successful breeding. If a lioness remains furious and stressed, she doesn’t allow the lion to mate, which can result in the latter injuring her. Studying their behaviour and psychology, we used to change the partner which we found stressed out,” explained Abhishek Kumar, zoo director. For successful mating, one lion is brought from the wild, and for the past two years, zoo authorities keenly started observing if they were comfortable in each other’s company. The indications of the camaraderie includes playing with each other, smelling etc and the absence of such behaviour indicates something abnormal which is not conducive for mating. Once the zoo officials felt that they had made a good pair, a conducive atmosphere, which they describe as ‘honeymoon,’ was created for free fifteen days or till the time they successfully mated. Earlier, the pair was separated after one or two matings, but now special care is taken of the king and queen. Another important change that was brought about was the food provided to the lions during the ‘honeymoon’ period. “Lions are given liver portions of buffalo meat or bone parts which they relish and elevates their mood. Earlier the caretaker assigned the job to serve food was randomly giving the meat,” said Kumar. Regular checks of deficiency like calcium phosphate, zinc, magnesium are also conducted so that foods rich in these nutrients are given. Moreover, special care is taken of lionesses after they conceive too. Along with nutritional food, a special bed is prepared for the lioness 10 days before she gives birth and care is taken that she is not disturbed or stressed.  The bed is made of sand and gravel which absorbs liquids as the accumulation can result in fungal infection in the cubs. A lioness gives birth in 95-105 days after conceiving.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/perfect-honeymoon-for-asiatic-lions/articleshow/84183859.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Kochi||146 flyers leave for UAE after taking Rapid PCR test at Cochin International Airport limited||KOCHI: With international departures commencing operations from Cochin International Airport Limited (Cial) on Monday, 146 passengers left for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) after undergoing the mandatory Rapid PCR test. It is the first time during the second wave of the pandemic that such a large number of passengers have flown out on a single flight. The UAE government gave special permission to 146 passengers who travelled to Abu Dhabi by an Etihad flight (EY247) that departed at 8.15am. Though the ban on international air travel is effective till July 31 due to the outbreak of the second wave of the pandemic, a special arrangement has been made between India and certain countries, permitting passengers to fly to some international sectors through the Air bubble operations. The Rapid PCR testing facility established by CIAL at its international terminal is a great help for passengers travelling to UAE. The Dubai Supreme Committee of Crisis and Disaster Management amended the travel protocol for Indian passengers in its June 19 circular, permitting them to arrive UAE with the compliance of rules, including a mandatory Rapid PCR negative certificate taken 4 hours before the departure. Following this, Cial Managing Director S Suhas has directed to find suitable labs, authorised by Kerala Medical Corporation Ltd, for operating the Rapid PCR testing centre. Cial commissioned the facility on June 28. The testing centre at T3 can carry out the test on 200 passengers in an hour. The facility gives the test result in less than half an hour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/146-flyers-leave-for-uae-after-taking-rapid-pcr-test-at-cial/articleshow/84186113.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cov on the wane but devastates family fin||Kolkata: The second wave has seen more than one member of the same family, in fact an entire family in some cases, getting infected and requiring hospitalization. This has left many families financially drained out. Those unable to foot the entire treatment cost had to pool in fund from relatives and close contacts to clear the dues while some even knocked the doors of the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission for intervention. A 35-year-old man from southern fringes of the city sought admission in a safe home in Park Circus in June after the family’s mediclaim amount was reduced to a negligible amount after the his mother’s Covid treatment in a Mukundapur hospital. Later, the youth had to be shifted to the same hospital as his condition deteriorated. He is still in ICU and the bill has accumulated to Rs 15 lakhs. The family has started crowd-funding and pooling in funds from relatives. Unlike the first wave, the average length of hospital stay has increased as more than 90% patients now need long oxygen therapy, with some even needing prolong intensive care treatment and few requiring extremely costly treatment like ECMO support. “This time, we took in only those whose oxygen saturation went below 93% and most of them needed prolonged treatment. So if more than one from the same family needed hospital care, the bill amount will obviously be high for that family and specially if they are ‘cash’ patients. Luckily, about 90% of our patients had insurance cover,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. On Monday, the health panel had asked a nursing home in Rajarhat to refund Rs 4.3 lakh to the lone surviving adult member of a family whose parents-in-law and husband died during Covid treatment. The family had incurred a bill of about Rs 14 lakhs on account of the trio’s treatment, ranging between 14 days to 17 days. Sources in the commission said they had received a good number of appeals regarding hospital bills. “The patient turnover time was much higher and due to the nature of the infection, many had to be on costly drugs, especially those in the ICU,” said CK Birla Hospitals CMRI COO Simmardeep Gill. Charges on various heads for private hospitals for Covid treatment have already been capped. Even as treatment is government Covid facilities are free during the peak, a section of patients rushed to wherever they could find a bed. “We have had many cases where a patient was unable to foot the bill. We tried to help through our patient support cell by raising funds and waiving a part of the bill,” said Narayana Health regional director (East) R Venkatesh. Medications like tocilizumab cost about Rs 40,000 a vial while that of remdesivir cost about Rs 5,000 a vial. Some patients need 15 vials. “The cost, especially for cash patients when more than one from the same family need hospital care, could be high. Our financial counselling cell informs patients’ families on tentative cost well in advance,” said an official of AMRI group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-on-the-wane-but-devastates-family-fin/articleshow/84186106.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Nagpur||Cases down, Nagpur private hospital downsize Covid beds||NAGPUR: Not allowed to shut their Covid facilities completely, many private hospitals have restricted their Covid hospitals to one or two bed in a room as the flow of regular patients, follow up cases and trauma victims have resumed full fledged. Some hospitals said they do get one or two queries in a week from the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) control room but they refuse to admit a single patient. On June 30, TOI had reported how the number of patients now admitted to dedicated Covid hospitals (DCH) are now quite less than what it was exactly a year ago. Admitting a single patient blocks a large part of the hospital, staff and equipment which is right now needed for other patients. Some doctors said they are keeping some beds reserved for staff members who may test positive or any emergency Covid case which may turn up during night hours. TOI spoke to a couple of prominent hospitals which were most-sought after during the second wave peak for admission. They refused to be quoted but explained the ongoing scenario. They claimed that “certain portion of hospital beds were reserved for Covid-19 even today”. The hospital had been offered nearly 100 beds for Covid but the “certain portion of beds” stood at less than 20 now. Another big hospital said it had one Covid-19 patient admitted but didn’t disclose how much it was charging the patient. Similarly, other hospitals revealed they had brought down the Covid bed to under 10. Vidarbha Hospital Association (VHA) convener Dr Anup Marar said, “It is true that all our member hospitals who were forced by NMC to serve Covid patients under capped charges bypassing compensation as per National Authority guidelines had conveyed their reluctance to continue as Covid Hospitals for forthcoming 3rd wave. This was due to the thankless attitude of social activists and administration post second wave. Instead of trying to understand the practical difficulties of managing a Covid hospital during these turbulent times, witch hunting was gleefully undertaken casting aspersions on private health care sector in totality without ever giving any thought of providing compensation as per constitutional norms.” Dr Marar added, “It is practically impossible to admit and treat present trickle of an occasional patient. Blocking complete section, arranging staff with restrictions of PPE usage over and above capped charges topped with an administration led auditor as per GR is difficult to comply. Moreover ever changing guidelines have now removed Remdesivir from treatment protocol which has stunned many specialists. So technically if one does prescribe the drug, he or she can be hauled up by administration. Hence most of hospitals are refraining from admitting an occasional Covid patient.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cases-down-pvt-hospital-downsize-covid-beds/articleshow/84186160.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

She also directed the officials concerned to meet the deadline fixed by the railways to give an impetus to development network in Bihar. Goel also took stock of monsoon safety measures at a time when several rivers in Bihar are in spate disrupting passenger train services on a few sections of Samastipur division due to floodwaters touching rail bridge girder. According to ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, Goel took keen interest in the appointment process on compassionate ground to the next of kin of railway employees who died of Covid. The ECR has lost more than 100 frontline workers and railway doctors during the second wave. The GM directed each division to extend all possible assistance to railway employees and their families. Expressing satisfaction at the track condition and its fitness during window trailing inspection right from Deen Dayal Upadhaya Junction to Patna Junction section of the Danapur division, she asked senior officials concerned to maintain a higher trend of goods loading in the ECR and ensure passengers’ safety amid the pandemic. Besides these, the GM issued an advisory to each division of the ECR to work out a comprehensive plan to provide more passenger amenities in passenger trains originating from different stations of the ECR.

---||Hyderabad||HCA president Mohammed Azharuddin’s move to delegate powers to nominated members draws flak||HYDERABAD: Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) president Mohammed Azharuddin’s move to delegate the responsibilities of the five ‘temporarily disqualified’ apex council members to non-elected members was not successful as both the representatives of the players’ panel rejected the offer. The move has also not gone down well with HCA members. It is learnt that Parth Satwalkar and Subhadra Suri declined to take up the additional charge during an apex council meeting convened by Azhar on Tuesday. It is also learnt that CAG nominee Santosh Daware did not attend the meeting. A day after denying the five members entry to the Gymkhana, there were questions as to how Azhar, the only elected member left in the apex council, would run the administration, the president took another debatable decision. In his order dated July 4, Azhar said: “Due to the temporary vacancy created by the disqualification of the above members (K John Manoj, R Vijayanand, Naresh Sharma, Surender Agarwal and P Anuradha) and to ensure the continuity of administration in the HCA, I, Mohammed Azharuddin, president-HCA, in exercise of the powers vested in me under Rule 7(1)(d), hereby assign additional charge to the following members of the apex council.” The circular said Satwalkar will hold additional charge of councillor, Suri of vice-president and joint secretary, and Daware of treasurer. Azharuddin himself took the additional charge of secretary. “It’s not finalised yet. We have to get the consent of the people. I have to ensure that there is no break in the administration,” Azhar told TOI. “It is unfortunate that people who have ruined the association in the last 20 years are speaking about rules. Starting league matches is fraught with danger because there is a strong talk about the third wave. If something untoward happens, we could end up behind bars,” Azhar added. HCA vice-president John Manoj contested the move. “The rule he quotes says, ‘the president shall, in the event of a vacancy or indisposition of an office-bearer, delegate the functions to another office-bearer until the vacancy is duly filled up, or the indisposition ceases’. How can nominated members of the apex council be office-bearers? How can they be given additional duties of the elected members,” he asked. Former secretary PR Man Singh said: “Justice (retd) Lodha too may not have foreseen such a situation where five office-bearers are suspended at a time. The HCA should amend its constitution to provide a remedy for such a situation,” he said. Ex-secretary, T Shesh Narayan, said: “How can CAG nominee be given charge of treasurer? He is a government employee.” Ex-secretary S Venkateswaran, said: “No secretary will support Azhar in this matter.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/azhars-move-to-delegate-powers-to-nominated-members-draws-flak/articleshow/84186152.cms||Solomon S Kumar
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Angry medical interns take their protest to the streets||DEHRADUN: Protesting MBBS interns today stepped outside their campus to protest against the Rs 250 per day stipend that they receive in return for working in high-risk Covid wards. The interns took a procession out from Government Doon Medical College to Kali mandir chowk. On the way, the interns stopped to talk to people on the streets and spread awareness about Covid’s impending third wave. They hadn’t stepped out of the college premises till now following disciplinary norms. The interns got political support from the Uttarakhand Kranti Dal. Over 330 MBBS interns in Uttarakhand have been on strike for four days demanding a hike in their stipend. Despite doing duty in high-risk Covid wards, these interns were paid just Rs 250 per day or Rs 7,500 per month, and they are demanding that the sum be raised to Rs 23,500, at par with central institutions. Since May, the interns said, they have been working day and night in Covid wards but till date they haven’t received any stipend. Some of them got infected while attending Covid patients and one intern was critical and referred to AIIMS-Rishikesh. While a few others’ parents were down with Covid and yet they chose to attend to their duty instead of attending to their ailing parents. The interns feel that despite making such sacrifices they have been short changed by the government. They haven’t received May’s stipend or the additional emoluments of up to Rs 60,000 promised to them by the state medical colleges. The protesting interns said that the current stipend of Rs 250 per day equates to daily wage of labourers. Although working in Covid wards lent them significant experience in handling emergency health situations, it was also traumatic for them. “It is part of our education to practice at the hospital but since we are being deployed in Covid wards under critical pandemic situation, we would urge the administration to kindly consider our request on humanitarian grounds as we are risking our lives,” said Akshat Thapa, representative of agitating MBBS interns at Doon Medical College hospital. Hem Chandra Pandey, VC, HNB Uttarakhand Medical Education University told TOI, “We have already forwarded their file and request for Rs 30,000 emolument for working in Covid wards, but increasing their stipend is a matter that only the state government can decide. It is not under the jurisdiction of the Medical Council of India.” Pandey further said that the decision regarding stipend amount “is solely based on the economic condition of a state.” Meanwhile, 99 students each at Srinagar Medical College and Haldwani Medical College continued to protest. Students at Srinagar and Doon medical colleges have been issued notices by the college administration for their “indisciplined behaviour’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/angry-medical-interns-take-their-protest-to-the-streets/articleshow/84183883.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Madurai||Madras HC tells state to use tech to monitor pleas to avoid delay||MADURAI: Taking a serious view that several detention orders passed by the authorities are being quashed by courts on technical grounds due to delay in considering the representations, the Madras high court on Monday suggested the state to establish a dedicated web portal or to use technologies such as e-mail, fax or WhatsApp to monitor their movement. The court was hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by Machakalai seeking to quash the detention order passed against his son Raguvaran alias Anbu who was arrested in a case for possession of commercial quantity (30kg) of ganja in Madurai district in 2020. The court had quashed the detention order against Anbu on the ground that there was a delay in considering the representation. A division bench of justices K Kalyanasundaram and B Pugalendhi observed that the objective of detention and the detention laws, is not to punish, but to prevent the commission of offences. The judges took note of the fact that the detenu was released on statutory bail under Section 167(2) of CrPC, on March 26, 2021, due to the delay in filing the final report before the court. The judges observed that while the inspector of police of Sindupatti police station in Madurai submitted that the investigation in the case was completed and the final report was made ready as early as on October 23, 2020 and was placed before the special public prosecutor for NDPS Act cases in Madurai, for vetting, the special public prosecutor denied receiving it. “The inspector of police and the special public prosecutor are passing the buck from one to another. None of them is taking the responsibility. Because of the lack of responsibility and accountability on the part of both the investigation and prosecution agency, an accused, who was found in possession of commercial quantity of contraband, was enlarged on statutory bail, despite the investigation was completed and the final report was prepared within the stipulated time limit,” observed the judges. Taking into account that there is a delay in filing final reports in several cases due to the process of submitting the final reports to the public prosecutors for vetting, the judges observed that the police can even approach the hierarchy of officers available in the directorate of prosecution. “Be it the public prosecutors or the officers of the directorate of prosecution, they should be instructed to take a maximum of seven days to vet the final reports. There should be a mechanism of giving acknowledgements for the receipt of final reports for vetting, reminders in writing, if any, etc,” observed the judges while directing the director of prosecution at Chennai, to issue necessary directions or instructions in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-tells-state-to-use-tech-to-monitor-pleas-to-avoid-delay/articleshow/84183896.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Otherwise, the state government will make necessary changes to the initial plan and execute the project with its own funds,” the minister said, while speaking at the inauguration of the Balanagar flyover. He said that the state government wants to build two skyways i.e. from Patny to Suchitra and Jubilee Bus Stand to Outer Ring Road (ORR), Turkapally. “The money has been arranged, HMDA officials have been given all instructions about the project, and we decided to go ahead even if the expenditure runs into Rs 3,000 crore or Rs 4,000 crore because it is for the people. But despite all this, for the last four years, we have been struggling to get a response from the Union government to allot the required defence land that comes in the way of the project,” Rao said The minister said that the Centre is not responding to Telangana’s pleas for four years and they do not understand the woes of the people of Hyderabad, as a result of which these skyways are getting delayed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ktr-if-centre-fails-t-will-take-up-skyways-project-on-its-own/articleshow/84186212.cms||---

The guards will work in three shifts, keep a watch on the vulnerable spots and help the irrigation department officials in daily work at the dam sites. At least 10 guards would be appointed at each dam. The irrigation department said it was also planning to approach local police stations to appoint teams of police officers at the dam sites. The three dams — a part of the Khadakwasla irrigation circle — are located within 50km from the city. Many people visit these reservoirs during the monsoon, but entering the water is not allowed. Sources in the irrigation department said the footfall had been comparatively less this year because of the pandemic restrictions, but instances of overcrowding could not be ruled out in future if the norms were relaxed. “We have a limited number of staff strength. It is difficult to deploy all the staffers at the dam sites. Some employees have retired and the vacant posts are yet to be filled. Considering all these aspects, a decision was taken to appoint an agency to increase security at the dams. The guards are being given basic training. There is a plan to set up chowkis (booths) at the dams for these guards,” an official from the irrigation department said. The irrigation department said it would replicate the deployment of guards at more dams if the new system worked effectively at Panshet, Khadakwasla and Varasgaon. The irrigation department had initiated steps to construct a wall at some spots along the Khadakwasla dam to prevent people from entering the water. Subhash Jadhav, a regular commuter on the Khadakwasla Road, said, “People do not bother about the rules and enter the water without any safety measures. The police and the irrigation department have put up boards appealing people to refrain from entering the water. The authorities should not allow parking of vehicles on the road along the dam”. An officials from the irrigation department said the presence of guards and police would deter people from entering the water. On Tuesday, the water stock in Khadakwasla was 35%, Panshet had 39% and Varasgaon was 24% full. The collective stock of the four dams in the Khadakwasla circle, including Temghar, was at 8.68 TMC (29%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/security-guards-to-prevent-people-from-entering-water-at-3-dams/articleshow/84186200.cms||Sarang Dastane

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Two Rohingya held for living illegally in Rajendranagar||HYDERABAD: Rajendranagar police arrested two Rohingya Muslim refugees of Myanmar for obtaining Aadhaar cards and other ID proofs illegally. After coming to India, the accused married two women refugees from Myanmar who were also named as accused in the case. The arrested accused are Abdul Munnaf alias Ayan Ansari, 31, a labourer from Chintalmet in Rajendranagar and Hafiz Ahmed, 34, a fish vendor from MM Pahadi in Rajendranagar. According to the police, the duo are natives of Gondusar Momakindao Maerma village in Maungdow district of Rakhine State, Myanmar. Abdul’s wife Noor Khalima and Hafiz’s wife Shaik Rofika, both refugees from Myanmar, have also been named as accused in the case but are yet to be arrested. Due to problems in Myanmar, in 2014, Abdul entered India illegally by crossing the India-Bangladesh border and in the same manner, Hafiz came to India in 2017 via Bangladesh, Rajendranagar inspector K Kanakaiah said. After entering India, the duo took shelter in Punjab and Mumbai respectively and later moved to New Delhi. They obtained refugee certificates from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and worked as labourers in private firms in Delhi. “As the company management insisted on Aadhaar card details for employment, the duo obtained Aadhaar cards by paying money to unidentified agents in Delhi. They also obtained PAN cards, driving license, voter ID cards, LPG connections and opened bank accounts,” the inspector said. The duo came to Hyderabad in 2018. Acting on specific information, police raided the houses of the duo on Monday night and seized the ID proofs obtained illegally. The accused were booked and produced before a local court and sent in judicial remand on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2-rohingya-held-for-living-illegally/articleshow/84186167.cms||---

The party also appealed to people to introspect over Swamy’s death and revolt against the Modi-led BJP government. Calling it an “institutional murder”, Goa Pradesh congress committee president Girish Chodankar said the activist’s death should be seen as his sacrifice for the nation and should awaken the national conscience. “Since this BJP government has come to power, it has sent around 3,974 activists behind bars to suppress their voice. They should be released immediately,” he said. “How can an octogenarian activist pose a threat to a nation when he had no arms and ammunition? Considering his age, the government should have shown some mercy. They failed to give him his rights and facilities after his arrest. Rather he met injustice and harassment.” Chodankar was speaking at a protest organised by Congress at Azad Maidan, Panaji, in honour of Swamy. Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat, Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lorenco, former minister Aleixio Sequeira, Mahila Congress president Beena Naik, Youth Congress president Varad Mardolkar, NSUI president Naushad Chowdhary, south district president Joe Dias, spokesperson Tulio D’Souza and other leaders were present. Stating that freedom of speech is a fundamental right, Kamat said, “So many intellectuals have been arrested. Democracy remains on paper if activists are arrested for making statements.” He appealed for their immediate release so that nobody else meets the same fate as Swamy. “Swamy’s death should not go in vain as he always said innocent people should not be jailed,” D’Souza said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fr-swamys-death-should-be-seen-as-a-sacrifice-awaken-conscience-of-nation/articleshow/84186177.cms||---

A 13-day special campaign launched on Tuesday will help legal heirs of those who died of Covid get property rights. “The current phase of the scheme will provide ‘khatauni’ or record of rights to legal heirs or widows of land owners. The drive will continue till July 18 and special camps will be set up to dispose of cases. Resolving this at the earliest will ensure widows without livelihood to seamlessly get land and property rights,” said a government spokesperson. The slogan — ‘Sabke Saath Khadi Hai Sarkar’ — will mark this campaign. Over next two weeks, lekhpals and kanungos will visit 1,08,992 revenue villages and collate details on undisputed inheritance of villagers who lost family members to Covid. Widows won’t have to submit any application for this. Lekhpals and kanungos have been directed to collect all information on their own and take necessary action. Pattas of agricultural and residential land will be allotted to widows as per eligibility. If they are eligible to housing facilities, construction of houses will be done with help of rural development department. The government had deputed around 22,000 lekhpals and nearly 2,500 kanungos for this drive.

EDC chairman Sadanand Shet Tanavade handed over a cheque of Rs 86 lakh as dividend for the year 2019-20 to the chief minister at a function held on Tuesday. Sawant praised EDC for its achievement, stating that it is the only corporation among others in the state that is ‘swayampurna’. The chief minister also said that when the chairman and directors come up with something innovative, then the corporation can turn profitable. Attempting to reach out to people in the hinterland, Sawant said that if a person from the rural talukas wants to do business then EDC provides loans at up to 2% interest and urged people to come forward and avail of this facility. Sawant also said that if PWD contractors are awarded work orders then EDC can provide finance for this purpose, and added that EDC can also finance startups. Sawant stated that 71 gram panchayats have been covered under Swayampurna Goa by EDC Urged other corporations to adopt the sawayampurna programme in order to assist citizens, the chief minister said that there are many corporations in Goa where the state government has to infuse corpus funds, and called for an end to this practice. “These corporations should run various activities to generate funds,” the chief minister said. Tanavade said that the rate of interest on loans have been decreased by one per cent for MSMEs. He said that EDC has also simplified the process for loan disbursement, which will now be done within 15 days. If people from backward talukas like Pernem, Bicholim, Sattari, Sanguem, Quepem and Canacona approach EDC for loans, they will get 5% less rate of interest on loans, the EDC chairman said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-will-support-youth-to-set-up-it-biz-sawant/articleshow/84186218.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kochi: Building a safe space for artists to create comics||KOCHI: To keep people connected with each other using comics as a medium, the comic creators in Kochi have started an online event called ‘Let’s Make a Comic?’. It is a social event where people from various backgrounds and age groups can come together and create a two-page comic in just under two hours. The first session was held on Sunday, and nearly 20 people, including children, took part in creating their own comics. The programme is led by Sanid Asif Ali and Nithin Mathew, two comic creators in the city, who have hosted various comic-related programmes earlier. The main purpose of the initiative is to create a community that is a safe space for artists at different stages of their career to come together and create personal art and have fun. “We are all living isolated from each other in little islands, and now more than ever, we are losing a sense of community. Art really brings together people, and comics are something that has a strong sense of nostalgia for many. We also want to create an awareness of how comics can be used as a tool of personal expression,” Ali said. The team encouraged not just artists, but anyone who was inclined to the art of storytelling to come and give a shot at comic making. The basic theme given to the participants was ‘time’, and each of them developed their own works. Even children came up with really interesting comics and explained in detail the story. All the works have been posted on the event’s Insta handle @letsmakecomicevent. “Let’s make a comic is an event in which all the artists, let it be beginners or professional, can push their art block and work creatively in a given period. This, in a way, mimics the pressure of deadline. We discussed why we love comics and even talked about the comic books which inspired us. It is during this time that our minds work more creatively. We are hoping to conduct this event every month,” Mathew said. As it is online, people based in other states too participated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/building-a-safe-space-for-artists-to-create-comics/articleshow/84186190.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

Alarmed by the surge in the number of visitors since the restrictions were eased at the beginning of the month, the district administration has put in place checks to prevent the virus spread. As part of containment measures, six kiosks have been set up in Bolpur and Rampurhat to check visitors' documents. Health officials have also been posted at prominent tourist spots like Santiniketan and Kankalitala temple near Bolpur and Tarapith and Rampurhat to conduct random tests and isolate those who test positive. “The Covid situation in Birbhum is now better. Apprehending another wave, we are keeping a vigil on visitors. Hence we are maintaining surveillance at places were most tourists throng. For the safety of both visitors and locals, tests will be conducted and tourists will be encouraged to follow Covid guidelines,” said Birbhum DM Bidhan Roy. Since July 1, tourists have started flocking to various tourist spots in Birbhum. Though entry into Visva-Bharati compound is restricted, many visitors who poured over last weekend, a district official said. “Since the Covid restrictions were eased, we have been getting a deluge of queries for hotel bookings.

---||Bhopal||Caught On Camera: Wildlife thrives secretly within Gwalior||BHOPAL: There are several wild animals living covertly within the municipal limits of Gwalior city and that too without any major conflict situation. A group of wildlife enthusiasts have successfully proved their existence in the vicinity by installing camera traps. Leopards, striped hyena, Indian jackal, wild boar, chital, blue bull, four-horned antelope, Indian hare, ruddy mongoose, and Indian crested porcupine are among the threatened species they were able to capture on camera. Team comprising Devavrat Pawar, Udayan Rao Pawar, Mahipati Rao Pawar, Sagarika Phalke, Yash Kumar Agrawal, Siddhant Umariya, Gabbar Singh Gurjar and Sonu Singh Gurjar claim to have collected the first photographic evidence of leopards from the Gwalior Forest Division in the last several years. Devavrat Pawar works as a conservation biologist with WWF-India in the Terai Arc Landscape for the past 4 years with focus on tigers and leopards. Similarly, Udayan Rao Pawar is a wildlife photographer who has won prestigious awards in wildlife photography, one of which was for the picture on Gharials from Chambal River. “The world’s most versatile wild cat, the leopard (Panthera pardus fusca), was photo captured for the first time in Gwalior Forest Division, Madhya Pradesh, India. We confirm the presence of the Indian leopard, detected on deployed camera traps during an opportunistic camera trap survey,” they claim. “Gwalior contains anecdotal records of tigers and leopards, amongst other wildlife being hunted by shikaris during colonial and post-colonial periods (up until the enforcement of the WPA),” the team said. “While previous literature indicates the presence of leopards in Gwalior, these camera-trap images of the leopard are to the best of our knowledge the first documented photograph within the municipality. Given the current human population of the district stands at 2032036 individuals, the record of the leopard within this landscape acts as an impetus to create species-specific conservation measures within the Gwalior Forest Division,” they said. The images of leopards were obtained during an opportunistic camera trap survey conducted by the Gwalior Forest Division (GFD) and the members of Gwalior Forester’s Society. The cameras were deployed in the field for 25 days (June 2021), on the basis of the results from the previously conducted sign surveys in order to obtain the best possible locations for camera trap deployment to maximise the chances of capturing the fauna of the area. Though patchy, Gwalior FD in north of Madhya Pradesh (MP) is connected to Kuno National Park Sanctuary, MP and Madhav National Park, MP and serves as a crucial wildlife corridor for tigers, leopards, sloth bears and other animals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/caught-on-camera-wildlife-thrives-secretly-within-gwalior/articleshow/84190091.cms||---

A source said 175 children each have been enrolled for age groups— 2-6, 6-12 and 12-18. “Most of the children have received the first dose of Covaxin – India’s indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine – and are being closely monitored for complications, if any, as well as the immune response generated after the vaccine,” said Dr Sanjay Rai, in charge of the trials at AIIMS Delhi. Apart from AIIMS Delhi, the trials on kids are being conducted at five other medical institutions across the country, including ESI in Delhi, AIIMS Patna, Mysuru Medical College and Research Institute, Prakhar hospital in Kanpur, Pranaam hospital in Hyderabad and Meditrinia Institute of Medical Sciences in Nagpur. India has approved three vaccines — Covaxin, Covishield and Sputnik — for immunisation of adults aged 18 years and above. However, there are no vaccines approved for children at present. The US and the UK have approved Pfizer for use in children above 12 years. Bharat Biotech, the company manufacturing Covaxin, was permitted by the drug regulatory body to conduct clinical trials of its vaccine on May 12, following which phase II/III trials were started at various centres, including AIIMS Delhi. It started with the screening of teens between 12 and 18 years — the oldest of the targeted population— to rule out Covid-19 and presence of antibodies against the virus. Also, the parents of these kids were asked to sign a consent form for participation of their wards in the trials. Those who cleared the screening process were administered the vaccine. Same process was followed in kids aged between 2 and 6 and 6 and 12 years, a source said. “Some of the participants had to be excluded when tests confirmed they already had antibodies against the virus, possibly due to exposure to the virus that went unnoticed,” said a senior doctor. AIIMS had also conducted phase I, II and III trials of Covaxin in adults. The hospital doctors said they had received 4,000 requests for participation when the requirement was for only 100 adults. “This time, we didn’t advertise much for participation in the clinical trials, but there were enough requests from parents keen to get their children vaccinated as a part of the trial,” said one of the doctors. The clinical trials are significant given the apprehension of an impending third wave of the pandemic in the country which, many experts said, might affect the children more. However, there is no evidence to support the claim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/500-kids-roped-in-for-covaxin-trials-in-six-hospitals/articleshow/84188434.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Kolkata||Call of the wild: You may go tiger-spotting at New Town mini zoo by year end||Kolkata: After Alipore zoo, the city is all set to get its second zoo enclosure. By next year, the deer park in New Town’s Eco Park — Harinalaya — will be developed into a mini zoo and animals like giraffe, zebra, hippo and even tiger, will be introduced. There will also be leopard, wolf and hyena. The first phase of the project is likely to come up by this November, said forest department officials. Harinalaya currently has around 37 deer. The plan that was chalked up by the forest department authorities last year was further discussed with officials of the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) on Tuesday, sources said. A broadband internet connection for having online ticketing system at Harinalaya was introduced on the occasion by New Town Telecom Infrastructure Development Company Limited (NTTIDCO), which is a part of Hidco. Biswanath Sengupta, range officer of Harinalaya, said there will be separate zones for carnivores, omnivores and herbivores. While the carnivore section will house tiger, leopard, wild dog, wolf and hyena, the omnivore aea will have hippos. “The herbivore section will have zebras, giraffes and deer. The first phase is likely to be inaugurated in November. Rest of the work will be completed in a phased manner,” Sengupta said, adding that the animals will be brought from other zoos under exchange programmes. Hidco chairman-cum-managing director Debashis Sen said that they have learned that the forest department had already received affiliation for having a micro zoo enclosure. “In the next stage, it will be a mini zoo enclosure with many more animals. For this, the infrastructure for setting up the living zones will be done,” Sen said. Harinalaya, spread over 10 acres beside gate 6 of Eco Park, was started in 2016. Earlier last year, the West Bengal Zoo Authority got the approval of the master layout plan from the Central Zoo Authority for having a mini zoo in the area. According to Hidco officials, the mini zoo will enrich the biodiversity of the place. A report released by the West Bengal biodiversity board in August 2019 had mentioned that there were about 109 species of vertebrates and 131 species of insects in Eco Park. Hidco has also set up a bird enclosure in New Town which has become a safe habitat for birds and turtles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/call-of-the-wild-you-may-go-tiger-spotting-at-new-town-mini-zoo-by-year-end/articleshow/84186228.cms||Suman Chakraborti

For shopkeepers who have been paying hefty upkeep costs while staying shut for three months, the opening of malls has come as a relief. Residents are equally excited about venturing out after a long time. On Tuesday, TOI visited some popular malls of Dehradun like Pacific Mall and Crossroad Mall. The re-opening of malls has come as a major relief to businessmen. Store manager at Pacific mall, Ratnesh Singh said, “During the nationwide lockdown last year, people survived with the help of savings, but the past three months were full of uncertainties as we were scared of losing jobs. People have started coming back to the shop which is a positive sign. We just hope that people follow social distancing norms.” Agrima Bansal, a college student who was at Pacific Mall, said “My social media account has been brimming with memories of selfies taken with friends at our favourite eating joints. It feels great coming back to make new memories.” Similar enthusiasm was witnessed among the people at Crossroads Mall. Deepti Singh, a homemaker, said “Coming to the mall after a three-month-long hiatus is refreshing. I decided to give myself a break from the routine of making my children sit for online classes. We must follow Covid guidelines to ensure there are no more closures.” On day one of re-opening, the zoos recorded an encouraging turnout. Anuj Mehra, a banker, said, “Children had become frustrated with the long period of confinement. The opening of the zoos has surely made them feel better.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-allows-zoos-malls-to-open-shopkeepers-look-to-mitigate-losses/articleshow/84183940.cms||---

Taking cognizance of it, justice G Ilangovan observed that since the earlier order of the court has been complied with, nothing survives in this petition for further consideration. Hence, the judge closed the contempt petition. The court was hearing the petition filed by S Doraisamy, a Chennai-based advocate , seeking action against the Thirumayam inspector of police for not filing the final report in the case by complying with the earlier orders. The petitioner stated that Raja by violating the orders of the court proceeded to set up a stage for a meeting as a part of Vinayagar Chaturthi celebration at Pudukkottai district on September 15, 2018. When the police attempted to stop him, Raja picked up an argument in which he passed derogatory comments about the judiciary. Since the final report was not filed, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench in 2019. When the contempt petition was taken up for hearing on June 17, the additional public prosecutor (APP) submitted that the final report was already filed before the Thirumayam judicial magistrate. APP had submitted that the Thirumayam judicial magistrate had taken cognizance of the final report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/state-to-hc-final-report-in-h-raja-case-submitted/articleshow/84183957.cms||---
---||Kochi||Ernakulam: Student Police Volunteer Corps ensure blood availability||KOCHI: The Student Police Volunteer Corps (SVC) in Ernakulam Rural district is successfully carrying out the Jeevadhara blood donation programme that was launched to ensure availability of blood amid the pandemic. More than 150 student volunteers have donated blood in the district over the past two months under the programme. The fast coordination of arranging blood donors has made the project popular and many people are now relying on Jeevadhara for blood requirement. Jeevadhara was launched by the Student Police Cadets (SPC) on its 10th anniversary as per the directive of former state police chief DGP Loknath Behera in 2019. As per the programme, cadets have to collect the consent letter from people who are ready to donate blood thereby arranging blood donor group. However, due to the pandemic the project was affected and SVC was officially created in November 2020, with ex-SPC cadets as members, which started coordinating various activities, including Jeevadhara. The project is monitored by SPC state convener inspector general P Vijayan. In Ernakulam Rural, Jeevadhara is coordinated by SVC teacher coordinator Anoob John, SVC district coordinator Sadika Selvan and SVC state vice-president Gokul Krishna. “Ex-SPC cadets have formed a blood donor group that is actively supporting blood requirements in Ernakulam Rural police district. Over 150 volunteers have donated blood at Aluva Blood Bank and other hospitals during the second wave of pandemic. The donors are brought to the hospitals or blood banks in police vehicles under the leadership of SPC assistant district nodal officer (ADNO) Shabu P S. Moreover, parents of SPC cadets too are enrolling as blood donors under Jeevadhara,” said John. In order to urge more volunteers to support the project, SVC and SPC are conducting various awareness campaigns online on the importance of blood donation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/student-police-volunteer-corps-ensure-blood-availability/articleshow/84186227.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Direct contest between BJP & SP at block level||LUCKNOW: After a high-pitched zila panchayat (ZP) chairperson elections, the stage is set for yet another direct political contest between BJP and a belligerent Samajwadi Party in block chairman elections on July 10. Even as BJP decided to announce its candidates at the local level, SP plans to throw in its hat by backing candidates, who could potentially thwart saffron party’s prospects of stealing the march on 825 block-level seats. UP BJP state general secretary and party in charge of rural local bodies’ elections, JPS Rathore said, the party would win maximum number of block chairman seats to further cement its position at the grassroots. He clarified that unlike ZP chairman seats, candidates for block chairman seats would be finalized and announced by the party regional and district-rung functionaries. BJP sources said, the party was in no mood to give room for resurrection of opposition, especially in rural areas that will determine electoral fortunes of parties in the high-stakes assembly elections due next year. Nevertheless, the party may forgo some seats, where its position is not strong. Speculations have begun doing rounds about BJP plans to placate sulking MLAs and MPs by supporting candidates close to them. Experts said, winning block chairperson seats is important for BJP for enabling better coordination with zila panchayat elected chairpersons and members to ensure seamless development of rural areas. BJP had won 66 of 75 ZP chairperson seats, in what allowed the saffron party to escalate its footprints in rural swathes. Samajwadi Party, which managed to win unopposed only five seats, including Etawah, banks on independent candidates to drive antiincumbency against BJP. A keen contest is expected in Azamgarh — parliamentary constituency of SP chief Akhilesh Yadav — which has maximum of 2,104 wards. In ZP chairperson elections, the seat was won by Samajwadi Party. So will be the case in Jaunpur -- it has 2,086 block level wards -- where BJP ally Apna Dal’s candidate Rita Patel lost to independent candidate and mafiaturned-MP Dhananjay Singh’s wife, Srikala Reddy. The head-on contest between BJP and SP at the block level comes in the backdrop of BSP chief Mayawati’s decision to withdraw from rural local bodies elections, citing irregularities in conduct of free and fair polls. Even as Mayawati positioned herself against SP in the ZP chairman elections, the move helped BJP as BSP supported ward members voted in favour of the BJP-backed ZP chairman candidates. The trend is expected to repeat itself in the block level elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/direct-contest-between-bjp-sp-at-block-level/articleshow/84188428.cms||Pankaj Shah

He, along with four other students from different parts of the world, worked on a project titled ‘bias in AI systems and applications’ over a period of 10 weeks. As part of the challenge, the team had to develop solutions to address AI bias issues for one or more AI systems and applications. The solution can include innovations and/or alterations of existing technology and data collected from online open sources. Gurijala, along with four other students from different parts of the world, worked on a project titled ‘bias in AI systems and applications’ over a period of 10 weeksWith AI systems recognizing patterns in datasets, biases in the datasets may be reflected on AI models as well. In many cases, the biased decisions made will have a high impact (for example, choosing whether a person will be hired or not). The team suggested that bias must be eliminated in order for AI models to make fair decisions. “As part of the team, I interviewed a professor in Virginia Tech for AI and took up surveys that were circulated among people engaged in AI. Our team came up with solutions that can give a holistic plan to weed out biases in AI systems and applications,” said Gurijala. The team came up with three primary solutions – bias measuring and mitigation platform, decentralised database and a guidebook that will enable developers and organisations to recognise implicit bias. As a reward, the team members will be given access to courses in New York University. Moving forward, Gurijala, who is already researching independently in the field of AI, plans to pursue higher education in the US in computer science.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/student-wins-intl-challenge-for-developing-solutions-to-ai-biases/articleshow/84186253.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttrakhand moves SC against high court stay on Char Dham Yatra||NAINITAL: A week after the Uttarakhand high court stayed the state cabinet’s decision to open Char Dham shrines for locals of the respective districts, the Pushkar Singh Dhami government has now filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court (SC) challenging the order. The government contended that the HC has committed an error in not appreciating the fact that the livelihood of a significant population living near the shrines depends on the Yatra. The development has been confirmed by two advocates who had already filed caveats on the issue in the SC. According to the advocates, the SLP was filed on Tuesday but is yet to come up for hearing as the apex court has cited certain defects in the plea. “The Supreme Court registry notified us that the state government has challenged the order but there are certain defects which need to be cleared. We expect that the hearing will happen this week itself,” said Dushyant Mainali, one of the advocates. Meanwhile, another counsel Abhijay Negi, who appeared for one of the petitioners Anu Pant based on whose plea the HC stay was imposed, said that they will contest the SLP in the apex court. Negi had also filed a caveat in the SC. In its SLP, a copy of which is available with TOI, the government has argued that the Yatra will be opened in a phased manner and senior officials will be posted at each of the shrines to ensure SOPs are followed. The apex court has also been informed that RT-PCR test will be mandatory for entry into the temples and that only a few hundred pilgrims will be allowed into the temples a day. The government has contended that none of the PILs before the HC had sought suspension or cancellation of the Yatra yet the court “erroneously dismissed the said objection as a mere technicality of law”. The petition further stated that the positivity rates in Chamoli, Rudraprayag and Uttarkashi districts have gone down significantly in the last fortnight and even the HC has allowed normal judicial work to resume in two of them. As reported by TOI, the HC had on June 28 stayed the cabinet decision that allowed locals of Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Uttarkashi districts to visit Char Dham shrines located in their respective districts. The court had concluded that re-opening of the Yatra would be akin to “inviting a calamity” and therefore the stay is in “public interest and in interest of justice”. Citing reasons like emergency of Delta Plus variant, predicted adverse impact of the third wave on children and the repeated failure of the government in ensuring adherence to SOPs, the division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma held that in present circumstances, the cabinet’s decision was not only arbitrary and unreasonable but also violated Article 14, Article 21 and several other provisions of the Constitution. The HC is set to hear the petitions on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-moves-sc-against-hc-stay-on-char-dham-yatra/articleshow/84183959.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Hyderabad||Balanagar flyover opens to public, named after Babu Jagjivan Ram||HYDERABAD: Municipal administration and urban development (MAUD) minister KT Rama Rao, who declared the new Balanagar flyover open here on Tuesday, has named it the Babu Jagjivan Ram Flyover, after the former defence minister and independence activist. The massive six-lane two-way flyover connecting Hyderabad’s Balanagar X Road and Narsapur Y Road was built under the Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP) at a cost of Rs 387 crore. To honour the hard work put in by the workers who took part in construction activities of the flyover, the minister asked Shivamma, a construction worker from Wanaparthy, to formally inaugurate the flyover. “Earlier, this entire area used to be congested due to massive traffic jams. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is developing these projects under SRDP to address such issues. In Kukatpally alone, works worth Rs 1,000 crore are being executed,” the minister said, adding that some projects in the northern part of the city had hit a roadblock as the Union government did not consider certain issues pertaining to land acquisition despite repeated requests. The construction for the Balanagar flyover project began in 2017 and was supposed to be completed in 2020 but was delayed due to land acquisition issues. The delay caused inconvenience to motorists for several months as the stretch was narrowed down for construction. However, the flyover is now expected to ease traffic on one of the busiest stretches starting from Kukatpally Y Junction towards Medchal highway and Rajiv Rahadari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/balanagar-flyover-opens-to-public-named-after-babu-jagjivan-ram/articleshow/84186235.cms||---

On the 36th anniversary of Bhopal gas tragedy, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had announced that pension of Rs 1000 to widows of Bhopal gas disaster would be resumed but it has not happened till now. The old women, some of them in their 80s and 90s, came to meet the CM from Gas Widows' Colony in Karond to apprise him of their pathetic condition in the absence of the monthly pension that they used to get as they are not in a position to work and many of them are destitute with nobody to take care of them. President of Bhopal Gas Peedit Nirashrit Pension Manch, Balkrishna Namdeo, who led the agitation, said that despite announcement of the chief minister on December 3, 2020, to resume the pension and sanction of Rs 5.30 crore for the purpose in the state budget this year, the pension has not been resumed as yet. He said, among 5000 gas disaster widows, 4474 are left now and their numbers are continuously decreasing as all of them are old and infirm and in such a situation, non-fulfillment of chief minister's promise of restarting their pension for more than six months is unfortunate. They couldn't meet the chief minister but his PA, O P Sharma, met their delegation and took the memorandum seeking the chief minister's intervention for resumption of their pension.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/gas-tragedy-widows-stage-dharna-atcms-bungalow-seek-pension-relief/articleshow/84190103.cms||---
---||Vadodara||SOG rural PI’s wife missing since a month, Vadodara SP orders probe||Vadodara: A police inspector is in the dock as his wife has been missing for a month. The Vadodara superintendent of police (rural) has ordered an inquiry in the case after the cops failed to track down 37-year-old Sweety Desai who is wife of special operations group (SOG) rural police inspector, Ajay Desai. The police said that the couple got married in 2015 and were staying in Karjan together. “On June 4 the couple was at home. Desai said that when he woke up on June 5, he couldn’t find Sweety. He searched for her but when he couldn’t find his wife, Desai informed Sweety’s brother Jaydeep Patel who rushed to the city,” said Kalpesh Solanki, deputy superintendent of police (DySP) who is conducting an inquiry in the case. When Patel, a resident of Dakor, too failed to find her, he approached the Karjan police and filed a missing person application on June 6. The cops had taken statements of Desai and Sweety’s family members but they failed to track her down. “After the inquiry was ordered, we have printed posters with Sweety’s photograph and distributed it at temples, crossroads, railway stations and bus stops in Vadodara rural and city,” Desai told TOI. The cops have also inquired at hospitals, hotels and Naari Sanrakshan Gruh to ascertain if she had visited these places. Sweety had left her mobile phone at home so the possibility of tracking her through her phone location is out of the question. The police have also gone through the CCTV footage of June 4 of the locality and even the residential colony where she was staying. Interestingly, Sweety isn’t seen exiting her colony or the area in any of the footage. When asked if they suspect Desai of any foul play, Solanki said, “As of now we don’t have any doubt on him. Even Sweety’s brother said that he doesn’t feel that Desai has any role in his wife’s missing case. We are making all efforts to track her down,” Solanki added. If need be, the cops may approach the court for Desai’s polygraph test.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/sog-rural-pis-wife-missing-since-a-month-sp-orders-probe/articleshow/84184057.cms||---

The civic body rolled out a list of 118 roads in the city that have been declared as commercial stretches from now on. According to the officials, the government did not agree to the suggestion to declare all 100-feet wide roads in the city as commercial stretches keeping in mind traffic density, noise pollution and space crunch. The road from Road Number 45, Jubilee Hills (from HDFC bank) to UMI Group (plot number 860 A), Himmatpura to Moti Galli (Bahadurpura), Madhura Nagar Colony (near Wells Fargo) to Nanakramguda ORR exit, Kothapet (near Omni Hospital) to Nagole X Road and Balanagar (Narsapur X Road to Gandimaisamma) are some among the new commercial stretches. As per the GO, for hospitals and schools that operate in G+I buildings, the impact fee is 2% or Rs 100 per sqft. If the establishment is operating from a building with more than one floor, the fee is 1% or Rs 50 per sqft. For shopping malls and office spaces, the fee is almost the same. Earlier, a lumpsum rate was charged based on the category of the road, however, now the fee will be based on the land value and as per use of the building. The deducted fee applies to the new stretches as well as the existing ones in the GHMC limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/impact-fee-for-shops-on-roads-reduced/articleshow/84186270.cms||---

According to the complainant, her husband, Ashraf, heads Khanqah-e-Ashrafia Hussainia Qutbe, a dargah (shrine) in Bengaluru, Karnataka. She also named her mother-in-law as a co-accused. ADCP, North, Prachi Singh said an FIR under the Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, 2020, and on charges of extortion and dowry harassment has been lodged in this connection. In the FIR, the woman, who hails from Lucknow, claimed that she got married to Ashraf in 2019. Initially, she got a warm welcome at her husband’s house in Bengaluru but soon he started pressuring her to befriend non-Muslim women and bring them home. The woman said she initially followed her husband’s diktats as she was afraid of losing him. “Later, when I got pregnant, Ashraf forced me to undergo sex determintation test. When Ashraf and her mother got to know that the urborn baby was a girl, they thrashed me. They called my brother and demanded Rs 25 lakh for sparing my life. My brother paid Rs 7.5 lakh to them,” she alleged. She claimed that Ashraf and his mother were running a love jihad campaign and added that at Ashraf’s behest, some hardliners of foreign origin tortured her. She also accused them of luring visitors at the shrine to further their love jihad campaign. Terming that the dargah was the hub of illegal money and arms deals, she said: “Ashraf married a Hindu girl in due course of time and renamed her Madiha. She was later shifted to the shrine where she was given training in weaponry.” The complainant claimed that Ashraf and his mother turned her out of their house saying they would allow her to return only if she paid Rs 17.5 lakh to them and brought four non-Muslim girls for religion conversion. “I came back to Lucknow and gave birth to my daughter,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/woman-accuses-her-husband-of-running-love-jihad-campaign/articleshow/84188473.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvanathapuram: Cost of sewerage works under AMRUT shoots up, bleeds corp||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Sewerage works under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme continue to bleed the city corporation with the actual cost going up by sizable figures owing to difficulties in the execution of work. The state government has approved the tender excess of three sub-works in sewerage schemes at rates of 31.5%, 43% and 24.05% and the cost has gone up from Rs 29.94 crore to Rs 32.7 crore. The government gave sanction to tender excess on the condition that half of the excess cost shall be borne by the city corporation. The works include sewer network from Pettah-Arasumoodu Junction to Edathara pumping station, laying sewer network at Edathara and laying transmission main and sewer network at Edathara, collection and conveyance system and another sewer network at Anayara. Kerala water authority, which is implementing the project, had reported that the three works were tendered three times and high quotes were received in the first two tenders. Later the third tender received excessive quotes. The officials attributed the excess amount to more depth involved in excavation, work being done in narrow lanes and transportation of huge quantity of excess earth to distant places. It was also pointed out that laying of sewer pipes by horizontal directional drilling (HDD) might cause damage to nearby structures and manholes have to be constructed in waterlogged areas. Initially administrative sanction (AS) was given for Rs 25 crore and the AS was later revised to Rs 29 crore. Corporation will have to meet 50% of the additional cost from own fund and the state government will fund the remaining amount. The state high-powered steering committee (SHPSC) which discussed the matter observed that high risk was involved in sewerage work and that the state faces an acute shortage of experienced contractors in sewerage and septage sector. The committee approved the tender excess citing that laying of sewer lines is a difficult task and cost of materials shot up due to the pandemic.

---||Bhopal||Bhopal to tread greener path with 300 CNG buses||Bhopal: With 300 CNG buses set to run on its roads by March 2022, state capital is set to get a public transport system which is more eco-friendly. Bhopal city link limited (BCLL), which operates red buses in the state capital has finalised the process of this order. BCLL, which is a wholly-owned Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) subsidiary ,already operates around 500 diesel buses in the state capital. These low-emission, gas-powered buses are expected to be delivered 280-days from the contract coming into effect, said an official. It would not only be the BCLL which is switching to CNG, civic body with a fleet of around 2000 vehicles is also planning to make the conversion. BMC and BCLL would jointly operate the CNG gas stations. Initially, low load carrying vehicles of the BMC would run on CNG, official said. BCLL will purchase midibuses, which will run on CNG. According to experts, compressed natural gas (CNG) to a large extent addresses the issue of poor air quality. . Given the rising cost of diesel and petrol, BCLL has factored a better revenue generation model by operating standard buses proportionately to its low-floor buses. “Mitigating to CNG with an additional benefit to urban air pollution along with its environmental and health benefits cannot be ignored. Lowering emissions in public transport can be achieved. With Bhopal metro on the horizon, last mile connectivity is set to get better,” said an urban transport official, seeking anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-to-tread-greener-path-with-300-cng-buses/articleshow/84190112.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Goregaon firm owner booked on charge of duping woman of Rs19 lakh||Pune: The proprietor of a private firm in Goregaon was booked on Monday on the charge of duping a woman (30) from Mundhwa of Rs19.48 lakh since May 17 on the pretext of supplying her 20 oxygen concentrators meant for Covid-19 patients. The woman (name withheld), into the business of selling beauty and herbal products, and equipment for treating Covid patients to private hospitals in the city, stated in her FIR that she wanted to purchase 20 oxygen concentrators and had contacted the suspect over the phone on May 17. The suspect told her that she would get a warranty of three years on the machines priced at Rs89,000 each, but would have to pay the Goods and Service Tax (GST). The woman signed an online sale and purchase agreement with the suspect on May 21, filled up the vendor registration form, received invoices of the machines and placed an order for 20 machines. The FIR stated that the woman transferred Rs19,48,080 to his bank account via net banking between May 24 and 31. But she did not get the machines within three or five days, as per the agreement. The woman’s complaint read, “After I pursued the matter with the suspect, he told me that he had transferred the money to his contact in Indonesia and was awaiting delivery of the machines. He later returned Rs50,000 but failed to deliver the machines. Nor did he refund the remaining sum.” The woman said she realised that she was duped after she came to know that the GST number provided by the suspect was not registered in his or his firm’s name. She told TOI, “I filed two complaint applications with the Mundhwa police and the cybercrime police on June 3 and 4. I met my business partner for the first time when the police summoned him for questioning. He told me that he had transferred some money to a bank account for receiving the machines and had used a part of the amount to meet his personal expenses.” Sub-inspector Ashwini Bhosale of the Mundhwa police said, “We conducted a preliminary inquiry into the woman’s complaint application and registered an FIR related to criminal breach of trust and cheating under sections 406 and 420 of the IPC. We have not arrested the suspect.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-goregaon-firm-owner-booked-on-charge-of-duping-woman-of-rs19-lakh/articleshow/84186285.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Delhi||Teachers fret over CBSE order on 2-term boards||NEW DELHI: Teachers and other stakeholders have expressed concern at the decision of Central Board of Secondary Education to hold the 2021-22 board exams in two parts. The main concern includes the short duration of the second year with many stressing that the announcement of syllabus rationalisation should not be delayed any further. The two terms of the CBSE exams would be held in November-December and March-April. The academic session is to be divided into two equal terms. The syllabus for the board examination would be rationalised. There would also be three periodic tests, student enrichment, portfolio and practical work or speaking listening activities or project. Rajpal Singh, principal of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, Yamuna Vihar, said, “This session cannot be planned in mid-session. It should have been earlier and well in time. It is already July and we are clueless about what syllabus is to be followed. Moreover, the duration of the second term is very less.” Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said that most people were highlighting the syllabus aspect. “They are asking if a chapter that is not a part of the first term has been started, then what do they do. But I feel we have an idea of how teaching must be done, so it should not be much of a problem. With the board predicting different situations, we have already told the children that their internals are up to date. Students have been raising questions about the MCQ. Though it is a comprehensive document, they will have to be trained in using OMR and other things,” added Joshi. Keshav Agarwal, president of Educators Society, an association of around 300 coaching centres, highlighted that with several unit tests and other assessments, children would be under pressure. “The gap between the first and second term is too little. It will put pressure on both students and teachers. The second term is for a subjective paper and preparation time is less. Also, JEE main exams are held in January. By that time, only 50% of the syllabus would have been completed,” he added. However, Sindhura Narayana, MD of The Narayana Group, welcomed the proactive release of the special assessment and called it a good scheme. “The only point of concern is the authenticity of exam results in the case of students attempting both term exams from home. Some form of proctoring will have to be envisaged to ensure that no malpractice occurs,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/teachers-fret-over-cbse-order-on-2-term-boards/articleshow/84186425.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Mukhtar Ansari swindled funds, under ED lens||LUCKNOW: The Enforcement Directorate, which is investigating a case against jailed gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari regarding income of crores of rupees through rent from illegally occupied government land, will also look into the siphoning of Rs 25 lakh under the MLA Local Area Development (MLA LAD) Fund. The money was meant for the construction of a school in Mukhtar’s assembly constituency Mau but no work was carried out at the site. After the matter came to light, the Mau police registered a case against Mukhtar at Sarai Lakhansi police station on April 26. The Enforcement Directorate on Tuesday contacted the Mau administration to seek details of the case. During investigation, it surfaced that total amount of Rs 25 lakh was misappropriated from MLA LAD funds in 2006-07 and again in 2017-18. Mukhtar released Rs 25 lakh to Anand Yadav and Baijnath Yadav of Sakin Sarva village for the construction of a school on gram sabha land that was illegally transferred in Baijnath’s name. However, not a single brick was laid on the site. Sources in the ED said the agency would seek records of the land deal and also identify other beneficiaries involved in the transfer of land. An officer privy to the probe said the case would be clubbed with money laundering case registered by ED in July. The official said during investigation of the previous case against Mukhtar, it was found that he occupied a government land in a Mau village and earned around Rs 12 crore by fraudulently giving away the land to a private company on a rent of Rs 1.7 crore per year. He collected the rent for seven years. ED is also scrutinising 49 FIRs lodged against Mukhtar in different police stations of the state and will also look into the cases where charge sheets have been filed .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mukhtar-swindled-funds-under-ed-lens/articleshow/84188502.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Under-construction station, narrow road but train in place||PUNE: The Hadapsar Railway Station is not ready yet, even the road connecting it is narrow and damaged, but despite the constraints a tri-weekly special train to Hyderabad will commence services from here on July 9. The 700-metre road connecting the station from Mundhwa bypass has a width of 10 feet in most parts — too narrow for two vehicles to pass side by side. Though traffic is likely to increase once the train services start, railway officials are not worried. They said that a team of Railway Protection Force (RPF) has been deployed to take care of traffic management. “The road belongs to the railways. But with the train set to start suddenly, our focus has now shifted to ensuring that passenger amenities are in place. Since Hadapsar station is to be developed into a satellite terminal by March 2024, road development is part of our long-term plan,” Manoj Jhawar, public relations officer, Pune rail division, told TOI. The special train will reach Hadapsar from Hyderabad on July 8. The train will leave Hadapsar every Tuesday, Friday and Sunday at 3:30pm from July 9. The train will leave Hyderabad at 20:35hours on Monday, Tuesday and Saturday. “The train is operated by the South Central Railway, and the decision to run it has come from the railway board. We are bound to execute it though it has come as a surprise for us. The Hadapsar station has three platforms and work related to basic infrastructure is going at a rapid pace. We will be able to provide basic amenities to passengers once the services start,” another rail official said. Local residents, however, said that the narrow road would pose a major problem. “No public transport is available from the railway station at present. Once the train starts, autorickshaws and private vehicles will come for picking and dropping passengers. However, the road is so narrow in most parts that two vehicles cannot pass side by side. Moreover, in many parts, the road is damaged, and waterlogging is a major problem. We can only imagine the nightmare passengers will suffer. The railways should have focused first on developing the road,” a local shopkeeper said. Another railway official said that passengers can walk up to the Mundhwa bypass to get public transport. Railway sources said that there was a proposal to start a train from/to Hadapsar last year, too, but the Pune railway division had made it clear that the station was not in a position to start passenger trains. “Nothing at the station was ready. Now, at least we have three platforms and one of them can accommodate a 24-coach train,” the official said. Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd (PMLML) officials said that the narrow road was a matter of concern. “We have visited the spot. Some midi-buses can be started, but the narrow and uneven road is a matter of concern. Different agencies, including the traffic police, are working on a solution,” Dattatray Zende, traffic manager, PMPML, said. Harsha Shah, chairperson, Railway Pravasi Group, said, “Every time you ask the railway officials, they just claim that work is going on and is expected to be completed soon. This has been going on for the past 10 years now. They must discuss and bring the train to Pune station to reduce the hardship faced by passengers.” Another railway official found solace in the fact that booking for the train was very less. “The bookings are just around 9%. So, there are not going to be many passengers at present,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/under-construction-station-narrow-road-but-train-in-place/articleshow/84186363.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: Classes in school bus to beat network issues||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As students complained about missing classes due to poor connectivity, the teachers of Bharathannoor Government Higher Secondary School are now teaching the wards in a school bus. Anil C V, headmaster of the school, is the brain behind the initiative. School authorities noted that there was a steady decline in the number of students attending online classes owing to network issues. “I kept track of the number of students attending online classes and I noted that many stay away due to poor internet connectivity. Last year too, our students faced the same issue and many couldn’t attend classes. This time I wanted all our students to have access to the classes. When I had the idea of turning the school bus into a classroom, I communicated it with officials who granted immediate permission to execute the plan,” said Anil. The school bus which was kept off road for the last one-and-half years was turned into a classroom by setting up a whiteboard, and LCD projector inside it. School officials decided to park the bus at a public place in Pandiyanpara and Ramarassery, from where the students complain of network connectivity. Though it is a 22-seater bus, only ten students will be permitted at a time, to adhere to Covid protocols. They would also conduct classes in nearby open spaces. School officials have ensured that the teachers and the bus driver are vaccinated. Also, they strictly follow the Covid protocols, including wearing masks and social distancing. “Initially, our teachers were concerned about providing direct classes. But after taking the first class, they seemed to be totally fine with the new system,” said Anil. The first such class in the bus was held on Friday. Eighteen students from Classes VI and VII attended. The seating arrangement ensured that only one student sat on a seat and the bus was sanitized after the class. Parents and students cooperated with the school’s new initiative of a mobile classroom. “The students were excited to see us after a long time. They normally go to one of the 12 study centres of the school to watch classes being telecast on Victers channel. Direct classes benefit them a lot. Even those students, generally not interested in studying, seemed to be happy to attend this class,” said Asa V S, an English teacher of the school. The classes will be held from 10am to 1pm on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The teachers hope to cover the maximum portion within this time. The school plans to give priority to students of Classes IX and X.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/classes-in-school-bus-to-beat-network-issues/articleshow/84186354.cms||---
---||Bhopal||BJP abuzz over Jyotiraditya Scindia Union cabinet berth||BHOPAL: The appointment of Thawar Chand Gehlot, the Union minister for social justice and empowerment, as governor of Karnataka and Jyotiraditya Scindia cutting short his Malwa trip and rushing to New Delhi on Tuesday, almost made it clear that Scindia would get a ministerial berth in the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Union cabinet. Apart from Scindia, names of other senior leaders were also doing the rounds for the Modi cabinet, the expansion of which is likely on Wednesday. Currently, there are 53 ministers in the Modi cabinet. Five among them are from Madhya Pradesh, including Narendra Singh Tomar, Prahlad Singh Patel, Faggan Singh Kulaste, Dharmendra Pradhan and Thawar Chandra Gehlot. If Scindia replaces Gehlot as a minister from MP, there would be two ministers from Gwalior and Chambal region in the Modi cabinet, Tomar and Scindia. Tomar, the Union cabinet minister for agriculture and farmers welfare, is member of parliament from Morena Lok Sabha constituency, while Scindia who is a BJP Rajya Sabha member from MP, also has a strong hold in the entire region. There would be no representation of Malwa region in the Modi cabinet after Gehlot. Prahlad Singh Patel, minister of state for culture and tourism, is MP from Damoh constituency of Bundelkhand region, while Faggan Singh Kulaste, minister of state in the ministry of steel, is MP from Mandla Lok S abha constituency, which comes in Mahakoshal region of the state. Union minister for petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan is the member of Rajya Sabha from MP. Baghelkhand and Nimar region of the state also have no representation in the Union cabinet. The Union cabinet can have 81 members and currently there are 53 ministers. As many as 28 more ministers can be accommodated. BJP workers and Scindia supporters were overwhelmed when the Rajya Sabha MP left for New Delhi on Tuesday. Speculations were also made on the portfolio he would get.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bjp-abuzz-over-scindia-union-cabinet-berth/articleshow/84190122.cms||Ankur Sirothia

This is the fourth consecutive year that the school students have recreated Basheer’s characters. Interestingly, this is not just a simple recreation rather, all his characters have been adapted to the contemporary scenario. Due to the pandemic, this year, teachers visited the house of students to prepare them for the programme. Every year as part of the activities of Vidyarangam Kala Sahithya Vedi, a club aiming at fostering the innate literary and artistic pursuits of the students, the teachers ensure that the veteran writer’s death anniversary is observed. This time, Beypore Sultan’s short novel ‘Ntuppuppakkoranendarnnu’ was adapted to suit the theme, freedom for women. The script for the video adaptation, ‘Velichathinu Enthoru Velicham’ was prepared by Vidyarangam Kala Sahithya Vedi teacher in charge, MC Abhilash. “The rising atrocities against women in our state prompted me to choose a theme dealing with women’s freedom. I am extremely glad that students and parents were able to grasp the significance of the theme in the contemporary society,” said Abhilash. With such adaptations, the students are acquainted with almost all characters of Basheer, who presented loftier thoughts in a simple language. Using WhatsApp, teachers narrated Basheer’s stories to students so that they would know the minute details of the character that they would portray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/basheers-characters-come-alive-on-his-death-anniv/articleshow/84186320.cms||---

Ramaraj, who conducted a consultative meeting with officials from Madurai district on Tuesday following the recent child trafficking incident involving an illegal home run by Idhayam Trust, said that a high-level committee has to be formed in the district to supervise the formation and functioning of such child protection committees. He also said that Madurai will be turned into a model district when it comes to protection of child rights. “There is a government order on behalf of the social welfare department which mandates formation of a child protection committee at six levels including village level, block level, town panchayat level and corporation level. The committee will keep an eye on the functioning of children homes and report to the authorities concerned if there is an illegal home,” he said. “Presidents and secretaries of committees should be trained to identify violations of children rights and report to the concerned authorities,” Ramaraj added. He suggested that legal recognition be given to the committees for effective functioning. Since the child protection subject is in concurrent list, the state government can bring in an amendment to be included in the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection Act) to determine powers, duties and responsibilities. Madurai district collector Aneesh Sekhar said that all steps will be taken to make Madurai a safe place for children. A high-level committee will be formed to ensure the rights of children are not violated. The committee will have members of the TNCPCR, commissioner of Madurai Corporation, district collector, regional director of municipal administration, project director of district rural development agency, deputy commissioner of town panchayats and district revenue officer as members. More than 500 people from various levels of the committee will be trained. Camps will be conducted regularly for the presidents and secretaries of the committees periodically, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/child-protection-panels-need-to-be-strengthened-says-tncpcr-member/articleshow/84184079.cms||---

Talking to reporters at Calangute, Sequeira said Congress in Calangute have decided to come together to defeat minister for ports Michael Lobo. “We're three Congress leaders in Calangute, former MLA Agnelo Fernandes, Lawrence Silveira (Congress candidate in the last zilla parishad election) and myself,” he said. “Whoever gets the ticket, we will all support that candidate. If I don't get the ticket and Agnelo or Lawrence gets the Congress ticket, then I will support him and send Michael Lobo home. He is finished,” he said, adding he will not contest on any other party ticket or as an independent if he does not get the Congress ticket. To a query, he said if the political situation changes and Michael Lobo contests as the Congress candidate, then none of the three leaders would support the Congress candidate. “There is no question of Congress voters supporting Michael Lobo if he is given the Congress ticket, " Sequeira said. In the past, Sequeira had been instrumental in getting Lobo elected as the BJP candidate in the 2012 assembly election and ensuring the defeat of then Congress MLA Agnelo Fernandes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/congress-will-unite-to-defeat-lobo-in-calangute-ex-sarpanch/articleshow/84186337.cms||---

Arjun, a panchayat secretary and former private secretary to the deputy chief minister, on Monday submitted his resignation and declared that he will contest the assembly elections in Quepem. Pereira was a councillor in Quepem municipal council during the last term and held the chairperson’s post on numerous occasions. He had contested the assembly elections on the Congress ticket in 1997, but lost by a narrow margin of around 600 votes to Prakash Velip. Arjun is currently holding charge as secretary in Benaulim panchayat. He was Kavlekar’s private assistant during the latter’s first tenure as MLA in 2002, but later quit to join the government job. “When Kavlekar became deputy chief minister after defecting from the Congress, I was given charge as private secretary to Kavlekar. However, I parted ways with him due to difference in opinion,” Arjun said. Arjun submitted his resignation to the block development officer, Salcete on Monday. Velip told TOI that he has submitted his resignation to contest the upcoming election against Kavlekar, but declined to divulge details on which party he plans to contest . “Many parties have approached me, but I will take a decision only after the government accepts my resignation,” he said. Arjun’s close aid, Rupesh Velip said that Arjun will stake claim for the Congress ticket as he had held many posts in Congress as block president and Seva Dal president from 1999 till 2006. “When Kavlekar first won the zilla elections on the Congress ticket, Arjun had also filed his nomination along with Kavlekar, but later withdrew his candidature in support of Kavlekar. Arjun’s father, Sonu Velip, was a founder member of the Congress,” Rupesh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/two-of-kavlekars-staunch-aides-to-mount-bid-for-quepem-seat/articleshow/84186316.cms||---

NIA stated that Sharma shared strategic and sensitive information, including troop deployment, locations, strength and composition of battalions with Pakistani spy agency, ISI, and received money from co-accused Anas Giteli of Gujarat. The duo has been charged under Official Secrets Act and Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. On January 8, Sharma and Gileti were arrested in simultaneous raids by Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad at their homes in Hapur and Godhra. NIA took over the probe on February 5 and Sharma took voluntary retirement on medical grounds in June last year. Sharma was in touch with a woman intelligence operative in Pakistan, who operated under a pseudo name of ‘Neha Sharma’ since 2016. While the soldier passed classified information to ISI on Whatsapp, Giteli would transfer money to his account, said an official privy to probe. NIA in its chargesheet claimed ISI hatched a conspiracy to obtain restricted and confidential information by luring Armymen through the woman operative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/espionage-nia-chargesheet-against-soldier-godhra-resident/articleshow/84188560.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

The tank was inspected by Madurai district collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar on Tuesday. The tank on the foothills of the Thiruparankundram temple holds water throughout the year as water draining from the hills also flows into it. As people use it for bathing and washing, the contamination was high and the biological oxygen demand was high, resulting in fish dying frequently, sources said. Last year, the HR and CE explored ways to clean the tank and maintain it and advisor and nuclear scientist Dr J Daniel Chellappa, had suggested the nano-aeration technology. The Madurai Corporation was brought in and now a dhobi khana has been constructed near the tank to prevent contaminated water from flowing into the tank. Chellappa said that he had sought for a report on the water quality earlier last year and it was found that the E-coli levels were near the permissible level and hence aeration could work. Now, a place has been established for setting up the electric unit to provide power for the aeration technology and the work would commence soon, sources said. Once implemented, the tank could provide clean water that the devotees can use for performing rituals and even fish could be reared in it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/dpr-prepared-for-aeration-of-saravana-poigai-tank/articleshow/84184125.cms||---

The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. Braganza, a former member of the Calangute panchayat, has alleged that the shop along with a stall outside selling masalas and vegetables located in the Calangute market was burnt down in retaliation for her speaking out against members of the panchayat. On Monday, CCF members, including Braganza, had lodged a complaint against a member of the Calangute panchayat for allegedly threatening and abusing Sapnesh Vaigankar, a forum member, on Saturday. “We’re social activists taking up a lot of issues concerning villagers. On Monday afternoon, we went to the police station to lodge a complaint against a panchayat member for abusing one of our members. At 8.50pm, I got a call that my shop was on fire,” Braganza said. “When the workers shut the shop, they had switched off the mains, so a short circuit could not have caused the fire. If there was a short circuit, the shop next to mine would have also got burnt. This has happened due to enmity. I have complained to the police and have asked them to get me justice,” Braganza said. She estimated the loss to be Rs 4 lakh. Meanwhile, former Calangute sarpanch Joseph Sequeira, condemned what he termed as the use of muscle power by panchayat members against activists who are critical of their functioning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/calangute-citizens-group-cries-foul-as-members-shop-gutted/articleshow/84186367.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Vikhroli man goes home after 85 days in hospital for Covid||MUMBAI: A Vikhroli man returned home on Monday after spending 85 days in a hospital battling Covid-19. As his ambulance exited the gates of Powai's L H Hiranandani Hospital, the family of 54-year-old Bharat Panchal admitted it was a day they weren’t sure would arrive. Panchal, who owns and manages a chemist shop in Vikhroli, came down with a fever on April 8, around two weeks after taking one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The odds were stacked against him right from the start, said his physician brother Dr Harish Panchal, as Bharat developed lung complications in a span of four days. He went from high-flow nasal cannula oxygen requirement to non-invasive ventilation and ultimately to mechanical ventilation, all in a week’s time. His CT severity score reached 21 out of 25 at an alarming speed. Bharat stayed on ventilator for more than 70 days, during which time he battled acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, sepsis, multiorgan failure, lung rupture and even fought off a mucormycosis scare. “He suffered every complication that a patient could possibly have. This case has once again taught us that critical Covid care is not a 100-metre race. It’s a long haul where doctors and families must have faith and patience,” said Dr Arpita Dwivedy, chief intensivist at Hiranandani. This was the longest hospitalization they have recorded in 15 months, she added. From plasma, remdesivir and tocilizumab to a range of antibacterial and antifungal medicines, almost everything in the armoury was used, doctors said. As Bharat battled the disease physically, his family went through an equally daunting emotional fight, said Dr Panchal. “Bed number 5 in the ICU had become a second home,” he said. There came a point when Bharat had developed ICU psychosis and stopped communicating with his wife, son and daughters entirely, the brother said. Since he was moved to the non-Covid ICU by then, though, the family could meet him every day. “Those meetings made a lot of difference,” said Dr Panchal, who added that motivation from Dr Dwivedy and her colleagues, Dr Sajith Babu and Dr Maheema Bhaskar, kept the family’s hopes alive. Bharat’s roller-coaster recovery saw one last critical moment when his lungs started bleeding about a fortnight ago. “We thought that was it and we would lose him. But the doctors managed to salvage him by repairing the bleeding in a tracheostomy,” said the brother. Rajesh went home with minimal oxygen support. The family has spent more than Rs 40 lakh. Once the insurance was exhausted, they were charged according to the government’s capped rates, Panchal said. The city’s public hospitals, too, have encountered cases where patients have taken unusually long to recover from the complications of Covid. KEM Hospital dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh said they had eight patients who were hospitalized in the range of 89 days to 150 days. A 73-year-old Worli resident was the most recent to be discharged after 112 days of hospitalization. “Complications of the lungs and involvement of other organs make recovery a lengthy and complicated affair in some of them,” said Dr Deshmukh. At B Y L Nair, one of the doctors said that they have had hospitalizations for up to 60 days. In SevenHills Hospital, up to 15% patients have required hospitalization of over 30 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vikhroli-man-goes-home-after-85-days-in-hospital-for-covid/articleshow/84186564.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Zookeepers to work under direct supervision||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The zoo authorities gave instructions to zookeepers in charge of snake enclosures to always work in the presence of a supervisor in the wake of the recent death of Harshad from a snakebite. In a meeting held here on Monday, the authorities directed the keepers that if any of them work alone in an enclosure beyond the stipulated time schedule, they should promptly inform their immediate supervisor. Harshad, who lay unconscious on the enclosure's floor before he died, was spotted by another zookeeper who was returning after work in the nearby bear enclosure. “The zookeepers go on lunch break from noon to 2pm. Many of them would be around the office for the break during this time. However, some keepers stay back due to work and, this results in a situation where they are exposed alone to dangers in animal enclosures. We don’t want any such incidents to recur in the zoo hence, we have asked all of them to keep the supervisors informed if they stay back for work so that there would be a system to monitor their safety,” said a zoo official. According to the authorities, the back cage was kept out of surveillance since the zookeeper's cabin is also located there. The keepers have been advised not to put their hands inside the back cage from that area. The master plan of the zoo includes a section on disaster management which covers steps to be taken in case of natural disasters, fire, civil disturbances. Contingency plans have also been prepared for animal escape, rescued animals, monkey menace, power failure, disease outbreaks, animal infighting and snakebites. As per the plan, to manage emergencies like snake bites, 15 to 20 vials of polyvalent antivenin are kept at the zoo hospital at all times. Besides, there are many reputed hospitals nearby that are in a position to manage such medical emergencies, the plan says. However, both these couldn’t be of help in Harshad's case. “We have polyvalent snake venom at our hospital and ensured availability of any number of vials at District Veterinary Centre, which is close by and nearby medical stores in case we need more but, this is not effective for King Cobra,” the officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/zookeepers-to-work-under-direct-supervision/articleshow/84186372.cms||---

He also targeted the BJP-led Madhya Pradesh government over the brutal murder of five members of a tribal family in Nemawar. Expressing his concerns over fuel price hike and inflation, the former chief minister said that prices of grains, food products, edible oils are increasing continuously. “The price of cooking gas has increased by Rs350 in the last seven months”, he said. “In these hard times, the Modi government has increased the Central excise tax on petrol and diesel by Rs35 which was only Rs9.50 on petrol and Rs3.50 on diesel in 2014” Digvijaya said, further claiming that people will get a relief of at least Rs25 to Rs30/litre on rate of petrol and diesel, if the Central government applies the same tax slab, which was at the time of the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government”, the senior Congressman said, Digvijaya claimed that the BJP government has generated over Rs4.5 lakh crore by increasing taxes on petrol and diesel. “Tax recovery from the common man has been increased while tax collection from big industrialists has decreased,” he said. He also said that an investigation has been launched in France on the Rafale deal. Digvijaya also targeted the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led state government on increasing crime incidents against women. Commenting over the Nemawar case, he said that it hould be heard by a fast-track court and death sentence should be announced against the accused. He also targeted the government over illegal mining and claimed that a minister from Indore stopped officials from acting against illegal mining at IIT, Indore .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/diggy-attacks-centre-for-rise-in-fuel-prices/articleshow/84190127.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: With existing facilities exhausted, a bid to set up third biomed plant||NEW DELHI: Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has begun the process to set up a third common biomedical waste treatment facility (CBWTF) in Delhi and selected two bids of the possible six companies that had submitted an expression of interest (EOI). DPCC officials said, once the next stage of receiving a financial structure in the form of a Request for Proposal (RPF) was complete, work on the next plant could commence within 15 days of allotment. The capital currently has two CBWTFs with a combined capacity of processing 63 tonnes of biomedical waste each day. While the facility in west Delhi’s Nilothi can process up to 29 tonnes of biomedical waste each day, the slightly larger unit at GT Karnal Road can handle 34 tonnes. However, with Delhi’s total generation jumping up by 15 times, both the units saw an increase in the quantum of biomedical waste being handled during the pandemic. While in May 2020, the city was averaging 25 tonnes of biomedical waste each day, it reached 372 tonnes in June and 349 tonnes in July, a report submitted by now-dissolved Supreme Court body Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority had informed. It had also noted that biomedical waste was not being segregated properly and often ended up with mixed waste and reached the landfill sites. The load currently, however, has reduced but DPCC estimates that two more CBWTFs would be required in the city by 2031. “The pandemic has shown us how better preparedness is required to manage biomedical waste. While initial plans already looked at two more units, we are speeding up the process to manage such waste better,” said a DPCC official, adding that of the two companies chosen — SMS ltd and Medical Pollution Control Committee — in the EOI process, one would be based on its RPF submission. The official said the locations for the plants were yet to be finalised and added that they were expected to cover the whole of Delhi, ensuring biomedical waste in south or east Delhi did not have to travel far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/with-existing-facilities-exhausted-a-bid-to-set-up-third-biomed-plant/articleshow/84188553.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Dr Vyas said the government wanted to push the vaccination programme further and conduct 10-12 lakh vaccinations in a day to complete inoculation of the targeted group by the end of August. The state has been allocated 1.15 crore vaccine doses for July. In his letter to the Union health secretary, Vyas wrote, “We are reporting approximately 10,000 new cases daily for the last three weeks despite trying to follow all the instructions of containment, isolation, testing and tracking. As a result, the state has the highest number of active cases in the country though the positivity rate in almost all districts has come down below 5%.” The state assured that it would administer these doses in the shortest possible time with minimal wastage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-health-secy-seeks-1-5cr-more-vax-doses-from-centre-in-july/articleshow/84186577.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Chandigarh||‘303 FIRs filed for illegal mining in 3 months, 290 held’||Chandigarh: Cracking a whip on illegal mining activities in Punjab, the state enforcement agencies have registered a total 303 FIRs against 439 persons in the last over three months under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. As many as 290 persons have been arrested between April 1 and July 7 and 411 vehicles, including earth movers, trucks and trolleys, have been confiscated across the state. The highest number of 38 FIRs during this period was registered in the Mohali district, followed by Ferozepur (30) and area under Ludhiana police commissionerate (27). Other areas with FIRs in double digits include Jalandhar Rural (26), Amritsar Rural and Nawanshahr (24 each), Hoshiarpur (22), Fazilka (20) and Ropar (18). ADGP R N Dhoke, who took over as first head of the newly-constituted enforcement directorate of mining on April 1, said: “Things are absolutely under control. We have issued directions to the commissioners of police and SSPs to crackdown on illegal mining activities in their jurisdiction.” Much has been done on the enforcement part, he added. Every vehicle carrying mining material has to carry the mandatory bar coded weighment slips. These vehicles are provided such slips at the mining sites where weighing bridges have been installed and proper computerised records are being maintained. The state mining department has a target of collecting Rs 321 crore as revenue this year. Whereas the department could collect nearly Rs 263 crore against its annual target of around Rs 300 crore last year, because of some legal issues pertaining to the mining sites in Ferozepur and Mohali districts. Though the matter concerning mining sites in Ferozepur has been sorted out, the department is hopeful that dispute about the Mohali mining sites would be addressed soon. Action against Congress MLA son Asked about the allegations of illegal mining still continuing in the state, a senior official of the mining department said they were trying its best and had even taken action against the son of Congress MLA from Baghapurana Darshan Singh Brar. His son Gurjant Singh Brar’s company Brar Stone in Mukerian was in November last year issued a demand notice to pay nearly Rs 1.56 crore as royalty to the state government for illegal mining. Generally, those who remain unsuccessful in mining auctions try to indulge in illegal activities, he added. The Punjab government had e-auctioned seven mining clusters between July and September, 2019, with the revenue target of Rs 306.69 crore. As per the bid conditions, there would be 7% annual increase in the mining revenue every year for the next two years. These seven clusters have 196 identified mines with the targeted excavation of 3.5 crore metric tonnes of sand and gravel. The clusters include Pathankot, Ropar, Mohali, Nawanshahr-Ludhiana-Jalandhar, Ferozepur-Moga-Faridkot, Amritsar-Tarn Taran-Kapurthala, and Hoshiarpur-Gurdaspur. The Punjab government has also developed an application for efficient monitoring of complaints pertaining to mining activities. One can download the app “PunjabMines” and lodge a complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/303-firs-filed-for-illegal-mining-in-3-months-290-held/articleshow/84188574.cms||Sanjeev Verma

Coming down heavily on KCR, Sanjay said the ongoing tussle over sharing of Krishna river water between Telangana and AP was only a drama. “I wrote letters to the Centre on Krishna water sharing. A few days ago, I was in touch with Union water resources minister on the issue, but we do not seek publicity unlike the TRS,” he said at a press conference. He also alleged that though the Union minister returned the CM’s calls, the latter had campaigned that the Union minister had not called him. “The TRS government is meting out injustice to southern Telangana. Whoever is doing injustice to Telangana should not be spared. If my allegations are false, I will jump into Srisailam. But, if the charges are true, the CM should tender an apology,” he said. Claiming that he does not want to live for 100 yeas, Sanjau offered to transfer a few years of his lifespan to the CM. “People should realise that the CM had conspired with Jagan Mohan Reddy and earlier with Chandrababu Naidu.

---||Chennai||Centre said no nod for Mekedatu dam without asking Tamil Nadu, says minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat||CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu water resources minister S Duraimurugan on Tuesday said the Union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat had promised him that the Centre would not give nod to Karnataka’s Mekedatu project without asking Tamil Nadu. Duraimurugan, who met Shekhawat in New Delhi on Tuesday along with a delegation of state officials, said the Union minister had also promised to set up a tribunal to resolve TN’s Pennaiyar interstate river water dispute with Karnataka which has built a dam across Markandeya river, a tributary of Pennaiyar. Tamil Nadu had complained to the Centre that it allowed Karnataka to prepare a detailed project report for Mekedatu dam without the consent of the lower riparian state, Tamil Nadu, which is mandatory as per Supreme Court and Cauvery tribunal orders. We said this is not a proper approach. The Union minister said that a detailed project report is nothing and we should not worry about it. He said the Centre won’t do and can’t do anything (giving approval to the dam) without asking us,” Duraimurugan told reporters in Delhi. Shekhawat is said to have told the delegation that the dam would not be built just because the Karnataka government got the sanction to prepare a DPR. He even pointed out that sanction was accorded to the National Water Development Agency to prepare a DPR to interlink Cauvery and Godavari, but the project was yet to materialise. On the dam built across Markandeya river by Karnataka, Tamil Nadu told Shekhawat that the construction was arbitrary since there was no approval granted by the lower riparian state. “Tamil Nadu moved the Supreme Court (in 2018) and got an order directing the Centre to set up a tribunal to resolve the dispute. I told the Union minister that we have been repeatedly asking for a tribunal. If it cannot resolve the dispute, the Centre could constitute a tribunal. Shekhawat assured that he would order setting up a tribunal,” Duraimurugan said. Thestate also urged the Centre to tell Karnataka to stop all work in the Pennaiyar basin. Tamil Nadu also complained about proper release of Cauvery water from Karnataka and urged the Centre to advice Karnataka to release Tamil Nadu’s due share. There was a deficit supply of 5tmcft until Monday for the current water year. Duraimurugan said the Union minister assured him that a full-time chairman would be appointed for the Cauvery water management authority immediately. On strengthening baby dam of Mullaperiyar dam, the state government urged the jal shakti minister to advice Kerala government to immediately give permission to cut 23 trees and repair the ghat road for which Tamil Nadu was willing to bear the cost. Or Kerala could give its consent to Tamil Nadu to carry out the repair. “When Shekhawat pointed to the Dam Safety Bill, I said they (Kerala) don’t allow us to enter the premises even though the control of the dam is vested with us,” said Duraimurugan and added that for the same reason, Tamil Nadu was opposing the bill. With regard to the Godavari-Cauvery linking project, the state requested the Centre to build consensus among the states concerned and finalise the DPR incorporating the request of Tamil Nadu without further delay. Duraimurugan said the state requested Centre’s financial support to execute the Cauvery-Gundar interlinking project in TN since the state was implementing a portion of a national scheme. The Union minister assured to consider the state’s demand, said Duraimurugan. The state also requested funding for Tamirabarani-Karumeniyar-Nambiyar interlinking project for an eligible central share of Rs 487 crore. “The Union minister patiently listened to our demands, which he said were just. He is thorough in our subjects. I am happy about the discussion with the Union minister since he accepted everything,” Duraimurugan said. The state requested the Centre to release the pending dues of Rs 44.48 crore towards central share for repair, renovation and restoration of water bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/centre-said-no-nod-for-mekedatu-dam-without-asking-tn-minister/articleshow/84186410.cms||---

With 54 state and national medals to her kitty in the last four years in various events, Esther who comes from a fisherman family in Nagapattinam, is all set to join the state police as a sub-inspector with the dream of winning an Olympic medal. Unlike many shooters who pick up the game from an early age, Cathrine touched a rifle for the first time as an air-wing NCC cadet during her undergraduation in Holy Cross College, Trichy. As she went on to bag the silver medal in the state-level 0.22 rifle shooting, she realised that she is here for a longer innings. There was no looking back after that, as she started participating in the state and national level shooting championships. Cathrine is a renowned shot holder for the last four consecutive years. This gives her the privilege of owning a licensed rifle and import cartridges. Seeing her performance, Royal Pudukottai Sports Club sponsored her rifle for her training. “I appeared for the SI test and was selected in the interview. Sports background came as an advantage for me to better my prospects. The exposure in NCC made me confident to face the interview without fear. It has shaped my behaviour and career,” says Cathrine. Wing commander C Gunasekaran, commanding officer, 3 TN Air Squadron, NCC, said that Cathrine has become a role model for her juniors in NCC. The very purpose of NCC is to make students identify their interests and help them chase their dreams apart from being a responsible citizen, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/chasing-olympic-dream-former-shooting-champ-set-to-join-state-police/articleshow/84184197.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Delhi||On NGT’s prod, parks in Delhi to get piped treated water supply||NEW DELHI: In the wake of National Green Tribunal ordering that only treated water should be used for horticulture purpose in Delhi, the authorities concerned are planning to provide piped network of treated water to each park. At a recent meeting chaired by chief secretary, Delhi Jal Board has been directed to carry out a survey and prepare a detailed project report for the complete scheme. Delhi has over 17,000 parks. “Chief secretary directed that a long-term perspective plan should be prepared for the optimum use of treated effluent. It must include maximum utilisation of treated water for horticulture purpose, including the coverage of all parks and gardens , to replace the extraction of precious groundwater through borewells for this purpose. DJB will carry out survey, preparation of DPR and cost estimates of the complete scheme for providing piped network up to each park,” stated a report submitted by the environment department to the Jal Shakti ministry. A senior official of the environment department said, “Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) had earlier asked agencies under whose jurisdiction the parks fall, to lay down the pipelines for connecting to sewage treatment plants located close to the parks. However, DJB will prepare a DPR for agencies, which maintain the parks.” According to officials, some park-owning or maintenance agencies are currently taking treated water from DJB’s STPs situated within 5-km radius of parks, by tankers. Last year, the district administration had sealed some borewells that were being used for horticulture. DPCC has also directed agencies to appoint a nodal officer to ensure use of treated water in the parks. “We are compiling information regarding the source of water in different parks. Later, appropriate action will be taken to stop the dependence on groundwater for horticulture purpose,” said a DPCC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/on-ngts-prod-parks-to-get-piped-treated-water-supply/articleshow/84188629.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Federation president M Arumugam said the committee should comprise representatives of private school associations to look into proper conduct of online classes, fees determination and to monitor the progress of students throughout the year. “The committee should ensure that decisions taken by the committee should neither affect the parents nor the schools. Once Covid-19 cases come down schools should be reopened and can function in a shift pattern such as conducting class for students on alternate days or in morning and afternoon sessions. Till then schools should conduct online classes and have continuous assessment of students to determine if they are eligible to be promoted and it should not be a blanket all pass,” he said. Fees should be fixed based on the spending of the government for students for government schools in cities, towns and rural areas. They said that the state government should do away with the existing fees determination committee’s structure. They claimed that the existing fees determination pattern is unjust and unrealistic. The federation also sought monthly relief of Rs 3,000 for each of the nearly 10 lakh teaching and non-teaching staff and owners of small private schools of nearly 15,000 private schools across the state till schools resume normal functioning after the pandemic. He said that they are struggling economically as schools remain closed for close to one-and-a-half-years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/federation-seeks-panel-to-detemine-online-classes-fees/articleshow/84184181.cms||---

The CM spoke at length about the veteran BJP leader’s condition to the doctors and also assured the family that the best care was being provided to him. An official statement from the institute said, a slight improvement in Singh’s condition was recorded on Tuesday. “There is a slight improvement in his sensorium… He, in fact, opened his eyes and gave a very mild response when the CM enquired about his well-being by asking ‘ kaise hain’,” the spokesperson said, adding, “A team of senior doctors supervising his treatment said his vital parameters like blood pressure and heart rate were under control.” Meanwhile, the family stated that senior leadership in the BJP was also keeping a tab of Singh’s health. His son and Etah MP Rajveer Singh said, scores of leaders called upon him and extended good wishes for his father’s speedy recovery. Singh was taken to Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences late on Saturday evening. Upon examination, the doctors noted that his renal parameters were deranged. They also recorded signs of inflammation in his gland. On Sunday, his blood pressure shot up and couldn’t be brought under control and in the patient’s best interest, he was transferred to SGPGI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ailing-kalyan-responds-to-cm-yogis-kaise-hain/articleshow/84188601.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Mumbai||Mumbai Police trace e-sale of fake Covid medicines to Bihar, nab 6||MUMBAI: Two months after Cipla Pharma filed a complaint with the state cyber cell alleging that fraudsters impersonating as its distributors were using the company’s logo and despatching fake Covid medicines online, the cyber crime cell of Mumbai Police busted one such racket in Bihar and arrested six people, including a minor boy. The gang was running operations from a makeshift call centre under a banyan tree in the naxal-affected Nalanda district, said the police. They posted advertisements for sale of remdesivir, tocilizumab, oxygen cylinders, ambulance services and other medicines on social media and even had a bank account in the name of Cipla Ltd and a twitter handle @janbharat_org to win victims’ trust. “The gang has cheated 210 people of Rs 60 lakh as per their 32 bank transactions. But we think the amount is much bigger as it was a pan-India scam,” said Milind Bharambe, joint commissioner of police, crime. “We conducted the raid at night. The moment they saw us, they started fleeing and destroying their phones. We managed to arrest six of them and seize 18 phones,” said senior inspector Sashtra Buddhe. All six arrested accused—Dhananjay Pandit (20) Shravan Pashwan (29), Dhananjay Kumar (29), Nitish Kumar and Sumant Kumar Prasad (26) and the juvenile—are educated. A hunt is on for three of their aides. The scam came to light in May after a doctor looking for remdesivir injection for her brother-in-law who had tested Covid positive came across an online ad of an “official distributor of Cipla” along with three contact numbers. “The complainant called the ‘distributor’ who asked her to deposit Rs 13,800 in a bank account and sent the receipt on WhatsApp. When she did not receive the injection, she called on the number but it was switched off,” said Rashmi Karandikar, deputy commissioner of police (cyber). In May, Cipla Pharma, which has the rights to sell medicines manufactured by US-based Gland Pharma in India, said fraudsters have posted as many as 34 mobile numbers online under the company’s name. Lauding the efforts of the cyber crime cell team —ACP Nitin Jadhav, inspectors Mazgar and Alka Jadhav—Bharambe said it was difficult to trace the gang as they used more than 100 SIM cards and frequently changed their location to evade arrest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-police-trace-e-sale-of-fake-covid-meds-to-bihar-nab-6/articleshow/84186582.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Goa||High court pulls up Goa department officer for cancelling senior citizen’s passport||PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Monday set aside an order of the passport officer cancelling the passport of a senior citizen who applied for correction of his birth date on his passport, and pulled up the officer for not giving him an opportunity to be heard. The court directed the passport officer to reconsider his application for correction of date of birth and dispose of it expeditiously within three months. Central government standing counsel representing the passport officer and Union of India, Mahesh Amonkar stated that the man approached the passport office last year for change of date of birth relying on his birth certificate, and he was directed to produce the documents based on which the initial passport was issued in 2011, but he stated that he didn’t have any documents. Amonkar said that the date of birth in the passport issued in 2011 is different from that on the birth certificate, and in terms of Section 10 (3), it revoked the passport. “How can you revoke it without any notice to him?” the division bench questioned Amonkar. “…Straight away, without any reason, you put a “chappa” saying it’s cancelled? Cancellation of a passport is a serious matter,” the bench said during the hearing. Amonkar said the office considered the information provided initially as false. The bench said the passport office should have heard him and then passed an order. “He says ‘you correct my date of birth’, now, either you correct it or reject it. But on one hand, you’re saying we are not ready to correct it, and on the other hand, you’re saying you gave false information on the basis of which we issued you the passport. Now he’s neither here nor there,” the bench said. If it suspected anything, the passport office should have asked him to show cause, heard him out and then passed orders, the court said. The petitioner’s lawyer, Arjun Naik, said the order cancelling the passport is violation of the principles of natural justice and fair play. “In terms of Section 10 of the Passports Act, 1967, no doubt the passport authorities have powers to impound or even cancel the passport, However, such powers have to be exercised, consistent with the principles of natural justice and fair play. In this case, there is nothing on record to indicate that the petitioner was informed the possible reasons for which the cancellation was being considered and, therefore granted an opportunity to meet with such reasons,” Justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar stated in the judgement. The petitioner’s passport, issued in 2011, was expiring in 2021, and somewhere in 2020, he applied for change of date of birth relying on a birth certificate. The office rejected his application on the ground that it was made after the prescribed period of five years. His passport was cancelled with the endorsement “passport cancelled, visa if any remains valid”. The court said that there was nothing on record to show that he was informed of the possible reasons for which cancellation was being considered, or granted opportunity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/high-court-pulls-up-dept-officer-for-cancelling-senior-citizens-passport/articleshow/84186559.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Delhi||A different heat to worry about: What is wet-bulb temperature||NEW DELHI: When human beings feel hot, they cool themselves by sweating. However, if the humidity is too high, sweating no longer works and one risks dangerous overheating. In this case, “wet-bulb” temperature is used to measure both heat and humidity, helping estimate whether conditions are safe for humans or not. Measured on a different scale compared with normal temperatures, where 35 degrees Celsius is the maximum or threshold limit, wet-bulb temperature of 32 degrees can mean that even fit, acclimatised people will not be able to work easily. At a wet-bulb temperature of 35 degrees Celsius, even fit, acclimatised people can suffer heatstrokes and potentially die if they are outdoors for considerable periods, studies show. With climate change, the number of such potentially dangerous days, where high heat and humidity combine, are also increasing. Currently, Delhi records 63 such days each year, but this could increase to 131 days by 2100 under the “business as usual” scenario, estimates show. At present, most of India experiences 12 to 66 days annually of this potentially deadly heat and high humidity combination with hotspots along the east coast, such as 124 days in Kolkata, 171 days in the Sundarbans, 178 days in Cuttack, 173 days in Brahmapur, 113 days in Thiruvananthapuram and 140 days in Chennai, according to a 2017 study. Mumbai, meanwhile, records 47 such days. Under the “business as usual” or RCP 8.5 scenario, where emissions are expected to increase at the same rate, wet-bulb days are expected to touch 99 each year in Delhi by 2050 and 131 by 2100. Even under strict emissions scenario RCP 2.6, where the global temperature increases by less than 2 degrees Celsius by 2100, Delhi will still see 81 such days each year. Rachel White, an atmospheric scientist with University of British Columbia, said adding a humid heatwave was a lot more dangerous compared with a dry heatwave. “With wet bulb temperatures, one can increase it in one of two ways. Either you increase the temperature or the humidity, and obviously it’s worse if both increase,” she added. Being outdoors during high wet-bulb temperature can cause heatstrokes as well as lightheadedness, nausea, organ swelling and, in rare cases, death. While the human skin has a temperature of around 35 degrees Celsius, a wet-bulb with the same heat means sweat can no longer be used to cool the body. In some cases, wet-bulb temperatures as low as 28 degrees Celsius have also led to mass mortality across the world. Real-time data on Tuesday showed parts of Uttar Pradesh touching a wet-bulb temperature of 31 degrees Celsius, while Delhi was at 25 degrees. In eastern India, it ranged from 26 to 29 degrees. “Your ability to cool down through sweating is not infinite. At some point, the body begins to heat up like any other object and you go through a variety of problems. You become dehydrated. Your skin dries out and various organs begin to shut down, including your kidneys, liver and brain,” said Georges Benjamin, executive director of American Public Health Association. Wet-bulb temperature is measured by wrapping a wet cloth around the bulb of a thermometer. It represents the lowest temperature air can reach by evaporation of water. Internationally, the wet-bulb globe temperature is calculated by using a globe thermometer and additionally accounting for solar radiation and wind speed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/stroke-of-bad-luck-a-different-heat-to-worry-about/articleshow/84188711.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Chennai||Uncertainty forces Sri Lankan Tamils into troubled waters again||Chennai: Last month, after a long gap, about five dozen Sri Lankan Tamils were apprehended for clandestinely entering Tamil Nadu by taking a boat ride across Palk Bay. While one group of 23 people was arrested in Madurai, the other group which moved from Tuticorin to Karnataka was held at Mangaluru. Their plan was to leave India once overseas air transport normalised and reach Canada. At least that’s what they were promised by the cross-border network of middlemen, who had received upto Rs 6 lakh per person for smuggling them out of the island nation. It has been a while since any Sri Lankan Tamil landed in Tamil Nadu’s shores seeking refuge and it has been years since such a large group was apprehended, raising questions if there was a growing desperation forcing more Tamils to flee the country. “If the conditions prevailing in Sri Lanka are good for Tamils, why would they take a risky boat ride and come to India braving the danger of being caught by Lankan and Indian security agencies,” asked Ra Mayootharan, a Jaffna-based independent journalist. “Especially when the additional threat of contracting Covid-19 looms large in India,” he said. Police say in most cases the promise to smuggle them to Canada are attempts by conmen to dupe the refugees. In the past, refugees were brought to TN on the assurance of sending them to Australia and Europe too. But they would be abandoned once they reach Tamil Nadu. What differentiates this batch of refugees from the past is that all the 60-odd were men, aged between 18 and 35 years, indicating that they were looking for livelihood opportunities. “The present government had promised to create one lakh jobs. But nothing meaningful has been done to generate employment,” Mayootharan says. Human rights watchers say this could be the beginning of another round of attempts to flee the country. “My understanding is that reasons for them to leave Sri Lanka is not over yet. This exodus will happen in intervals,” said Ramu Manivannan, head, department of politics and public administration, University of Madras. Manivannan says there have been indications of resurgence of Sinhala nationalism in the past two years after the return of the Rajapaksas to power. The denial of political resolution, appropriation of land owned by Tamils and bleak scope for livelihood are writ large on the Lankan canvas. The European Union parliament passed a resolution last month expressing concern over human rights violations targeting the Tamils. Sri Lanka responded that it was taking efforts to review an anti-terror law widely criticised for its purported intention targeting Tamil minorities. “If Lankan Tamils don’t find any good prospects there, many more will certainly attempt to leave,’’ Manivannan said. Some Sri Lanka observers say this could be an isolated case. “We do not have firsthand information of the situation in Sri Lanka because of the Covid lockdown and suspension of visitors. I would like to believe that this is a oneoff incident,’’ said an official with United Nations High Commission for Refugees. But activists in Sri Lanka say that a sense of uncertainty and anxiety over their safety was still pervasive among the Tamils. For Tamil Nadu, what was a cause of concern was that it was not just the refugees who managed to reach Indian shores, but contrabands across Palk Bay. A recent seizure of 260kg of ganja and Rs 30 lakh cash meant for hawala transactions to Lanka from Rameswaram has thrown light on the nexus between nefarious local elements and Lankan smugglers. Police said under the guise of devotees and tourists, racketeers from Lanka had visited Rameswaram and established contacts with locals looking to make easy money. These locals rope in fishermen, who smuggle anything from ganja to turmeric from Tamil Nadu and sneak in gold and sometimes people seeking refuge from the island. There have also been recent incidents where coastal people of Dhanushkodi and Thondi have seen fishing boats from Sri Lanka coming all the way to the Indian coast to collect ganja. “It is a highly lucrative, decades-old cross border network. Cracking it would need a dedicated team with enough manpower and modern gadgets like motion sensor cameras,” said a police officer. Chief minister M K Stalin had in his recent meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked for citizenship to Lankan Tamil refugees in India. TN should also impress upon the Union government for bilateral efforts to curb overseas smuggling even as seeks to provide succour for the refugees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/uncertainty-forces-sri-lankan-tamils-into-troubled-waters-again/articleshow/84190137.cms||V Mayilvaganan

But it is an old story; now she put her signature on the documents to the surprise of the bank staff to withdraw the money. Though Dhanabakkiyam enjoyed the respect the bank staff showed her, she regretted that she had not learned to read or write despite working in a place of learning. Retired from the anganwadi centre, Dhanabakkiyam had a reason to go back to the school from September last year. Now she can read and write English as well as Tamil. “She is slow, but she can pick up if she makes reading a habit,” says K Chithra Rani, headmistress of the Panchayat Union Primary School (PUPS), Kothamangalam. The ‘Karpom Ezhthuvom Iyakkam’ – a scheme of the directorate of non-formal and adult education has provided training to many illiterate adults like Dhanabakkiyam to learn reading and writing breaking the age barriers. Under Puthiya Vayathu Vanthorkalvi Thittam, an adult literacy programme, illiterate people above the age of 15 were identified in every village and they were trained to put their signatures and read and write. Dhanabakkiyam and many others were felicitated by C Amuthavalli, joint director, directorate of non-formal and adult education when she visited PUPS Kothamangalam on Wednesday. K Marudhanayagam, block education officer (BEO), Manikandam, said that more than 1,000 such people are enrolled in 40 centres in Manikandam for adult education. They were engaged for two hours every day in the evening for training. The objective was to make them put their signature so that they don’t have to live as an illiterate for the rest of their lives, he said. Chithra Rani, who has been training 20 such people in her school, says that many of them show child-like enthusiasm in learning though they spent their lives working for the family and raising their families. “Pitchaiammal, 70, could not hold a pen because of shivering and she would use both hands. I asked her to focus on reading as she can start reading small storybooks once she picks up the language, said Rani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/puthiya-vayathu-vanthorkalvi-thittam-initiates-many-elders-to-world-of-letters/articleshow/84184232.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Delhi||Delhi University: Covid weighs heavy, applications from int’l students still above 1k||NEW DELHI: University of Delhi has witnessed a dip in the number of applications from foreign students for the 2021-22 academic year, but this year, too, the count has crossed the 1,000 mark despite the Covid-19 pandemic. While it had enrolled over 1,500 students from abroad in 2020-21, the number of applications stands at 1,324 this year. Before 2020-21, DU’s highest foreign student intake was over 600 in 2019-20 and 438 in 2018-19. On January 22 this year, DU vice-chancellor P C Joshi announced that the varsity had witnessed a big jump in international admissions last year despite the pandemic. This is part of DU’s Mission 500 plan under which the administration aspires to be among the top 500 institutes in the global QS rankings. According to DU’s dean of students’ welfare and dean of admissions, Rajeev Gupta, “This year’s application number is good, despite the pandemic situation in the country.” He ascribed the reason of the considerable jump in 2020 to the university’s decision to “strengthen the online admission process and streamline foreign student admissions”. While most of the students were from Nepal and Afghanistan and of the Tibetan origin last year, the varsity had given admissions to the applicants from over 80 countries. This year, the applications have been received from only 61 countries. Afghanistan is at the top with 320 applicants, a jump from last year’s 53. Unlike last year when Nepal was the top country with 136 enrolments, 185 applications have been submitted this time. “One reason for the improvement in the Afghanistan count could be that they are attracted to the quality education in India, particularly in DU. Also, Indian Council for Cultural Relations has been working with a number of neighbouring countries,” said Gupta. The other countries with high applications this year are Vietnam (10), Thailand (7) and Sri Lanka (5). Gupta said DU had sent offer letters to all these applicants. “Hopefully, they will confirm admissions and, if the situation improves, can travel and study here,” he added. As the QS rankings considers foreign student numbers, the university has been signing MoUs or starting new centres like Centre for Central Asian studies or a Bangabandhu chair to attract Bangladeshi students, Joshi had said. “Delhi University has had good relations with Southeast Asian countries like Laos, Vietnam, Thailand or African countries like Kenya, Nigeria and others. We want to keep these strong... We also want to sign MoUs with Central Asian countries like Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan,” the VC had announced earlier this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-weighs-heavy-applications-from-intl-students-still-above-1k/articleshow/84186542.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

J Suresh Kumar, 47, a social rights activist from Elisa Nagar resides close to Rajah Serfoji Government College, Thanjavur. He said there was no response to his repeated petition asking the college administration to prevent the premises from being misused by anti-social elements. “I wrote several letters to the college principal V Senthamilselvi seeking steps to raise the compound wall of the college to prevent unauthorised entry but there was no response from the college management,” said Kumar. He said that he decided to seek a RTI reply asking measures taken to rebuild the compound wall and whether police complaint was lodged to prohibit trespassers. “But she has asked me to prove my citizenship to get the details in her reply which I received on Saturday,” he said. He said that he wrote to the Tamil Nadu state information commission complaining against the public information officer (PIO) of the college. However, legal experts said that the public information officer seeking petitioner to prove citizenship cannot be termed incorrect. “Apart from fundamental rights, ordinary legal rights are available only for citizens. Therefore, asking the petitioner to prove his citizenship cannot be termed as illegal. However, the petitioner can approach the appellate authority for adjudication besides going for appeal,” said T Lajapathi Roy, advocate, Madurai bench of the Madras high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/rti-activist-asked-to-prove-citizenship/articleshow/84184248.cms||---

According to sources, while some of the anti-drone systems, currently available with various agencies like NSG and NTRO, are already being installed and tested at locations like the Jammu airport as well as some select border stretches, the larger plan is to extend the deployment of anti-drone technologies designed to detect, intercept and inactivate drones within a possible 5-6 km range, to vital or key security installations within J&K, apart from using them to secure the border with Pakistan. “This will help not only tackle drones being sent with payloads like the one used in the recent attack on Jammu IAF base, but also those detected so far carrying weapons, narcotics and even ready-to-use IEDs,” said a source. The source revealed that the IED recovered from a terrorist arrested in Jammu on the very day drones were used to attack the IAF facility there was also delivered by a drone sent from across the border. “This shows that there may be proper control-rooms just across the border to launch the kind of sophisticated, ‘micro’ drones used to bomb the IAF facility on June 27,” said an officer. The threat of drones is also from terrorists based within J&K. “Drones already in possession of civilians in J&K are being seized. Though their purpose is often explained as wedding or tourism photography, the threat of they being launched by terrorists or overground workers cannot be ruled out,” said an intelligence officer. Sources said Indian agencies are keen to test Israel's advanced anti-drone systems, including Iron Dome technologies, that can detect and intercept drones with good precision. "The target is to test these systems over a week or two and have them installed to cover vital installations and the western border in the following couple of months. The systems available have a range of destroying drones within a range of 5-6 km to as far as 30 km," said a source in the Central security establishment. Meanwhile, the drone threat was discussed at a security review meeting on J&K chaired by home secretary Ajay Bhalla here on Tuesday. Other issues deliberated at the meeting - attended by heads of Central intelligence agencies and para-military forces including CRPF, CISF and J&K police brass - included the upcoming infiltration season, border security, general security scenario, telephone signal overlaps and multiple SIMs getting into wrong hands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-may-get-advanced-drone-shield/articleshow/84191230.cms||Bharti Jain

She has been shortlisted for mixed relay events to be held in Tokyo next month. Her grandmother, who trained her after spotting her talent at the zonal competition, is elated at her selection. She was selected based on her performance in the trials held recently, where she covered 400m distance in 53.55 seconds. She will join the Indian contingent, which will leave for Japan soon. Her coach K Kannan, from the Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu (SDAT), Madurai, said, “We are elated very much and there are no words to express the joy when we heard about her selection. It is a proud moment for people in Madurai. I shared the news with her grandmother and she is very happy,” he said. Revathi is a shy girl who talks very little. However, she lets her performance speak about herself. She is a disciplined girl and very hardworking, which took her to places. “I used to tell her that she would represent India one day in the Olympics. She never said anything and replied with a smile. She put her best in the last few months to earn a place for the competition,” Kannan said. Revathi lost her parents V Veeramani and V Rani when she was young. After her parents’ deaths, her grandmother Arammal, a daily wager, took care of her and her younger sister. She studied at a government-aided school at K Pudur staying in a hostel. With the help of sponsors and the college authorities, she has completed BA in Tamil in Lady Doak College in the city. Revathi initially took part in football games, while studying in middle school. Her teacher Regina spotted her running capability and encouraged her to take up sprinting. Revathi joined railways as a travelling ticket examiner (TTE) at Madurai junction last year. She left for Patiala a few months ago for training for the Olympics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-girl-revathi-makes-history-qualifies-for-olympics/articleshow/84184305.cms||V Devanathan
---||Goa||Rajendra Arlekar named Himachal governor, first Goan neta to hold the post||PANAJI: The President on Tuesday appointed former Goa speaker and senior BJP functionary Rajendra Arlekar, 67, as governor of Himachal Pradesh. Arlekar, a former state BJP president, will take oath in the next couple of days. Arlekar said that PM Narendra Modi called him on Monday and sought his opinion on the Centre’s decision to appoint him governor of Himachal Pradesh. Arlekar said he would go by whatever was decided by Modi, after which the PM, and later, President R N Kovind, personally called and congratulated him. Arlekar had recently told BJP national general secretary (organisation) B L Santosh that he isn’t interested in contesting the 2022 assembly elections, but instead would like to work for the party. Arlekar was from the 1989 batch of the RSS cadre who were inducted into the BJP. Another from the batch, Shripad Naik, went on to become India’s first Ayush minister, a post he still holds. On Monday, Arlekar said that his appointment has shown that the party respects the work of a common karyakarta of the party. “I am humbled and grateful to the leadership of BJP, grateful to the PM, president, and home minister Amit Shah, who have shown their trust in me,” he said. The former minister for forest and environment in the Laxmikant Parsekar government said that his experience as a speaker and minister would help him in executing his duties as governor. He also said that when he was the speaker of the Goa legislative assembly, he learned how not to be biased. “I have learnt not to be biased, and a governor has always to be unbiased,” he said. “I will work according to the Constitution.” Arlekar, a commerce graduate, has been associated with the RSS since his childhood. His father, Vishwanath Arlekar, was in the Jan Sangh. The newly-appointed governor had worked closely with former chief minister and defence minister Manohar Parrikar in building the party. Arlekar is also a core committee member of the party. Arlekar contested his first assembly elections in 2002 from the Vasco da Gama constituency, and was elected. He lost the seat in 2007, and in 2012, he was elected from Pernem constituency. In 2017, Arlekar lost to current deputy chief minister Manohar Ajgaonkar, who was then in MGP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/arlekar-named-himachal-guv-1st-goan-neta-to-hold-the-post/articleshow/84186508.cms||---

The early Pandya-era structure is the only stone temple of its kind in Ramanathapuram. Built with only granite stone, the temple’s intricate inscriptions and shape are examples of the outstanding architecture of the early Pandya period. It offers a lot of information to students of architecture, says president of the Ramanathapuram Archaeological Research Foundation V Rajaguru. The structure houses the shrines of Lord Shiva and goddess Amman separately. V Sivaranjani, who has studied the temple closely, says, “The details are very interesting, many stories from Hindu religion have been etched out intricately on these walls,” she said. But much of the frescoes have been damaged over the years. And the handiwork of artisans are all but disappearing. Its architecture is similar to the better-known early Pandya period temples like the Kazhukumalai Vettuvankoil in Tuticorin and the Thirupathur Sivan temple. All these temples have square towers, known as ‘Nagara Vimana’ and the Thirupathur temple has three tiers, while the Ramanathapuram temple and the Kazhukumalai temple have two. In the first tier of the tower of this temple there are sculptures of a chariot and a bullock cart. Frieze of Yali figures, makara yali, simha yali and 'gana' figures in dancing postures and floral decorations are common to all the three temples. A sculpture of Kannappa Nayanar, a hunt who had donated his eyes to Lord Shiva adorns the wall of this temple. The sculpture shows him with his foot placed on top of a Shiva Linga and another has Uma Maheswarar sitting on top of Nandi, and many other intricate forms. This should be protected as architectural treasure, says Rajaguru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/stone-temple-of-pandya-era-shows-signs-of-dilapidation/articleshow/84190157.cms||Padmini Sivarajah

Swamy’s elder brother T P L Hirudhayasamy and his family members watched a prayer live-streamed before his funeral at St Peter’s church at Bandra in Mumbai from their ancestral residence at Viragaloor at 4pm. “Since we did not have the opportunity to pay homage in person, we watched the prayer online,” said H Stans Sundar, son of Hirudhayasamy. Sundar also said that around 500 people including the residents of Viragaloor, few Jesuit fathers from St Joseph’s college and office bearers of Christhuva Nallena Iyakkam took part in the candle light prayer at Seven Dollars Church in the village followed by a mass in the church. Hirudhaysamy’s grandson S Benitto Prabhu said that the police denied permission to hold a rally in the village citing Covid-19 norms on Tuesday. The family has been in touch with Indian Social Institute (ISI) director Joseph Xavier who was taking care of the funeral rites to Swamy in Mumbai. “The ash will be handed over to Xavier who will take it to Ranchi in Jharkhand as per the wish of our grandfather,” said Benitto.

The farmers led by the association’s Thanjavur district secretary S Vimalnathan said that farmers across the state paid several hundred crores of rupees towards crop insurance premium to the government through authorised insurance companies in November 2020 under the PM crop insurance scheme. Crop cutting experiment (CCE) would be done one month before the harvest in a particular survey number identified by the government for each village to assess the crop loss in the presence of officials of the agriculture department, statistical department, survey department and insurance companies. “The continuous rainfall in the last leg of 2020 and the beginning of 2021 left paddy crops inundated. Even though they completed the assessment, they were yet to declare the percentage of the crop loss in each village, which they should have done by the end of February,” said Vimalnathan. The association said that information on the crop loss should be declared within a month of the assessment. “Even though the PM crop insurance scheme has been renamed as Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana in 2019, it has been done for namesake. “There is no transparency in the process till now. They have not declared the crop loss of the summer season. With the existing technology, they can calculate the crop loss in a day or two but they have taken so many months to release even the basic information,” said Vimalnathan. As per the modified crop insurance scheme, insurance companies should pay interest in case of delay in disbursing the compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmers-protest-delay-in-crop-loss-relief/articleshow/84184320.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Six of same family positive, shifted to MLA Hostel Covid care centre||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has shifted another six members of a family to MLA Hostel Covid care centre (CCC) after all of them tested positive in the last couple of days. Top civic health officials said three of the family members from Dhantoli zone tested positive on July 3. This mandated the testing of three immediate high risk close contacts who too tested positive a day later. As per officials, they don’t have travel history though it was being said the family had travelled to one of the districts in Maharashtra still reporting high positivity. All are asymptomatic and doing well, officials said. The NMC zone officials traced and tested around 70 more high risk close contact but they tested negative in RTPCR. Like the two samples of another family from the same zone, the civic officials have sent these six samples to NEERI. On June 4, TOI had reported that the NMC has also decided to study the samples of patients if they belong to same chain of infection and test positive at the same time. The trend of entire family testing was seen during the peak of second wave between March and early May. Last week, the Dhantoli zone medical team had shifted six persons to MLA Hostel CCC. They had tested positive following their return from Kolhapur, which is among the seven districts in the state where the delta plus variant has been detected. The NMC then requested the CSIR-NEERI lab led by Dr Krishna Khairnar to examine the six cases too. The saline gargle RTPCR samples of only five were collected and handed over to NEERI team. Of these, only two tested positive whose sequencing quality RNA extracts were prepared by NEERI and forwarded to CCMB Hyderbad. The results are awaited. The genome sequencing is part of active surveillance and containment measure in the wake of Delta Plus variant spread.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/six-of-same-family-ve-shifted-to-mla-hostel-ccc/articleshow/84186536.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Malik, who was governor of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir before its reorganisation, became popular in Goa, and was proactive and outspoken about several relevant issues, including the state government’s mishandling of the Covid-19 crisis during the first wave. He had warned CM Pramod Sawant that New Delhi was keeping close watch on Goa’s Covid situation, and advised Sawant to “pull up his socks”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-almost-a-year-goa-gets-a-full-time-guv-sreedharan-pillai/articleshow/84186539.cms||---
---||Surat||MNC manager creates 286 female IDs for vulgar chat||Surat: In an unusual case of online sexual behaviour, Surat cybercrime sleuths nabbed a 29-year-old man who preferred to chat posing as woman with women. The accused production manager from Vadodara, Yatin Diyora, had opened 286 Instagram accounts from which he indulged in adult chats with women. The accused who works in a multinational chemical and polymer manufacturer had got married in January and discontinued his habit. But his chequered past soon caught up with him when a Surat woman came to haunt him after 10 months in August 2020. “Such a behaviour developed in a short period can be a paraphilic disorder. The purpose of such an individual is only pleasure and not to harm anyone,” said Mukul Choksi, a psychiatrist. Diyora’s name cropped up in investigation of a complaint lodged by a packaging businessman in March that someone had created a fake Instagram ID similar to his wife’s name and was indulging in vulgar chats with a friend of his wife. Police initially did not get any success but using cyber surveillance techniques cops traced the accused. Since lockdown in 2020, the accused created 286 fake IDs using various forms of the name Bijal (name changed). He used photos of girls in the display or profile picture to establish that he is a woman and then sent random friend requests to women. If the woman accepts his request he starts chatting as a girl and gradually shifts to vulgar talks. While some women continued chatting, most, however, stopped. “Trouble started for him when he did a similar thing with a woman in Surat. The woman accepted his request thinking that the request was from her friend Bijal. She was suspicious when Diyora started a sexual chat,” said Y A Gohil, assistant commissioner of police, Cyber Crime. The woman contacted her friend Bijal and asked that why are you doing sexual chat. In turn Bijal informed that her ID is different and she alerted her husband. They then approached cybercrime and lodged the complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/mnc-manager-creates-286-female-ids-for-vulgar-chat/articleshow/84181617.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Nagpur||After 3-year wait, Raju Hiwase is Nagpur University’s full-time registrar||NAGPUR: After a long wait of three years, Nagpur University (NU) finally got a full-time registrar in the form of Raju Hiwase on Tuesday. After his selection by the panel, the former finance and accounts officer (FAO) immediately took over the charge from Anil Hirekhan, who was looking after the additional charge. Hiwase’s tenure as FAO had already ended, but he was granted a six-month extension in view of the Covid-19 pandemic situation. The newly appointed registrar told TOI, “My focus will be on the digital transformation of the university, which is the dream of our vice-chancellor (VC) Subhash Chaudhari. Another target would be to achieve a top grade in National Assessment and Accreditation Council’s (NAAC) rating.” He added, “Apart from these, I will work hard to fill up the several vacant posts in the university and also to promote research activities. The ultimate objective is to bring back the past glory of our historic institution and make it the most sought-after in Central India at the end of my tenure.” A total of 38 candidates applied for the post from all over Maharashtra, of which 10 withdrew their applications on the first day of interviews on Monday. Along with Hiwase, even Hirekhan was a front runner for the post. Other strong contenders were Shyam Koreti, Vijay Bansod, Sangita Lohi, Ashok Khobragade, and one teacher from Pune. Ever since Puran Meshram demitted the registrar’s office in 2018 after the end of his five-year tenure, the appointment process for the post was often marred into one or the other controversy. Earlier, the charge was handed over to former exam controller Neeraj Khaty, who was later appointed full-time registrar by former VC SP Kane in 2019 after conducting interviews. However, Khaty refused to join after Shikshan Manch, one of the dominant players in NU politics, allegedly forced Kane to appoint its candidate, as per NU officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-3-year-wait-hiwase-is-nus-full-time-registrar/articleshow/84186548.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Mumbai||Antibody drop against Delta may bolster call for 3rd jab||Recent findings by the Indian Council of Medical Research, indicating lower levels of neutralizing antibodies against the Delta variant in a small portion of Covishield recipients, may just tip the balance in favour of a third booster shot, experts in the field have said. The ICMR study indicated a 4.5-fold and 3.2-fold reduction in neutralising antibody levels against Delta in those who were given one and two doses of Covishield, respectively, compared to an earlier SARS-CoV-2 version that had the D614G mutation (detected early last year). Dr Samiran Panda, chief of the ICMR’s epidemiology and communicable diseases division, said, "These kinds of observations have the potential of informing immunization programmes, including the possible need for a third booster dose for vaccination against Covid-19." For the study, serum samples were collected from healthy individuals who had received one or two doses of Covishield. Samples were also collected from Covid-recovered patients who had received one or two doses. The fifth category of individuals whose samples were drawn were breakthrough cases — people who contracted Covid after vaccination. Dr Pragya Yadav, from National Institute of Virology and a member of the research team, said the study indicated that serum of Covid-recovered participants (given either one or two doses) and the breakthrough cases had higher neutralizing antibody titres compared to non-Covid participants who had received one or two shots of Covishield. Dr Panda said, "This indicates that neutralizing antibodies in the serum of individuals who had contracted Covid, in a way, worked like the first dose. A full vaccination schedule after that resulted in higher levels of neutralizing antibodies. Similarly, people who had received two doses of Covishield and contracted Covid after that (breakthrough infections), had higher levels of neutralizing antibodies." In both cases, Dr Panda said, the immune system was exposed to the viral antigen thrice, generating a greater immune response. "The ICMR study could then help support discussion on whether or not a third Covishield booster dose could be needed in future for some cases.” Dr Yadav said, “Another important aspect of the study was the finding that breakthrough cases have significantly less severity and mortality. Also, it showed that even one dose is sufficient for long-term protection in case of those who have recently recovered from Covid-19."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-antibody-drop-against-delta-may-bolster-call-for-3rd-jab/articleshow/84186545.cms||Neha Madaan

The stray dog had three puppies and while two died on Sunday, one more, was being treated in a veterinary hospital. The mother died on Monday. Based on a complaint from Mayur Hassija, an animal activist from the city, a case was registered with the Koodalpudur police station and an inquiry was underway. Hassija said that the dogs were taken care of by an elderly couple. A neighbour has been complaining about the dogs saying that they may bite her daughter. The couple counselled the neighbour but he was not convinced and lodged a complaint with the Madurai Corporation. Hassija said that the dog was captured by the corporation employees despite the fact that nursing dogs should be spared. The corporation workers brought the dog back to her habitat after providing an anti-rabies injection. “We are not sure who has killed the dog. The city police should view it as a serious incident and arrest the people behind it,” he said. K P Marikumar, animal activist said that incidents of killing dogs take place quite regularly. There were at least 15 incidents of killing dogs in the last few months. Hassija said that animal activists find it difficult for cases to be booked in such incidents as police do not show seriousness unless pressure is exerted through higher officials. “Fine and punishment should be increased under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act in order to stop the killing of dogs. The civic body should vaccinate 70% of the community dogs and achieve 80% sterilization as per the WHO guidelines and ensure that dogs and humans happily coexist,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/stray-dog-two-puppies-poisoned-to-death-activists-call-for-stringent-laws/articleshow/84184340.cms||V Devanathan

---||Goa||For Class IX-X, boys’ dropout rate in Goa almost twice that of girls||PANAJI: Even as Goa is among ten states and Union territories with the lowest dropout rate at the secondary school level, in Classes IX and X, the percentage of boys who drop out are almost double that of girls. The Union education ministry recently revealed this in the unified district information system for education (U-DISE) report for 2019-20. At the Class IX-X level, 12.8% boys had given up school education in the state, as compared to 7.2% of girls. The dropout rate was nearly zero upto Class VIII, till which class the no-fail policy is applicable. In Goa, the school dropout rate has always been higher for boys, with educationists citing that early employment opportunities provided by sectors like tourism and mining in the state being factors. However, the sheer gap between the dropout rate for boys and girls thrown up by the U-DISE report is of concern. The gap is equally wide when it comes to repeating a class. Here, too, boys are twice as likely to flunk and repeat a class in Class IX and X. The repetition rate for boys is 9.4%, which is nearly double the figure for girls, at 5.4%. When compared to other states and Union Territories, students in Goa are more likely to repeat a class than drop out. The national average repetition rate for students of both genders in Class IX and X is 2.8%, while Goa’s average stands at 7.5%. In the case of dropout rate, however, Goa’s average of 10% is much better than the national 16%. In the past, former chairman of the state Board Jose Remedios Rebello has gone on record to express his concerns over schools, especially urban ones, detaining students at the Class IX level.

Among its 870 recipients, Samir Hiwarkar and Chakradhar Thawkar would be honoured with the prestigious degree by chancellor BS Koshyari, who would be attending the ceremony online. But both the candidates had unfortunately expired during the second wave of Coronavirus. Now their family members would be handed over their degrees for which they worked hard for years, as per the NU officials. Hiwarkar completed his PhD while working in a private job under guide Madhuri Lele. Though he had submitted his thesis, it couldn’t proceed ahead as the experts failed to check his research work. NU then appointed another panel of experts to go through his project which led to a delay of six months. On April 1, NU issued a notification in his name, but he succumbed to the virus on April 9. Thawkar was working as a principal at Lal Bahadur College. He had completed his research under guidance of Rajendra Watane. NU was also going to felicitate him with a gold medal in the name of Mahant Nagraj Baba. Even his notification was out in February, but he expired on June 1. According to NU officials, he would have himself received his degree if the convocation was held by the university during its earlier dates -- April 3 and then on April 11. But the event was deferred, due to the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. NU declares 685 results in a month Infamous for an inordinate delay in results declaration a decade ago, NU has set a record of sorts by declaring 685 results of winter-2020 examinations in a month. According to NU media coordinator Rajendra Pathak, the university conducted 926 exams from February to June and had already announced 685 results in 24 working days of June, which comes to about 30 per day. NU had held the winter-2020 exams in three phases, but it was delayed due to Covid-19 second wave striking the nation. Out of 376 results in the first phase, 301 were declared, while 92/130 in the second phase and 292/420 in the third phase are already out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/postponed-convocation-results-in-2-phds-conferred-posthumously/articleshow/84186639.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

While Thavarchand Gehlot replaces Vala as Karnataka governor, Mangubhai Patel will relieve Uttar Pradesh governor Anandiben Patel of the additional charge of MP. With his term as governor ending, Vala had expressed a desire to return to his home town, Rajkot. Patel meanwhile said he will do his best to fulfil his responsibilities as governor of MP. Patel, 77, is a native of Navsari in South Gujarat and a well-known tribal leader of the BJP. “I will try my best to fulfil my responsibility as governor. The BJP is a party which believes in taking all communities along. I thank President Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and other leaders for giving me this new responsibility,” Patel told mediapersons at his residence in Navsari. “I will continue to walk the path shown by Modiji and am ready to serve the people in my new role,” said Patel, who had served as minister of tribal welfare, forests and environment in Gujarat when PM Modi was the CM. Patel also served as the Gujarat Assembly’s deputy speaker in 2013. A former RSS worker, Patel was born on June 1, 1944, at Navsari. He will be the 19th governor of MP Vajubhai Vala was the sitting minister who had vacated his assembly seat for then Gujarat CM and now PM Narendra Modi to contest. After Vala’s appointment as Karnataka governor, present chief minister Vijay Rupani contested on the same seat in Rajkot and won. Vajubhai Vala’s return to Rajkot sparked excitement among his friends and well wishers. Gunvant Delawala, his friend, said, “Vala could not come here for the last 18 months because of the Covid situation. Even after becoming governor, he used to attend social functions at home. He called me and said he is now coming back and again we will enjoy plays at Hemu Gadhvi Hall and dayras.” According to Delawala, Vajubhai is expected back in Rajkot in the next couple of days after he is relieved from his duty as governor of Karnataka. Guessing game over new faces from Gujarat in PMs cabinet Following the appointment of Mangubhai Patel as Rajasthan governor, speculation is rife about Gujarat leaders who could be accommodated in the likely reshuffle of the Union cabinet. At present, Gandhinagar MP Amit Shah is Union home minister, while three other ministers – S Jaishankar, Mansukh Mandaviya and Parshottam Rupala – are Rajya Sabha members from the state. There is a buzz that one or two new faces from the state could be inducted into the Union cabinet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mangubhai-new-mp-governor-vala-to-return/articleshow/84186667.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||HC goes ballistic over Telangana govt’s ‘bench hunting’||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Tuesday found fault with advocates representing the state and farmers for making ‘a mountain out of a molehill’ by vying with each other on who should hear the AP farmers’ plea against Telangana’s hydel power generation. The bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy, while conveying its displeasure over the request made by the state government on Monday asking Justice MS Ramachandra Rao to recuse himself from hearing the case, however, minced no words in criticising the counsel for the farmers. “You look no better. You rushed to the second division bench asking it to take up the matter on an urgent basis despite knowing the fact that there is an overlap in the subjects to be heard by the first and second courts respectively. What you have done too could be construed as bench hunting,” the bench said addressing senior counsel Vedula Venkata Ramana, who appeared for the farmers. As per the roster, the subjects pertaining to rivers, irrigation projects, etc., fall under the purview of the bench headed by the CJ. Matters pertaining to disputes between the two states revolving around AP Reorganisation Act are allocated to the second division bench headed by Justice Ramachandra Rao. The CJ said that there was an overlapping of subjects and the parties should have displayed maturity instead of rushing to baseless conclusions. “What vested interest will the courts have? Why do you adopt a confrontationist attitude? This is most unacceptable,” the CJ bench said. CJ Kohli directed advocate general BS Prasad to withdraw the interim application filed by the state government asking Justice Ramachandra Rao to recuse himself from the hearing. “You should have pointed out the roster issue and leave things there instead of seeking recusal. It is most unbecoming on the part of the state of Telangana. It is in a bad taste,” the CJ said, addressing the AG. She also found fault with Venkata Ramana for not allowing time to the registry to take a call on the issue. “Why did you not wait? Why did you rush to the second court? What is the hurry? Can’t you wait for some time,” the CJ bench asked. When Venkata Ramana said he can wait for three or four days, the CJ said, “Then wait now.” The CJ is seized of the matter and is expected to take a decision in a day or two. Meanwhile, upset with repeated requests from the state government asking him to recuse himself from the hearing, Justice Ramachandra Rao also expressed his displeasure over the attitude of the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-goes-ballistic-over-t-govts-bench-hunting/articleshow/84190175.cms||---

Civic authorities said that they are yet to chalk out a plan and select centres that would be earmarked for them. The Union health ministry on July 2 approved the vaccination of pregnant women since they are at an increased risk for preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes if infected with Covid. The Centre has also prepared operational guidelines, counselling kit for medical officers and frontline workers and information material for people to read and understand the risks and benefits. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, confirmed that vaccination of pregnant women wouldn’t start immediately. “We will be shortlisting centres first. That will be followed by training of healthcare workers who would be informing pregnant women about the risks and benefits,” she said. The city may have over a lakh pregnant women waiting to get vaccinated. The procedures and modalities of vaccination like registration, generation of certificates after vaccination etc, will remain the same as it is for any beneficiaries above 18 years. Meanwhile, the city on Monday vaccinated over 69,515 people, taking the number of people who have got both doses to nearly 12 lakh and those with one dose to 34 lakh. More doses were administered at the public centres compared to private hospitals. Gomare said that the city will have vaccination at regular hours on Wednesday (9am-5pm) since it had received stocks of 95,000 doses on Monday. Across the state, nearly 3.9 lakh doses were administered on Tuesday. The state has finished administering both doses to over 71 lakh people. State officials said that the state has been assured of 1.1crore doses of vaccine in July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/vax-for-citys-pregnant-women-plan-yet-to-be-chalked-out-centres-not-identified/articleshow/84186670.cms||---

Authorities failed to tar the road that was dug up to lay a pipeline. Citizens complained that many accidents have occurred along this route as water accumulates in the potholes during monsoon. “The condition of the road is pathetic. It was dug up for laying the pipeline. This is the third year that the road continues to be in this state. The authorities concerned have not undertaken any patch work to provide relief to commuters. The government should at least level the potholes,” said an aggrieved commuter. Local panch member William Fernandes said that the panchayat has been following up with PWD officials, who had assured that one layer of tar would be applied, but this is yet to be taken up. The contractor suddenly abandoned the work after he was given another task elsewhere, he said. “PWD had ample of time to apply at least one layer of tar which would have given some relief, but nothing was done. Now, PWD should take up some temporary work,” said Fernandes.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Finds put Vadnagar at par with major Buddhist sites||AHMEDABAD: Vadnagar, now famous as the home town of PM Narendra Modi, has again revealed its ancient treasures to experts from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) – an elliptical (capsule-shaped) structure similar to those at other ancient sites associated with Buddhism, a sealing with the same first words as on a casket found at the Devni Mori site have connected the ancient town firmly with the Buddhist heritage of India. The results were shared by the Excavation Branch V of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) on the first day of a two-day workshop on Tuesday. The workshop, which had experts from diverse fields associated with archaeology – from archaeo-botany to ground-penetrating radar – has been organized to assess progress made at Vadnagar in the past seven years. Top officials including Raghvendra Singh, secretary (culture), and V Vidhavathi, DG of ASI, participated in the event. The ancient town entered the limelight in the 2000s with the find of a monastery right in the middle of the town. In the past few years, the ASI team has unearthed multiple structures in and around the town, firmly putting the 2,500-plus years old town on the Buddhist map.  Dr Abhijit Ambekar, in-charge superintending archaeologist of Excavation Branch V working at Vadnagar said in his presentation that only four archaeological sites — Rajgir, Besnagar, Sravasti and Nagarjunakonda, three of them associated with Buddhism and Besnagar with Vaishnavism — have reported structures of such designs earlier. “Identified as mandalamala in Pali literature, such structures were probably used for congregation or to house a shrine,” he said, adding that the structure in Vadnagar has a pradakshinapath (circumambulatory path) around it. “From the evidence so far, it is probably the contemporary of other structures. While the four other structures date from the 5th century BCE to the 2nd century CE, the structure at Vadnagar is dated to between 1st and the 6th-7th centuries CE.” The three sealings are found from another site – believed to be a stupa due to its circular design – near the boundary wall of the town near Sharmishtha lake. “The sealing has the same letters ‘namassarvagyaya’ (salutations to Lord Buddha) as the first letters found on the casket found from Devni Mori. We can infer that the sealings were contemporary to the site,” said Dr Ambekar in his presentation. The ancient casket was found at a stupa in Devni Mori during an earlier excavation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/finds-put-vadnagar-at-par-with-major-buddhist-sites/articleshow/84186702.cms||Parth Shastri

Dr Madhuri Rajeev Kanitkar, deputy chief, Integrated Defence Staff (Medical), the new vice-chancellor of Nashik-based Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS). A Raj Bhavan statement read that the new vice-chancellor’s appointment would be for a term of five years or till attaining the age of 65 years, whichever is earlier from the date she assumes the VC’s office. She will succeed Dr Deelip Mhaisekar, whose term ended in February this year. Savitribai Phule Pune University vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar was the acting VC of MUHS since then. After her appointment, Lt Gen. Madhuri Kanitkar said team work and rural health would be her focus areas. “The Indian armed forces have believed in team work and that is what I would try to bring to the university. To achieve this objective, I would try to bring all disciplines together to work on research and patient care,” she told TOI. She also said she would be focusing on inculcating discipline among students and motivating them to work beyond curriculum. “Rural health is one of the major concerns before us. To address it, we would motivate and encourage postgraduate medical students to work in rural areas. This would bring a lot of change in rural life,” she added. Lt Gen. Kanitkar had also served as the dean of Pune-based Armed Forces Medical College, her alma mater, for over two years since January 2017. She topped Pune University during her MBBS graduation examination. Her teaching experience and involvement in research span over 22 years. Hailing Lt Gen. Kanitkar’s appointment as the new VC, an MUHS official said she would be the first person from the defence background to lead one of the most prestigious health science universities of the country. “Lt Gen. Kanitkar is known to be an extremely competent academician in medical education. Since she has been attached to health science academics and research for a long time, she will bring fresh ideas that would benefit not only the health science institutes affiliated to MUHS but also the students,” said a senior functionary of MUHS. The Maharashtra Governor had in February this year appointed a three-member team headed by retired chief justice of the Odisha high court Justice Kalpesh Jhaveri to recommend to him a panel of names suitable for appointment of the vice-chancellor. Randeep Guleria, director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), and Saurabh Vijay, secretary in the medical education and drugs department, were the other two members of the committee. The panel initially shortlisted 19 names from the 35 applications that it had received and subsequently sent names of five candidates to the Raj Bhavan for the final selection of the new MUHS vice-chancellor. MUHS was established in 1998 and over 415 health science colleges in the state are affiliated to it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lt-gen-madhuri-kanitkar-new-vc-of-muhs/articleshow/84186689.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Around 52% of the population in the above 45 age group have been vaccinated with the first dose, while the remaining will be given priority once the vaccine supply begins, said NMMC officials. “Of the 10.8 lakh population above 18 years of age, 5.7 lakh have already been covered with the first dose. This means, we are in a better position as far as volume of vaccination is concerned,” said NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar. “If vaccines are made available, we can cover the remaining population with the first dose within 30 days since 84 vaccination centres have already been created in the entire city, and 16 more are on the cards, taking the tally to 100 centres. Each centre will have to immunise at least 200 beneficiaries a day,” added Bangar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/can-vaccinate-all-above-18-yrs-with-1st-dose-in-30-days-nmmc/articleshow/84186709.cms||B B Nayak
---||Delhi||Universities in Delhi announce tentative entrance dates as they await clarity on common exam||NEW DELHI: Several universities in Delhi, which rely on entrance tests for admissions, have started issuing tentative dates for the tests in July or August. A response from UGC on the possibility of a CUCET exam is, however, still awaited. Controller of Examination at Jamia Millia Islamia Nazim Jafri said, “We may conduct entrance tests from July 26. It will be done in the physical mode as the current situation is conducive for that.” Raju Nair, IP University’s Controller of Examination, said that they had opened the registration process and the entrance test would be conducted by a government agency. “We have set a tentative test date in the second or third week of August, depending on the pandemic. The number of exam centres will be higher to ensure social distancing norms.” JNU is yet to announce the test dates. JNU director of admissions Jayant Tripathy stated that “admissions are likely to take place in the same format as last year.” “The varsity is awaiting a go-ahead from NTA as they have been conducting JNU’s entrance tests for the past few years.” Sources in the university say that they cannot announce the admission process as they are waiting for UGC to issue an academic calendar schedule. A source in NTA said there was no clarity on CUCET yet as a decision on it would be taken by the education ministry and UGC. “So far, NTA has not received any intimation on this. Even if UGC asks us to conduct it now, NTA will need around 45 to 60 days for preparations for the national-level test.” “JNU entrance dates will be announced after the announcement of JEE and NEET dates. Tentatively, JNU exams are to be scheduled between the last week of August and September first week,” stated NTA sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/varsities-announce-tentative-entrance-dates-as-they-await-clarity-on-common-exam/articleshow/84186685.cms||---

---||Nashik||Lt Gen. Kanitkar new VC of MUHS||Nashik/Pune: Maharashtra Governor and chancellor of universities in the state Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Tuesday appointed Lt Gen. Dr Madhuri Rajeev Kanitkar, deputy chief, Integrated Defence Staff (Medical), the new vice-chancellor of Nashik-based Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS). A Raj Bhavan statement read that the new vice-chancellor’s appointment would be for a term of five years or till attaining the age of 65 years, whichever is earlier from the date she assumes the VC’s office. She will succeed Dr Deelip Mhaisekar, whose term ended in February this year. Savitribai Phule Pune University vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar was the acting VC of MUHS since then. After her appointment, Lt Gen. Madhuri Kanitkar said team work and rural health would be her focus areas. “The Indian armed forces have believed in team work and that is what I would try to bring to the university. To achieve this objective, I would try to bring all disciplines together to work on research and patient care,” she told TOI. She also said she would be focusing on inculcating discipline among students and motivating them to work beyond curriculum. “Rural health is one of the major concerns before us. To address it, we would motivate and encourage postgraduate medical students to work in rural areas. This would bring a lot of change in rural life,” she added. Lt Gen. Kanitkar had also served as the dean of Pune-based Armed Forces Medical College, her alma mater, for over two years since January 2017. She topped Pune University during her MBBS graduation examination. Her teaching experience and involvement in research span over 22 years. Hailing Lt Gen. Kanitkar’s appointment as the new VC, an MUHS official said she would be the first person from the defence background to lead one of the most prestigious health science universities of the country. “Lt Gen. Kanitkar is known to be an extremely competent academician in medical education. Since she has been attached to health science academics and research for a long time, she will bring fresh ideas that would benefit not only the health science institutes affiliated to MUHS but also the students,” said a senior functionary of MUHS. The Maharashtra Governor had in February this year appointed a three-member team headed by retired chief justice of the Odisha high court Justice Kalpesh Jhaveri to recommend to him a panel of names suitable for appointment of the vice-chancellor. Randeep Guleria, director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), and Saurabh Vijay, secretary in the medical education and drugs department, were the other two members of the committee. The panel initially shortlisted 19 names from the 35 applications that it had received and subsequently sent names of five candidates to the Raj Bhavan for the final selection of the new MUHS vice-chancellor. MUHS was established in 1998 and over 415 health science colleges in the state are affiliated to it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/lt-gen-kanitkar-new-vc-of-muhs/articleshow/84181833.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

The CM said after each aerial survey, he would get feedback from the local administration through videoconferencing as to what else has to be done for the affected population. The flood-hit blocks and localities which the CM covered were Ramnagar, Chanpatia, Narkatiaganj, Gaunaha and Majhauliya in West Champaran, Sugauli, Ramgarhwa, Chhaudadano, Banjara, Chiraiya, Dhaka, Patahi and Madhuban in East Champaran, Gaighat, Katra and Aurai in Muzaffarpur besides Runnisaidpur, Belsand and Bairganiya in Sitamarhi and all the three blocks in Sheohar district. The flood-affected areas are in the basins of Gandak, Bagmati, Burhi Gandak, Kamla, Lalbakeya and the Adhwara group of rivers. Floodwaters have destroyed the paddy saplings even before they could be transplanted in some areas. As per the water resources department (WRD) flood bulletin, the Bagmati was flowing above the danger level at most points along its downstream and showed the rising trend. There was light to moderate rainfall in the basins of North Koel, Sone, Punpun, Falgu and Sakri-Panchane rivers on Monday and Tuesday. The weather forecast in the catchment areas of north Bihar rivers lying in Nepal is for light to moderate rainfall on Wednesday. Araria received 32mm rainfall and Kishanganj 50mm. Meanwhile, reports from Bagaha in West Champaran district said the rail communication has been disrupted on the Narakatiaganj-Sugauli and Narakatiaganj-Raxaul sections under Samastipur division since July 4. The floodwaters touched the girder of the bridge number 248 between Majhaulia and Sugauli railway stations. The route for trains running from Muzaffarpur to Anand Vihar (Delhi) through Narkatiaganj via Paniyahawa has been temporarily diverted to the Chhapra-Gorakhpur section. Special passenger trains from Narakatiaganj to Gorakhpur via Paniyahawa are running as usual, a Samastipur rail division bulletin said on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-to-announce-relief-for-flood-hit-areas-today/articleshow/84184544.cms||Abhay Singh

Both were remanded to police custody for 15 days by a local court on Tuesday. Rajput was nabbed from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh by a team of Detection of Crime Branch (DCB). He had been evading arrest since December 2020. Native of Mahendru village in Jaunpur of UP, Rajput had escaped a few days before the offence under GujCTOC was registered against him. “It was a challenging task to nab Rajput whose family is politically well connected,” said police. Meanwhile, Chauhan was nabbed from Bharuch based on specific information. Rajput operates a gang that is known by his nickname ‘Jhalim’. At least 94 offences are registered against Rajput and his gang members which include murder, extortion, threat, assault to name a few. At the time of registering the offence police had arrested Shivam Rajput, Nilesh Avchite and Jagdish Kantariya while eight others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/gangster-jhalim-arrested-from-varanasi-in-up/articleshow/84181824.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Plot to martyr’s kin hangs fire, Telangana HC fumes||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Monday took the revenue department to task for failing to allot a plot, as promised by the state government 13 years ago, to the widow of an IFS officer who was killed in a terror attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul in July 2008. The court warned the principal secretary of the revenue department that he has to face serious consequences if the plot is not alloted in the next three weeks. The bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy converted a letter written by Vadapalli Malathi Rao, whose husband Venkateswara Rao, an IFS officer, lost his life in a terrorist attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul in July 2008. The state government, in 2008, had promised Malathi that it would allot 475 square yards of land in Jubilee Hills and even issued a GO to this effect. Thirteen years later, the government is yet to allot the promised land. When Malathi wrote a letter to the high court, the court converted it into a petition and sought response from the state. Revenue department counsel C V Bhaskar Reddy informed the court that though a GO was issued, they later found that only 411 square yards land was available in the Bharani layout where the plot was located. The bench said it’s a shame that the state could not fulfil its promise even after 13 years. “Why do you issue GOs when you do not implement them”, the bench fumed. Taking objection to the state counsel saying that they would consider any fresh representation, the bench said you made the widow run from pillar to post for the last 13 years. “Now she will stop requesting you. She will not run around you anymore. Now you do the running. Go to her, request her and hand over her plot,” the bench said. Do not forget that you are dealing with a person whose husband lost his life while in the service of the nation and was posthumously honoured with a Keerthi Chakra, the bench said. “Let your principal secretary file an affidavit as to why this shortfall of a few yards happened. When did this happen? When was the GO given, Why were the authorities sleeping over this issue all these years, file an affidavit by July 27,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/plot-to-martyrs-kin-hangs-fire-hc-fumes/articleshow/84190187.cms||---

Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat will hear the arguments on the plea on July 12. Advocate Pradeep Teotia along with lawyer and Ishrat’s sister Sarwer Jahan is representing her in the case. “She has been shown to be the leading female face of the protest. This is one of our grounds in the bail plea. We are fighting for justice and to prove her innocence to the court as she has been falsely implicated,” said Sarwer. In November last year, the court had denied interim bail to her considering the gravity of the offences including those lodged under UAPA, the stringent anti terror law.

---||Nagpur||Chandrapur: Tadoba queen Maya’s 3 cubs missing||NAGPUR: Three cubs of Maya (T12), which is the most popular tigress of Tadoba and Andhari Tiger Reserve, have gone missing since two months. 40 camera traps placed to track them have failed to throw up any evidence. For tourists, the last sighting of the tigress along with her four cubs was before April 15 after which the park was closed owing to lockdown. Since then the tigress is seen with only one cub. On June 11, last year, TOI had reported about Maya delivering five cubs. One died soon after birth. It is likely they were born in April last making them around 14-15 months now. At this age, they are still dependent on the mother for food. According to official sources, the cubs were last seen by the forest staff in the first week of May. Two male and one female cubs are the ones missing. The lone cub still with Maya is a shy animal according to tourists. The tigress and the cub were sighted by tourists during June 25-31 when the core area opened for tourism. “Either the cubs must have left the territory or must have been killed by another male which wanted to mate with Maya,” said sources. Wildlife Institute of India (WII) tiger scientist Bilal Habib says in a high-tiger density area like Tadoba “cubs disperse early”. “This was the case with other tigresses like Sonam and Chhoti Tara. In April, our team had recorded four cubs during estimation. There are several male tigers in Tadoba which kill cubs for mating rights with females. Maya’s cub Surya from a previous litter was forced out in 2019 when it was less than two years old. Similarly, two tigresses from Kolsa and Tadoba had dispersed to Paoni range of Karhandla. I feel there are less chances that Maya’s three cubs are dead.” This was sweet music to the ears of wildlife lover Nikhil Abhyankar. “Three sub-adult tigers cannot be killed by any male in one go. If one is attacked, there is always a scope for the others to run away. A male wanting to mate may not even attack three tigers at one go. Maya and her cubs have put Tadoba on the global map and a search should be launched to track the cubs, which doesn’t seem to be forthcoming,” he said. TATR field director & conservator of forest Jitendra Ramgaonkar told TOI that the cubs were at a stage when they could kill small preys. “It is difficult to conclude that these cubs must have been killed. They must have moved into non-tourism area and may surface again,” he said. Ramgaonkar says, “Tourists not sighting the cubs or any tigers killing cubs not fathered by them and then have their own progeny by mating with the tigress is common in high tiger density area.” “Maya has been unlucky when it comes to her cubs. Park managers should launch a strong efforts to locate the missing cubs. We should wait for confirmed reports. Tiger population is increasing and more sub-adult tigers are trying to search new territories,” said naturalist Himanshu Bagde. History has not been too kind to Maya as at least 5 of her previous cubs have been killed by other males. This is Maya’s fourth litter since June 2014 and till now she has delivered 12 cubs. The death rumours started after May was seen mating with Mowgli and Rudra in May. End of June, the Queen of Tadoba was also seen with Tala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tadoba-queen-mayas-3-cubs-missing/articleshow/84186767.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat faces Draft Ports Bill challenge||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government recently announced plans to invite global bids to develop a non-major port at Nargol with an initial investment of Rs 3,800 crore. Less than 50km away at Vadhavan in Maharashtra, the central government is working on a plan to develop a major port for an estimated investment of Rs 65,000 crore. Nargol is likely to encounter tough competition from Vadhavan in drawing traffic. Moreover, the plans to develop new ports and to boost port-led development activities could face challenges if the Draft Ports Bill 2021 of the Union ministry of ports, shipping and waterways is implemented in its present form. The draft bill aims to modify the current management model of non-major ports or ports that are run by state maritime regulators. The major ports are run by the central government. “The powers of state maritime boards are likely to get affected as the policy proposes setting up of Maritime State Development Council (MSDC) where any plan for developing a new port is to be cleared,” said a state government official. He said that the council will have ministers of ports and shipping from every state as representatives, with the Union minister of ports being the chairperson. “This issue faced by Nargol and Vadhavan is common in many parts of the country today,” said Anand Sharma, director of Mantrana Maritime Advisory Private Limited. “And the draft bill, if it were to become a reality, will only create more jurisdictional issues.” Sharma went on to say: “The bill asks the states to set up maritime boards for planning infrastructure and mandates them to act independently.” Sharma added: “However, it vests the approval of any infrastructure planned by the state on the council.” The majority of the 27 functions defined for MSDC override the independence of state maritime boards, Sharma said. The council has powers to withdraw, suspend, or cancel port registrations without defining the parameters, he further said. MSDC can also advise maritime boards on concession agreements and areas such as competition and anti-competition. An official with the Union ministry of ports said that MSDC will formulate a national plan for major and non-major ports of India, for both existing and proposed. “There are more than 200 minor ports in the country of which there would be barely 50 that are fully operational,” he said. “We need to revive these ports and chalk out a national plan covering all states.” Tamil Nadu chief minister recently wrote to his counterparts in nine states, including Gujarat, proposing that all coastal states and Union Territories object to the bill as it dilutes the powers vested with the states. Gujarat Maritime Board regulated ports handled 338 million metric tonnes (MMT) of cargo for the year 2020-21 as compared to the total national cargo of 1,247MMT. The state houses the country’s largest commercial port, the largest captive jetty, and is the only state to have three LNG terminals. “Gujarat handles about 31% of the country’s total sea cargo and it is likely to be adversely impacted due to the new policy proposed,” said another state government official. “If there is a central council to decide whether a state can develop a greenfield port or where it can be developed, if an existing port can be expanded or not, then the role of a state maritime regulator is diluted.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-faces-draft-ports-bill-challenge/articleshow/84186824.cms||Maulik Pathak
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Bullocks dead, siblings put yoke on shoulders, plough field to survive||HYDERABAD: With their pair of bullocks dead in an accident and the family not in a position to buy another pair, two brothers in Domeda village in Telangana’s Mulugu district put the yoke around their shoulders to plough their field this monsoon. Their financial condition is such that they have no choice but to take the place of the bullocks. The elder of the two, Narendar Babu, has BSc and BEd degrees and has worked as a teacher for a few years. His younger brother Srinivas, with a masters in social work (MSW), worked as a computer operator in an educational institution in Hyderabad. “But we found it difficult to even make ends meet,” Narendar Babu told TOI. He left his job as a mathematics teacher four years ago and settled in his village because the pay was not good enough . “The last two years have been tougher due to Covid. My brother and I have worked as coolies to get whatever amount we could under the MNREGS,” said Narendar. Srinivas got back to the village as the institution he was working for shut down in the lockdown and he could not find work. Besides not having the money to buy bullocks, hiring a tractor was also not affordable. That is when the brothers decided to take the place of the bullocks and plough the field along with their father. “It was tough but we had no choice,” said Narendar, who is married and has two children. He has applied for a ration card but has not got it so far. Their father, Sammaiah, tried to buy a pair of bullocks with the Rs 60,000 he had saved. But a healthy and young pair of bullocks costs up to Rs 75,000. The family gets ‘Rythu Bandhu’ from the Telangana government but they need a little more to cultivate the land and to grow paddy. Sammaiah said, “I worked hard and got my sons educated. I had hoped that they would get government jobs. But that did not happen. Both my sons returned home as they had no means of livelihood. I have exhausted all my savings. Financially, our family is in a bad situation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bullocks-dead-siblings-put-yoke-on-shoulders-plough-field-to-survive/articleshow/84190191.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Delhi||Delhi: Over 2,000 centres to bring civic services closer home||NEW DELHI: Instead of visiting the zonal headquarters, Delhiites will soon be able to access municipal services near home through 2,166 common service centres (CSCs). Municipal services such as registration of birth and death, property tax filing and e-mutation, health trade and factory licence payment, and community hall booking will be available at these centres. North Delhi Municipal Corporation has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with CSC e-Governance Services India Ltd to open 816 service centres where 15 municipal services will be offered. Similarly, East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) will open 782 centres. South Delhi Municipal Corporation has also signed an agreement to make its services available through 568 centres in all 104 wards. EDMC mayor Shyam Sundar Aggarwal said dozens of services would be accessible at the centres at nominal charges. “We have made it mandatory to put the rate list prominently and if any one is found to be charging extra, a fine of Rs 5,000 will be imposed,” he said, adding that some of the centres were being operationalised and all 782 units would be opened in the next one month. The mayor said the list of the centres would be made available to the area councillors so that local people could easily avail of the benefit of the scheme. Each ward will have approximately 11 centres. EDMC has fixed the service charges for birth and death registration at Rs 10, tehbazari at Rs 30, property tax return at Rs 50, health trade and factory licences at Rs 80, and veterinary, pet and conversion parking licences and e-mutation at Rs 100. The north corporation signed an MoU with CSC e-Governance Services India Limited for common service centres last week. “The CSC scheme is one of the mission-mode projects under Digital India Programme of Government of India. CSC Services Ltd has been set up by the electronics and IT ministry and it provides a centralised collaborative framework for delivery of services to citizens through these centres,” a civic official explained. Mayor Raja Iqbal Singh said, “Delhiites who do not have IT access can avail of multiple municipal services through CSC centres. Now it would be easy for the citizens to get access to municipal services.” Despite being offered online, many municipal services are still availed of by Delhiites through the manual mode, a civic official pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/over-2000-centres-to-bring-civic-services-closer-home/articleshow/84186783.cms||---

They left from Nimaknagar village, the entry point into the Little Rann from Dhrangadhra side, for the temple which is around 35 km inside. When found, Ambaram was unconscious due to extreme heat, humidity and lack of food and water. "We are about 10 km away from the temple but we saw there was water on all sides. As it was not possible to reach, we decided to return. However, the situation turned tricky when our bike had some mechanical problem and did not start. Initially, we tried to push it manually but all three of us got exhausted. We abandoned the bike in the Rann and started walking on foot,'' Ambaram told TOI over phone. Around 1pm, the trio lost the sense of direction due to severe exhaustion and was completely clueless about the route by which they came.“Our hopes started sinking as we did not have water or food. We were hungry and thirsty. We were worried because we knew that no one would come into the Little Rann because of the monsoon. But some people from Rajkot who were also returning back with us had informed villagers at Nimaknagar that we were in trouble,'' he added. Meanwhile, family members of Ambaram and villagers started a search for them and reached Nimaknagar village. "We formed a six-member team to search for them and left with a tractor, food and water at around on Monday night. After an hour, we found the three from different directions. Ambaram was unconscious, so we immediately gave him water and food and assured them that they are now safe,'' Chakubhai Thakore, who led the rescue team, told TOI.When all three were brought to Nimaknagar, doctors checked their health and asked them to rest for two-three days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/three-lose-way-in-little-rann-of-kutch-rescued-in-nick-of-time/articleshow/84181922.cms||---

SSK Idukki district project co-coordinator D Bindumol said 15 such centers have started functioning in Idukki in areas such as Marayoor, Edamalakudy, Adimali and Karimannoor. “Educated members from tribal settlements have been selected as the volunteers of the Ooruvidya Kendram. Tribal students from Class I-XII can come to the centres and attend classes,” said Bindumol. “ In view of the pandemic, the tribespeople, including students, are reluctant to venture out from their villages. The centers are functioning inside the hamlets and no outsiders are involved,” the official added. To facilitate online education, laptops have been distributed among all the volunteers. At a function held at Marayoor on Tuesday, district panchayat president Giji K Philip inaugurated the laptop distribution. SSK project director A P Kuttikrishnan also attended the function. “There are various challenges such as network issues and lack of gadgets among tribal students. We are expecting to resolve the issues by this month,” said Kuttikrishnan. “In areas facing network issues, the volunteers will be able to conduct the classes using the materials already downloaded in their laptops,” said Bindumol. “The basic aim is to avoid the disruption in studies among the tribal children. If they drop out now, it will be difficult resume studies after the pandemic,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tribal-centres-to-check-dropouts/articleshow/84184598.cms||Sandeep Thomas
