Closer home, one such tale unfolded on a beach in Mangaluru, recently. In the torrential rains, a bottle washed ashore in Thanneerbhavi, and was found by Adit Chirag, a teen surfer who is a regular at the beach. “As usual, we were on the beach trying to catch a good wave to surf. While doing so, I noticed something bobbing up and down on the waves. It was soon deposited on the shore and out of curiosity, we took a closer look. That’s when we saw that there was a letter in it. We were so excited and opened it immediately,” says Adit, who, along with his friends who were with him, read the letter. “It was written by a couple in January 2021 and we found it at the end of May. Mangaluru is vast and they threw it into the water at one of the numerous beaches that drape the region,” shares Adit. While the concept of a message in a bottle is said to date back to 310 BC and it was primarily a medium to convey distress or doom, over the years, it has slowly grown to encompass messages of goodwill and hope, too. The Mangaluru tale is a testament of the same. — Madhu Daithota||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/teen-surfer-finds-a-letter-in-a-bottle-at-a-mangaluru-beach/articleshow/84064688.cms||---

He said the retail and wholesale trade sector was left out of the ambit of MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises). "Now under the revised guidelines, retail and wholesale trade will also benefit from priority sector lending under RBI guidelines," the MSME minister added. In a tweet, he said the government is committed to strengthening MSMEs and make them engines of economic growth. The revised guidelines will benefit 2.5 crore retail and wholesale traders. The move would also allow them to register on Udyam portal. Commenting on the development, Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) said, with this decision, traders will be able to avail requisite finances from banks and financial institutions under priority sector lending. Besides, now the traders can avail the benefits of several other government schemes for MSMEs, it said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/government-includes-retail-wholesale-trade-under-msmes/articleshow/84077157.cms||---
---||World||US prosecutors in plea discussions with Capitol rioters linked to Oath Keepers||WASHINGTON: Federal prosecutors are discussing possible plea bargains with members of a group of defendants in the US Capitol storming accused of links with the far-right Oath Keepers movement, a government lawyer told a federal court on Friday. During a hearing on the status of prosecutions stemming from the January 6 attack, federal prosecutor Kathryn Rakoczy said the government had initiated discussions about possible plea deals with at least 12 of 16 defendants connected to the Oath Keepers. The movement is focused on recruiting current and former military, law enforcement and emergency services personnel. Five people died, including a US Capitol Police officer, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol to try to stop the formal certification of Joe Biden as the winner in November's presidential election. The Southern Poverty Law Center identifies the Oath Keepers as "one of the largest radical anti-government groups" in the United States. Three people described as Oath Keeper defendants have already entered guilty pleas to charges related to the Jan. 6 riot and agreed to cooperate with investigators. Rakoczy told Judge Amit Mehta at Friday's hearing that it is likely that additional guilty pleas will be entered in Oath Keeper cases. While most riot defendants accused of Oath Keeper links have been released on bail, at least three remain in pre-trial custody. Lawyers and Judge Mehta indicated that at least some of the pending Oath Keeper cases could ultimately proceed to trial. In a separate federal court hearing in Washington on Friday, a San Antonio man pleaded guilty to a single riot-related misdemeanor charge. Matthew Carl Mazzocco, 37, of San Antonio, Texas, pleaded guilty to a charge of violent conduct on US Capitol grounds. A federal court document describes Mazzocco as a mortgage loan officer for CMG Financial and says he posted pictures of himself on Facebook at the US Capitol with the caption, "The capital is ours!" A sentencing hearing for Mazzocco was set for October 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-prosecutors-in-plea-discussions-with-capitol-rioters-linked-to-oath-keepers/articleshow/84077143.cms||---
---||World||Slovakia sells most Sputnik V vaccine doses back to Russia||PRAGUE: Slovakia has sold most Russian Sputnik V coronavirus vaccines back to the country of origin, the Slovak health ministry said on Friday, as public interest is low after months of government hesitation over using the product that lacks European regulatory approval. Slovakia shipped back 160,000 out of 200,000 doses imported in March, at $9.95 per dose, the same price as the original purchase, a ministry spokeswoman said. Slovakia's adventure with Sputnik was a political fiasco for then-Prime Minister Igor Matovic, who bought the shots without telling his coalition partners and over their opposition. He was forced to resign in a political crisis, though he returned to a reshuffled cabinet as finance minister. Slovakia's drug agency SUKL refused to give a recommendation for using Sputnik V, citing insufficient data from the producer. The government eventually allowed usage of Sputnik V last month for those who prefer it to other, EU-registered vaccines, but public interest was far below the available amount. The health ministry said on Friday 10,500 Slovaks had received their first dose of the vaccine and 8,000 more were on a waiting list for the two-dose product. The government closed registrations on June 30, and said last week it planned to sell or donate the vaccines, which are nearing expiration dates. Matovic had originally planned to buy 2 million doses of the vaccines, at a time when western-made vaccines were slow to arrive in the country badly hit by the pandemic in the winter. Slovakia is only the second EU country after Hungary to use the Russian vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/slovakia-sells-most-sputnik-v-vaccine-doses-back-to-russia/articleshow/84077189.cms||---
---||World||Canada hunts for survivors of fire that destroyed small town||VANCOUVER: Officials on Friday hunted for any missing residents of a British Columbia town destroyed by wildfire as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau offered federal assistance.  The roughly 1,000 residents of Lytton had to abandon their homes with just a few minute's notice Wednesday evening after suffering the previous day under a record high of 121.2 Fahrenheit (49.6 Celsius).  Officials said it was unclear whether anyone remained in the village 95 miles (150 kilometers) northeast of Vancouver due to a lack of cell service and because it wasn't safe to enter most of the area.  "We do know there are some people who are unaccounted for," said Mike Farnworth, the province's public safety minister, though he said the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Red Cross were working to locate people.  In Ottawa, Trudeau pledged that the federal government will "help rebuild and help people come through this."  Trudeau said he had spoken with British Columbia Premier John Horgan and John Haugen, acting chief of the of Lytton First Nation and planned to convene an emergency response group.  Another wildfire threat at Kamloops, 220 miles (355 kilometers) northeast of Vancouver, forced an evacuation of about 200 people Thursday night, but officials said they could return Friday.  Kamloops also recorded a record temperature this week of 117 Fahrenheit, (47.3 Celsius) but it had cooled down to around 90 (32) on Friday.  "I can't imagine what the firefighters are going through working in these conditions," said Noelle Kekula, a fire information officer for the British Columbia Wildfire Service. "We are up for a real battle."  The Wildfire Service said at least 106 fires were burning across the province, including dozens that started within just the past two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/canada-hunts-for-survivors-of-fire-that-destroyed-small-town/articleshow/84077566.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Army man fights off muggers wielding knife, iron rod in cab||BENGALURU: A cabbie who drove an MG Road-bound customer on the deserted Begur Road stretch from Kempegowda International Airport on Thursday night had not bargained for his passenger being an army man well-versed in combat techniques. The Naik successfully managed to repel an attack from the iron rod-wielding cabbie and his knife-brandishing accomplice, police said.  The driver was arrested, while his aide is on the run. Bahaddur Yadav, 26, Naik with the army in Bengaluru, arrived by a Delhi flight and boarded the taxi around 11pm to reach his office quarters near MG Road. The cab driver took Begur Road instead of Ballari Road and told Yadav, “I want to avoid toll sir. Please cooperate.” After driving for about eight kilometres, the driver halted the vehicle, complaining of a sound from the boot. He stepped out and went to the rear. While Yadav sat on the backseat, two men, including the cabbie, suddenly entered the vehicle from the rear doors on both sides. The driver wielded an iron rod, while the stranger whipped out a knife. They grabbed Yadav’s arms, asking him not to shout or resist.  “Though it was pitch dark outside, I saw their position. Using combat techniques I had learnt in the army, I caught hold of the cabbie’s wrist with one hand and the other man’s hand with another. Both men tried to free themselves but my hold remained firm,” Yadav told TOI. Meanwhile, Yadav told the driver and his aide that he was an army man and they will have to pay a price for attacking him. “Then, I saw lights of Hoysala vehicles coming from both directions. The two men ran away, leaving behind their weapons. I told cops everything and soon they traced the driver and arrested him,” recalled Yadav, who sustained minor injuries on his hands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/army-man-fights-off-muggers-wielding-knife-iron-rod-in-cab/articleshow/84077695.cms||Rajiv Kalkod
---||Bengaluru||Register 45 OCI students for CET: HC to KEA||BENGALURU: In a big relief for 45 students holding Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) cards, the high court has passed an interim order directing Karnataka Examinations Authority to register them for CET-2021 as per a notification dated June 14, 2021 and permit them to take the exam. Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum passed this order after hearing petitions filed by Alekhya Ponnekanti and others. “If the petitioners are not registered with KEA, it would be an irreparable loss for them and may even take away all future prospects in their career. Therefore, I am of the view that a direction needs to be issued pending consideration of all these relevant points raised by the rival parties,” the judge observed. Ajoy Kumar Patil, one of the counsel representing the petitioners, told the court there are about 200 institutions and around 55,000 seats would be available only through CET, including institutional seats. Nitin R, the other counsel, brought to the court’s notice that on account of the pandemic, board examinations have been cancelled and, therefore, it is crucial that students intending to pursue technical courses are allowed to appear for CET. Both argued the petitioners have domicile in India and pursued schooling for more than seven years and, therefore, they ought to be treated on a different footing. They contended the notification under challenge bars the petitioners from getting admission to government seats in government/private colleges. They stated the HC had already held Rule 5 of the Karnataka Selection of Candidates for Admission to Government Seats in Professional Educational Institutions Rules, 2006 to the extent it prescribes Indian citizenship needs to be interpreted so as to include OCI card holders within the definition of “Citizen” as contemplated under Section 4 of Citizenship Act, 1955. Appearing for the state government, additional advocate general Dhyan Chinnappa claimed citizenship falls under the central government’s domian and states are bound to follow instructions issued by the Centre. Citing a notification issued by the Centre on March 4, 2021, he argued that even if it was not incorporated in the 2006 rules, it would be relevant and hence, petitioners who fall under OCI category stand excluded and their grievance cannot be considered at this juncture. According to him, even if the March 4, 2021 notification is held to be prospective, it would not be applicable to the petitioners since they are yet to secure admission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-to-kea-register-45-oci-students-for-cet/articleshow/84077711.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka CM’s ambitious 1 lakh housing scheme runs into land hurdle||BENGALURU: Persistent land woes and change in housing policy have forced the government to reduce construction of houses by 20% under the chief minister’s one lakh housing scheme. The 2017 scheme was floated in a new avatar after Yediyurappa took charge in 2019 with an eye to woo urban voters ahead of BBMP polls. Senior government officials told TOI the scheme ran into rough weather after the government decided to change the policy from S (stilt)+14 to G (ground)+3. “Citing that people for whom houses were to be constructed may be ill-equipped financially to cover maintenance of lifts and the building as such, the policy was revised. This has effectively meant that we need more land for the project in a city with none to spare,” said an official. Housing minister V Somanna said the scope of the project has been limited due to non-availability of land. “Our aim is to construct 80,000 houses which we hope to complete by November 2022,” he said, hinting at the government planning to finish the project before the 2023 general elections. According to him, the biggest issue with the project was that the Congress and coalition governments between 2017-2019 took into consideration vacant quarry lands to construct houses. “Now, these lands are unstable for construction and have become a big liability for the state. Hence, we had to look for alternative land,” he said. The housing department was then provided with 515 acres of BDA-recovered properties and is to get an additional 165 acres to build 80,000 houses. The lands which have been identified are in far-flung locations, though within Bengaluru Urban district, adjacent BDA layouts and adjoining Kempegowda Layout and Anekal. 46,000 houses in progressThe scheme will now see 48,000 houses being constructed in the S+14 format and the remaining 30,000 in the G+3 categody. At present, 46,000 houses are under progress and 13,000 will be sanctioned later this month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cms-ambitious-1-lakh-housing-scheme-runs-into-land-hurdle/articleshow/84077747.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

The accused is Arun Kumar of Kundoo village in Honnahalli taluk, Davanagere. One of his victims has filed a complaint with Vidhana Soudha police, claiming the suspect collected money from his friends between January and September 2020 and later turned incommunicado. “Two of my friends — Lakshmappa Chandragiri and Chandrappa — wanted to become sub-inspectors with the excise department. Arun Kumar, secretary with Jnanaganga Education Society in Kundoor village, met us saying he was a member of Karnataka Public Service Commission (KPSC) and had good connections in the government. Arun promised to get my friends the jobs and said it would cost around Rs 70 lakh,” said the complainant HB Jayadeva, a 38-year-old contractor from Davanagere. “Agreeing to Arun’s offer, we transferred Rs 15 lakh to his bank account in January 2020. In June, we transferred another Rs 20 lakh. Arun’s wife Lavanya and brother Hanumantappa told us he could even help my other friends get government jobs. Trusting them, around 10 friends of mine transferred Rs 1.3 crore to Arun’s bank account. Meanwhile, Arun invited us to Bengaluru and met us in a parking lot at MS Building,” the complainant said. In September 2020, Arun called Jayadeva to the city again and demanded Rs 10 lakh more. “We grew suspicious and sought time from him. He showed us an ‘appointment letter’ in his name, saying he was a KPSC member. After some time, he gave us appointment letters in the names of Chandragiri and Chandrappa, saying they got jobs of sub-inspectors, excise department. We realised the letters were fake and Arun had cheated us,” the complaint read.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-job-aspirants-lose-1-6-crore-to-conman/articleshow/84077754.cms||---
---||World||Overseas tourists finally roam free on Thai island of Phuket||PHUKET: Newly arrived overseas tourists on Thailand's island of Phuket were able to roam free without quarantine on Friday for the first time in more than a year, as Thailand launched a special program for vaccinated visitors to the island.  Tourists swam in hotel pools and walked along Phuket's postcard-perfect beaches after receiving a Covid-19 test result within 24 hours of arrival.  "This is the perfect place to just relax and clean our minds, our heads, after a long time," said Sigal Baram, lying by the pool, who was visiting from Israel with her husband and friends. The group was among the first to arrive in the country.  The 'Phuket Sandbox' initiative allows free movement on the island for fully vaccinated tourists, with no quarantine required, although masks are required in most public places.  While five-star hotels and restaurants welcomed back tourists, local street vendors said they were not benefiting from the plan, because tourists frequent mostly large hotels.  "There is no way street vendors will get the money from overseas tourists... it will go to hotels and restaurants instead," said Yupin Papor, a massage therapist who lost her job during the pandemic and became a street vendor selling food on the beach.  Thailand lost about $50 billion in tourism revenue last year when foreign arrivals plunged 83%.  Phuket was hit particularly hard by job losses and business closures.  "I see the shops closed. It's a big difference to me from before," said Omar Alraeesi from the United Arab Emirates, who comes to Phuket every year.  Millions of people visited Phuket every year before the pandemic and the government and tourism industry hope the reopening will help save its battered economy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/overseas-tourists-finally-roam-free-on-thai-island-of-phuket/articleshow/84077994.cms||---
---||World||Explainer: 5 key takeaways from the June jobs report||WASHINGTON: The US job market is storming into summer. Job creation and wages rose sharply in June. And more and more Americans are confident enough to quit their jobs and look for a better one.  In the strongest gain since August, employers added 850,000 jobs last month. And average wages rose a healthy 3.6% from a year earlier, a sign that businesses need workers so badly they're willing to ramp up pay.  The June jobs report did contain one conspicuous blemish: The unemployment rate actually ticked up last month. But many economists wrote that off as a technical blip.  With vaccinations still increasing, the number of new Covid-19 cases has plummeted to an average below 12,000 a day - down dramatically from around 250,000 in early January. The brightening health picture has allowed businesses to increasingly reopen and has encouraged formerly cooped-up consumers to rush out to restaurants, shops and entertainment venues and to book vacation flights.  As employers post job openings at a record pace, they're complaining that they can't find enough workers to fill jobs. Economists expect the supply of workers to gradually catch up with demand. Some Americans are delaying their job search owing to lingering health concerns, difficulty making child care arrangements or generous, though temporary, federal unemployment benefits. Others have decided to retire early or train for new careers.  The economy remains 6.8 million short of the number of jobs it had in February 2020, just before COVID-19 flattened the economy.  "It's only a question of time before hiring catches up with buoyant labor demand," said Lydia Boussour, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. "The economy is set for a jobs boom in the coming months as labor supply constraints gradually dissipate."  Boussour said she foresees job growth exceeding 1 million a month over the summer.  "Let the employment fireworks begin,'' she wrote in a research note.  Here are five takeaways from the June jobs report: Two surveys, two stories The 850,000 jobs that employers added last month were a pleasant surprise. Economists had predicted about 675,000. Yet the unemployment rate ticked up from 5.8% to 5.9%. And the number of people who reported being employed actually dropped by 18,000. What gives? The contradictory numbers reflect the way the Labor Department compiles the monthly jobs report - with two surveys. The two surveys sometimes tell different stories, as they did in June. But the differences tend to even out over time.  One survey asks businesses how many people they employed during the month; this determines the number of jobs gained or lost.  The other survey asks households whether the adults living there have a job. Those who don't have one but are looking count as unemployed; those who aren't looking for work do not. This survey determines the unemployment rate.  The household survey, unlike the survey of businesses, counts farm workers, the self-employed and people who work at start-ups. It also does a better job of counting small-business jobs.  But the survey of businesses uses a larger sample size and is considered more precise: The Labor Department surveys 145,000 companies and government agencies, compared with just 60,000 households.  Economists also suspect that technical factors might have thrown off the household survey in June. Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings, for example, says the drop in employed Americans might be explained by "the challenges of seasonal adjustment after'' huge job losses in the spring of 2020. Moving on A hot labor market, and perhaps a rethinking of personal priorities after COVID-19, has led many Americans to leave their jobs and look for higher-paying or more satisfying work elsewhere. In June, 942,000 people were unemployed because they voluntarily left their old employer. That was up 21% from 778,000 in May, and it's the highest such monthly figure since 2016.  "Workers clearly know that they are in the driver's seat right now, and many appear willing to walk away from their current position before they have even a new job lined up," says Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities.  In an earlier report, the Labor Department had reported that 4 million workers quit their jobs in April. That was the highest such figure on records dating to 2000. Muddled numbers The wild swings in the job market - from an epic collapse in the spring of 2020 as the coronavirus triggered devastating layoffs, to a vigorous rebound over the past year - have created confusion in the way the Labor Department calculates its numbers and adjusts them for seasonal fluctuations.  For example, the department reported a sharp increase last month in jobs in local (up 155,000), state (up 75,000) and private (39,000) education as schools reopened. But those job gains might have been exaggerated, the department conceded, because the bumpy switch from remote to in-person learning has "distorted the normal seasonal buildup and layoff patterns.''  Likewise, Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at the consulting firm Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc., cautions that a surprising and seemingly unhealthy drop in weekly hours worked at private companies likely reflects the difficulty of accounting for people who work from home.  "With most who are able to work remotely still doing so at least part of the time," Shapiro writes, "the reliability of these data are likely compromised to some degree." Higher unemployment for all races The unemployment rate rose 0.1 percentage point last month for Black, Hispanic and white workers alike. The jobless rates are now 5.2% for whites, 7.4% for Hispanics and 9.2% for Black Americans.  Despite steady job growth, lingering damage from the coronavirus recession is still taking a toll on Americans of all races: Nearly 6.5 million whites were unemployed in June, up 2.6 million, or 67%, from February 2020, just before the virus struck. Over the same period, the number of unemployed is up 53% to 1.9 million for African Americans and 65% to 2.2 million for Hispanics. Back to the cubicle As the virus recedes and businesses reopen, Americans are increasingly packing up their laptops, leaving makeshift offices in the kitchen and trudging back to their old places of work.  The Labor Department reported that the proportion of people who are teleworking dropped to 14.4% in June - down from 16.6% in May and a peak of 35.4% in May 2020. (The figures include anyone who worked remotely at any point in the previous four weeks.)  Companies that operate out of downtown office buildings and restaurants that cater to weekday commuters are nervously waiting to see whether - or to what extent - the work-from-home trend sticks once economic life returns to normal after Covid-19. Many companies have already told their employees to expect a hybrid system in which they could work from home on certain days of the week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/explainer-5-key-takeaways-from-the-june-jobs-report/articleshow/84078043.cms||---

Police said Madan aka Madhu, a resident of Lakkasandra, near Wilson Garden, was driving his car near Banashankari temple when he noticed fresh vegetables on the roadside. He stopped his car, got down and purchased some greens. Madan was about to board his vehicle when six persons attacked him with machetes and other sharp weapons. The gang hacked Madan to death before speeding away from the spot in three two-wheelers. Police said that according to eyewitnesses, the incident took place between 11.55am and 12.15pm. Some of the assailants wore helmets, while the others had masks on. Harish Pandey, deputy commissioner of police (south), said four to six persons accosted Madan when he was about to enter the car. According to police sources, Madan, 44, was running a finance business in Lakkasandra and Wilson Garden areas. He was reportedly closely acquainted with the suspects in the murder of Vijay Kumar alias Cable Viji alias Lakkasandra Viji, a notorious rowdysheeter. Viji ran a cable TV business and also allegedly extorted money from local businessmen, including financiers. Suraj C, son of D Chandrappa, the then corporator from Homegowda Nagar ward, was also one of Viji’s victims. So, Suraj and others allegedly hired hitmen, who hacked Viji to death at his cable office in December 2018. Viji’s associates suspected Madan had financially helped Viji’s killers. Police are also investigating if associates of financier Linga alias Lakkasandra Lingaraj, who was hacked to death at his farmhouse near Hassan in December 2020, are involved in Madan’s killing. “We learnt that aides of Viji and Linga suspected Madan financially helped the killers in both the cases. We are investigating the case from a rivalry angle,” a police officer said. Jayanagar police have taken up a case of murder and efforts are on to trace and nab the assailants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/gang-hacks-financier-to-death-under-metro-stn/articleshow/84078077.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Infra projects in Karnataka suffer cost overrun as commodity prices rise||BENGALURU: The government is feeling the impact of steep hike in prices of goods and commodities, with many of its ongoing infrastructure projects seeing huge cost escalations on account of price rise. The departments of public works, water resources and urban development, which take up major infrastructure projects like building roads, bridges and irrigation works, have been affected by the hike in prices of steel, cement, sand and fuel, which have seen a whopping appreciation (between 20 to 30 per cent) in less than one year. While the price of a tonne of steel has gone up from Rs 45,000 to almost Rs 70,000, a bag of cement is costing Rs 80 to Rs 100 more. Price of M-sand has also seen a rise of Rs 100 to Rs 150 per tonne. “It is quite natural for cost of projects to rise when raw material prices go up. The public works department has also been affected. We are yet to work out by what percentage project costs have gone up,” said PWD minister Govid Karjol. A senior official from PWD pegged the cost escalation at 25 to 30 per cent over the original estimates. He, however, said since the government has not taken up any new major infrastructure project in the last one year owing to financial constraints caused by Covid-19, the impact of price rise is considerably less. Meanwhile, the PWD and water resources departments have reportedly approached the finance department seeking more allocations to fund the gap in cost. Contractors have also been aggressively pushing for upward revision of estimates. Lakshman Rao Peshwe, secretary, water resources ministry, said revision of project estimates is a continuous process as prices of goods keep changing. Every project will have a provision for it. “But this time it is conspicuous as prices have risen significantly. Usually, we allow revision of estimates only when projects are 80% complete,” he said. Another senior official from the finance department said the cost escalations will not have much impact on state finances as this loss will be compensated by the additional tax revenue it gets on account of rise in prices of goods and commodities. ISN Prasad, additional chief secretary, finance department, said it was too early to assess the burden of price rise on the state’s treasury. “We may spend a little more on the projects, but we will also be getting a little more tax due to price rise. So, it is very hard to assess,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/infra-projects-suffer-cost-overrun-as-commodity-prices-rise/articleshow/84078117.cms||Anil Gejji

Many senior legislators, including presiding officers, are urging the government to convene the session. Sources said the authorities are examining the possibilities of holding one in July or August. Apart from the receding pandemic, the Centre’s decision to call the monsoon session of parliament from July 19 seems to have nudged the state government to follow suit. “It will be discussed in the cabinet and the chief minister will take the final call,” said law and parliamentary affairs minister Basavaraj Bommai. The Covid-19 technical advisory committee (TAC) opined that the present situation is not a deterrent to holding the session. “The guidelines issued for the previous sessions hold good and a protocol to include mandatory vaccination can be added,” said TAC chairman Dr MK Sudarshan. Basavaraj Horatti, chairman of legislative council, has gone a step further, asking the session be held at Suvarna Vidhana Soudha in Belagavi. “The Belagavi session could not be held after 2018 for multiple reasons. While it is important to resume the practice, the primary need is to call the monsoon session in line with the convention of convening it in June-July,” said Horatti. As a precursor to the session, meetings of 16 standing committees, which were kept on hold due to the Covid-induced lockdown, resumed on Monday. While the committee on public undertakings met on Wednesday to discuss the CAG findings on unproductive expenditure of PSUs, the panel on petitions met on Thursday. The committee on women and child welfare, headed by K Poornima, too met on Thursday and took stock of the measures taken to protect children against Covid-19 and preparedness for the third wave. “It is heartening to see proceedings of the standing committees have been resumed. Keeping with the positive trend, the monsoon session should also be held as early as possible,” said Viswanath Chandrashekhar Mamani, deputy speaker of legislative assembly, However, there is no urgency to call the session in July or August as rules allow six-month gap between two sessions. Since the budget session ended on March 26, the government has time till September end to call another session. Moreover, there are no important bills pending except an amendment to the Karnataka Stamps Act that envisages reduction of stamp duty on registration flats costing below Rs 45 lakh from 5% to 3%. “ Currently, it is important to discuss the impact of pandemic on lives and livelihoods and preparedness for the third wave. Also, issues like agriculture, rain and flood situation should be discussed,” said Mamani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-mulls-monsoon-session-as-covid-wanes/articleshow/84078152.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

A report published by Ariana News — an Afghan news broadcaster — revealed that the Taliban have allegedly issued orders for all men to grow out their beards; banned women from leaving their homes without male guardians (mehram); and announced dowry regulations for women wishing to get married. The claims evoked fears of a return to the orthodox and ultra-conservative Afghanistan of the 1990s, when the Taliban ruled the country with an iron fist, stoning people to death and chopping their hands for offenses and imposed harsh laws on women in violation of their rights enshrined in their country’s Constitution. “In a statement, the Taliban have urged women not to leave their homes without a male relative. They have also urged men to grow their beards and barred barbers from shaving beards of men or having an unapproved haircut,” said Merajuddin, a civil society activist in the Afghan province of Takhar. He claimed that the Taliban have also started insisting on trials without evidence. In addition to the alleged rights violations, members of the Takhar provincial council said that food prices have surged in the areas that have fallen to the Taliban. “People are facing problems there; services are nonexistent, clinics and schools are closed,” Mohammad Azam Afzali, a member of the Takhar’s provincial council, was quoted by Ariana News as saying. Meanwhile, Takhar’s governor Abdullah Qarluq claimed that the Taliban have destroyed several government buildings in districts that have been captured by them. Activists in the province have urged Kabul to launch clearance operations to oust the group from their areas. The Taliban, however, have rejected the claims, terming them a “propaganda” against the group. The Afghan broadcaster’s report comes in the backdrop of multiple reports of the Taliban attacking and taking control of districts in various provinces of the country over the past few weeks. Since the US declared that it would completely withdraw from the country by September 11, the Taliban have made rapid inroads, capturing several districts even in the north, which never remained their stronghold. The UN even warned that the Taliban were laying a siege around big cities, including capital Kabul, to take over. In a speech to Parliament this week, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan regretted that the leverage Pakistan had over the Taliban had been severely reduced by US President Joe Biden’s troops withdrawal announcement, adding that the insurgents believed they had “defeated” the super power and driven it out of their country. He also stressed that the only viable solution to the crisis was a negotiated settlement. The Taliban commitment to negotiations with any entity other than the Americans has always been ambiguous. They regard the government in Kabul as a puppet of the Americans and barely hide their contempt for it. They have never committed to a power-sharing arrangement with the government, much less elections. The Kabul government, on its part, has repeatedly expressed its belief that the Taliban’s true intention is to seize power by force and reinstate the harsh Islamic Emirate of the 1990s.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-imposing-rigid-laws-of-their-past-rule-in-afghanistans-captured-dists/articleshow/84078241.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The airbase had been Washington’s nerve centre in the almost two-decade war on terror against militants in the country. According to Afghan police, at least 32 people, including army soldiers and members of private militias, were killed and many injured in Taliban attacks in Badakhshan and Baghlan provinces in the north on Thursday night. Amid a surge in militant attacks in the country, Kabul had allowed private militias, described as "public uprising forces", to fight on the side of the national army against the insurgents. Quoting police, the Afghan media reported on Friday that the situation in Badakhshan’s Faizabad city and its suburbs was very alarming, and that 28 soldiers and members of the public uprising forces, including its commander, had been killed in attacks on different outposts. Some had been taken hostage by the Taliban. "Faizabad is faced with the threat of falling to the militants if the Taliban attacks are not pushed back," police sources said. In Baghlan, five people, including Mohiuddin Paikan Haidari, the head of the education department of Pul-e-Charkhi prison, and two commanders of public uprising forces were killed in Taliban attacks. The situation is so volatile that General Austin Scott Miller, the commander of American troops in Afghanistan, had recently said recent insurgent territorial gains were concerning and had cautioned the Taliban against attempting to take control of the country by force. "A military takeover is not in the interest of anyone, certainly not for the people of Afghanistan," Miller had said. Miller, who oversees the exit of US troops from Afghanistan, also cautioned that pro-government militias being deployed around the country to help the beleaguered Afghan security forces in containing Taliban advances could plunge the country deeper into civil war. Meanwhile, the Taliban claim to have captured more than 100 of the country’s 419 districts since May 1, when the last remaining US and allied soldiers formally began leaving Afghanistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/fierce-fighting-continues-in-northern-afghanistan/articleshow/84078265.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||World||WHO appoints official to help prevent sexual abuse by staff||GENEVA: The World Health Organization has appointed a new official to address the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse, following revelations that staffers allegedly traded jobs for sex during a deployment to Congo to fight an Ebola outbreak, the UN agency said Friday.  Dr. Gaya Gamhewage, a 20-year WHO veteran, will seek to streamline and improve internal efforts to fight sexual misconduct. The issue has particular implications for an agency whose job is to protect the health of the world's most vulnerable people.  WHO spokeswoman Marcia Poole confirmed the appointment of Gamhewage, who has years of expertise in health emergencies and has voiced her concerns about sexual exploitation and abuse. The appointment took effect Thursday, and she reports to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.  "Dr. Gamhewage will work with the accountability departments to strengthen and speed up their work, but she will not have a role in disciplinary actions," Poole said in an e-mail.  Western diplomats and non-governmental groups have expressed concerns about the way WHO management has responded to news reports that first emerged in October 2020 about sexual abuse involving humanitarian staff in Congo battling an Ebola outbreak that erupted in 2018.  In May, the AP published an investigation documenting that senior WHO management was informed of multiple sex abuse allegations involving at least two of the agency's doctors during the epidemic. Tedros was pictured in a photo on the WHO's website with one of the doctors accused of sexual harassment and misconduct and a senior staffer who received emailed complaints about the alleged abuse. The WHO chief referenced the doctor in a speech that he made to a committee of the WHO's decision-making body.  Shortly after an initial news report emerged about wider abuses in the humanitarian sector in 2020, Tedros appointed an independent commission to investigate the matter. It is expected to issue its findings in August.  He acknowledged earlier this year that the WHO's response to sex abuse allegations had been "slow," and more than 50 countries have asked the agency to be more transparent about how such cases are handled.  Gamhewage, who recently was head of WHO's learning and capacity development, has been outspoken about the issue. In an internal discussion on sex abuse, she said the "impunity with which we have operated is leading to this."  In audio recordings obtained by The Associated Press from a WHO town hall meeting in November, she decried a "culture that allows women to be treated in this way not just by armed militants but also by our own colleagues." That was an apparent reference to armed groups in northeast Congo whose violence hindered the response of WHO and other aid groups against the Ebola outbreak that began in 2018.  "I really want us to be courageous enough to start making changes before this investigation is over, starting with our workplace and going all the way to the field," she said, alluding to the investigation ordered by Tedros in October. "Training is not going to solve this problem."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/who-appoints-official-to-help-prevent-sexual-abuse-by-staff/articleshow/84078287.cms||---

Also known as ‘rifle-women’, their deployment is to primarily check narcotics and weapon smuggling across the LoC by local women. The ‘rifle-women’ were already a part of combat groups in Kupwara district in north Kashmir, deployed in August last year amid reports of narcotics and weapon smuggling by militants with the help of their “women handlers.” Commanding officer of 34 Assam Rifles RS Karakoti told media that ‘rifle-women’ of Assam Rifles have been deployed at mobile vehicle check posts in Ganderbal. “They have been a force multiplier and they have been bridging the gap between forces and local women. We are using them in other operations as we use our riflemen. The ‘rifle-women’ help develop a special relation between the Army and the locals,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/now-rifle-women-to-check-arms-smuggling-in-central-kashmir/articleshow/84078385.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||World||Statues of Queen Victoria, Queen Elizabeth toppled in Canada||WINNIPEG, Canada: Protesters have toppled statues of Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth II in the Canadian city of Winnipeg as anger grows over the discovery of the remains of hundreds of children in unmarked graves at former indigenous schools. A crowd chanted "no pride in genocide" before pulling down the statues of the monarchs. The action took place on Canada Day on Thursday, when traditionally celebrations take place across the country. However, many cities scrapped events this year as the scandal over the indigenous children made Canadians confront their colonial history. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the day would be "a time for reflection". Almost 1,000 unmarked graves have been found at former residential schools in British Columbia and Saskatchewan that were mainly run by the Catholic Church and funded by the government. For 165 years and as recently as 1996, the schools forcibly separated indigenous children from their families, subjecting them to malnourishment and physical and sexual abuse in what the Truth and Reconciliation Commission called "cultural genocide" in 2015. In Winnipeg, a crowd cheered as Queen Victoria's statue fell outside the Manitoba provincial legislature. Protesters, many of whom wore orange clothing, also kicked the toppled statue and danced around it. The pedestal and statue were daubed in red paint hand marks. A nearby statue of Queen Elizabeth was also pulled down. She is Canada's current head of state, while Victoria reigned from 1837 to 1901 when Canada was part of the British Empire. Protests in support of the indigenous children also took place on Thursday in Toronto, Canada's financial hub, while a #CancelCanadaDay march in the capital Ottawa drew thousands in support of victims and survivors of the residential school system. Vigils and rallies were held across other parts of the country. Many participants wore orange clothing, which has become the symbol of the movement. In his Canada Day message, Trudeau said the discoveries of the remains of the children at the former schools "have rightfully pressed us to reflect on our country's historical failures". Injustices still exist for indigenous peoples and many others in Canada, he said. A spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government condemned any defacing of statues of the queen. "Our thoughts are with Canada's indigenous community following these tragic discoveries, and we follow these issues closely and continue to engage with the Government of Canada on indigenous matters," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/statues-of-queen-victoria-queen-elizabeth-toppled-in-canada/articleshow/84078544.cms||---

State news agency RIA, citing a source, said the volume of leaked chlorine was at 800 kilograms (1,764 pounds) and the emergency services were working to prevent the gas from reaching residential areas.  A statement from the regional emergency service advised people in the city of more than 600,000, which is 1,220 km (760 miles) east of Moscow, to avoid low ground where the chlorine gas, which is heavier than air, can accumulate.  Chlorine is a widely used disinfectant and water purification agent, but if inhaled, the gas turns to hydrochloric acid, which can lead to internal burning and drowning through a reactionary release of water in the lungs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/chlorine-leaks-in-russian-city-of-izhevsk-no-casualties-reported/articleshow/84078720.cms||---

"A striking example of hypocrisy and double standards as the US openly aids, provides weapons to (Kurdish militant groups) PKK/YPG that forcibly recruits children," a statement by the foreign ministry said. The Turkish foreign ministry said it was "grotesque" that the list did not mention Kurdish militant groups, which have been fighting an insurgence against Turkey for over 40 years. The US sees the YPG as a key ally in the fight against Islamic State. The United States on Thursday added Turkey to the list, placing a NATO ally for the first time in such a list, in a move that is likely to further complicate the already fraught ties between Ankara and Washington.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/turkey-rejects-us-list-that-implicates-ankara-with-use-of-child-soldiers/articleshow/84078513.cms||---
---||World||Brazil prosecutors to probe claims against Bolsonaro in alleged vaccine graft case||Brasília: Brazilian prosecutors on Friday opened a probe into allegations that President Jair Bolsonaro sat on evidence of corruption in a Covid vaccine deal. The move by the attorney general's office, headed by Bolsonaro allies compelled to act by the nation's high court, added to growing pressure on the far-right leader but seemed unlikely to result in the president's removal from office any time soon. Even if investigators find evidence of wrongdoing, the Supreme Court can only open a case against Bolsonaro with the approval of congress, where he holds sway. The attorney general's office said in a statement Friday it had informed the Federal Supreme Court "of the opening of an investigation into events reported" by three senators who have formally asked for an investigation of the president for malfeasance. The office was compelled to do so after the court turned down its initial request to throw out the senators' bid, which stems from accusations made before a senate commission looking into the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The outbreak has claimed more than 520,000 lives in Brazil -- the second-highest death toll after the United States. The commission was told last week that a deal to purchase the Indian-made Covaxin vaccine was a front to embezzle millions of dollars, that a Bolsonaro ally masterminded the plan and that the president knew all about it, but did nothing. A health ministry official testified that his superiors had exerted "atypical, excessive" pressure on him to approve payment for the deal, which he suspected was over-billed. The official and his brother, a congressman close to Bolsonaro, said they took the matter to the president, but he took no action. This is the evidence that prompted three senators to ask the Supreme Court to investigate Bolsonaro. Attorney General Augusto Aras, whose job it is to decide whether to bring charges or not, is an ally of the president. His deputy, Humberto Jacques de Medeiros, had asked the Supreme Court to reject the senators' request, but this, in turn, was rejected by judge Rosa Weber, who said the attorney general's office could not be "a spectator of the actions of the powers of the republic. Madeiros was thus compelled to file a request to the Supreme Court for authorization to seek information in the case "and the eventual transfer of evidence" collected by other judicial and legislative bodies. If prosecutors find any evidence, they would approach the Supreme Court to open a case against Bolsonaro. But this seemed very unlikely, with Bolsonaro enjoying majority support from a loose alliance of conservative parties that have so far blocked more than 100 impeachment bids brought by opponents. "The acceptance to investigate (the senators' complaint) is a defeat for the president, but I do not see any element that guarantees a guilty finding," political analyst Creomar de Souza, of the consulting firm Dharma, told AFP. The polarizing president has faced growing outrage over his handling of the epidemic, which he is accused of criminally mismanaging. Bolsonaro who himself contracted Covid-19 minimized the virus as a little flu, fought lockdowns, questioned face masks and rejected various offers of vaccines while pushing unproven drugs such as chloroquine and urging Brazilians to get back to work. On Wednesday, opposition lawmakers launched a fresh bid to impeach him amid yet more allegations of vaccine purchase corruption. A document signed by dozens of left-wing political parties, trade unions and civic organizations, as well as a few former allies, was submitted to the chamber of deputies, listing more than 20 accusations against the president, including negligence. Protests have been organized for Saturday to call for Bolsonaro's resignation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/brazil-prosecutors-to-probe-claims-against-bolsonaro-in-alleged-vaccine-graft-case/articleshow/84077675.cms||---

Investigation is in progress. We have not reached any conclusive stage to say who is involved. However, we know Lashkar’s history of using drones to drop weapons, narcotics, ready-made IEDs on this side of the border or de-facto border,” he said. Asked about the spike in ‘encounters’ between security forces and terrorists in the Valley, the DGP replied: “More encounters will take place. Terrorists will be finished. So, operations are being intensified against them.” Referring to the arrest of a terrorist with 5.5 kg of IED in Jammu, Singh said cops had busted a module that was planning to carry out an IED explosion at a crowded place to cause a large number of casualties. “The IED was sent from the terrorist’s LeT handler from Pakistan,” the DGP said. Interacting with the media after the attestation-cum-passing-out parade of the 27th Basic Recruitment Training Course (BRTC) in Kathua district on Friday, Singh said: “Counter-insurgency operations will be speeded up to wipe out terrorism. Efforts are also on to strengthen security arrangements to counter the threat posed by drones, especially in the aftermath of the recent attack on the Indian Air Force base in Jammu.” Describing drones as a major security threat, Singh said that the use of drones by anti-national elements and terrorists to drop weapons and IEDs needs strong counter measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lashkar-maybe-linked-to-attack-on-jammu-iaf-station-says-jk-dgp/articleshow/84079019.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

The UAV, suspected to be a Pakistani surveillance drone, was spotted by alert BSF personnel around 4.30am in Arnia sector. Described as a quadcopter (a drone controlled by four rotors), it was forced to return to the Pakistani side when the BSF troops fired half-a-dozen rounds to bring it down. “Alert BSF personnel fired at a small quadcopter belonging to Pakistan today morning as it was trying to cross the International Border in Arnia sector. Due to the firing, the drone returned immediately,” a BSF spokesperson confirmed. The drone strikes on the Jammu IAF station on June 27, the first of their kind, by terror groups in Pakistan have put security forces in Jammu and Kashmir and its neighbouring states sharing a border with Pakistan on high alert. After the attack, drones were spotted hovering over vital Army installations in different areas of Jammu on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday night as well. The Army has also claimed to have thwarted a drone near its brigade headquarters at Kaluchak and Ratnuchak on Sunday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bsf-fires-at-drone-trying-to-enter-indian-territory-from-pak/articleshow/84079504.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

Several Catholic churches have recently been vandalized or damaged in fires following the discovery of more than 1,100 unmarked graves at the sites of three former residential schools run by the church in British Columbia and Saskatchewan that generations of Indigenous children had been forced to attend .  The nation also saw a series of attacks Thursday- Canada Day-on statues of Queen Victoria, Queen Elizabeth and other historical figures.  Trudeau, himself a Catholic, said he understands the anger many people feel toward the federal government and Catholic church. The government has apologized for the schools and Trudeau has called on Pope Francis, too, to make a formal apology.  ``It's real and it is fully understandable given the shameful history we are all become more aware of,'' he told a news conference.  ``I can't help but think that burning down churches is actually depriving people who are in need of grieving and healing and mourning from places where they can grieve and reflect and look for support.''  On Thursday, statues of Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth on the grounds of the Manitoba legislature were tied with ropes and pulled down by a crowd.  The statue of Queen Victoria was covered in red paint and its base had red handprints on it. On the steps behind the statue were hundreds of tiny shoes, placed there to recognize the children who went to residential schools.  Arlen Dumas, grand chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, was at a separate event at the time but said he was shocked at what happened. ``I personally wouldn't have participated in that,`` he said, though he added, ``Mind you, it has been a very triggering time over the past few weeks.''  ``It's unfortunate that they chose to express themselves the way that they did. But it's actually a symbol of the fact that there is a lot of hurt and that there's a lot of frustration and anger with just how things have happened,`` Dumas said.  Premier Brian Pallister called the vandalism ``a major setback for those who are working toward real reconciliation.'' ``Those who commit acts of violence will be pursued actively in the courts. All leaders in Manitoba must strongly condemn acts of violence and vandalism, and at the same time, we must come together to meaningfully advance reconciliation,`` he said in a statement.  In other incidents on Canada Day, a statue of Queen Victoria in Kitchener, Ontario, was doused in red paint. In Victoria, British Columbia, a statue of Captain James Cook was dismantled and thrown into the harbor. The statue was replaced with a wooden cutout of a red dress- a symbol representing murdered and missing Indigenous women - and its base was smeared with red handprints.  In St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, two prominent buildings and a statue dedicated to the local police force were vandalized with bright red paint.  Earlier this week, a First Nations group in British Columbia said it had used ground-penetrating radar to find 182 human remains in unmarked graves at a site close to a former residential near Cranbrook, 525 miles (845 kilometers) east of Vancouver.  That followed reports of similar massive findings at two other such church-run schools, one of more than 600 unmarked graves in southern Saskatchewan and another of 215 bodies in British Columbia.  Some 150,000 Indigenous children were forced to attend residential schools, which operated for more than 120 years in Canada. More than 60% of the schools were run by the Catholic Church.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/trudeau-denounces-church-burnings-vandalism-in-canada/articleshow/84079513.cms||---

According to the data of the three municipal corporations in the city, 19,366 death certificates were issued in June 2021 compared to 11,642 in the same month last year. The total number of death certificates for April, May and June this year has touched the 58,839 mark. This figure doesn’t include the death certificates issued in the New Delhi Municipal Council and Delhi Cantonment Board areas. Non-institutional deaths reason for time gap in issuances of certificatesThe latest reports from the public health departments show that the north corporation issued 10,715 certificates, south corporation 6,832 and east corporation 1,819 in June this month. Interestingly, officials pointed out, that the gap has widened for the May death registration data with revision of numbers as pending applications for death certificates were approved. The corporations issued 29,232 certificates in May this year as compared to 5,480 in the same month last year. The south corporation issued 10,209 certificates, north corporation 13,586 and east corporation 5,437. April, too, had showed a similar trend with 10,241 certificates being issued this year as against 4,439 in April 2020. Read AlsoDelhi: 30% eateries renew health trade licence, expected to go up noweeling under economic stress following the two lockdowns and Covid-19 restrictions, restaurants in the city seem to be slowly winding up their business.The figure is 2.7 times that of the number of certificates issued in these three months in 2020, i.e 21,561. It is also almost 2.2 times that of the number of certificates issued in the corresponding period in 2019 — 26,975. According to the Delhi government's pre-pandemic annual report on birth and death registration in Delhi, there were 1.45 lakh death registrations in 2019 with the three municipal bodies accounting for 75.53% of the deaths and New Delhi Municipal Council and Delhi Cantonment Board contributing the rest. A senior official said they have never registered such a high number of deaths in a small three- month period and this indicates the devastation the second wave of Covid-19 had wreaked in the city. Officials of the public health department of the corporations said the peak of the Covid wave had arrived in the last part of April and first few weeks of May when the maximum number of Covid protocol funerals took place and the daily Covid funerals crossed the 700-mark. “The revision is due to pending applications being cleared. In case of hospital or institutional deaths, the data of deaths is submitted directly by the healthcare facility and a certificate is automatically generated by the corporation. In the case of non-institutional deaths, there is a larger gap between the date of death, submission of application by the family and final approval,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pandemic-ebbed-in-june-but-deaths-remained-high/articleshow/84079891.cms||Paras Singh

The Libyan navy issued a statement late Thursday condemning "any acts that violate local and international standards and laws" and vowing to hold those responsible to account. The statement added that the Libyan vessel had endangered the lives of migrants during the chase.  On Thursday, the German non-governmental group Sea-Watch released footage filmed from a plane showing the Libyan coast guard chasing at high speed a blue wooden boat with a small engine and at least two dozen people on board.  During the chase, which occurred in international waters in Malta's search and rescue responsibility zone, men in uniform aboard the Libyan vessel could be seen firing at least two times toward the boat, with bullets hitting the water nearby. The Libyan coast guard came close to crashing into the boat several times.  On Friday, EU Commission spokesman Peter Stano deplored the incident as "a cause of concern," adding that the commission had already asked for explanations from the Libyan government.  "We are checking the facts and circumstances behind that event and certainly we will follow this up very closely. And ask for explanations but also to carry out an investigation on what happened," Stano said.  The EU trains equip and support the Libyan coast guard to intercept people trying to cross the Central Mediterranean to Europe. At least 723 people are known to have either died or gone missing taking this route on unseaworthy boats so far this year.  Nearly 15,000 men, women, and children have been intercepted by the Libyan coast guard and returned to Libyan shores from the start of the year up to June 26, a record number.  The Libyan navy also vowed in the statement to "pursue its duties to save lives at sea and safeguard the Libyan coast, according to local and international laws and humanitarian standards."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/libyan-navy-acknowledges-dangerous-chase-of-migrant-boat/articleshow/84080124.cms||---
---||World||In Mexico, transgender politicians make strides||MEXICO CITY: Salma Luevano was arrested for publicly identifying herself as transgender in provincial Mexico in 1985. Now she is set to take office as a member of Congress. It has been a long journey, but one that appears to be breaking through the rigid definitions of gender that long prevailed in Mexico. Luevano is one of two transgender federal legislators elected to the lower house in the country's June 6 elections. Luevano plans to lead a campaign to get gender equality written into the constitution and gain recognition nationwide for same-sex marriage and gender identity. Luevano, a hair stylist who ran on the ticket of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's Morena party, is under no illusions about how hard the task still is. "The fact that I was able to get here doesn't mean they're going to roll out the red carpet for me, and everything is solved," Luevano said in an interview this week. Lopez Obrador himself is socially conservative, and has not pushed gender issues. "What comes next is the struggle to try to convince 500 colleagues, but it is not impossible," Luevano said, referring to the number of seats in the lower house. At the age of 17 in 1985, Luevano was surrounded by dozen of police in the central plaza of the provincial city of Aguascalientes and detained amid shoves and blows, accused of being a threat to public decency and morals. That started Luevano on a three-decade struggle for equality, alongside Maria Clemente Garcia, the other transgender person elected to Congress this year. One of their first efforts will be to get the national statistics institute to perform a census of LGBT people. More than 100 candidates from the LGBT community ran in the June 6 elections, and more than 20 of them were transgender. But on the other hand, 79 people from the LGBT community were murdered in 2020, 43 of them transgender, according to the activist group Letra S. That was a decline of about one-third from 2019, something that may be associated with the coronavirus pandemic. But Mexico still holds second place in the world for murders of gay and transgender people between 2008 and 2020, trailing only Brazil, according to a study by Transgender Europe and the academic journal Liminalis. Same sex marriage is recognized in 20 of Mexico's 32 states and only 13 have laws recognizing self-identified gender. "Society must turn its attention on us because it's not fair that we are getting killed," said Luevano, who identifies as female. Rocio Suarez, a member of the activist group Support Center for Trans Identities, said the two legislators face a hard battle. "There are going to face a lot of inertia, but we trust that their ability to start a dialogue inside Congress will allow them to reach agreements and consensus," said Suarez. "They are our hope."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/in-mexico-transgender-politicians-make-strides/articleshow/84079542.cms||---

DuVal's family has farmed the land for three generations, and this summer, for the first time ever, he and hundreds of others who rely on irrigation from a depleted, federally managed lake aren't getting any water from it at all.  As farmland goes fallow, Native American tribes along the 257-mile (407-kilometer) long river that flows from the lake to the Pacific Ocean watch helplessly as fish that are inextricable from their diet and culture die in droves or fail to spawn in shallow water.  Just a few weeks into summer, a historic drought and its on-the-ground consequences are tearing communities apart in this diverse basin filled with flat vistas of sprawling alfalfa and potato fields, teeming wetlands and steep canyons of old-growth forests.  Competition over the water from the river has always been intense. But this summer there is simply not enough, and the farmers, tribes and wildlife refuges that have long competed for every drop now face a bleak and uncertain future together.  "Everybody depends on the water in the Klamath River for their livelihood. That's the blood that ties us all together. ... They want to have the opportunity to teach their kids to fish for salmon just like I want to have the opportunity to teach my kids how to farm," DuVal said of the downriver Yurok and Karuk tribes. "Nobody's coming out ahead this year. Nobody's winning."  With the decadeslong conflict over water rights reaching a boiling point, those living the nightmare worry the Klamath Basin's unprecedented drought is a harbinger as global warming accelerates.  "For me, for my family, we see this as a direct result of climate change," said Frankie Myers, vice chairman of the Yurok Tribe, which is monitoring a massive fish kill where the river enters the ocean. "The system is crashing, not just for Yurok people ... but for people up and down the Klamath Basin, and it's heartbreaking." Roots of a crisis Twenty years ago, when water feeding the farms was drastically reduced amid another drought, the crisis became a national rallying cry for the political right, and some protesters breached a fence and opened the main irrigation canal in violation of federal orders.  But today, as reality sinks in, many irrigators reject the presence of anti-government activists who have once again set up camp. In the aftermath of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, irrigators who are at risk of losing their farms and in need of federal assistance fear any ties to far-right activism could taint their image.  Some farmers are getting some groundwater from wells, blunting their losses, and a small number who get flows from another river will have severely reduced water for just part of the summer. Everyone is sharing what water they have.  "It's going to be people on the ground, working together, that's going to solve this issue," said DuVal, president of the Klamath Water Users Association. "What can we live with, what can those parties live with, to avoid these train wrecks that seem to be happening all too frequently?"  Meanwhile, toxic algae is blooming in the basin's main lake - vital habitat for endangered suckerfish - a month earlier than normal, and two national wildlife refuges that are a linchpin for migratory birds on the Pacific Flyway are drying out. Environmentalists and farmers are using pumps to combine water from two stagnant wetlands into one deeper to prevent another outbreak of avian botulism like the one that killed 50,000 ducks last summer.  The activity has exposed acres of arid, cracked landscape that likely hasn't been above water for thousands of years.  "There's water allocated that doesn't even exist. This is all unprecedented. Where do you go from here? When do you start having the larger conversation of complete unsustainability?" said Jamie Holt, lead fisheries technician for the Yurok Tribe, who counts dead juvenile chinook salmon every day on the lower Klamath River.  "When I first started this job 23 years ago, extinction was never a part of the conversation," she said of the salmon. "If we have another year like we're seeing now, extinction is what we're talking about."  The extreme drought has exacerbated a water conflict that traces its roots back more than a century.  Beginning in 1906, the federal government reengineered a complex system of lakes, wetlands and rivers in the 10 million-acre (4 million-hectare) Klamath River Basin to create fertile farmland. It built dikes and dams to block and divert rivers, redirecting water away from a natural lake spanning the California-Oregon border.  Evaporation then reduced the lake to one-quarter of its former size and created thousands of arable acres in an area that had been underwater for millennia.  In 1918, the U.S. began granting homesteads on the dried-up parts of Tule Lake. Preference was given to World War I and World War II veterans, and the Klamath Reclamation Project quickly became an agricultural powerhouse. Today, farmers there grow everything from mint to alfalfa to potatoes that go to In 'N Out Burger, Frito-Lay and Kettle Foods.  Water draining off the fields flowed into national wildlife refuges that continue to provide respite each year for tens of thousands of birds. Within the altered ecosystem, the refuges comprise a picturesque wetland oasis nicknamed the Everglades of the West that teems with white pelicans, grebes, herons, bald eagles, blackbirds and terns.  Last year, amid a growing drought, the refuges got little water from the irrigation project. This summer, they will get none. Speaking for the fish While in better water years, the project provided some conservation for birds, it did not do the same for fish - or for the tribes that live along the river.  The farmers draw their water from the 96-square-mile (248-square-kilometer) Upper Klamath Lake, which is also home to suckerfish. The fish are central to the Klamath Tribes' culture and creation stories and were for millennia a critical food source in a harsh landscape.  In 1988, two years after the tribe regained federal recognition, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed two species of suckerfish that spawn in the lake and its tributaries as endangered. The federal government must keep the extremely shallow lake at a minimum depth for spawning in the spring and to keep the fish alive in the fall when toxic algae blooms suck out oxygen.  This year, amid exceptional drought, there was not enough water to ensure those levels and supply irrigators. Even with the irrigation shutoff, the lake's water has fallen below the mandated levels - so low that some suckerfish were unable to reproduce, said Alex Gonyaw, senior fish biologist for the Klamath Tribes.  The youngest suckerfish in the lake are now nearly 30 years old, and the tribe's projections show both species could disappear within the next few decades. It says even when the fish can spawn, the babies die because of low water levels and a lack of oxygen. The tribe is now raising them in captivity and has committed to "speak for the fish" amid the profound water shortage.  "I don't think any of our leaders, when they signed the treaties, thought that we'd wind up in a place like this. We thought we'd have the fish forever," said Don Gentry, Klamath Tribes chairman. "Agriculture should be based on what's sustainable. There's too many people after too little water."  But with the Klamath Tribes enforcing their senior water rights to help suckerfish, there is no extra water for downriver salmon - and now tribes on different parts of the river find themselves jockeying for the precious resource.  The Karuk Tribe last month declared a state of emergency, citing climate change and the worst hydrologic conditions in the Klamath River Basin in modern history. Karuk tribal citizen Aaron Troy Hockaday Sr. used to fish for salmon at a local waterfall with a traditional dip net. But he says he hasn't caught a fish in the river since the mid-1990s.  "I got two grandsons that are 3 and 1 years old. I've got a baby grandson coming this fall. I'm a fourth-generation fisherman, but if we don't save that one fish going up the river today, I won't be able to teach them anything about our fishing," he said. "How can I teach them how to be fishermen if there's no fish?" 'It's like a big, dark cloud' The downstream tribes' problems are compounded by hydroelectric dams, separate from the irrigation project, that block the path of migrating salmon.  In most years, the tribes 200 miles (320 kilometers) to the southwest of the farmers, where the river reaches the Pacific, ask the Bureau of Reclamation to release pulses of extra water from Upper Klamath Lake. The extra flows mitigate outbreaks of a parasitic disease that proliferates when the river is low.  This year, the federal agency refused those requests, citing the drought.  Now, the parasite is killing thousands of juvenile salmon in the lower Klamath River, where the Karuk and Yurok tribes have coexisted with them for millennia. Last month, tribal fish biologists determined 97% of juvenile spring chinook on a critical stretch of the river were infected; recently, 63% of fish caught in research traps near the river's mouth have been dead.  The die-off is devastating for people who believe they were created to safeguard the Klamath River's salmon and who are taught that if the salmon disappear, their tribe is not far behind.  "Everybody's been promised something that just does not exist anymore," said Holt, the Yurok fisheries expert. "We are so engrained within our environment that we do see these changes, and these changes make us change our way of life. Most people in the world don't get to see that direct correlation - climate change means less fish, less food."  Hundreds of miles to the northeast, near the river's source, some of the farmers who are seeing their lives upended by the same drought now say a guarantee of less water - but some water - each year would be better than the parched fields they have now. And there is concern that any problems in the river basin - even ones caused by a drought beyond their control - are blamed on a way of life they also inherited.  "I know turning off the project is easy," said Tricia Hill, a fourth-generation farmer who returned to take over the family farm after working as an environmental lawyer.  "But sometimes the story that gets told ... doesn't represent how progressive we are here and how we do want to make things better for all species. This single-species management is not working for the fish - and it's destroying our community and hurting our wildlife."  DuVal's daughter also dreams of taking over her family's farm someday. But DuVal isn't sure he and his wife, Erika, can hang onto it if things don't change.  "To me it's a like a big, dark cloud that follows me around all the time. It's depressing knowing that we had a good business and that we had a plan on how we're going to grow our farm and to be able to send my daughters to a good college," said DuVal. "And that plan just unravels further and further with every bad water year."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/water-crisis-reaches-boiling-point-on-oregon-california-line/articleshow/84080437.cms||---

With this, the value of total attachments in the case has reached Rs 14,522 crore. The agency has estimated the value of ‘proceeds of crime’ at Rs 16,000 crore. The Sandesara brothers, wanted for siphoning off Rs 16,000 crore of government banks, fled to Nigeria with their family in 2017. The siblings, who have since been declared ‘fugitive economic offenders’ with non-bailable warrants and have two red corner notices issued by Interpol pending against them, have been shuttling beteen countries which they consider to be outside the grasp of India’s agencies. Interpol has also issued red corner notices against two family members of Sandesaras . Before his death, Patel himself was questioned multiple times in connection with financial dealings he, his son Faisal and son-in-law Irfan had with Sandesara brothers. “Eight properties, three vehicles and several bank accounts having total value of Rs 8.8 crore have been attached under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in a case against the Sandesara group,” the ED said. The agency has so far filed a prosecution complaint (chargesheet) and four supplementary chargesheets in the case and arrested four persons. Nitin Sandesara, Chetan Sandesara, Dipti Chetan Sandesara and Hitesh Patel have been declared fugitives by a special PMLA court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-attaches-ahmed-patel-kins-assets/articleshow/84080289.cms||---
---||World||South Africa hits record 24,000 new COVID-19 cases in third wave||JOHANNESBURG: South Africa registered more than 24,000 cases of Covid-19 on Friday, its highest tally of new infections since the pandemic began, as a third wave of the virus spread through a population in which just 5% have been vaccinated. The surge in cases in Africa's most industrialised nation has overwhelmed hospitals, especially in the main city of Johannesburg, and left overworked healthcare personnel struggling to find enough beds for critically ill patients. Bureaucratic failures have worsened the health crisis. The South African Medical Association threatened on Thursday to take the government to court because more than 200 new junior doctors cannot find placements despite desperate staff shortages. South Africa has recorded just over 2 million cases and more than 60,000 deaths during the pandemic, according to government data, while 3.3 million people have been vaccinated out of a population of just under 60 million. President Cyril Ramaphosa last Sunday announced a raft of measures, including suspension of alcohol sales and a halt of indoor dining in restaurants, for two weeks to minimise the impact of the new wave, which scientists say is driven by the highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant first found in India and now circulating widely around the world. The country's low vaccination rate is due to a combination of factors including of bad lack - the government had to destroy 2 million contaminated Johnson & Johnson vaccines - lumbering South African bureaucracy, and rich countries with plentiful vaccine supplies inoculating their citizens first while much of the developing world waits for doses. Ramaphosa has been highly critical of what he called global "vaccine apartheid." He has called on drugmakers and allied Western governments to waive their patent protections to allow emergency local manufacturing of vaccine doses, so far to no avail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/south-africa-hits-record-24000-new-covid-19-cases-in-third-wave/articleshow/84080206.cms||---

The Centre asked states to identify districts where weekly positivity rate is above 10% or bed occupancy is over 60% and impose highest level of restrictions for at least 14 days to break the chain of transmission. "The second wave is not over. Though there is an overall decline in cases, some states are still reporting a high number of cases. We are not safe till the entire nation is safe. There is a need to contain the virus locally in districts where positivity is high," NITI Aayog member, health, Dr V K Paul said. While the overall weekly positivity has dropped to 3.1%, 71 districts still have positivity rate over 10%. The Centre has deputed teams to Kerala, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Manipur that are reporting a high number of Covid-19 cases. The teams — consisting of clinician and public health experts — will assess the situation and suggest remedial actions. The government stressed that states need to implement containment measures along with ramping up vaccination and following Covid-appropriate behaviour even as economic activities are opening up with an overall decline in new cases. Paul also highlighted that many countries where cases had declined are now again witnessing a surge. The overall incidence of Covid-19 has declined significantly. During June 26-July 2, the average daily cases were at 46,258, 13% less against last week (June 19-25). Only 100 districts now reporting more than 100 cases per day, official data shows. On Thursday, 46,617 new cases were recorded from across the country, whereas the active caseload has come down to nearly 5 lakh cases. Fifty six cases of Delta Plus variant (AY.1) have been detected in 12 states till June 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-centre-sends-teams-to-6-states-with-high-caseloads/articleshow/84080683.cms||Sushmi Dey

He tendered his resignation to governor Baby Rani Maurya at the Raj Bhavan in Dehradun. TOI had, earlier in the week, reported about the likelihood of yet another change of guard in the state. The reason given for Rawat’s resignation was that it was being done to avert a "constitutional crisis". Rawat, who is Lok Sabha MP from Pauri Garhwal, needed to win an assembly seat by September 10, but with the Election Commission not likely to conduct a bypoll in the state, it left him with no other option but to tender his resignation, highly placed sources told TOI. The decision followed hectic parleys throughout the week with Rawat meeting senior party leaders including BJP chief JP Nadda and home minister Amit Shah in Delhi after being urgently summoned there on Wednesday. He was scheduled to return on Thursday evening but was asked to stay back. Rawat met Nadda again on Friday morning.

Whatever the Centre decides, we will move ahead in that direction. We will follow the strategy decided by the Centre.” Soon after returning from Delhi on Friday evening, the CM addressed a press conference at the state secretariat in Dehradun. It was expected that he would announce his resignation there but instead he listed out the achievements of his government and announced that over 22,000 new recruitments would be done in over 21 government departments over the next six months.

He and three others were detained on Friday in the northwestern state of Falcon.  Tarazona and three others were detained after reporting Friday morning to the state's prosecutor that their team had been harassed by intelligence service officials and unidentified armed men had been waiting for him at the door of his hotel, the organization said on its Twitter account.  "We demand that the integrity and life of these four people be respected, as well as the integrity and life of FundaRedes activists and volunteers," said Clara Ramirez, FundaRedes' documentation and human rights coordinator  "It is alarming that the Venezuelan state maintains a policy of intimidation, threat and harassment against human rights defenders," she said.  FundaRedes has been the most active entity documenting and denouncing abuses by Colombian armed groups in border areas and their illegal trafficking and mining activities.  The group was the first organization in March to denounce fighting between the Venezuelan military and dissident groups of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia guerrillas, which departed from peace accords signed in 2016, in remote parts of the Apure state on the border with Colombia.  The group also denounced extrajudicial executions of civilians at the hands of Venezuelan police forces and the displacement of hundreds of inhabitants of Apure in search of refuge in Colombian territory.  This week Tarazona was at the headquarters of the prosecutor's office in Caracas, to request that the alleged links between government officials and irregular armed be investigated.  Venezuela's information ministry and prosecutor's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/venezuelan-police-detain-head-of-human-rights-group/articleshow/84081078.cms||---

The batch of bulk drug substance - which has not yet been put into vials - can make up to 15 million doses of J&J's vaccine, according to a source familiar with the matter. The FDA has now authorized a total of four batches of the vaccine manufactured at the Emergent facility. "While the FDA is not yet ready to include the Emergent BioSolutions plant ... as an authorized manufacturing facility, the agency continues to work through issues there with Janssen and Emergent BioSolutions management," the agency said in a statement, referring to J&J's pharmaceuticals unit. Production of J&J's vaccine at the Baltimore site was halted by US authorities in April following the discovery that ingredients from AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine, also being produced at the plant at the time, contaminated a batch of J&J's vaccine. An FDA inspection of the plant also turned up a long list of sanitary problems and bad manufacturing practices. "As Covid-19 continues to impact countries and cause untold suffering worldwide, we remain committed to producing safe, high-quality vaccines," J&J said in a statement.

---||World||Maxwell lawyers: Cosby ruling reason to toss sex abuse case||NEW YORK: Lawyers for British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell are arguing a court decision that freed Bill Cosby from prison backs up tossing out her sex trafficking case. In court papers filed on Friday, the lawyers said the former girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein is in a similar situation as Cosby because both were covered by non-prosecution deals at the time they were charged in sex abuse cases. Cosby was convicted in 2018 on charges of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand in 2004 when she was a Temple University employee. He was released earlier this week after Pennsylvania's highest court found prosecutors violated his rights by reneging on an apparent promise not to charge him. The same principle applies to Maxwell's case because she was covered by a non-prosecution agreement Epstein signed with federal prosecutors in Florida in the late 2000s, her lawyers said. It's the latest among numerous approaches _ so far unsuccessful _ that the lawyers have taken to try to nullify charges alleging Maxwell recruited teenage girls from 1994 to 2004 for Epstein to sexually abuse. She has pleaded not guilty. A spokesperson for the US attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment on Friday. Maxwell is set to go on trial later this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/maxwell-lawyers-cosby-ruling-reason-to-toss-sex-abuse-case/articleshow/84081105.cms||---
---||World||New US LGBTQ-rights envoy sees reasons for hope and worry||NEW YORK: Jessica Stern, soon to become the State Department's special diplomatic envoy for LGBTQ rights, sees a mix of promising news and worrisome developments almost everywhere she looks, both at home and abroad.  In the United States, Stern's admiration for President Joe Biden's moves supporting LGBTQ rights is offset by her dismay at other developments. These include persisting violence against transgender women of color and a wave of legislation in Republican-governed states seeking to limit sports participation and medical options for trans youth.  "I don't think there's a country or region that's all good or all bad," she told The Associated Press on Friday. "When you look around the world, you see progress and danger simultaneously."  Stern, whose new post was announced by Biden last week, has served since 2012 as executive director of New York-based OutRight Action International, which works globally to prevent abuses of LGBTQ people and strengthen their civil rights. She expects to start the State Department job in September.  From her vantage point at OutRight, she's been monitoring far-flung threats to LGBTQ people: recent mass arrests in African countries such as Ghana and Uganda, three killings within a week in Guatemala, and legislation in Hungary that has been assailed by many European leaders and human rights activists as denigrating LGBTQ people.  Stern is also worried that LGBTQ people in Myanmar are suffering disproportionately amid the military's violent suppression of demonstrators and opposition groups.  Regarding the United States, she said, LGBTQ developments this year have reflected deep-seated contradictions.  She hailed Biden for moving to bolster transgender rights, including lifting a Trump administration ban that blocked trans people from joining the military. And she welcomed the ground-breaking appointments of LGBTQ people to important administration posts -- including Pete Buttigieg, who is gay, as transportation secretary, and Dr. Rachel Levine, who is transgender, as assistant secretary of health.  "At the same time, the work in the U.S. for the safety and security of transgender Americans is far from complete," said Stern. She urged Congress to pass the Equality Act, a bill that would extend federal civil rights protections to LGBTQ people. The bill is stalled in the Senate for lack of Republican support.  "There's no country that has gotten this right," she said. "We all have work to do to ensure we are free from discrimination and violence. ... We're all in this together."  She does see reasons for optimism, even in Africa, where South Africa is the only one of 54 nations to have legalized same-sex marriage.  In Nigeria, for example, she said a recent poll showed 25% of the public opposes discrimination against LGBTQ people -- a substantial increase from a few years ago,  "There's no doubt it's a slower journey for LGBTQI rights in any place where conservative religions play a dominant role, but progress is happening," she said.  "Every day I get an email from a new organization -- maybe starting a film festival or an arts festival," she said. "As long as LGBTQI civil society is strong, it's only a matter of time before we see a change in attitudes and even in law and policy."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/new-us-lgbtq-rights-envoy-sees-reasons-for-hope-and-worry/articleshow/84081516.cms||---

We will decide on it soon.” Gehlot’s upfront view appears an attempt to pre-empt criticism from regional parties, states and the opposition which have been lashing out at the Centre ever since the Supreme Court on May 5 upheld the 102nd Constitutional amendment but stated that it empowered the Centre (the President), based on the recommendation of the National Commission for Backward Classes, to determine which communities can be included in the state list of OBCs. Till the SC judgement, the state list of OBCs had been an exclusive domain of the states. The 102nd amendment was enacted to grant constitutional status to the NCBC in 2018. But the formulation of the bill came under serious scrutiny during the debate in Parliament from OBC leaders belonging to the opposition and regional parties, who warned the government that it will overturn the existing system of identifying the Mandal castes and concentrate the powers in the NCBC and the union government. The Centre insisted there is no change in the states' powers to draw up their OBC lists. As reported by TOI, the critics were not optimistic of the appeal route given the negative history of the challenges to the Supreme Court judgements, and had started lobbying the government for an amendment to the 102nd amendment. The changed order of things, post-SC judgement, has strong political implications. Given that the NCBC is a central body packed with political appointees, there are strong fears that the ruling may end up dictating the OBC lists in states besides the central OBC list. Gehlot told TOI, “We feel that the central OBC list should be decided by the Centre and the state lists should be determined by the states. We feel that the old system should stay. We don’t want to snatch away the powers of states or weaken them.” Asked that the opposition was criticising the BJP government for ignoring its warnings in Parliament, Gehlot claimed that “we kept the old law, we made no change in it”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/as-102nd-amendment-blows-up-in-its-face-govt-plans-to-amend-amendment-to-restore-states-power-to-identify-obcs/articleshow/84081567.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

Underlining the efficacy of vaccines delivered in India, the government said among those without vaccination, around three per 1,000 people died due to Covid-19, whereas the incidence of death was 0.25 per 1,000 among those who received just one dose and 0.05 per 1,000 in those who got both doses. “This shows that the chance of serious disease or deaths are almost eliminated by vaccination. There should be no doubt that vaccines used in the country are safe and effective,” NITI Aayog member-health Dr V K Paul said. He added the government is making efforts to ramp up vaccination and reach the remotest areas to ensure maximum coverage. The government, however, emphasised on the need to maintain Covid-appropriate behaviour.

---||World||UN: Over 400,000 people in Ethiopia's Tigray face famine now||UNITED NATIONS - The United Nations said Friday that more than 400,000 people in Ethiopia's crisis-wracked Tigray region are now facing the worst global famine in decades and 1.8 million are on the brink and warned that despite the government's unilateral cease-fire there is serious potential for fighting in western Tigray.  The dire U.N. reports to the first open meeting of the UN Security Council since the conflict in Tigray began last November and painted a devastating picture of a region where humanitarian access is extremely restricted, 5.2 million people need aid, and Tigray forces that returned to their capital Mekele after the government's June 28 cease-fire and exit from the region have not agreed to the halt to hostilities.  UN political chief Rosemary DiCarlo urged the Tigray Defense Force "to endorse the cease-fire immediately and completely," stressing that the UN's immediate concern is to get desperately needed aid to the region.  Acting UN. humanitarian chief Ramesh Rajasingham said the situation in Tigray "has worsened dramatically" in the last 2 ½ weeks, citing "an alarming rise in food insecurity and hunger due to conflict" with the number of people crossing the threshold to famine increasing to 400,000 and with 1.8 million a step away and some suggesting "the numbers are even higher."  "The lives of many of these people depend on our ability to reach them with food, medicine, nutrition supplies and other humanitarian assistance," he said. "And we need to reach them now. Not next week. Now."  The largely agricultural Tigray region of about 6 million people already had a food security problem amid a locust outbreak when Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on November 4 announced fighting between his forces and those of the defiant regional government. Tigray leaders dominated Ethiopia for almost three decades but were sidelined after Abiy introduced reforms that won him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019.  No one knows how many thousands of civilians or combatants have been killed. DiCarlo said an estimated 1.7 million people have been displaced from their homes, and more than 60,000 have fled into neighboring Sudan. Though Abiy declared victory in late November, Ethiopia's military kept up the offensive with allied fighters from neighboring Eritrea, a bitter enemy of the now-fugitive officials who once led Tigray, and from the Amhara region adjacent to Tigray.  In a stunning turn earlier this week, Ethiopia declared a unilateral cease-fire on humanitarian grounds while retreating from advancing Tigray forces. But the government faces growing international pressure as it continues to cut off the region from the rest of the world.  DiCarlo said reports indicate that leaders of Tigray's previous regional administration including its former president have returned to the regional capital Mekele, which has no electrical power or internet. "Key infrastructure has been destroyed, and there are no flights entering or leaving the area," she said.  Elsewhere in Tigray, DiCarlo said, Eritrean forces, who have been accused by witnesses of some of the worst atrocities in the war, have "withdrawn to areas adjacent to the border" with Eritrea.  Amhara forces remain in western Tigray, and DiCarlo said the Amhara branch of the ruling Prosperity Party warned in a statement on June 29 that the region's forces will remain in territory it seized in the west during the conflict.  "In short, there is potential for more confrontations and a swift deterioration in the security situation, which is extremely concerning," she warned.  Rajasingham, the acting humanitarian chief, told the council that "what we are seeing in Tigray is a protection crisis," citing civilian killings during the conflict, and more than 1,200 cases of serious sexual and gender-based violence reported, "with more continuing to emerge."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/un-over-400000-people-in-ethiopias-tigray-face-famine-now/articleshow/84082082.cms||---
---||World||US to hold Belarus accountable amid report of border closure, says senior official||WASHINGTON: The US government is aware of reports that Belarus has closed its border with neighboring Ukraine, a senior administration official said on Friday, vowing that Washington would continue to hold the government of President Alexander Lukashenko accountable for its actions. "It appears the Lukashenko regime is once again seeking to deflect attention away from its campaign of repression against its people," the official said. "We will continue to stand with the Belarusan people and hold the regime accountable." Lukashenko on Friday ordered the full closure of the country's border with Ukraine, seeking to block what he called an inflow of weapons to coup-plotters detected by his security services, according to the BelTA state news agency. Washington this week banned ticket sales for air travel to and from Belarus, acting after Minsk forced a Ryanair flight to land and arrested a dissident journalist aboard. It was not immediately clear what further actions might be taken in response to Lukashenko's harsh crackdown against months of pro-democracy protests over his alleged rigging of an August 2020 election. The longtime ruler denies election fraud.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-to-hold-belarus-accountable-amid-report-of-border-closure-says-senior-official/articleshow/84081813.cms||---
---||World||Liberty: Lots of travelers expected on freer Fourth of July||NEWARK: Americans enjoying newfound liberty are expected to travel and gather for cookouts, fireworks, concerts and beach outings over the Fourth of July weekend in numbers not seen since pre-pandemic days.  Yet lingering restrictions, worker shortages and significant numbers of unvaccinated people mean some may not be as free as they would like to be.  And there are fears that the mixing of large numbers of vaccinated and unvaccinated Americans at a time when the highly contagious delta variant is spreading rapidly could undo some of the progress made against the scourge.  Nashville is expecting as many as 400,000 people to stream into the city for its July Fourth celebration featuring country star Brad Paisley. In Massachusetts, the Boston Pops' Independence Day concert is back, but the show that usually draws hundreds of thousands to the Charles River esplanade in Boston will be held 100 miles away at the Tanglewood music center.  Beaches and lakefronts are expected to be packed as well. In Southern California, Huntington Beach is planning one of the biggest celebrations on the West Coast, a three-day festival that could bring in a half-million people.  Elizabeth Driscoll plans to enjoy the festivities in Cheboygan, Michigan, including a parade down Main Street, a trip to a farmers market and a family party on a lake, all ahead of the fireworks display over the Straits of Mackinac. Last year, the parade and fireworks were canceled.  "You can feel it all over town, just an influx of people on the tourism side, and people who live here are out and about," she said. "There's good energy."  At the same time, airlines have been struggling to get enough crew members to fly their planes. Pools and beaches have been hit with a shortage of lifeguards. And restaurants and bars in tourist destinations have had to scale back hours because of a lack of help.  President Joe Biden has welcomed the holiday as a historic moment in the nation's recovery from a crisis that has killed over 600,000 Americans and led to months of restrictions that are now almost gone. He plans to host more than 1,000 people at the White House - first responders, essential workers and troops - for a cookout and fireworks to mark what the administration is calling a "summer of freedom."  "I'm going to celebrate it," Biden said Friday ahead of the holiday. "There's great things happening. ... All across America, people are going to ballgames, doing good things." But he also warned that "lives will be lost" because of people who didn't get vaccinated.  The US is averaging about 12,000 new cases and 250 deaths a day thanks to vaccines that have been administered to two-thirds of the nation's adults. But that is short of the goal of 70% by July 4 that Biden set. Vaccine hesitancy remains stubborn, especially in the Deep South and West, allowing the delta variant to spread throughout the country.  AAA forecasts that more than 47 million people will travel by car or plane this weekend in the US, a return to 2019 levels and 40% higher than last year. That includes 3.5 million airline passengers.  At the Newark, New Jersey, airport, travelers waited in long check-in lines Wednesday and encountered flight delays that tested their patience. Some were just happy to get on a plane after vacation plans were disrupted last year by Covid-19 restrictions.  Rhetta Williams, a 54-year-old manager at a pharmaceutical company, was traveling to Charleston, South Carolina, for a family reunion with about 50 relatives that was postponed a year ago because of the virus.  "And we're not going to be practicing any social distancing," she said, laughing.  Zach Carothers, a 21-year-old computer science student, flew from South Carolina to Newark for a weekend at the Jersey Shore, where people have been flocking back.  "It's nice to get back to it after quarantining for so long," Carothers said, adding that he is looking forward to a vacation that will "definitely have celebratory beers."  While masks have been shed around the country even in indoor spaces, the Transportation Security Administration emphasizes that they are still required at airports and on planes - a restriction not everyone is accepting gracefully. Airlines are reporting increasing cases of disruptive passengers refusing to wear masks.  Fireworks are likely to draw some of the biggest crowds many communities have seen in months.  "Outdoor stuff remains, I think, pretty safe for unvaccinated or vaccinated people," said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University's School of Public Health. "Probably a packed outdoor concert is not ideal, but short of that, outdoor activity is safe for people. Watching fireworks is fine."  Moving the party indoors is considered less safe, at a time when some states have less than half their population fully vaccinated.  "I'm concerned about most of the country," said Dr. Lynn Goldman, dean of George Washington University's school of public health. "I think it's premature to declare it over, especially because of what we see in other parts of the world."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/liberty-lots-of-travelers-expected-on-freer-fourth-of-july/articleshow/84082194.cms||---

Even minor girls were not spared. They have been brutally assaulted sexually. Properties were damaged and a number of people were forced to leave their homes and migrate to neighbouring states.” “We may make it clear here that we are not making the interim report public as the matter is still being investigated,” the HC said, repeating that “only an interim report” had been filed. “Before passing any final order, due opportunity shall be granted to all parties to place their cases,” the HC added. The court also asked for a second autopsy on Bhartiya Mazdoor Trade Union Council office-bearer Abhijit Sarkar’s body at the Command Hospital and asked south suburban division deputy commissioner of police Rashid Munir Khan why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against him for the June 29 incident in which an NHRC member claimed he was heckled and threatened in Jadavpur. “The state has not been able to create an atmosphere” to give “confidence to sufferers” to return home, the HC said. “Most complaints were not recorded by police or cross-cases were forced against them. Complaints were registered only after this court took cognisance of the matter in some cases of heinous crimes. Investigation was (done) in slip-shod manner and hardly any arrest was made. Some cases have not been registered and, in most cases, the accused have been bailed out,” the court observed, adding: “The state was found on a wrong foot throughout... in denial mode.” The five-judge bench, comprising acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justices IP Mukerji, Harish Tandon, Soumen Sen and Subrata Talukdar, also told the state government to provide free ration to the victims if they had lost their ration cards. The bench will hear the matter again on July 13. The court said the NHRC’s interim report mentioned a “surprising fact” — The state claimed there was no complaint but there was a flood of complaints when an opportunity was given to victims. “People are afraid to even disclose their identity. It shows there is more to conceal than to reveal,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/calcutta-high-court-slams-bengal-on-post-poll-violence/articleshow/84082222.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||World||China bill delayed in US House amid partisan wrangling||WASHINGTON: The US House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee will resume work later this month on Democratic-led legislation intended to boost competitiveness with China and push Beijing on human rights, after two days of debate on the measure. A spokesman said on Friday the panel would consider its consideration of the Ensuring American Global Leadership and Engagement Act, or Eagle Act, on July 12 after marathon discussion of the measure on Wednesday and Thursday, but no vote. The desire for a hard line in dealings with China is one of the few truly bipartisan sentiments in the deeply divided US Congress, which is narrowly controlled by President Joe Biden's fellow Democrats. However, the two parties disagree on how best to deal with Beijing. While the Senate passed sweeping legislation with bipartisan support in early June, the full House has yet to finalize or vote on a comprehensive bill. During the marathon discussion of the Eagle Act, which ended well after midnight on Wednesday and then stretched into Thursday evening, members of the Foreign Affairs panel offered about 100 amendments to the legislation, which was written by the committee's Democratic chairman, Representative Gregory Meeks. Among other things, committee Republicans - who said before the meeting they would not support the bill - objected to provisions authorizing funding for climate initiatives. They also said it was too much of a "messaging bill," focused more on ordering reports than changing policy, a criticism Democrats dispute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/china-bill-delayed-in-us-house-amid-partisan-wrangling/articleshow/84082080.cms||---

"No," Biden said when asked by White House reporters if the withdrawal completion was days away, Voice of America (VOA) reported. "We're on track exactly as we expect it to be. I wanted to make sure there was enough 'running room' that we wouldn't be able to do it all till September," he added, referencing the September 11 deadline he gave for the withdrawal's completion. Biden has set a deadline of September 11 for the final pullout of the few remaining troops. Earlier, a US defence official confirmed that all US and international coalition forces had left Bagram Airfield, the main American base in Afghanistan and that the base had been turned over to the Afghan National Security Forces. Citing the media reports, VOA reported that the withdrawal from Afghanistan could be completed by the US Independence Day on Sunday. On Thursday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with Afghan Minister of Defense Bismillah Khan Mohammadi, saying the United States was invested in the "security and stability of Afghanistan" as the withdrawal neared its completion, CNN reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-exit-from-afghanistan-wont-be-finished-in-next-few-days-says-biden/articleshow/84082488.cms||---
---||India||26% of schoolkids in English medium; nearly 60% in Delhi||More than a quarter of all schoolchildren in India now study in English-medium schools though Hindi remains by far the biggest medium of instruction, accounting for over 42% of total enrolment. Among the states that have more kids in English medium than in vernacular are Punjab, Haryana and Delhi, besides most of the southern states and several smaller states and Union territories. This was revealed in the latest UDISE (Unified District Information System for Education) report for 2019-20 which covers about 26.5 crore children from primary to senior secondary level in over 15 lakh schools. Anecdotal evidence suggests that in many so-called English-medium schools, instruction is often imparted in the local language, but the rise in enrolment in such schools nevertheless indicates an aspirational urge. The biggest increase in the proportion of children choosing English medium has been in Haryana, a jump of over 23 percentage points, compared to 27.6% of students in 2014-15. Telangana followed, with a jump of 21.7 percentage points putting 73.8% of students in English medium. Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have the smallest proportion of students studying in the vernacular medium, Telugu. Telangana has less than a quarter studying in Telugu medium, while in Andhra, it is less than a third. Enrolment in Malayalam medium too is eroding quickly, down to barely 35% from 46% in 2014-15. While only Telangana and Kerala among the larger states had more than half the enrolled students in English medium schools in 2014-15, since then, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh too have joined the club. In the last five years, English raced to overtake Tamil as the preferred medium of instruction in Tamil Nadu: from 42.6%, the proportion of students jumped to 57.6%. Karnataka remains the only southern state where vernacular medium schools have more students (53.5%), than English medium ones, though the share of English has jumped by almost 20 percentage points. Delhi, Haryana and Punjab are the only states in the north where the vernacular medium has been overtaken by English. While Delhi might have a higher proportion of students in English medium, almost 60%, the increase in share of English medium in Delhi over the five years before the current report was a modest 7.6 percentage points compared to the huge jump witnessed in Haryana. In Punjab, the share of English went up from 37.6% to 51%. Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand are two other Hindi belt states that are seeing considerable growth in proportion of students in English medium. Though there is a steady increase in the proportion of students opting for English as the medium of instruction in all states, the increase is very small in most Hindi belt states. However, the smallest proportion of students studying in English medium is in West Bengal, just 5.3%, compared to 89.8% in Bengali medium. This, combined with the high proportion of students in Bengali medium in Tripura (80%), makes Bengali the third largest language of instruction in India (6.7%), followed by Marathi (5.6%). Odisha (9.5%) and Bihar (10%) are the two other states with the smallest proportion of students in English medium. The proportion of English-medium schools is highest, more than 53%, among larger schools which are from Class 1 to Class 10 or 12, senior secondary or higher secondary schools. It’s share is among the lowest (12.3%) in primary schools (Class 1-5) as most state governments continue to emphasise the need to start children off in their mother tongue. English-medium schools are a small proportion (just 4.7%) in the category of very small schools which have just upper primary classes (6-8) or just 11% in schools with just senior secondary classes (9 & 10 only).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/26-of-schoolkids-in-english-medium-nearly-60-in-delhi/articleshow/84082483.cms||Rema Nagarajan

Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) group, disappeared from Nigeria after skipping bail in 2017. He appeared on Tuesday, handcuffed and hooded, at a court in Abuja, flanked by security agents. Nigerian authorities said he had been captured abroad and brought back to face charges, but refused to say where he had been caught. On Friday, Kanu's lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, said Kanu was abducted by Kenya's special police force and held for eight days before being turned over to Nigerian authorities. "He was tortured and subjected to all forms of inhuman treatment which worsened his health condition," Ejiofor said in a statement. Wilfred Machage, Kenya's high commissioner to Nigeria, emphatically denied his country's involvement in Kanu's arrest. In a statement posted on Twitter, he called any such charge "fictional, imaginary and deliberately concocted to fuel antagonistic feelings among certain sections of the Nigerian people." IPOB's 1967 campaign for an independent nation in southeastern Nigeria, called the Republic of Biafra, triggered a three-year civil war in which more than a million people died, mostly from starvation. Kanu is facing 11 charges including treason, terrorism and illegal possession of firearms. His case is due to resume in court on July 26-27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/lawyer-for-biafran-separatist-alleges-abuse-kenya-denies-involvement/articleshow/84082545.cms||---
---||Business||After consumer protection, govt to ready e-commerce policy||NEW DELHI: After the draft consumer protection rules, the government on Friday said it will soon issue the e-commerce policy, clarifying on certain aspects, as platforms were not following the rules, in letter and spirit. “After we have finalised the consumer protection rules, we will come out with the e-commerce policy and whatever clarifications — we are not changing any policy for e-commerce for FDI. The policy is crystal clear since it (the sector) was opened up, but certain instances have come to our notice, where the policy is not being followed in letter and spirit. We will be obviously clarifying that very shortly,” commerce & industry and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal told reporters. Domestic trade groups have been protesting against players such as Amazon and Flipkart for allegedly violating provisions of the foreign direct investment (FDI) policy on marketplace, an issue on which the government has also expressed its worry. While the government had earlier issued a draft e-commerce policy it had to put it on the backburner due to high-decibel protest from overseas players as well as lobby groups representing them. It, however, tweaked the FDI rules, forcing them to rework their operations as government policy does not allow an inventory-based model and only allows Amazon-type entities to operate as e-marketplaces. The draft consumer protection rules have some elements of the now defunct e-commerce policy draft, such as checks on “flash sales” — which the government clarified are back-to-back sales arrangements between a marketplace and entities where it has interest. Even these proposals have been attacked by Amazon and Flipkart. “We recently announced the (draft) consumer rules under the Consumer Protection Act, this is a series, which involves consumer affairs, FDI policy and e-commerce policy. We wanted to come out with the consumer protection rules first because we believe that the most important stakeholder is the consumer and we wanted to make sure that consumer protection prevails over everything. This has sent a very strong message to the world as sometimes there was criticism that our e-commerce policy is skewed against foreign investors. By announcing the e-commerce policy for consumer protection, we have demonstrated that our foremost concern is the consumer,” Goyal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/after-consumer-protection-govt-to-ready-e-commerce-policy/articleshow/84082715.cms||---

The move, which MSME minister Nitin Gadkari said would benefit 2.5 crore enterprises, came after months of inter-ministerial wrangling, which saw several wings of the government pass the buck on one another, and even the Reserve Bank of India refused to play ball until the government reworked its rules. In fact, at one point in time, agencies within the government had argued that retail and wholesale trade were not “services”, although they were categorised within that bracket globally as well as in India. This was despite the government including retail and wholesale trade enterprises in the MSME Development Act, 2006, until it was dropped on the recommendations of a committee in 2017. The problem came to light after the government reworked the turnover limit last year and a new electronic registration process was started using GST and permanent account numbers. While retailers and wholesale traders who had registered up to 2017 were eligible under the earlier system, the new system would have blocked them out. Describing the Centre’s move as “path breaking”, industry bodies on Friday said the decision will help in the formalisation of the sector. Apart from access to priority sector loans from banks, retail and wholesale trade enterprises can take advantage of other schemes for MSMEs. Under the new rules, commercial banks have to extend 40% of the adjusted non-bank credit or credit equivalent amount of off-balance sheet exposure (whichever is higher) to agriculture, MSMEs and weaker sections. Of the total, 7.5% has to go to small businesses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-brings-retail-wholesale-trade-under-msme/articleshow/84082743.cms||Sidhartha
---||India||SC refuses to stay NLSIU quota||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday refused to stay the decision of the National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Bengaluru, to reserve 25% of its seats for students from Karnataka. A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Ravindra Bhat turned down a plea to stay the NLSIU notification that introduced a 25% horizontal quota for Karnataka-domiciled students seeking admission to BA, LLB (Hons) and LLM programmes offered by the university. The governing body of the university had contended that it was a part of the university’s “inclusion and expansion plan 2021-24”. Those who have studied at an educational institute of Karnataka for at least 10 years are eligible for admission under the quota. Subsequent to its decision, NLSIU asked Karnataka students to update their Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) 2021 application form to avail the benefit of this quota. The plea for interim stay was made while the apex court was hearing an appeal filed by the Karnataka government challenging the 2020 judgment of the Karnataka high court striking down a law passed by the state assembly to provide 25% reservation for Karnataka-domiciled students. It was contended that the revised admission notification was an attempt to get over the Karnataka high court’s judgment. But the state government opposed the plea and contended that the high court struck down the amendment act on the reasoning that the legislature had no competence to intro-duce reservation in NLSIU. It said that there was nothing wrong in the present reservation system as the HC judgment also recognised the power of the executive council of the NLSIU to introduce reservation and the present reservation had been introduced by the NLSIU in terms of the powers recognised by the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-refuses-to-stay-nlsiu-quota/articleshow/84082786.cms||---

Dhankhar finished his address in four minutes, with din created by BJP MLAs against the “deliberate suppression of post-poll violence” in the background, and left the assembly. The governor’s address came in the backdrop of a barrage of allegations and questions — from his “involvement” in a 1990s’ “hawala case” to “land deals in Punjab struck down by courts” — from TMC. There has been intense speculation about how he would handle the address — prepared by the TMC government, with which he has had several run-ins — after his “questions” and the TMC’s allegations. TMC seniors called the governor’s selective reading “unprecedented” but former assembly opposition leader and Congress MLA Abdul Mannan cited similar instances in the past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dhankhar-reads-out-only-first-last-paras-of-18-page-speech/articleshow/84082843.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Business||In letter to PM, IRS officers blast extensions to brass||NEW DELHI: In a rare outburst, “highly agitated” Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officers dealing with customs and indirect taxes have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, denouncing extensions and reappointment to members of the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), arguing that this promotes “vested interests and lobbying” that is “detrimental to professional conduct and prevention of tax evasion”. A year after a CBIC member’s term was extended, the association said, some more members are expected to be getting an extension or reappointment post-retirement and proposals are under “active consideration”. It argued against extension for members of CBIC as well as the Central Board of Direct Taxes. “…extension of tenure beyond superannuation demoralises the cadre as the entire chain of promotion gets blocked, that too when sufficient eligible officers are available for promotion,” the association said, adding that secretaries who belonged to the IAS were not being given an extension. Sandeep Mohan Bhatnagar, who is currently member (customs), had got an extension last August. When contacted, All India Association of IRS Association of Customs & Indirect Tax Officers president Naresh Penumbaka told TOI the letter was sent after consultations with 150 office-bearers, with a similar representation sent to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and principal secretary to PM P K Mishra. “It is our appeal. We will observe government orders, but we have to ventilate the views of our members,” he said over the phone. The representation comes amid repeated criticism of the revenue service by opposition parties, who have accused tax officers of taking politically motivated stands. Earlier this week, AAP criticised the tax department following a notice to Delhi MLA Atishi. The letter has also triggered chatter among direct tax officers from the IRS. The officers’ wing for direct tax officers is virtually defunct after the government charge-sheeted some office-bearers for offering unsolicited advice during last year’s national lockdown, which included levying of cess on certain sections. Currently, J B Mahapatra is working as the interim chairman of CBDT with his two predecessors Sushil Chandra and P C Mody getting two extensions each after their retirement. The government had also reappointed S K Gupta as member CBDT after his retirement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/in-letter-to-pm-irs-officers-blast-extensions-to-brass/articleshow/84082872.cms||---

The virtual meeting was organised by the CPCB after the intervention of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which has recently set up a high-power independent monitoring committee to look into the issue of pollution in rivers Varuna and Assi in Varanasi by discharge of untreated sewage and unauthorized constructions. The NGT in its order dated June 17 had mandated that based on the report of the committee, the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) may give an action taken report in the matter before August 4. He said, “Without groundwater the dynamics of the river system does not function. The Assi and the Vauna rivers need to be properly dredged to remove the settled garbage in order to explore the groundwater table. The inflowing pollutants should pass through the septic tank/sedimentation tank at the source, and finally the pollutants need to be disposed of in the river in proper quantity at proper location and in proper methodology.” “The disposal of pollutants from the existing sewage treatment plants (STPs) located on the city side bank, causing soil, air and water pollution spreading along the ghats by dissipating the momentum of flow are hopeless if the outlets of the STPs are not properly linked with the sand bed,” he added. The outlet of the Assi river joins the Ganga at Nagwa at 90 degree and causes heavy loss of momentum and turbulence of the Ganga. It is causing the spread of pollutants of the Nagwa STP. This is why the Ganga water at Assi ghat is black and smelling. The cause of recent Algal growth in the Ganga was the pollutants of the STPS, he informed TOI. “Therefore, the STP system is utterly useless,” he said, adding that the Assi river was wrongly shifted, which caused the permanent shifting of the Ganga from the Assi ghat. The Assi and the Vauna are the river body systems as any river in the world. There is a need to understand their anatomy, morphology and dynamics. The river problems should be solved with the help of experts of the river institutes. The Varuna confluences with the Ganga in the zone of converging streamlines of the Ganga. It was causing the filling up of the erosion pockets. This has been disturbed due to the construction of a spur on Lalita Ghat. Now the upstream of Lalita Ghat has become the zone of sedimentation and the downstream of Lalita Ghat has become the zone of pollutant logging. Since they are curved in nature, the water inside them is subjected to centrifugal forces and secondary circulations. Therefore, dilution, diffusion and dispersion of pollutants are functions of location inside the river. For imparting minimum basic knowledge of the river to all officers in water resource departments there must be a sufficient number of river engineering institutes. Further, the river problems should be analyzed with model study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/ganga-pollution-expert-points-outlapses-in-sewage-treatment-system/articleshow/84076203.cms||Binay Singh

---||Patna||Two more with LeT links held in Darbhanga parcel blast case||PATNA: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday arrested one Haji Salim and his son Kafil from Kairana in Uttar Pradesh after getting seven-day custody of Mohammad Nasir Khan and his brother Imran Khan with alleged Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) links in Darbhanga railway station parcel blast case. The two brothers were arrested in Hyderabad on June 30 and were brought to Patna on transit remand on Friday morning. All the four belong to Kairana in Shamli, UP. Sources said Salim, an alleged recruiter for LeT in India, had also recruited Nasir and had faciltated his visit to Pakistan in 2012 for getting trained in IED manufacturing. Both Salim and Kafil were being brought to Patna and would be produced in the NIA court on Saturday in the Darbhanga parcel blast case. The parcel containing a chemical kept in a glass bottle wrapped with adhesive tapes in women’s clothes was booked at Secunderabad railway station. The parcel had exploded while being dumped at platform number one of Darbhanga railway station on June 17. "It has also come to light that Salim himself had visited Pakistan 12 times and recruited youths in India for the LeT. He had also financed more than Rs 1.5 lakh to Nasir and Imran for manufacturing the explosive and parcel it to Darbhanga from Secunderabad," an NIA source said. Earlier, Nasir and Imran were brought to Patna by air amid tight security on transit remand and produced before the special court (NIA Act) of ADJ-XV Gurvinder Singh Malhotra, which allowed their custodial remand for interrogation. The court also accepted the NIA’s plea to invoke Section 16 (punishment for terrorist act) and Section 18 (punishment for conspiracy to attempt, advocate, abet, advice, incite, knowingly facilitating commission of a terrorist act) of The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act, 2019 in the case. As per the NIA, Nasir visited Pakistan in 2012 and was trained by LeT in making improvised explosive devices (IED) from easily available chemicals in the market. The NIA has also stated that both were acting on the direction of their Pakistan-based handlers. The duo belongs to Kairana in Shamli, Uttar Pradesh, but had settled in Hyderabad two decades ago. Sources said both were interrogated by a joint team of ATS and four members of the Intelligence Bureau after landing at Patna airport and before producing them in the NIA court. Sources said the NIA will soon arrest some more people in the case. They were sent to Beur central jail to spend a night as the NIA would take the duo on remand from Saturday and take them to several places during interrogation. Sources said the NIA had actually prayed for their ten days’ custodial remand, but the court allowed only seven days. State police headquarters sources said a special interrogation cell has been prepared inside the high-security Bihar Special Armed Police (erstwhile Bihar Military Police) premises for interrogating Nasir and Imran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/2-more-with-let-links-held-in-darbhanga-parcel-blast-case/articleshow/84075442.cms||Debashish Karmakar

I will submit my resignation to the CM soon after reaching Patna on Saturday,” he told this newspaper over the phone. Sahni is a JD(U) MLA from Bahadurpur assembly constituency in Darbhanga district. Meanwhile, apart from opposition leaders, several JD(U) netas have also admitted that Sahni was right to speak his mind on the issue. “What Sahniji has said is absolutely true,” a senior JD(U) leader said on condition of anonymity. HAM(S) chief and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi too supported Sahni. “I am sorry to say that most officials of the government departments in the state are not listening to the people’s representatives,” he said. The HAM(S) is an ally of the ruling NDA in the state. Earlier, two BJP MLAs — Gyanendra Gyanu and Haribhushan Thakur — had alleged that money changed hands in the recent transfer and posting of the officials. Thakur said the MLAs have been reduced to the status of peons by the babus in the state. An officer of the social welfare department said the minister had recommended transfer of 134 child development project officers in June, but it was put on hold. Sources said delay in clearance of file related to transfer and posting may have angered Sahni. State labour resources department minister Jibesh Kumar said, “Although I don't know why Sahniji has offered to resign, there should be proper coordination between the ministers and officers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/will-resign-today-says-social-welfare-minister/articleshow/84075475.cms||Ramashankar

RJD supremo Lalu Prasad on Friday said such situation is bound to happen if a CM is made neglecting the people’s mandate. Lalu tweeted that the government was any how formed using power and administrative manipulation. “Such things will naturally happen when a person passes in the third grade and manages 40 seats neglecting all ethics and modesty. Forget about good or bad, there is no governance in Bihar at all,” he tweeted. Sahni, a JD(U) MLA, has offered to resign from the Nitish cabinet while alleging that the state’s bureaucrats don’t listen to the ministers and MLAs. Leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, had also taken a jibe at the autocracy of bureaucracy in Bihar and blamed CM Nitish for the mess. State Congress also targeted the Nitish government over the issue. Party spokesperson Rajesh Rathorre said not only Sahni, almost all the cabinet ministers and legislators were facing the same situation. “Many of them may not come on record, but this is the fact that bureaucrats do not listen to any minister or MLA. Earlier also, MLAs had been mistreated by bureaucrats. This is because CM Nitish has given upper hand to the bureaucrats and does not have faith in his own ministers and MLAs,” he said.

About 25 commercial projects have been switched to residential schemes so far this year. Revised building plans have been approved in case of 20 commercial projects in areas falling under Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). Five more projects in areas of Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA) have changed to residential from commercial. “We converted our commercial project at Panjrapole cross roads into a residential one. The project now offers 3 BHK plus work from home (WFH) apartments as well as showrooms. We changed our plan as there was a good demand for residential units in this area,” said a city-based realtor Chitrak Shah, who is also the vice-president of CREDAI-Ahmedabad GIHED, a body of city-based real estate developers. Another real estate company, Venus Infrastructure, has converted its commercial project behind Rajpath Club in Bodakdev into an upscale residential scheme after getting its revised building plan approved. “Our commercial project was retail heavy and demand for retail spaces took a beating after the outbreak of the pandemic. The project location was always good for residential. Hence, we switched to the residential project,” said Rajesh Vaswani, executive director, Venus Infrastructure. A builder in Sanand moved a proposal for setting up a multiplex and a shopping complex. However, he changed the project into a twin bungalow scheme in the same area. According to the real estate industry, work from home, high inventory, corporates putting their expansion hold as well as territorial restrictions and fewer footfalls in showrooms and malls due to Covid-19 have dented the demand for retail and office spaces in commercial projects. Building plans were revised in case of three commercial projects in 2018-19 and the number stood at seven in 2020. However, the number shot up in 2021, said AMC officials. There is, however, demand for residential housing and the segment also ensured some cash flow to developers, which has prompted many to convert their commercial projects which are on the drawing board to residential projects. “Converting a commercial project into a residential one, whenever it is possible, is an intelligent step in the right direction,” said Balbirsingh Khalsa, national director industrial and logistics and branch director-Ahmedabad, Knight Frank India, a leading real estate consultant in India. “On one hand, vacancy level in offices is high and rentals are falling, prospects for retail spaces continue to be clouded amid pandemic fears. On the other hand, the demand for residential dwellings is good and the residential housing inventory is very low at present. Currently, it makes sense to switch to residential from commercial,” he added. AMC and AUDA officials added that there was a rush for commercial projects in 2018 and 2019. The trend has changed in 2021. At present, about 80% of building plans coming up for approval in both AMC and AUDA are for residential projects. The percentage was 60% in past few years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/realtors-convert-commercial-projects-into-residential-amid-tepid-demand/articleshow/84101379.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Dubey was killed in an encounter in the morning of July 10. While talking to reporters in Lucknow, she claimed that her family was being harassed continuously and now they do not wish to live any more. “We request the CM to accept our request and give us permission for euthanasia,” said Richa. “None is paying heed to our grievances. We are running short of money and now we are even unable to deposit our children’s school fee. I have to run my house by selling jewellery,” she said. Richa further said that not only this, the death certificate of her husband Vikas Dubey, who was killed in the police encounter, has not been made even after a year. “Due to his father’s name wrongly being mentioned in the post-mortem slip, the error also appeared in the funeral slip. Because of which, the municipal corporation people have refused to make the death certificate of my husband and now we are facing a lot of hardships and unable to claim the insurance money,” she said. Richa said, “I finally demand chief minister Yogi ji that he should give us permission for euthanasia.” She said that the chief minister belongs to the entire state but none is paying heed to our grievances. “I have full sympathy with the policemen who were killed by Vikas on July 2 & 3 night. I never said anything ill about those families, but someone should listen to us too,” she said and added, “If my husband Vikas did wrong, he was punished for that, now why are we being harassed.” Eight policemen, including DSP Devendra Mishra, were ambushed in Bikru village in Chaubeypur area of Kanpur when they were going to arrest Dubey and fell to bullets fired from rooftops shortly after midnight on July 2 & 3, 2020. Dubey was killed in an encounter in the morning of July 10 when a police vehicle carrying him from Ujjain to Kanpur met with an accident and he tried to escape from the spot in Bhauti area in Sachendi, the police had said. Prior to Dubey’s encounter, five of his alleged associates were killed in separate encounters, while 45 including two cops and four women were arrested and sent to jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/bikru-mastermind-vikass-wifeseeks-cm-nod-for-euthanasia/articleshow/84076355.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Varanasi||IIT-BHU experts come up with surgical grade nickel-free steel||VARANASI: Scientists at the metallurgical engineering department of Indian Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University (IIT-BHU) have succeeded in making nickel-free surgical grade stainless steel that is cheaper and much safer than stainless steel containing titanium, cobalt-chromium and nickel used in organ transplantation in the human body. The new metal is also lighter in weight and double in strength. According to them, titanium, cobalt-chromium and nickel-based surgical grade stainless steel metals such as (316L) are currently being used in surgical treatment of broken bones. It is extremely expensive and many problems are also associated with it. Stainless steel (316L) is a nickel-based metal which is cheap but the nickel element present in it causes problems like allergies, cancer, inflammation, discomfort, changes in the skin of the implant area in human skin. Principal investigator and associate professor at the department, Dr. Girija Shankar Mahobia said, “The common side effects of nickel are fatigue, swelling and skin allergy. In some circumstances, there may also be a risk of developing lung, heart and kidney disease. Nickel also starts coming out along with various elements. Its dissolving capacity can be as high as 20 milligrams per kilogram, which is very dangerous. Keeping all these things in mind, it became necessary to invent such cheap and effective metal in which nickel is negligible and it does not have any side effects in the body.” He further informed TOI that a patent had been filed for this in April 2020. “The new metal does not stick to magnets. Its strength is twice that of the metal currently in use, which will reduce the weight of the equipment made in it by half. Due to its adaptability to the body, it can also be used to make heart related devices like stents, pacemakers, valves. The new metal has absolutely no impurities, due to which its anti-fatigue properties are very good,” he added. According to the weight of the human on the metal implanted inside the human body, there is an additional load on different organs which is three to four times more. A normal and healthy human walks 7 to 10 kilometres per day and walks an average of one to two lakh steps every year. Accordingly, the extra load is applied to the implanted metal forever and the usefulness of the protection anti-fatigue property of the metal is greatly increased. As the new metal is nickel-free, it will also be Rs 100 per kg cheaper. Dr Mahobia said that in 2015, taking inspiration from Prof. Vakil Singh, an expert in mechanical-metallurgy, he submitted a project to the ministry of steel to make a nickel-free metal. Due to being interdisciplinary and social welfare, it was given the green signal in January 2016. The ministry provided a fund of Rs 2.84 crore for three years and ‘Corrosion Fatigue Research Lab’ was set up in the department. The project team involved experts from IIT-BHU, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, National Center for Cytology, Puna, Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology Trivandrum, Mishra Dhatu Nigam Limited-Hyderabad and Jindal Stainless Limited-Hisar. Dr. Mahobia and Dr. OP Sinha designed the chemical composition of the new metal and got it produced at Mishr Dhatu Nigam Limited, Hyderabad. According to Dr. Mahobia, nitrogen and manganese were added to the new metal by removing nickel. Also, other components such as chromium and molybdenum are mixed in a favourable ratio. Due to this, the mechanical properties and anti-corrosion properties of the metal are higher than those of the currently used stainless steel. Prof. Vakil Singh contributed as an advisor to the entire project. Chandrashekhar Kumar PhD research student has studied the ‘corrosion fatigue’ and anti-corrosion properties in detail according to all international parameters. Dr. Sanjeev Mahto of the School of Biomedical Engineering, IIT-BHU investigated the metal-adhesion and survival of bone cells. Prof. Mohan R. Wani, senior scientist, studied the metal-adherence and survival of stem cells and found that the nickel-free metal is body-friendly. The effect this metal can have on cells and blood inside the body has been tested in a Trivandrum-based lab to international standards on various animals such as rats, rabbits and pigs. In all the tests, the new metal was found to be compatible with the body. No side effects were found on any animals. Prof. Amit Rastogi of the Institute of Medical Sciences, BHU, conducted detailed testing of the new metal on rabbits and found that the new metal is absolutely safe. Dr. N Shanthi Srinivasan and Dr. Kaushik Chattopadhyay have been instrumental in understanding the mechanical behavior of this metal. “For use of any new metal in the body, permission has to be taken from CDSCO, government of India, similar to what we are currently seeing on the corona vaccine, its usefulness will have to be proved on human trials at different levels. An appeal will be made to the ministries of steel and health to take necessary steps to make use of the new metal for the public. Various steel makers and implant device manufacturing industries have also shown their interest,” said IIT-BHU director Prof. Pramod Kumar Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/iit-bhu-experts-come-up-withsurgical-grade-nickel-free-steel/articleshow/84076193.cms||Binay Singh

These funds were received by them as trustees for the benefit of others, the BCAS has pointed out in its letter to the chairman of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). BCAS has referred to the press note issued by the CBDT on June 25. This note provided income tax (I-T) exemption in respect of funds received by a taxpayer from an employer or others for treatment of Covid. The funds are clearly received by these individuals with an “overriding diversion of title to the funds in favour of beneficiaries”, BCAS has said. Technically, the funds received by them are not taxable as they have received the funds in the capacity of trustees for the benefit of others. Trustees are liable to tax in the like manner and to the same extent as beneficiaries. Since beneficiaries have been exempted under the press note, trustees would also get exempted, it explains. BCAS also suggests certain safeguards. Those collating the funds (intermediary celebrities and other individuals) should either spend the money directly for Covid relief or donate it to I-T-registered charitable trusts. Any sum retained by them for more than 6 months or up to such a period as CBDT may specify should not be entitled to tax relief. If they have received more than Rs 10 lakh, submission of audited statements with their I-T returns could be introduced, so that the same can be examined by the I-T authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dont-tax-funds-stars-get-for-covid-relief-cas-to-cbdt/articleshow/84079224.cms||---

---||Gurgaon||After lockdown lull, staycation rush has hotel registers ringing||Not everyone is headed to the Himalayas for a break. A weekend at an NCR hotel will do just fine too. A staycation rush is seeing check-in registers fill up fast again at hotels, which have otherwise struggled for guests for months. The past two weeks have been encouraging for hotels, surpassing even their own expectations as they expected travellers to return much later this time, particularly after the harrowing second wave. Several hotels for business travellers that had seen a big drop in numbers recently are also seeing a revival as leisure destinations. The easing of lockdown restrictions, steady drop in Covid cases and bottled-up yearning to travel have all come together to bring this silver lining to the hospitality industry. Rahul Puri, GM at The Westin Gurgaon and The Westin Sohna Resort and Spa, said 85% of guests at his Gurgaon property would be corporate travellers. But this has changed now, to weekend staycations and leisure. Puri said domestic travel and staycation trends were showing promising recovery, with a week-on-week 25-30% growth in leisure guests coming into the hotel. “We have already started witnessing an upswing in staycations both at the hotel and the resort. There is pent-up demand and people do want to get away. Both the hotel and the resort have already touched full occupancy over the weekend,” he said. Vishal Singh, GM of Hyatt Regency Gurgaon, told TOI that unlike last year, the pick-up this time has been very swift. “Occupancy touches 50% over the weekends,” he said. He added that other areas that have seen good recovery are dine-in at the hotel’s restaurant Kitchen District and wedding celebrations. Permission to hold wedding functions has also helped. Varun Chhibber, GM, The Leela Ambience Gurugram Hotel & Residences, said since wedding functions are restricted to 50 people, he has noticed many people who otherwise could not afford a five-star property opting for his hotel. “Celebrations and social functions are driving the business. Almost all the guests are from NCR. Our weekend occupancy has reached 80% while food and beverage sales are also picking up faster than expected,” he said. A major boost to hotels has come from food sales since they reopened their outlets. Popular weekend brunch destinations, like threesixtyonedegrees at The Oberoi, Spectra at The Leela Ambience and Latest Recipe at Le Meridien, have been buzzing over the last two weekends. Social media posts detailing sanitisation protocols and vaccination status of staff have added to customer confidence as well. Surinder Singh, GM, Taj City Centre Gurugram, they have seen an encouraging response, especially over the weekends. “It is good to see that diners have started to trickle in. The reopening of Thai Pavilion has been very well received by our guests. Private dining experiences are being chosen for milestone occasions,” he said. Singh added that the number of weddings has gone up. “They have become a more intimate affair in line with the new norms and physical distancing,” he said. Some Delhi hotels, too, are benefiting from the staycations. The Lodhi has been sold out for the last few weekends and seen impressive occupancy on weekdays as well. “Weekends have been extremely busy with guests coming in from NCR cities,” Saurabh Khurana, executive assistant manager at The Lodhi said, adding that rooms with pools, eateries within the hotel and a vast open space at the property have been a huge draw. Ankush Nijhawan, MD of Nijhawan Group and CEO of Travel Boutique Online, observed that while all hotels may not be back to pre-Covid levels, for most, business has definitely picked up. To beat the heat and humidity of the past few days, many residents of NCR also headed out to Himachal Pradesh and Ladakh, a trend that he predicted will continue for the next few weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/after-lockdown-lull-staycation-rush-has-hotel-registers-ringing/articleshow/84063450.cms||Amin Ali
---||Kanpur||Uttar Pradesh: A year on, Bikru residents say ‘democracy restored in village’||KANPUR: Tired of unending atrocities at the hand of gangster Vikas Dubey and his aides, the residents of Bikru while recalling the massacre followed by Dubey’s encounter by police heaved a sigh of relief and said that “democracy has been finally restored after 25 years of long gap in Bikru”. “Democracy or elections means nothing here in Bikru. None used to campaign here and Dubey would field candidates of his choice. People this time contested the elections and went door-to-door and sought votes,” said a group of villagers on the first anniversary of the Bikru massacre of July 2, 2020, night in which eight policemen were killed by Dubey and his henchmen. Two gunmen, identified as a maternal uncle and another close relative of Dubey, were also killed in the gunfight. The autopsy report revealed that DSP Devendra Mishra had been beheaded and brutalised with an axe, while other cops had multiple bullet wounds fired from different weapons, suggesting an ambush. The police later recovered looted weapons, including an Ak-47 rifle and an INSAS rifle, among others, belonging to the policemen. The inspector-general of police had stated that at least 60 men had ambushed the police team, who were just 30 in number. The call records showed that Dubey was in contact with multiple cops, who leaked vital information to him. Within eight days of the Bikru massacre, the police and STF together had killed six miscreants including Vikas Dubey in encounters. On the night of July 2 & 3, 2020, Rahul Tiwari, a local of Chaubeypur, had filed a case of attempt to murder against Vikas Dubey and his associates. After registering the FIR, a raid was conducted in Bikru village under the leadership of the then CO Bilhaur Devendra Kumar Mishra at around 12.30 the same night. Vikas Dubey and his henchmen were already ambushed here. A JCB was installed to stop the police at the house. As soon as the police arrived, the miscreants started firing at them from the rooftops. Trial of the case is on. After the Bikru incident, the police have sent a total of 45 accused including minor Khushi Dubey to jail. It also includes four women including Khushi. Apart from this, nine accused are Vikas’s helpers and arms buyers. The weapon buyer was a relative of a politician from Bhind, who was caught by STF. So far, NSA has been imposed on three accused Shivam Dubey alias Dalal, Ramesh Chandra and Bablu Muslim. The policemen who were martyred in the ambush included Deputy SP Devendra Kumar Mishra, SHO Mahesh Kumar Yadav, sub-inspector Anoop Kumar Singh, sub-inspector Nebulal, constable Jitendra Pal, constable Sultan Singh, constable Babloo Kumar and constable Rahul Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/a-year-on-bikru-residents-say-democracy-restored-in-village/articleshow/84076299.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

The state cabinet approved the government’s proposal at a meeting on Friday. The cabinet also cleared the revised project cost of the first phase of the Ganga water lifting project at Rs4,174 crore. It is being implemented under the Jal Jeevan Hariyali campaign. Earlier, the estimated expenditure on the first phase of the project had been put at Rs 2,836 crore. While the project was under implementation, there occurred an increased expenditure worth Rs1,338.81 crore. The project is being executed by the water resources department. The project cost was revised due to the increased expenditure of Rs918.58 crore and additional related works necessitated an expenditure of another Rs420.23 crore. The project envisages supply of Ganga water to Gaya, Bodh Gaya and Rajgir towns. In sync with the same, the cabinet also approved free transfer of 16 acres of non-forest fallow land in Mohammadpur revenue area of Giriyak circle in Nalanda district to the environment, forest and climate change department. The transfer of the 16 acres of land has been necessitated as a reservoir is being constructed on a chunk of land that belongs to the environment, forest and climate change department. The cabinet also cleared the transfer of 40.24 acres of toppo/diara land in the Sabalpur mauja of Saran district for the construction of the Digha to Deedarganj Ganga Path. That apart, the cabinet sanctioned the transfer of Rs200 crore to the World Health Organisation (WHO) for the purchase of hand compression pump required for the spraying of insecticides in affected areas, as part of the kala-azar eradication drive. It also approved the changes in rules for providing domestic assistance to former chief justice of the Patna high court and also to its former judges. The cabinet gave its nod to the payment of incentive money to M/S ABIS Exports (India) Private Limited for establishing a poultry feed unit at Bela Industrial Area, Phase-II, in Muzaffarpur, with private investment worth Rs94.70 crore. Before the payment of incentive money, the actual investment made on the project has to be computed. The two values of the incentive money to be paid -- one on the proposed investment and the other based on the actual investment – have to be calculated. Whichever is the lesser amount will be paid as the incentive money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ganga-water-lifting-project-cost-revised/articleshow/84075137.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ED suspects Rs 750 crore loan by Ajit Pawar-linked mill was diverted||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate suspects that an approximately Rs 750-crore loan taken by a Satara-based sugar factory which was leased out to a company linked to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar was diverted for purposes other than those declared to the bank. The ED has attached now land, buildings and machinery at the Jarandeshwar Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana (Jarandeshwar SSK) in connection with the Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank (MSCB) money laundering case. The agency said Mumbai-based builder, Omkar Developers, floated a company named Guru Commodity Services Pvt Ltd, which was used to purchase Jarandeshwar SSK in an auction at an undervalued price after it defaulted on a loan from MSCB. Guru Commodity and Mumbai-based Shivalik group coughed up funds to purchase the mill in a Rs 65-crore transaction, along with an Ajit Pawar-controlled company. After purchasing the mill, Guru Commodity leased it out to to a group company of Ajit Pawar called Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills Pvt Ltd, said the ED attachment notice. The attachment notice said Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills in connivance with Guru Commodity Services later obtained a loan of more than Rs 700 crore and created various rights in the leased sugar mill. The notice further added Guru Commodity immediately shifted control of Jarandeshwar SSK “to group company of Ajit Pawar i.e. Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills Pvt Ltd under the guise of taking the said property on lease.” The premises of Jarandeshwar SSK was utilized by Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills to avail loans of Rs 700+ crore from various banks, the ED said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-suspects-rs-750-crore-loan-by-pawar-linked-mill-was-diverted/articleshow/84082692.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Patna||Swollen rivers flood many villages in north Bihar||PATNA/BAGAHA: Even as parts of Gandak and other river basins have been reeling from floods, the threat of severe flood suddenly shifted on Friday to the north Bihar districts lying in the basins of Mahananda, Kamla and Bagmati rivers, water resources department (WRD) sources said. The shift has taken place as the catchment areas of the three rivers in Nepal are expected to be further lashed by moderate to heavy rainfall over the next 36 hours, along with abnormally heavy rainfall at some places. “The Mahananda, Kamla and Bagmati rivers are on spate. Their basins face the abrupt threat of flood since their catchment areas in Nepal have received moderate to heavy rainfall on Friday and the trend is expected to continue through Saturday,” a WRD official said. He added the Nepal-based catchment areas of Gandak at Sibling on the west received 252mm rainfall on Thursday, while the catchment areas of Mahananda in eastern Nepal recorded 125mm rainfall the same day at Chandragarhi airport area near Jhapa. “Most areas have been receiving moderate to heavy rainfall,” he added. The flood bulletin released by the WRD has forecast moderate to heavy rainfall in slightly over 14 districts in Bihar for Saturday. “So far, the rainfall received by the eastern districts in the northern parts of the state is less than their normal share in June. The rainfall share in the western districts is much more than the normal rainfall in June. While north Bihar districts have been rattled by flood threat, the rainfall forecast in south Bihar for Saturday is zero,” the WRD official added. Meanwhile, of the major rivers, the water discharge through Gandak was falling, but increasing gradually in the Kosi river. On the other hand, the Ganga is flowing below the danger level at most places because the south Bihar districts encompassing the basins of North Koel, Sone, Punpun and Phalgu have not received heavy rainfall. Bagmati was flowing above the danger mark at most places, and Burhi Gandak at Sikandarpur, Samastipur and Rosera. Similarly, Kamla Balan was flowing above the danger level at Jainagar and Jhanjharpur in Madhubani district. In West Champaran district, heavy rain in the catchment areas of the Gandak, Bhapsa, Kosil, Haraha, Manor, Masan, Pandai, Karhatawa, Oria, Gad, Kharahatawa Maniyari, Harbora, Sikarahana and Doharum rivers have caused inundation in about 250 villages of Sikta, Mainatar, Gaunaha, Majhaulia, Narakatiaganj, Nautan, Bairia, Jogapati, Ramnagar, Bagaha-1, Bagaha-2, Piparasi Madhubani, Bhitaha and Thakaraha blocks. Farmers in West Champaran district are concerned as their paddy seedlings have been washed away. The fear is that the paddy transplantation coverage will be only around 40-45% of the area. Several panchayats have remained cut off from the sub-divisional headquarters Narakatiaganj. Due to the incessant rain, the approach road of Gandak Setu under Nadi police station near Nainaha dhala has been damaged. Thousands of vehicles were seen stranded along both ends of the bridge. The Bagaha sub-divisional hospital and the low-lying localities are under ankle to knee-deep water. Floodwaters overtopped Bagaha-Valmikinagar state highway near Hardiyachati under Naurangia police station. In Sitamarhi, all the major rivers were flowing above danger marks on Friday. The incessant rain in Nepal’s catchment areas have added to the woes of people in the district. The district administration is keeping strict vigil on the embankments of the Bagmati, Lalbakeya, Lakhandei, Jhim, Rato and Marar rivers. Sitamarhi DM Sunil Kumar Yadav visited several embankments this week. The worst affected low-lying localities facing waterlogging in Sitamarhi are Raghunathpuri, Aadarsh Nagar, Pratap Nagar, Mirchayipatti and Raghunath Jha College. People in these areas have started vacating their houses and shifting to safer places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/swollen-rivers-flood-many-villages-in-north-bihar/articleshow/84076336.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Dehradun||NHPC challenges additional tax on hydel projects in Uttarakhand in high court||NAINITAL: NHPC, the largest hydropower generator in India, has filed a special appeal in the Uttarakhand high court (HC), challenging the judgment issued by a single bench judge in February, which upheld the state’s right to levy additional tax on hydropower projects. After hearing the matter on Friday, the division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma issued notices to the state government and the state commission for water tax on electricity generation, water resource department, irrigation department and nodal officer of the research and rehabilitation department. The court has given all respondents four weeks to file their counters. Although the petition also sought a stay on the judgment of the single judge bench, the court refused to grant the relief and asked the counsel appearing for the firm to place its previous orders dealing with the same issue on record. In February, the single bench of Justice Lok Pal Singh dismissed 11 petitions filed by several hydropower project owners and upheld an Act passed by the state in 2012, which puts an additional tax on such firms for using the hill state’s water for generation of electricity. The law in question – the Uttarakhand Water Tax on Electricity Generation Act 2012 – imposes a tax amount ranging from two to 10 paise, depending on the size of the hydel project. This tax is in addition to the 12% power that these projects supply to the state government free of cost, as royalty. The court had held that the law neither violates the Constitution nor is it mala fide in nature and that the legislature is competent to bring the law since it imposes tax on the use of water, not generation of electricity. The NHPC, however, contends that through his order, the judge has effectively held that the definition of land includes the water flowing on it, which goes against provisions of the Constitution. Its petition adds that the judgment has given the state government power to put tax on water usage for generation of electricity, but the constitution does not grant the state government any such power. Earlier, THDC, another hydropower generator, had challenged the order on similar grounds. The court had issued notices in the matter as well. However, sources said that despite almost three months having passed since the first hearing, the state, a respondent, is yet to file its reply in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/nhpc-challenges-additional-tax-on-hydel-projects-in-uttarakhand-in-hc/articleshow/84075105.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Patna||Patna: Covid pandemic compounds struggle of working mothers||PATNA: Covid-19 has brought in numerous, never-ending problems that has caused a tremendous effect on lives. The situation of mothers who have a huge responsibility of raising their kids and work at the same time is even more difficult. Studies have shown that because of the pandemic, there has been a huge shift in the elevated rates of depression and anxiety among mothers. The constant pressure of dealing with responsibilities, expectations, looking after their children along with continuing work has been quite exhausting for them. Madhu Taneja, a teacher who has been working from home, talks about how a working woman, who is also a mother, has to deal with different struggles during the pandemic. “I can no longer be involved in somebody’s happiness or sadness because of social distancing. There are times when you feel depressed because you yearn to meet your students, but the current situation does not allow us to do so,” she said. Many mothers have been forced to scale down their hours or leave work entirely. Another struggle that they have been facing is keeping kids away from the overload of the use of cellphone. “The impact of internet use on these younger children is quite a struggle for me. These devices are quite tempting for them, but a pain for me because these children are young, immature and they don’t know how to use the internet for their benefits and how to avoid the internet which can cause problems for them,” said Priya Manish Kumar, a city-based professor. “I have become more of a disciplinarian than I was before the pandemic to stop my children from overusing the internet,” she added. Ayesha Taneja, teacher in a city-based private school, said transitioning from taking care of a baby to work has become quite burdensome. “Other people in the family do not understand the change of roles of a woman. It’s being taken for granted that since the mom is at home, she will do the household chores,” she said. Taneja added, “Because of the pandemic, the rigid arc of 9am to 6pm job has completely been broken. It has become quite flexible. Hence, mothers are finding it difficult to manage time. This means that the time management has become a huge concern for them.” Rashi Kohli, a Bengaluru-based counsellor, said she asks her clients to prioritise their needs for better time management. “A mother caters to the needs of others first. I suggest them to write journals so that they can write about their struggles,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-pandemic-compounds-struggle-of-working-mothers/articleshow/84075290.cms||---

The CID has also urged for deputation of a dedicated additional advocate general in the case for honestly putting the prosecution side against the accused DSP to oppose his bail in the special court (Pocso Act) on July 5. Syed Qaiser Sharfuddin is the special public prosecutor in the special court (Pocso Act) in the case. The special court (in-charge) of ADJ-VII Neeraj Kumar had ordered no coercive action against the DSP while hearing his anticipatory bail petition. CID (weaker section) ADG Anil Kishore Yadav had written the letter on June 28 in the capacity of in-charge officer under SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules, 1995, to additional chief secretary (home) Chaitanya Prasad. The ADG wrote that the prosecutor didn’t attract the attention of the court that the victim was a scheduled caste and entertaining his anticipatory bail petition would be unconstitutional as per Section 18 of SC/ST Act. He also wrote that the prosecutor didn’t mention to the court that the victim and his brother had already recorded their statements under Section 164 CrPC supporting the allegations in the FIR. The ADG has suspected a conspiracy over unsupportive attitude of the prosecutor due to which even arrest warrant was not issued by the court against the DSP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cid-seeks-probe-against-gaya-special-pp-in-dsp-case/articleshow/84075830.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The fundraising follows a 44% growth in premium to Rs 3,243 crore. Insurance companies need to set aside capital for solvency in proportion to the business they write. The company counts Virat Kohli among investors. The latest fundraise will result in a 5% dilution in the company’s equity. Speaking to TOI, Digit Insurance chairman & founder Kamesh Goyal said that 99% of the company’s business by volume and 85% by value is generated digitally. The company’s digital platform equips it to be competitive on pricing and its use of analytics has enabled it to achieve the highest retention ratio for the entire industry in motor insurance at the time of renewal. Motor insurance is the largest business segment, accounting for around 75% of the company’s premium income. Digit’s digital platform allows the company to ramp up its business without a corresponding increase in operating costs. This also enables it to do significantly higher business in smaller towns, where insurance distribution infrastructure is not developed. In the first two months of the current fiscal, Digit managed to grow premium by 70%, which is more than four times the 17% growth recorded by the industry. Among listed non-life companies, ICICI Lombard has a market capitalisation of Rs 70,596 crore ($9.5 billion). Public sector New India Assurance — the largest non-life insurer in the country — is valued at Rs 28,254 crore. Last month, HDFC Bank acquired 3.6 crore shares (4.99% stake) in HDFC Ergo General Insurance for Rs 1,906 crore, valuing the company at over Rs 38,000 crore ($5.3 billion).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/digit-insurance-valued-at-3bn-raises-200mn/articleshow/84079371.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Dehradun||Dehradun: Principal, senior staff of Welham Boys' School booked after ‘halal meat ad’ row||DEHRADUN: The principal, vice principal and manager of Welham Boys’ School, a prominent residential school in Dehradun, were booked for “promoting enmity between groups” after an FIR was lodged against the institute at the behest of Bajrang Dal members for "inviting halal meat suppliers for the mess". The case was filed at the Dalanwala police station on Thursday evening following a complaint by Bajrang Dal’s Dehradun convenor Vikas Verma. The complaint, a copy of which is with TOI, alleged that the school was serving halal meat even though students of all faiths studied there. “The school has issued a tender for serving halal meat in the school canteen with the intention of religious conversion of students. Due to this act, the religious sentiments of Hindu community have been hurt,” it claimed. Mahavir Singh, officer in-charge of the case, told TOI that all three school officials have been booked under section 505 (2) of the Indian Penal Code which pertains to statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes. The section is cognizable, non-bailable and provides for imprisonment which may extend to three years, fine, or both. “There were some discrepancies in the school’s statements so we have filed a case against them. We will investigate the matter,” Singh said. Earlier this week, Bajrang Dal members had barged into the school premises and protested against the tender for halal meat which was published in a newspaper last month. While halal is an Islamic way of slaughter where blood is drained from the animal, in jhatka the animal is killed instantly with a single strike. The school management had earlier told TOI that they had published ads for both types of meat separately. Mahesh Kandpal, vice principal of the school, had said the institute served both halal and jhatka meat in its campus. On Friday, the management was not reachable for a comment. Parents TOI spoke with said it was a “non-issue”. “I have never thought of what type of meat my son is eating. He has been studying there since 2014 and it was quite shocking to us that so much fuss is being created over nothing. We have sent our kids to study there and that should remain the focus,” said Namita Gupta, who runs an NGO in Kashipur. Another parent, Vikas Munjal, a businessman based in Moradabad, said, “Why should this be an issue when we often eat frozen food where nothing is mentioned on the packaging about the type of meat it contains.” Munjal, however, added that some parents might take issue with ‘halal’ meat being served to their children. The alumni association of the school also said the matter seemed to have “blown out of proportion”. President of the Welham Old Boys’ Society, Gurjyotinder Singh said, “It seems that the matter was blown out of proportion but the institute should have been more cautious since this is a sensitive issue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/principal-sr-staff-of-welham-boys-school-booked-after-halal-meat-ad-row/articleshow/84075097.cms||Mohammad Anab

These statues themselves may get washed away any day by the Pandai which erupts suddenly and menacingly in monsoon,” he rued. A black tiled plaque commemorating Shukla’s role in the Champaran Satyagraha manages to stand still in the slush, Gandhiji’s portrait washed away though. “They had pasted a paper photo of Bapu. Rain and sun peeled it away,” Suruj Yadav, another villager, recalled. Following Yadav’s pointed finger, eyes veer to thatched hutments crumbled by the fury of the Pandai. A bullock cart comes into view. At the helm is Mahendra Yasav. The cart is laden with his worldly possessions: a couple of tin trunks, a small wooden almirah, table and his sparse larder of grains. At the rear of the cart is Yadav’s world: his wife and two little children. The villager’s home has been devoured by the river. He is migrating to higher ground. The heritage walks organised in 2017 now seem a cruel joke on the villagers. That a walk on the ground that Gandhi blazed from Narkatiaganj to this village en route to Bhitiharwa in 1917 is difficult to tread is more than figuratively speaking. Leaving the car where the metalled road has been breached, the trudge through the current onto about 200 metres of tar meanders into a road untouched since Gandhiji walked these parts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/gandhians-statue-in-champaran-village-at-the-mercy-of-river/articleshow/84076032.cms||Abhay Mohan Jha

Adil Khan, who ran a stationery shop in the area, had come out of his home for a walk when he was mowed down. The truck then rammed a lamp post. Khan died at the spot, and the driver and helper of the truck fled. Locals vandalized the truck and set it on fire before they blocked the road with the body still lying there. They alleged police negligence in letting overloaded trucks speed through Howrah roads at night and demanded immediate cop posting at Pilkh-ana crossing. RAF personnel dispersed the crowd before taking the body to a government hospital. Cops said they have contacted the truck owner and are in the process of arresting the driver.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/truck-set-ablaze-road-blocked-after-accident/articleshow/84077073.cms||Rupak Banerjee
---||Delhi||East Delhi corporation charging clinics Rs 24,000 extra for waste removal: Saurabh Bharadwaj||NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj on Friday said doctors’ clinics in east Delhi would have to pay an additional fee of Rs 24,000 annually for removal of garbage. East Delhi Municipal Corporation has introduced it in the name of the solid waste management rules 2016 in addition to the existing Rs 6,000 annual fee, he said. “EDMC has also introduced a professional tax on chartered accountants, architects, doctors, etc.” Bharadwaj said, demanding rollback of the “irrational fees and taxes”. A signature campaign was launched by AAP on Thursday to raise a voice against the corporation’s “harassment of traders”. Bharadwaj alleged that the corporations had started looting people by increasing taxes, trade license fees, etc. “Doctors are already made to pay Rs 500 per month to get biomedical waste removed, which means they pay Rs 6,000 annually. Now, they’ll have to pay an additional sum of Rs 24,000. Each clinic will pay Rs 30,000 just because they have to get their waste picked up,” Bharadwaj said, claiming that the corporation had been harassing people and arm-twisting them. AAP apprehended that the step might be followed by two other municipal corporations. “BJP is counting its last days in the corporations and people will not re-elect it, so it has started to loot people,” Bharadwaj claimed. Delhi BJP general secretary Harsh Malhotra said Bharadwaj was misleading people. “These charges have not been levied by EDMC but ordered by Delhi government in the gazette notification dated January 15, 2018. The new charges will be levied as per medical unit i.e. clinic, nursing home and hospital size and the waste generated. Despite the new provision, no substantial rise will take place for next-door physicians’ clinics,” Malhotra claimed. He called upon Delhi government to immediately withdraw the notification to allow relief to the medical fraternity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-charging-clinics-rs-24k-extra-for-waste-removal-aap/articleshow/84079337.cms||---

The technique would help in surgeries of nasal septum, polyps and other problems with more accuracy. Dr Vineet Sinha, head of the ENT department, will monitor the endoscopic surgeries. Though 22 surgeries of mucormycosis were performed at PMCH in about a month, many other patients had been referred to AIIMS-Patna and IGIMS for endoscopic surgeries, said Dr Thakur. In another development, ten more beds attached to the central monitoring system in the new surgical emergency of PMCH will become functional from Saturday. Thakur said the central monitoring system would enable the doctors on duty to keep watch on various parameters like blood pressure, pulse rare and ECG of patients from a monitor without visiting each bed. It would help in faster response in case of emergency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pmch-ready-to-begin-endoscopic-surgeries-superintendent/articleshow/84075124.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Kanpur||Kanpur: Four pharmacists found guilty in Remdesivir scam||KANPUR: Four pharmacists have been found guilty in the Remdesivir scam at Lala Lajpat Rai (LLR) hospital, where injections were allegedly issued in the name of dead Covid-19 patients. The committee headed by the chief development officer (CDO) has submitted the report to district magistrate (DM) Alok Tiwari. “The probe report has been received and four pharmacists have been found guilty. Action will be taken against them soon,” said the DM. The doctors, meanwhile, have been given a clean chit in this case. Other employees have also been acquitted. These injections were issued from the store in the name of the two patients who had already died due to coronavirus. During the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, there was a crisis of Remdesivir injections in the market. People were ready to spend Rs 50,000 to Rs 55,000 for procuring the injection. Taking advantage of this, black-marketeers started selling injections at premium rates. Police had then arrested four persons including two nursing staff of LLR hospital for selling injections. A few days later, it came to light that Remdesivir injections were issued against the names of the two Covid -19 patients admitted to the hospital, and who had already died. “Those injections were also shown to be administered to patients,” sources at LLR said. The matter was brought to the knowledge of then principal of GSVM Medical college Prof. RB Kamal under whose jurisdiction the hospital comes. On the basis of the report of the inquiry committee, he suspended the sister in-charge and pharmacist of the neuroscience centre of Covid-19 in the hospital and issued show-cause notices to eight nursing staff. At the same time, the DM also ordered an inquiry. A three-member investigation team was formed under the supervision of CDO Mahendra Kumar, in which ADM (City) Atul Kumar and CMO were also included. The committee has recommended action in the report considering four pharmacists guilty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/four-pharmacists-found-guilty-in-remdesivir-scam/articleshow/84076334.cms||---

Most places in south Bihar are likely to witness light rainfall and humid weather. Yellow code alert has also been issued for thunderstorm with lightning over the next four days. The yellow code warning alerts the authorities to be watchful for extreme weather conditions. The expected rainfall has been attributed to two weather factors in the region -- monsoon trough line passing from north-west Rajasthan to east Assam via Bihar and strong moist south-westerly winds from the Bay of Bengal to north-east India. Patna weathermen said moderate rainfall was witnessed in most of north Bihar along with heavy to very rainfall at a few places over the last 24 hours. Chanpatia received the maximum 204mm rainfall, followed by Bagaha (180mm) in West Champaran and Birpur (142mm) in Supaul.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/heavy-rainfall-lightning-alerts-in-north-bihar/articleshow/84075999.cms||---

---||Business||Government asks NPCI to start vaccine e-voucher platform||MUMBAI: The government has asked the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to launch a platform for electronic vaccine vouchers. These vouchers will be like electronic prepaid instruments that can be used only for vaccination. Employers can purchase these vouchers in bulk and these will be sent to the smartphone or feature phone of the employee. The employee will then share the voucher at the hospital for cashless vaccination, and the hospital will get the money instantly credited to its account. According to payments industry sources, the NPCI is in the process of short-listing banks for issuing these vouchers. Banks, in turn, will offer this as a payments service in partnership with technology service providers. The intention is to deliver the voucher as a QR code to smartphones and as a code to feature phones. The same mobile can be used to deliver vouchers for the entire family. Currently, private organisations that want to tie up for vaccinating their employees and families do it in a camp mode. This is feasible only when there is a sizeable number of employees. In many organisations that have shifted to work-from-home, employees have moved out of the city to their hometowns and returning to the workplace is not feasible. Vaccine vouchers will enable the employees to get vaccinated at the nearest centre. The vaccine e-vouchers will also enable the private sector to plan when it comes to booking orders with vaccine manufacturers. For hospitals, the advantage is that they will receive the payment instantly in their bank account. According to sources, although the platform was being developed for vaccines, it could be used for any form of targeted direct benefit transfers. This will eliminate the need for subsidies and providers would not face any hassles from recovering payments from the government. Bankers say that the platform is similar to the prepaid gift card solutions offered by some entities, including e-commerce players.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-asks-npci-to-start-vaccine-e-voucher-platform/articleshow/84079269.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Kozhikode||Kerala: CPM MLA faces party action over Kuttiady dissent||KOZHIKODE: CPM Kozhikode district secretariat has initiated steps to take action against MLA KP Kunhammed Kutty in connection with the public show of dissent in the party over candidature in Kuttiady constituency in the run up to the recent assembly elections. The district secretariat proposed to the state secretariat and state committee for demoting him from the district secretariat to the district committee. But, the nod of state secretariat and state committee is needed for it. Meanwhile, CPM district secretary P Mohanan refuted reports of disciplinary action against Kutty. The district secretariat took the view that Kutty wished to become the candidate in Kuttiady and couldn’t effectively intervene to prevent public protest against giving the seat to KC(M) as per LDF’s decision. However, it is not known whether the state secretariat will endorse the decision to relegate him to a lower committee as it is not usual to take disciplinary action when the party is preparing to start its organizational conferences. There are chances of the party deciding to opt for a reduced disciplinary action. CPM had faced an unprecedented public protest from local cadres in Kuttiady against handing over the seat to KC(M). The party’s rank and file had rooted for Kutty’s candidate in the first protest march and they had put up posters and banners in support of his candidature in the area. The local party cadres had taken out a huge protest march on March 10 in a public show of dissent which shook the CPM leadership. Realizing that the discontent could spill over to other constituencies in the district and spoil LDF’s chances in Nadapuram and Vadakara, the state leadership then initiated talks with KC(M) chairman Jose K Mani. Kutty was fielded as the candidate. He won from the seat with a margin of 333 votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/cpm-mla-faces-party-action-over-kuttiady-dissent/articleshow/84077227.cms||---
---||Agra||Mamata Banerjee's super hit 'khela hobe' poll slogan enters Uttar Pradesh||AGRA: “Khela Hobe” – Didi’s popular slogan that caught the fancy of the Bengal voters during the recent assembly elections, has been swiftly adopted by the Samajwadi Party workers in Uttar Pradesh, who have painted its Bhojpuri version - “Khela Hoi” - on the walls of several cities across the state. After the slogans appeared initially in Varanasi and Kanpur, it is now painted on walls of several other cities, including Aligarh. Even hoardings of “Khela Hoi” have been put up. Party’s state spokesperson Juhi Singh said that though this is not an official slogan of the party yet, party workers are using it widely as they seem to like it. “Our party will play the game with a strategy,” she said, adding that this phrase came from Bengal where Trinamool contested elections against all odds and won. The hoardings with the slogans — “Ab UP me khela hoi” (now the game is on in UP) have been put at various vantage points in Aligarh. “This message is for the ouster of BJP from power in the 2022 state elections like it happened in West Bengal,” said Ajju Ishhaq, former city president of Samajwadi party in Aligarh. He added that unemployed youths and people from backward castes will come together to vote the SP to power in 2022. When contacted, BJP MP from Aligarh, Satish Gautam, said this is UP, not Bengal. “They can write whatever they want, but the Yogi government will be formed again in the state,” said Gautam, adding that they can “khela” only on posters and hoardings, not on the ground. “They could not play the role of opposition in the state and want to fight elections on the basis of slogans borrowed from another state,” said BJP’s state spokesperson Chandramohan, adding that they “don’t have anything to say against the government, so they are now copying slogans”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/didis-super-hit-khela-hobe-poll-slogan-enters-up-sp-sounds-khela-hoi-bugle/articleshow/84075121.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

It was while probing the case of the missing boy, whose body was found near a factory on Nauganva Sadat road, that the Amroha police unravelled a saga of betrayal and guilt. Police learnt that Ahmad, a resident of Moradabad, was filled with rage when he discovered that his wife had allegedly developed a relationship with her brother-in-law, Shakir. In his bid for exacting revenge, he and a relative hatched a plan to kidnap Shakir’s son and kill him. Giving details, Poonam, Amroha superintendent of police, said, “ On June 28, Shakir filed a complaint that his son, Kamil Ahmed, had gone missing from their house in Kutkae mohalla in Amroha city. The next day, the child’s body was found.” While investigating the case, police were informed about Ahmad’s suicide. Investigations revealed that Ahmad was seen with his relative, Shanu, of Joe village in Amroha on June 28. Suspecting a connection between the two cases, Shanu was picked up for questioning. Shanu confessed how they had lured the boy to Naugawan Sadat road and killed him by smashing a brick on his head. Then they dumped the body in a pit on the roadside. But Ahmad could not bear to live with the knowledge of the crime and ended his life, said Shanu, who has been arrested and sent to jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/feeling-guilty-over-killing-nephew-9-man-takes-poison/articleshow/84075119.cms||Harveer Dabas

The value of seized gold is pegged at Rs 2,99,16,042. The officials attached to the Coimbatore regional unit of DRI said they were tipped about the gold smuggling bid and based on that they had intensified checking at the airport. An official said the six had boarded the Air Arabia flight from Sharjah and landed in the city at 3.50am on Friday. “We frisked them completely and based on the tip recovered the gold that they had concealed in jeans trousers and undergarments. We have seized 6kg and 117g gold from them.” The official said the six had melted the gold and affixed the same on to their undergarments and trousers with the help of some chemical. “It weighed 7kg and 907g with the chemical. We processed it and separated the gold later. There was a difference of more than 1kg in the weight then.” The official said the six - Mannankatti Arumugam, Bajarul Rahman Haji Abdul Hameed, Emayaraj Madhavan, Mubin Ahmed Sulaiman, Thirumoorthy Rajendran and Habeeb Maraikayar Seeni Ibrahimsha - were handed over to the air intelligence wing of customs. “The accused are natives of Viluppuram, Cuddalore, Ramanathapuram and Vellore districts.” Another source said the accused were working as drivers, construction workers and mobile phone repairs in Dubai and Sharjah. “They did not have enough work because of the pandemic situation and decided to return to their hometowns. Meanwhile, some people approached and told them that they would bear the travel expenses and provide commission for smuggling the gold to India. Lured by the prospect of making a quick buck, the six agreed but only to be caught at the airport.” Customs officials have registered a first information report against the six, who were later let off on conditional bail. They have been directed to appear before the officials whenever summoned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/six-held-at-airport-for-smuggling-6kg-gold/articleshow/84079332.cms||---

---||Nagpur||We’re working to make our cities climate resilient, says Maharashtra environment minister Aaditya Thackeray||Whether it’s heatwaves, drought, severe floods or erratic rainfall, the devastating impact of climate change is evident in the state. The bright spot, however, is that policy-makers have not just acknowledged climate change as a serious threat but are also introducing steps to combat it and make sure that the state doesn’t fall short of meeting long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. To know more about the mitigation measures, TOI spoke to environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, under whose new-age leadership the state recently joined the Under2 Coalition and also sanctioned Rs 141 crore to enhance the resilience of coastal communities to climate change. Excerpts- What was the reason behind joining the Under2 Coalition? The idea is to learn and exchange perspectives and ideas with governments who already have climate action plans and have gained a deeper learning curve in fighting climate change. In the last one year, Maharashtra, too, has taken some significant steps for environment conservation, right from saving the Aarey forest to protecting 9,800 hectares of mangroves. To build on more such efforts, it’s essential to gain perspective from precedents that already exist. How would the Under2 Coalition help the government in tackling climate crisis? What is the roadmap for the state? By joining the C40 cities climate change group, we are working towards capacity- building in our cities and readying them for climate resilience and mitigation. Under 2 Coalition on the other hand will provide an overarching support to the state government and also peer-to-peer learning opportunities for the state. It will also help to tap into green financing. In the last few years, Maharashtra has been significantly vulnerable to climate change. It has the highest number of non-attainment cities in the country where pollution levels exceed permissible standards. How does the state plan to fight this? Maharashtra has been the epicentre of economic growth for India and also continues to be the growth engine of the country. We are now moving towards sustainable growth practices by engaging with cities and states who have gone through a similar journey and that will help us to accelerate our action towards achieving net zero emission targets. What is Maharashtra’s contribution towards meeting Paris goals? The state mitigation and adaptation programme (Majhi Vasundhara) is an effort that is working across all administrative stakeholders in the government. Through this initiative, local governments are covering five elements of nature and are benchmarked accordingly. The Majhi Vasundhara initiative sequestered roughly 370,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide within 8 months of its initiation last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/were-working-to-make-our-cities-climate-resilient-says-environ-min/articleshow/84077219.cms||Manka Behl

The impact has been severe on consumers and transporters, as prices have risen by nearly 10% in a matter of 78 days.  Fuel prices have continuously increased since April 15. “Sales in April and May were certainly muted due to restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-19. However, in June, as markets reopened, sales volumes have recovered significantly,” said a member of the Federation of Gujarat Petroleum Dealers’ Association (FGPDA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/petrol-price-hits-rs-96-per-litre-in-city/articleshow/84079380.cms||---

He was speaking against the backdrop of action by the Enforcement Directorate, which has attached a sugar mill leased to a company related to deputy CM Ajit Pawar and his wife Sunetra. The action was part of a probe into a money laundering case involving Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSCB), an ED release said. “Jarandeshwar is the tip of the iceberg. I am writing a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah,” said Patil. Patil further said the state should get empirical data about OBC and Maratha reservation. “The state authorities should undertake a survey to help define the ‘backwardness’ of the Maratha community and the percentage of OBCs,” Patil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-bjp-seeks-probe-into-auction-of-co-op-sugar-factories/articleshow/84082718.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Man selling leopard claws, other parts held at Kashmere Gate ISBT||NEW DELHI: A man was arrested near Kashmere Gate ISBT on Friday with leopard claws, teeth and other body parts by Delhi forest and wildlife department in a joint operation with Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB). A forest official said the man was approached first by a decoy individual, who met him on pretext of buying the items, before teams were sent in to arrest him. An official said the accused did not seem like a repeat offender; however, investigation was under way to determine if other individuals were involved. Aditya Madanpotra, deputy conservator of forests (Central), said inputs were received, and based on intelligence, a trap was set up to call the man near the Kashmere Gate terminal. “Our team approached him on the pretext of buying the items and subsequently tried to catch him in the act. He tried to flee, but was caught by WCCB and forest teams,” said Madanpotra. The man revealed that he did not kill the animal, but allegedly took them from a dead leopard in Shimla, he added. “Prima facie, it appears that he has not done this in the past, but he knew these parts had a lot of value in the international black market. He may have sold some already because he had them for over two years now,” Madanpotra added. While smuggling and wildlife trafficking of animals is not common in Delhi, the capital is often used as a smuggling corridor to send items to other parts of the country and abroad. The official said the man had been booked under relevant sections of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The forest department had also launched an integrated tree and wildlife helpline number – 1800118600— earlier this year where complaints regarding wildlife trafficking or wildlife in distress can be made. Only last week, forest officials in Gurgaon arrested a man for smuggling 23 turtles from Delhi into the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-selling-leopard-claws-other-parts-held-at-kashmere-gate-isbt/articleshow/84079395.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Agra||Agra sees record 72% dip in pre-monsoon rainfall in June||AGRA: There has been a record 72% dip in pre-monsoon rainfall in Agra in the month of June this year. From June 1 to July 1, only 16.3 mm of rainfall was recorded as against the expected 58.4 mm, according to the meteorological department. During the same period, Agra experienced the highest average temperature in six years. On Friday, Agra was the hottest district in UP. The mercury touched 42.5 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal. The minimum temperature was recorded at 28.4 degrees, two degrees above normal. However, a light shower for a few minutes in the evening brought some relief. With high humidity and the mercury level breaching the 40-degrees mark, patients are queuing up at the out-patient departments (OPD) of government medical centres with complaints of diarrhoea, vomiting and heat stroke. Chief medical officer RC Pandey said, “The number of patents has increased on an average by 10% across the district this month. A majority of the patients are suffering from vomiting, diarrhoea and heatstroke. Children account for the maximum number of heat –related cases. OPDs at the government centres are efficiently addressing the situation.” CMO said the best way to avoid illness under the current weather conditions is to drink plenty of water, maintain high standards of cleanliness and consume simple and fresh food items in limited proportions. He suggested eating plenty of fruits. In case of diarrhoea, oral rehydration salts (ORS) should be consumed, he added. According to the weatherman, there is a possibility of one or two spells of rain or thundershowers from July 4 onwards. With a partly cloudy sky, a slight dip in temperature is likely.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-sees-record-72-dip-in-pre-monsoon-rainfall-in-june/articleshow/84075134.cms||---

Chocko Valliappa, vice-chairman, Sona Group of Institutions, said there was a growing potential for engineering courses. “Ashok Leyland needs women engineers for their industrial design division. Google, Paypal and a few others are looking for data analysts. There is going to be a huge demand for core engineering. Substantial work has been outsourced from Germany with China getting sidelined in the global arena. All this will lead to a huge manufacturing shift to India,” he said. R Chellappan, managing director, SWELECT Energy Systems, concurred with Chacko but urged the students to equip themselves to meet the challenges. “You need CAP - creativity and curiosity, analytical skills and problem-solving skills for growth.” Venkatraman Umakanth, head, market development and learner success, FutureSkills – Nasscom, underlined the importance of unlearning and learning while things are changing rapidly. The experts pointed out that there was a high demand for artificial intelligence and data science. They said there was a 10% more demand in terms of hiring women engineers in core industries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/demand-up-for-women-engineers-say-experts/articleshow/84079411.cms||---

Justice Ashok Menon declined a stay after considering a petition (Crl. M.C. No. 2912/2021) filed by Aisha challenging the case registered by Kavaratti police. The court said the investigation is going on and is at its nascent stage. Investigation agencies have to be given more time, the court said while asking Lakshadweep administration to produce details of the probe so far. The case against Aisha was registered on the basis of a BJP worker’s complaint. While seeking to quash the case, she contended that she did not mean to offend sentiments while making the said remark. The word ‘bioweapon’ was not used in its literal sense and was only intended as a criticism of the administrative action, the petition said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sedition-case-hc-declines-to-stay-probe/articleshow/84077268.cms||---
---||Agra||Mother of two shoots herself in Agra, leaves behind a 3-page letter for PM||AGRA: A 30-year-old married woman allegedly shot herself dead with a country-made pistol in Agra’s Vidyapuram Colony on Friday morning. She left behind a three-page letter in the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to "ensure the safety of women in their houses". In the letter, Mona Dwivedi, mother of two children, held her brother-in-laws, Ambuj and Pankaj, responsible for her death. “Ambuj and Pankaj, who are connected with the ruling party, beat me up as I belong to a very poor family. My mother died in my childhood and my father is an alcoholic. They threatened to kill me, if I narrated my plight to anyone,” the letter reads. Mona shot herself around 10am. After hearing the gun shot, other women members in the house reached Mona’s room, which was locked from inside. They broke the door and found Mona lying in a pool of blood. They then took her to a hospital where she was declared “brought dead”. She shot herself in the chest, police said, adding that the country-made pistol, which seems to be 25 years old, has been recovered from the spot. Mona also expressed her desire to meet the PM, if she "survived". According to the letter, the woman got married at the age of 16 and could not speak up against her in-laws despite being repeatedly tortured, as she was scared that her husband would leave her. Police said that during inquiries it was found there was some family dispute and her brother-in-laws misbehaved and passed sarcastic comments on her. Talking to TOI, in-charge of Etmadulla police station, Amarpal Singh, said that she had sent this letter to her family on their mobile phone, which is now being viral on social media. “The letter was not found at the spot,” he said, adding that preliminary investigations revealed that this was a case of suicide. The police have not received any complaint till the filing of this report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/mother-of-two-shoots-herself-in-agra-leaves-behind-a-3-page-letter-for-pm/articleshow/84075142.cms||---

Azad’s newly-floated Azad Samaj Party kicked-off a state-wide cycle rally on Thursday. It was in Muzaffarnagar on Friday that party chief told TOI that its slogan was ‘Jaati Todo Samaj Jodo’ (break the cycle of caste and unite the society). “For the next eight months, we will work hard for a change of guard in the state. Every section of the society has been badly affected by the working of this government.” He said: “In the next few months, BJP will try everything to divide people. That is why we have come forward to unite society with the message of brotherhood. Bahujan Samaj is divided into 6,741 castes and we are going to unite all of them.” He also alleged that ruling BJP has not done any development work in the state. Azad said his party got a good response in the rural polls. “Not just in Muzaffarnagar, people have given us a mandate across the state in the panchayat polls. We have also won seats in Saharanpur, Bijnor, Kanpur, Etawah, Fatehpur, Kannauj, Gorakhpur, Balrampur, Basti, Azamgarh, Sultanpur, Unnao, Lucknow, Raebareli, Ambedkar Nagar and Aligarh. This shows people are supporting our candidates.

---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: No decision on revision of tipping fee to company lifting garbage||LUDHIANA: The civic authorities are unable to reach any conclusion about the revision of tipping fee to be given to private company for lifting of garbage from secondary collection points. Mayor Balkar Sandhu had formed a committee to take a decision on the revision, but the panel members gave the decision rights to him and the commissioner. Now again the mayor has announced that the matter will be decided in the finance and contracts committee meeting. Sandhu said, “I will do whatever the committee members will recommend. We will fix the revised tipping fee in the F&CC meeting.” One of the members of sub-committee and Congress councillor Jaiprakash said, “The committee has agreed on revision of tipping fee and we will shortly submit a report to the mayor and the commissioner.” Garbage processing at the Tajpur Road dump had been stopped and before the authorities could take any decision to restart it, the tipping fee issue left them in a tight spot. The MC had served a notice on A2Z Waste Management Company and their services ended on February 4, following which processing of garbage was stopped at the dump. Then the civic body gave the waste lifting work to another firm, which demanded revision of tipping fee due to increase in diesel rates. The company had threatened to stop lifting after June 30 if the rates were not revised, forcing the mayor to form a sub-committee. The committee members conducted a meeting and decided to give the powers to the mayor and the commissioner.  Garbage piles up at Tajpur Road dump The city generates 1,100 tonnes of garbage daily and since the closure of the processing plant at main dump, much of it is getting piled up. The authorities are yet to officially hire a company for running the processing plant at the dump. The officials also could not start the bioremediation of legacy waste kept at the dump as directed by the National Green Tribunal committee members. Underground water polluted The members of the NGT committee have directed the civic officials to ensure that nobody drinks groundwater in areas up to 2km from the dump as it is polluted. Moreover, many a time garbage catches fire at the dump and poisonous smoke reaches the houses of people living nearby.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/no-decision-on-revision-of-tipping-fee-to-company-lifting-garbage/articleshow/84075242.cms||---
---||Delhi||Cost imposed on plea to put off test: Delhi HC to hear doctors on July 12||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Friday said it will hear on July 12, a plea by an association of doctors seeking to remove adverse comments and costs slapped by an earlier court order against them. A single judge had earlier dismissed their petition seeking to postpone Foreign Medical Graduate Examination (FMGE) screening test due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation in the country. A bench of Justices C Hari Shankar and Subramonium Prasad said there was no justification for taking up the matter now and listed it before the roster bench on July 12. “You are only challenging the costs and adverse observations, let it come before the roster bench,” the court said. The petitioner, Association of MD Physicians, has appealed against the June 11 order imposing a cost of Rs 25,000 and making certain remarks, while dismissing the petition seeking to postpone the exam that was scheduled for June 18. The association, which also has as members some foreign medical graduates who have completed their primary medical courses in institutions abroad, had said there are a limited number of cities being notified as centres for the FMGE screening test and a large number of candidates will be forced to travel without having received even one dose of Covid-19 vaccine. The single judge, while dismissing the petition had said there was no doubt that while arriving at the decision to hold the FMGE- June, 2021 on the scheduled date, the respondents, National Board of Examination (NBE) and National Medical Commission (NMC) have considered all aspects of the matter. “The fact of the matter is that the pandemic is a reality that one has to live with, for at least some time in the future, but all essential activities will have to go on, albeit with necessary precautionary measures,” it had said. The plea had said on one hand the authorities have postponed the National Eligibility Entrance Test (Post Graduate) -2021 due to the ongoing pandemic, on the other hand, they have decided to conduct the FMGE screening test at times when the country is overcoming the second wave and preparing for a possible third wave of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cost-imposed-on-plea-to-put-off-test-hc-to-hear-docs-on-july-12/articleshow/84079512.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

With 904 people getting discharged, the number of active cases stood at 3,382. The total number of people recovered grew to 2,15,053, taking the recovery rate to 97.5%. The district recorded seven deaths due to the virus increasing the toll to 2,058. The seven victims included a 34-year-old man who tested positive on June 12 and got hospitalized on June 20 with complaints of fever and difficulty in breathing. He passed away on Thursday due to Covid-19 pneumonia. Meanwhile, vaccination centres continued to remain a flashpoint for political parties to gain mileage out of the drive. On Friday, a verbal clash erupted between district BJP and DMK members in front of the vaccination centre at the Coimbatore Clothes Merchants Association Girls Higher Secondary School on Raja Street. An officer with Variety Hall police station, who had to pacify both the parties, said the issue began with BJP members erecting a flex board in the school while vaccination was going on. “The flex board thanked the new chief minister for implementing BJP government-initiated vaccination programme. BJP members claimed that they had a right to the claim as it’s a central government scheme,” he said. “However, DMK members accused them of trying to gain political mileage and demanded that the flex be removed,” he added. Around 25 people from each party had gathered and began indulging in a verbal clash. “We pacified members of both the parties. School authorities filed a complaint against BJP members for erecting a flex without permission from them, the corporation or police,” he said. Meanwhile, three more tribal people from Anamalai Tiger Reserve, in Tirupur district, tested positive for Covid-19. The three tribals were a 55-year-old man and a 45-year-old woman from Mavadappu settlement and a 40-year-old woman from Kurumalai settlement. Health department officials had totally tested 136 tribal people across four settlements, after a 31-year-old woman from Kulipatti tribal settlement tested positive after her delivery. “The three of them have been admitted to Udumalpet GH. We have also spoken to the tribal heads and instructed them to reach out for help if anybody else developed symptoms,” a health officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dist-maintains-declining-trend-records-486-cases/articleshow/84079461.cms||---

On Friday, the directorate of education issued the transfer order in ‘consequent to the administration’s decision to rationalise the staff of the education office in Kochi’. “The education officer in Kochi was responsible for processing stipends, hostel fee, tuition fee, letter of sponsorship, scholarship reimbursement and all other concerns of students. It was unusual as the officer was transferred and no one was appointed in his place. Now, students will have to go to Kavaratti for such purposes and it would cause delays leading to students facing problems in colleges. This has happened once when the scholarship wing was transferred to Kavaratti in the past,” said Faisal. He added that the administration was not consulting with the elected representatives before taking such a decision that affected people. As per the order, posts of an accountant, a stenographer, a UD clerk, an LD clerk and an MSE were among those being transferred. The order also directed the shifting materials like electronic equipment, furniture and files dealt by the said staff to the directorate of education in Kavaratti.  The education officer in Kochi, as per the order, has to ‘relieve the officials with the direction to report before the director of education within seven days’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/moving-education-staff-to-kavaratti-unhelpful-mp/articleshow/84077292.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Uttar Pradesh: Eye on 2022 assembly polls, Congress to bet big on social media||PRAYAGRAJ: Be it catchy slogans, attacking the ruling BJP or taking up party ideology, the Congress leadership has decided to make the most of social media platforms ahead of the most-awaited 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly polls. To contest the elections with full valour, Congress has decided to strengthen its organisational structure at gram sabha level and empower foot soldiers about an understanding of issues that the party will be raising in its election campaign on social media. Claiming that social media could be a powerful tool in strengthening public connect, the UPCC leadership held a two-day training session for block pramukhs and office-bearers of eight districts, including Trans Ganga and Trans Yamuna of Prayagraj district, Ghazipur, Chandauli, Mirzapur, Sonbhadra, Jaunpur, and Bhadohi at Bhagautipur in Shringverpur block on Friday. A team of Congress leaders from Chhattishgarh also interacted with party leaders and workers and exchanged ideas and suggestions, which would be helpful in coordination between party leaders and workers and reaching the last mile voter base. Congress leaders were briefed about the public platforms that could be used for debates and take up party ideology and principles. UPCC chief Ajay Kumar Lallu asked the party leaders and workers to connect with people through social media and inform them about the wrongdoings of rival parties, including the BJP-led central and state governments. He also asked the party workers to strengthen the base at grassroots level — gram sabha and nayay panchayat — and induct more and more members into party fold. Lallu said: “ Party workers should focus on catchy slogans at village and block levels to project the wrongdoings of the BJP-led state and central governments.” He appealed to the workers to visit the houses of those people whose lost their family members to Covid-19 and offer help. Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) secretary and in charge of Jaunpur district, Mukund Tiwari told TOI that the “party leaders and workers were asked to create WhatsApp groups to connect with each other and take up activities on frequent intervals. He said the leaders on ground level have been asked to connect with the masses through various modes, including social media, and communicate the achievements during the UPA government. Meanwhile, Congress leaders and workers also took out a prabhat pheri in Shringverpur block. Apart from Prayagraj, the training session for party leaders and workers will be held from July 3 to July 8 across the state.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Health panel fixes key Covid test charges after complaints from patients||KOLKATA: The West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission (WBCERC) has capped the charges on five radiological tests and 15 pathological tests, including several which are often recommended to Covid patients. An order to this effect was passed by the health panel on Friday, mentioning that all private hospitals with more than 150 beds are bound to follow it. The commission said it has been getting complaints of high investigation charges, especially from Covid patients throughout the pandemic. The decision to fix the rates was taken after recommendations from two expert committees. “We had sought inputs from two committees to decide on the reasonable charges for these tests. Even as we had shared the charges with some big hospitals, some said they needed a formal order. Now, with this order all have to abide by this rate,” said WBCERC chairman Justice (retired) Ashim Kumar Banerjee. Private hospitals, however, have questioned the blanket capping of the rates for all types of patients. “Why would the charge be applicable to a corporate patients staying in a single cabin or a deluxe room? We request the commission to reconsider this order by defining the patient type on whom these charges are applicable,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. Private hospitals also said a hospital lab is functional 24x7 unlike standalone diagnostic labs. “Capping of rates, especially for a premier hospital, works against the principle of cross-subsidization,” said Rupali Basu, managing director, Woodlands Multispecialty Hospital. “Labs in private hospitals run 24x7 unlike diagnostic centres. So manpower and maintenance, including quality control cost, is much higher,” said president Association of Hospitals of Eastern India Rupak Barua. “The capped price is applicable for tests conducted on non-Covid patients as well,” said the commission chairman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/health-panel-fixes-key-covid-test-charges-after-plaints-from-patients/articleshow/84077299.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

With this, the value of total attachments in the case has reached Rs 14,522 crore. The agency has estimated the value of ‘proceeds of crime’ at Rs 16,000 crore. The Sandesara brothers, wanted for siphoning off Rs 16,000 crore from government banks, fled to Nigeria with their family in 2017. The siblings, who have since been declared fugitive economic offenders, with non-bailable warrants and two red corner notices issued by Interpol pending against them, have been shuttling between countries which they consider to be outside the grasp of India’s agencies. Interpol has issued red corner notices against two members of the Sandesara family. Before his death, Patel, too, was questioned multiple times in connection with financial dealings he, his son Faisal and son-in-law Irfan had with Sandesara brothers. “Eight properties, three vehicles and several bank accounts having total value of Rs 8.79 crore have been attached under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in the case,” the ED said. The agency has filed a prosecution complaint and four supplementary chargesheets and arrested four persons. Nitin Sandesara, Chetan Sandesara, Dipti Chetan Sandesara and Hitesh Patel have been declared fugitives by a special PMLA court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-attaches-assets-of-ahmed-patels-kin-and-film-stars/articleshow/84081821.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Infrastructure work obstructs view of 54 traffic signals in Nagpur||NAGPUR: Call it a technical glitch or sheer oversight. The work on the construction of MahaMetro and flyover pillars across Nagpur is blocking the view of as many as 54 traffic signals. Now, a member of the parliament road safety committee (PRSC) has proposed replacing these signals with hanging traffic lights. As per a study by the NMC traffic department, Metro pillars have affected the view of 25 signals from Automotive Square to the airport T-Point. Similarly, the view of 30 traffic signals has also been affected on the east-west corridor. Ongoing infrastructure projects have also left at least 20 signals defunct. Besides signals, many busy roads and intersections have been narrowed down to accommodate the pillars. Citing examples, traffic police pointed out that many Metro pillars, including those at Munje Square, Variety Square and Dhantoli Square have become obstacles and accident prone. Pillars and stairways of Metro rail occupy a lot of road space, squeezing vehicles and also inconveniencing the public, said the traffic police, citing the example of Jaiprakash Nagar, Central Jail station and stations on north Ambazari road. Vice-president of PRSC and Rajya Sabha member Dr Vikas Mahatme told TOI that the existing traffic signals need to be repositioned. “The help of Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology will be sought for studying the strengthening of traffic signals in the city,” he said. He was quick to say that “we have to pay some fee to the institute only then will they start identifying junctions which need hanging traffic signals.” Funds will be sought from the central road fund (CRF) department, which comes under Union minister for road transport Nitin Gadkari. Mahatme said NMC and other government agencies like NHAI, PWD and NIT have claimed to have carried out rectification of accident-prone spots. “But we need a scientific study from VNIT, so that road accidents could be brought to zero,” he said. The CRF will also be used for conducting a study of accident-prone spots. Gadkari has been approached for funds to identify and rectify accident-prone areas. “The union minister has given a positive response to the needs of the city,” said Mahatme. A study of accident-prone spots in rural Nagpur has already commenced with the help of Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association and improvement work will commence soon, he said. The MP expressed concern over the rise in human errors in road accidents. “We need to focus more on educating and creating awareness among motorists about road safety,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/infra-work-obstructs-view-of-54-traffic-signals-in-city/articleshow/84077312.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Kozhikode||Kerala: Two youths drag guest worker on road, held||KOZHIKODE: Police have taken two youths into custody for allegedly dragging a migrant worker from Bihar for around 50m on the road following an attempt by the motorbike-borne accused to rob the victim’s mobile phone at Iyyad near Koduvally. Two youths Sanu Krishnan, 18, and Shamnaz, 23, hailing from Kakoor, were nabbed on Friday, said Koduvally police. The victim Ali Akbar, 23, hailing from Bihar, had sustained injuries in the incident. Police said that the duo allegedly approached Akbar on a bike on Wednesday and asked him to lend his mobile phone to make a call. The pillion rider acted as if making a call while the other motorist tried to speed away. Akbar, who was holding the rear handle of the bike, was dragged on the road for about 50m. In the melee, the mobile phone of one of the motorists fell on the road and police identified the number to nab the accused. Kondotty MLA Dr M K Muneer condemned the incident and urged police to take appropriate action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/2-youths-drag-guest-worker-on-road-held/articleshow/84077344.cms||---

Sources in the civic body said the situation could improve further next week. For people who have been uncertain about the second jab that is due, there was palpable relief on Friday as centres did not turn them away like they had on Tuesday and Wednesday citing acute shortage of vaccines. On Thursday, the inoculation drive was suspended to observe Doctors’ Day. Also, the Chatbot facility to book vaccine slots will take in only the second dose recipients for now. On Friday, half the vaccine doses given to the centres were meant for those who were due to get the second dose. “We were spared the embarrassment of having to tell people that there weren’t enough vaccines. On Friday, supply was adequate and we vaccinated most of the people,” said an officer at a KMC clinic in Tollygunge. Sources said allotment for the civic body’s vaccination centres would rise next week. Retired government official Ratan Dutta, who on Friday stood in a long queue to for his second Covishield dose at Garia Atabagan clinic, said: “This was my third attempt in a week. Earlier attempts went in vain as the supply was scanty.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/40-shots/clinic-on-wed-to-200-on-fri-kmc-ramps-up-drive/articleshow/84077354.cms||Saikat Ray

---||Allahabad||Uttar Pradesh: Vaccine shortage, OTP verification hamper vaccination drive in Sangam||PRAYAGRAJ: The shortage of vaccines and the 'time-consuming' OTP verification process for the spot registration is hampering the Covid-19 vaccination drive in Sangam city. Health officials associated with the vaccination exercise claimed that apart from facing a shortage of vaccines at all vaccination sites, the OTP verification exercise for the on-the-spot registration process is proving to be a time-consuming process, which also includes completing formalities on the CoWin portal. All these factors have hampered the vaccination work to a major extent. As a result, many recipients of all age groups had to return without jabs for the past two days. Dr Utsav Singh, in charge of vaccination at MLN Medical College, told TOI, "Due to the shortage of vaccine, we are not taking up the first dose of vaccination of 45 plus age of recipients. He further added, "The OTP verification exercise for the on-spot registration formality which consumes quite some time has also hampered the vaccination exercise to a major extent." Those who took the first dose in the first week of April, are arriving for their second dose and jabs are being administered to them. The number of recipients is increasing per day in all centres since recipients who took their first jab in march last week, are also approaching the vaccination sites for the second dose which is pushing up the number of beneficiaries. "It takes on average 15 minutes per recipient to complete formalities on the portal including OTP verification,” said Dr Singh. "Time duration for the verification increases if the recipient is not carrying or forgets to get their mobile phones while visiting the centre,” he added. However, there has been an online facility for the registration of recipients for the age group between 18-44 years. He also said, “We are currently vaccinating 1,000-1,200 recipients per day at the MLN Medical college compared to 1,400 earlier." There were many instances when recipients forgot to carry their mobile phones with them and it consumes a lot of time to complete all formalities on the portal. Sangam city has now seen the number of recipients fall below 10,000 for the past four days. This is a steep fall considering that the number of recipients, not long ago, was touching 20,000 recipients a day. On Friday, Covid vaccination sites across the city and rural areas witnessed a heavy rush of eligible recipients to get a shot. As the vaccination exercise resumed on Thursday after a gap of two days at 44 vaccination sites, a large number of recipients thronged the vaccination centres, spotted standing in long queues, waiting for their turn. The shortage of vaccines has already suspended the cluster plan in Sangam city which was supposed to begin on July 1. Officials of the health department, however, said that the vaccination exercise was taken up at all the city-based (24) vaccination sites and 20 Community Health Centres (CHCs) in rural areas on Thursday. District Immunization Officer (DIO) and Additional chief medical officer (ACMO), Dr Teerath Lal told TOI that the vaccination exercise was taken up as per the availability of vaccines. He added that jabs were administered to eligible recipients at 44 sites on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/vax-shortage-otp-verification-hamper-vaccination-drive/articleshow/84074326.cms||Kapil Dixit

During the site inspection, the team identified lapses in compliance of various acts and rules of the labour department and violations of conditions laid down in the no objection certificates and licenses issued by the Mormugao Municipal Council and the urban health centre. The team also noticed that the advisory issued to control vector borne diseases was not followed due to lack of proper coordination by the site supervisors at construction sites. In residential areas it was noticed the households failed to check the stagnation of water thereby allowing the breeding of mosquitoes A detailed report of the observations at the site inspection and related recommendations will be submitted by the core committee to various government agencies at the district and state level. An action plan based on the recommendations of the site inspection will be drawn up by the directorate of health services’ (DHS) National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme (NVBDCP).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vasco-inspected-for-vector-borne-diseases/articleshow/84081775.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||TRS moves to check Andhra Pradesh CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and YS Sharmila||HYDERABAD: There is a lot more to the barrage of statements made by TRS leaders and ministers against AP chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and his late father, former CM YS Rajasekhara Reddy than what meets the eye. The TRS appears to be adopting a twin-pronged strategy on the father-son duo. Firstly, the Telangana government wants to stop Jagan from going ahead with Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Project (RLIP) and enhancement of Srisailam Right Bank Canal works. Secondly, the ruling party wants to nullify YSR’s daughter YS Sharmila who is currently touring districts promising to usher in ‘Rajanna rajyam’ (YSR’s golden rule) in Telangana. Soon after the recent meeting of the state cabinet, half a dozen ministers and TRS MLAs upped the tempo against Jagan and YSR over what they called illegal irrigation projects, especially RLIP, constructed by AP across Krishna river and detrimental to Telangana’s interests. Ministers Vemula Prashanth Reddy, V Srinivas Gound, S Niranjan Reddy and G Jagadish Reddy and MLAs went to the extent of calling Jagan and YSR as “water thieves”. They alleged that if YSR had done grave injustice to Telangana by enhancing the capacity of Pothireddypadu, his son is constructing the RLIP which would leave the erstwhile Mahbubnagar and Nalgonda districts parched for water. Srinivas Goud even alleged that YSR was indirectly responsible for the death of Congress leader P Janardhan Reddy. On the other side, some AP ministers too started issuing statements defending Jagan. While the war of words between Telangana and AP ministers has intensified, both Jagan and Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao have been conspicuous by their silence. Sources in the TRS said it was only after KCR had given the ‘green signal’ for the onslaught against Jagan and YSR, the ministers and MLAs launched the diatribe. Telangana government officials claimed that recent letters to the KRMB and NGT had some effect. “YSR opposed formation of Telangana when he was CM though Congress leadership in Delhi was in favour of a separate state. The state’s formation got delayed because of him,” Srinivas Goud alleged. Analysts said the TRS leaders and government have been critical of the AP government on irrigation projects but have stayed away from besmirching YSR’s name. But now, they have gone the whole hog. Analysts said the TRS is utilising the opportunity to target both Jagan and Sharmila. The latter is launching her new party on July 8 and wants to establish herself as a successor to YSR in Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-moves-to-check-jagan-and-sharmila/articleshow/84080096.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Allahabad||HC grants bail to 3 booked under sedition for burning UP CM’s effigy||Prayagraj: The Allahabad High Court has granted bail to three people booked for sedition for allegedly raising slogan against Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and burning his effigy under Karvi police station area of Chitrakoot in March this year. Since the accused were booked for sedition, the main plea taken on their behalf was that it was only a political protest and the ingredients of the offence under section 124A of the Indian Penal Code, which describes the offence of sedition, are not made out. According to section 124A of IPC, whoever, by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards the the government established by law in India shall be punished with imprisonment for life to which fine may be added, or with imprisonment which may extend to three years, to which fine may be added. While granting bail to Phoolchandra Yadav, Aashutosh Agrahari and Suraj Singh, Justice Suneet Kumar observed, “Without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case and considering the nature of accusation and severity of punishment in case of conviction and the nature of supporting evidence, reasonable apprehension of tempering of the witnesses and prima facie satisfaction of the court in support of the charge, the applicants are entitled to be released on bail in this case.” As per prosecution, 12 named and 10-12 unknown people had raised slogans against the Chief Minister and burnt his effigy. These applicants are named in the FIR lodged under section 124A (sedition) and other sections of IPC at Karvi police station. During the proceedings, it was urged by the counsel for the applicants that six co-accused in similar circumstances have already been enlarged on bail. It was further submitted that the applicants had been languishing in jail since March 17 and there is no likelihood of early disposal of trial. If granted bail, the applicants would never misuse the liberty and cooperate in the trial. However, the state counsel opposed the bail application, saying a prima faice case is made out against the applicants. The court gave this decision on June 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-grants-bail-to-3-booked-under-sedition-for-burning-up-cms-effigy/articleshow/84074352.cms||---
---||Delhi||Not just luck: Why some parts of Delhi are hotter than others||NEW DELHI: Feeling warmer than normal in some parts of Delhi-NCR compared with other areas? Might not just be the temperature or the humidity alone.  It could all be down to the concretised and urbanised landscape around you. The urban heat island effect makes localities hotter than others due to factors like concretisation, population density and the density of the land-use area. A new study has found parts of the city recording an increase in the surface and canopy-level heat index of 4-6 degrees Celsius by 1.30am. The study, conducted by the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT Delhi, analysed change in the land use and land cover pattern over the last five decades on the basis of Delhi’s maps between 1972 and 2014 to determine how urbanisation had impacted the urban heat island effect in the Central National Capital Region. The study assessed both the surface heat island intensity (SHI), measured at ground level, as well as the canopy layer heat Island intensity (CLHI), measured in the air. It found that with increasing urbanisation, around 500 square km of Delhi is now experiencing 4-6 degrees Celsius of CLHI at night, something that was non-existent in the 1970s. A dense 23 sq km of Delhi records a CLHI greater than 5 degrees Celsius. On average, Delhi’s near-surface temperature has also increased by 1.02 degrees Celsius due to an increase in the urban-land use from 1970 to 2010s. NCR too has seen similar changes, with increases in SHI and CLHI of 4-6 degrees Celsius during the day and 2-4 degrees Celsius at night. The study also looked at thermal comfort and discomfort due to excess heating and determined that comfortable hours had reduced over the last five decades. “The extremely uncomfortable hours have increased from an average of 10 hours a day to 12–13 hours a day. Similarly, comfortable hours have decreased from around three hours per day to around an hour per day,” says the study, co-authored by Ankur Prabhat Sati and Shweta Bhati. Manju Mohan, lead author of the study that was published in Urban Climate, said the increase in temperatures is maximum by 1.30am and lowest at 10.30am. “Through the day, surfaces heat up the maximum by 1.30am. In comparison, readings collected at 2:30pm showed an increase in UHI by 2-3 degrees Celsius. By 10.30am, cool night-time temperature has released the heat and makes morning ideal,” explained Mohan, who added that Gurugram, Dwarka and Faridabad all showed high UHI readings, while locations like Delhi Ridge (north) and Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary showed little increase in both surface or CLHI at night. Mohan, in past studies to determine UHI in Delhi, has established locations such as Connaught Place and Sitaram Bazaar as being the hottest, with an average UHI index of over 4 degrees Celsius. JNU and Vasant Kunj had lowest UHI at 1-2 degrees Celsius.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/not-just-luck-why-some-parts-of-delhi-are-hotter-than-others/articleshow/84079555.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||India||3 TMC MPs allege ‘impropriety’ by SG, Mehta denies charge||NEW DELHI: Three TMC MPs on Friday wrote to the PM seeking removal of solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who represents the CBI in the Narada and Saradha chit fund scams in constitutional courts, for allegedly committing impropriety by meeting BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari, an accused in the two scams. Derek O’Brien, Sukhendu Sekhar Roy and Mahua Moitra alleged that Adhikari met Mehta on Thursday immediately after meeting home minister Amit Shah and that it appeared the meeting was “organised to influence the outcome of matters where Adhikari is an accused” by using the SG’s office. However, the SG rejected the charge of impropriety, asserting that he never met Adhikari. Responding to TOI’s query, he wrote, “Adhikari did come to my residence-cum-office unannounced on Thursday at around 3pm. Since I was already in a pre-scheduled meeting in my chamber, my staff requested him to sit in the waiting room and offered him a cup of tea. When my meeting got over and my PPS informed me about Adhikari’s arrival, I requested my PPS to convey to Adhikari my inability to meet him and apologise on my behalf as he had to wait. Adhikari thanked my PPS and left without insisting to meet me. The question of my meeting with Adhikari therefore does not arise.” The MPs said the SG’s “meeting with Adhikari not only reeks of impropriety but also raises questions of integrity and taints the post of SG”. They said such a meeting between an accused and the second-most senior law officer of India, who is advising such investigating agency by whom Adhikari is being investigated, is in direct conflict with the statutory duties of the SG.  The SG has been in TMC’s crosshairs since he, appearing for CBI, alleged in the Calcutta HC and the SC that CM Mamata Banerjee had led a crowd of TMC workers to the CBI office on May 17 to prevent the agency from physically producing TMC leaders arrested in Narada scam before the trial court. He had also alleged that state law minister Moloy Ghatak had thronged the trial court with TMC supporters to overwhelm the trial judge, who had granted bail to the TMC leaders. The HC is seized of the CBI petition in this case. During a recent SC hearing on petitions by Mamata and Ghatak challenging the HC’s refusal to accept their “delayed” response affidavits in the Narada case, the SG had said that the SC could allow the duo to make fresh applications for acceptance of their affidavits before the HC as it was not a case where CBI should contest their pleas in the SC. The SC bench had termed SG's stand “very fair”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/3-tmc-mps-allege-impropriety-by-sg-mehta-denies-charge/articleshow/84083042.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Kolkata||Travel breather in morning but buses vanish in evening||Kolkata: The Joint Council of Bus Syndicate that has over 70 routes in the city operated just two routes — 45 and L238. The Minibus Operators Coordination Committee that operates 53 routes operated only two. Incidentally, the Metiabruz-Howrah mini, one of which was involved in the Red Road fatal accident on Thursday, was the only major minibus route operating in Kolkata on Friday. Yet, Friday morning was comparatively better than Thursday despite government offices operating along with the private ones for the first time after easing of restrictions. Passengers said the government bus services improved with depots actually studying passenger pressure and allotting buses accordingly. “We have deployed 4,000 government buses in Kolkata. If the situation demands, more buses will be deployed on other routes,” said state transport minister Firhad Hakim. The government even deployed South Bengal State Transport Corporation buses to stem the rush. Also, a number of private bus owners, drivers and conductors — going against their union’s decision — chose to ply a few private buses on select routes on 18B/1, DN-17 and 79D. A few buses on route 230 tried operating even by sticking to the norm — they shut the door after 50% of passengers occupied the seats. Even then, TOI found major queues and passengers waiting for buses at Dunlop, Ultadanga, Shyambazar, Behala Chowrasta, Ruby Crossing and Rashbehari Crossing. By evening, though, whatever little relief was seen in the morning was gone as the city witnessed chaos with crowds gathering at Esplanade and Dalhousie and trying to put a foot on the packed government buses. “I availed a jam-packed bus after waiting for over one-and-a-half-hours at Ruby Crossing. I risked my life by boarding the packed bus amid the pandemic situation as I had no other option,” said Geeta Majumdar, a passenger. The unions pointed out that several of these buses disappeared in the evening as they ran out of fuel. “Where is the money to refill the diesel tank and run the bus?” asked Tapan Banerjee of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicate. Swapan Ghosh of the Minibus Operators’ Coordination Committee alleged that some private buses tried to extract extra fares from passengers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/travel-breather-in-morning-but-buses-vanish-in-evening/articleshow/84077420.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

According to police, the woman was married in 2013 and gave birth to a baby boy after eight years in 2020. The woman’s father however has alleged that she was killed by her husband and in-laws. The police have lodged a complaint of murder against the deceased’s husband and in-laws. Police received a call from Preeti Chaudhary’s father-in-law Pratap Chaudhary on Thursday, who said that she was found hanging from the ceiling fan and her baby boy, who is just 18 months old, was also lying unconscious next to her. The woman allegedly had a heated argument with her husband, who is a private company employee in Delhi. “We reached the spot and found that the toddler was strangled to death as there were marks on his neck. Forensic team has also collected evidence from the spot. Woman’s in-laws informed that they knocked the door for long as the deceased was not coming out of her room. When they tried to see inside the room, they found her hanging,” said SN Vaibhav Pandey, circle officer Hapur city. The officer added that an FIR of murder against husband and in-laws of the woman has been filed on the complaint of the woman’s father. Her family claimed that their daughter has been killed. Police have detained woman’s in-laws for questioning. “Things will be clear after her autopsy report,” added the CO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/woman-strangulates-her-toddler-to-death-later-hangs-herself-family-suspects-murder-by-in-laws/articleshow/84075381.cms||---

A dozen women had been rescued from a brothel in GB Road on March 19 and lodged at the shelter home. On May 24, they escaped by breaking an exhaust fan hole of the shelter home located on the third floor of a building. Two of the women sustained injuries on their foot and couldn’t escape but the rest managed to get away. The two women told the authorities that they were bored of staying at the shelter home and wanted to resume working. “An abduction case was registered as per protocol after which hue-and-cry notices were issued and advertisement published as per norms,” a senior officer said. According to police, the women were rescued earlier by a team from Kamla Market police station. A case of abduction was registered and their age verification test was conducted. In the meantime, on directions of Child Welfare Committee (East), the women were lodged at a home in Sector-19, Dwarka. A controversy erupted on Friday after an ad given by police mistakingly listed them as being lodged at Delhi Metro Children Home in Tis Hazari. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation spokesperson clarified, “An advertisement has been issued by Delhi Police regarding the kidnapping of 10 girls allegedly from DMRC Children Home in Tis Hazari. This is to clarify that the Children Home run by Salaam Baalak Trust only accommodates boys and no girls stay there. Therefore, DMRC’s Children Home has no connection whatsoever with this incident.” Police, thereafter, clarified that it was an inadvertent mistake only in the English version of the advertisement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-search-for-10-women-who-fled-dwarka-shelter/articleshow/84081892.cms||---

Worli MLA and state tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray have given around Rs 75 lakh each for the upgrade. BMC officials said the new open space is designed with the help of Rachana Sansad College. The maidan is spread over 1.5 lakh sq ft. Times ViewBMC’s plan to upgrade Worli’s iconic Jamboree Maidan is a welcome move. While the ground will have upgraded facilities, BMC must ensure that the green footprint of the ground is not reduced. BMC must not end up concretising large parts of the play area in the name of the upgrade. Funds given by MLA Aaditya Thackeray and the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray must be used judiciously.“This maidan historically serves also as a venue of cultural programmes such as dahi-handi. This maidan is used by senior citizens for walking, young citizens for jogging and sports activity and by children also. Planning of this work is done with the help of Rachna Sansad College,” said Sharad Ughade, assistant municipal commissioner, G-South ward. Ughade said that the maidan will also get a new jogging track. Locals said that the ground wasn’t upgraded in decades and it was turning into ruins despite the high footfall at the open space. “We will have an attractive theme painted ornamental gate and we will install various gym equipment. The entire ground will get a new fence. We will carry out improvement of existing ground with an underground drainage facility and create a percolation system so that there is no water-logging in the ground. We will also have a rainwater harvesting system. The jogging track will also have walking facilities for the challenged. We will install attractive lighting and horticulture work will also be done,” Ughade said. Aaditya said that the Jamboree Maidan is historic and iconic to Mumbai. “It is only fitting that Maharashtra’s CM born in Mumbai initiates his local area development funds from such an iconic place and it’s an honour for me as the local MLA too. We are committed to ensure all our maidans remain earthy and yet clean and well-maintained,” said Aaditya. Officials said that work on the upgrade will be completed by the end of the year. While Aaditya sanctioned around Rs 75 lakh from his local MLA fund, CM Thackeray set aside Rs 75 lakh from his MLC fund. The total cost of the upgrade will be around Rs 2.5 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-worlis-jamboree-maidan-to-get-sporty-rs-2-5cr-revamp-on-cards/articleshow/84081890.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Awhad was addressing in a programme organised by the Ulhasnagar Trader Association for residents who were rendered homeless after the civic body demolished dangerous buildings. UMC mayor Leelabai Ashan of the Shiv Sena had recently promised that she would arrange for a relief fund of Rs 50 crore from the government to help the displaced by constructing transit camp. She also assured that the fund would be used to pay rent for those forced to evacuate thier homes. But Awhad’s statement that the government has no money has left residents disappointed. “To resolve the problem of regularisation of illegal buildings, the state should bring a new law,” said Awhad. “But if (UMC) thinks government will give any financial aid then they should forget about it as use the government has no money due to the pandemic. The state is paying salary to staffers by taking a loan,” he said, adding that the UMC commissioner should give proper notice before demolishing dangerous buildings. BJP corporator Deepak Sirwani, who is UMC standing committee chairman, said Awhad’s statement makes the chink in theMVA government conspicuous as their leaders are giving conflicting statements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-dont-expect-aid-govt-has-no-money-min-awhad-tells-displaced/articleshow/84082748.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Delhi||Three years of happiness curriculum bring children’s well-being centre stage||NEW DELHI: Launched three years ago by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, the happiness curriculum in Delhi’s government schools has taught students how to never give up and how to build up concentration with regular practice of mindfulness. While celebrating three years of the unique curriculum on Friday, experts also pointed out how it had facilitated conversations around the important issues of wellbeing, collaboration and happiness. What the happiness curriculum has achieved was discussed by students and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, principal secretary of education H Rajesh Prasad, director of education Udit Prakash Rai and an international panel on Friday. Sparsh Aggarwal, a Class VII student at a government school in Kalkaji, testified that she learned how to persevere in the face of persistent challenges. Her mother confirmed that her daughter and she had become closer since the happiness classes began. Rakshit, again a Class VII student at Rohini Sector 9, narrated how his addiction to mobile games and the attendant eye problems had been alleviated by the curriculum. With the practice of mindfulness and other activities learnt in the happiness sessions, he claimed to be stress-free now. Gurmeet, a Class IX student at Bachchan Prasad SKV, Deoli, said that she had been encouraging her family to practise activities she learned in the happiness classes. Prachi of SDSV Sector 9, Rohini, shared that she used to be irascible earlier but had learnt to manage her anger in the happiness classes. After listening to these student accounts, Sisodia said, “They have brought our age-old tradition of mindfulness back in the community. Lakhs of children have practised mindfulness and other activities learned in the Happiness classes in their homes with parents and siblings during the Covid pandemic. This has led to people feeling happier and stress-free in such difficult times.” Sisodia also met international experts and discussed best global practices on social-emotional learning. “We want to learn from the best in the world. Delhi has created a model of happiness classes and education systems across the world can also benefit from this,” he added. Dr Scherto R Gill, chairperson, G20 Interfaith Forum’s education working group, noted, “Education around the world should be about well-being, self-exploration and co-inquiry, which the ecosystem in Delhi had managed.” Amit Sen, director and co-founder of Children First, Kamal Silwal, CEO of Genius Academy Nepal, and Ankit Pogula, member of Cell for Human Values and Transformative Learning, were the other experts on the panel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-yrs-of-happiness-curriculum-bring-childrens-well-being-centre-stage/articleshow/84079635.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Make fee defaulters’ list, issue notice: HC||Kolkata: The Calcutta High Court on Friday asked schools to prepare a list of students, whose parents were yet to pay the slashed fees (80%), and asked them to issue a notice to the guardians. The HC said if it was not “a good cause” for the default, it might allow schools to remove the students concerned from the rolls. The order by a division bench of Justice I P Mukerji and Moushumi Bhattacharya was made after several schools told the HC that “taking advantage of the order of this court restraining the school authorities from expelling the students on the grounds of non-payment of fees, a substantial number of students has not paid the reduced fees”. The schools wanted the HC’s permission “to expel these students from the school”. “The schools, considering the continuance of the pandemic, will not take any step to expel the students or to discontinue their study,” the HC said. But it added that by the next date of hearing, if “we find that such default is continuing, we shall, after hearing representation on behalf of the students and in the absence of good cause, permit the schools to remove the name of those defaulters... from the rolls of the school”. The HC had earlier said that till July 31, no school should remove any student from the rolls for non-payment, or short-payment of fees. The fresh HC directive came after the division bench on June 4 started hearing a PIL, urging the implementation of HC’s October 2020 order to charge 80% of fees in the 2021-22 session as physical classes had not begun.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/make-fee-defaulters-list-issue-notice-hc/articleshow/84077514.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

But a patrolling police vehicle passing by sensed something amiss and decided to check. “When our team halted to question the men about what they were upto, one of them fled. The other two, Vijay Shaikh and Tayyab Shaikh, were caught. We recovered the donation box with all the cash intact,” said senior inspector Anand Hake, Samta Nagar police. One of the two arrested men was previously booked in a case of cruelty to spouse.

A Sukumar, a forest veterinary officer attached to the Coimbatore forest division, had alerted his FB friends on Tuesday about a fake account that sought money. Conmen used his profile picture to create the fake account and requested his friends to send Rs 10,000 to a bank account. “Some of my FB friends had alerted me about the fake account. Thanks to timely intervention, it was blocked. No one lost money,” the forest veterinary officer told TOI. Deputy superintendent of anti-land grabbing cell T K K Senthilkumar shared a similar experience. “On Saturday, my friends alerted me about a fake profile that requested them to send money through Google Pay. I requested them to report the account, which was later blocked,” he said. The cybercrime cell received more than 120 complaints about fake accounts, said C Sanghu, additional superintendent of police. “If you notice a fake FB account in your name, you can register a complaint through www.cybercrime.gov.in.

They were not defaulters, they claimed. Principals felt a confusion might have been created as some had submitted the marks online and some sent them physically. But since both the modes were allowed, the council should have updated the list, they said. Among the city schools on the defaulters’ list are St Lawrence High School, Jodhpur Park Boys’, Silver Point and Hindu School. Most of them have gone to the council with proof that all the marks were sent in 2020. “I submitted Class XI marks long ago. There is no reason why my name should feature on the defaulters’ list,” said Fr Sebastian, principal of St Lawrence. Silver Point School principal Sucharita Roychowdhury said, “We have proof of submission. I don’t know why we have been included. I am getting back to the council.” Several principals have also approached the council, seeking to change submitted marks, citing “mistakes” while recording them in a hurry. “As 60% weightage will be on Class XI marks, we re-checked our tally and spotted mistakes. We hope the council allows us to change them,” said Parimal Bhattacharya, principal of Jadavpur Vidyapith.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/many-city-hs-schools-tell-the-council-that-they-are-not-defaulters-in-class-xi-marks-submission/articleshow/84077569.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Delhi||Transcending barriers at special Covid vax camps||NEW DELHI: Nearly 430 transgender individuals have taken their first Covid-19 vaccine over the past week at three special camps organised for the community at Daryaganj’s Happy School. A health camp was also organised there and free rations distributed to the transgenders. Some of those inoculated on Friday said they had till now found it difficult to take the jab either because of vaccine shortage or because of lack of awareness about the process. Those reluctant to take the jab were counselled by NGOs and finally decided to report to the vaccination camp. Akriti Sagar, district magistrate (Central), said, “We have been organising special camps for the marginalised communities, including sex workers, slum residents and shelter homes inmates for two months. We then wanted to assist the members of the transgender community and simultaneously hold health camps for them and provide them with dry rations. The idea was to make them feel included in society. We told even those who did not have Aadhaar to avail of the vaccination opportunity.” Sagar got in touch with an NGO that helped them in identifying and mobilising the transgenders. “We got a good response from transgenders from across Delhi. We roped in NGOs to provide dry rations and organise a health camp,” she said. Umesh, 40, who took the first shot of the vaccine on Friday at the camp at Happy School, said, “I have been trying for the past many days to take the jab but failed to find an empty slot. After I heard about the special vaccination camp for transgenders, I came here. The entire process was hassle free.” Transgender community member Manish Rana, 38, said most people like him were averse to taking the Covid shot due to rumours that the vaccine had an adverse health impact. “I think that it is necessary to inoculate ourselves for our safety and I will now be a role model for others,” said Rana. Sanjeev, who came with seven transgender persons, said after he took the first jab on June 26, he had been encouraging his friends to roll up their sleeves for the injection. Mahesh Kumar, a salesman in a footwear showroom, said his employer had been asking him to go for vaccination, but he did not know how to do so. “I heard from a community member about the special camp and took the jab without any inconvenience,” he said happily. Mohammed Iliyas, who was waiting in the queue for the vaccination, said, “I went to a health camp earlier for the jab, but was asked to first register online. I couldn’t do that. But the officials here took care of everything.” Dharti Varshney, nodal officer for NGO Liaising, said, “Knowing the transgender community was hit by the Covid lockdown, we provided them with dry rations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/transcending-barriers-at-special-covid-vax-camps/articleshow/84079717.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Indcoserve CEO Supriya Sahu received the certificate from chief minister M K Stalin on Friday. Fairtrade certification is an internationally acclaimed product certification system where social, economic and environmental aspects of production are certified through a rigorous process.

Indcoserve ensured ethical compliances in tea manufacturing,” Sahu told TOI. “In general, government organizations don’t see opportunities to growth. We did break that myth and became at par with private professionals. We also worked very closely with small tea grower members to create awareness about safe use of pesticides and fertilizers for moving toward to organic mode of cultivation.” Indcoserve successfully completed supply of about 4,200 tonnes of Ooty Tea to ration shops in Tamil Nadu, achieving the task in a matter of 35 days as part of the government’s special Covid relief package, Sahu added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/indcoserve-earns-intl-certification/articleshow/84079667.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Three years on, SC grants salon staffer bail in colleague’s murder case||MUMBAI: After being behind bars for over three years, Mumbai salon staffer Khushi Sahjwani accused of strangling a colleague to death in a moving car, got bail from the Supreme Court on Friday. The apex court directed her release on bail, observing that she is a woman and has been behind bars for long, with chargesheet already filed in the case. Sahjwani, 46, is accused for the murder of salon chain BBlunt employee, Kirti Vyas. The SC bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and V Balasubramanian did not consider the matter merits, but considered the fact that she is a lady with a minor child and aged parents and that the investigation is also over. The bench directed that she is to be released on conditions to the satisfaction of trial court. Last year denying her interim emergency bail during the pandemic, Mumbai sessions court had said being a woman was not a sufficient ground for the relief. Her co-acccused a male, is in custody. Sahjwani and Siddhesh Tamhankar, colleagues of Vyas, are booked for murder, kidnapping for murder, and destruction of evidence. Vyas went missing on March 16, 2018 after leaving home at Grant Road, for work and was last seen with the two accused in Sahjwani’s car. Few days earlier she had issued Tamhankar a notice to improve his work and put him on review. Sahjwani, had been lodged at Byculla women’s jail since May 5, 2018 following her arrest. The SC was hearing her special leave petition in which she was being represented by counsel Yug Chaudhry, against a January 11, 2019 order of the Bombay high court rejecting her bail plea. The HC had said she was not seen in CCTV footage to be getting down at Grant Road station and her phone was switched off near Jijamata Nagar, Worli, while CDR locations of the two accused was shown from Santa Cruz to Wadala Mahul Port Trust between 8.50 pm and9.40 pm that night, according to a preliminary investigation report. For DCB, CID Mumbai police senior counsel Raja Thakare and state’s counsel Rahul Chitnis opposed her plea on merits, and said no parity can be granted to co-accused. Her child and elderly parents are “entirely dependent on her’’. The court is yet to frame charge in the case. Her petition said the case is “entirely dependent on flimsy circumstantial evidence where prosecution evidence shows that the victim was seen alive after she was last seen with” Sahjwani. It adds that a ransom call received by Vyas’ colleague, which police do not say was made either by Sahjwani or co-accused, was not investigated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-yrs-on-sc-grants-salon-staffer-bail-in-colleagues-murder-case/articleshow/84082754.cms||Swati Deshpande

Meyyanathan who held a review meeting with officials in Coimbatore on Friday instructed the officials of the state pollution control board to ensure that the medical waste and construction debris were being disposed of as per rules. Not only water bodies, such waste should not be dumped in street corners, sewerage lines or vacant lands, he warned. On the part of the local bodies, Meyyanathan said, degradable and non – biodegradable waste should be collected separately, and reusable waste should be sent for recycling. Pollution control board officials should keep a watch whether industrial units dispose waste in adherence to rules. “Pollution control board officials should take action on industrial units that dispose solid and liquid waste in water bodies,’’ he said. Meyyanathan also suggested that urban afforestation should be carried out in cities and towns under Miyawaki method and increase the green cover of the district. The minister, accompanied by collector G S Sameeran and other officials, visited Vellalore garbage yard where he inspected the production of manure from waste and scientific disposal of medical waste using incinerators there.

As per the announcement made by chief minister Pramod Sawant, the curfew is relaxed for another three hours till 6pm, from the earlier timing of 3 pm. “Shops can remain open from 7am to 6pm,” he tweeted. A senior government official said that only shops selling essential commodities would be allowed to operate.

After the Covid review meeting, Ajit Pawar said there was a slight increase in the weekly positivity rate and cases, while the recovery rate was little less than the active cases. “So, the existing relaxations for the corporations and rural areas will continue,” he said. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limit’s weekly positivity rate was 5.3%, while it was 5.4% in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) areas. The weekly positivity rate was 7.3% for Pune rural. “We had thought of giving some concessions to malls, but it seems difficult in the current scenario. So, they will continue to remain closed. Sportspersons above 18 years, who have got both doses of vaccine, would be allowed to take part in indoor sports. Coaching classes for competitive exams would be allowed till 4pm.” In the PMC limits, coaching centres were permitted to operate with 50% capacity. Those attending classes should have taken at least one of the two doses of the vaccine, stated the PMC order. Ajit Pawar said Pune district and the state would be getting ambulances. He directed the district authorities to ramp up oxygen supply by three times the demand during the peak period of the second wave. On Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol’s absence in a meeting related to some issues in the PMC limits, he said, “Being the first citizen of the city, the mayor was invited. But news reports said he was not. I have spoken to him. There was some misunderstanding. I have given standing instruction that the mayor must be invited to any meetings involving the civic administration.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/restrictions-to-remain-unchanged-as-weekly-positivity-rate-same-dy-cm/articleshow/84079721.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Corporations want vax info early for efficient planning||NEW DELHI: To plan work properly and assign responsibility to health, sanitation and other staffers at the vaccination centres on time, the municipal corporations have demanded circulation of duty plans by the district administrations at least in the morning of the previous day. The civic bodies said they had to contact the district administrations daily regarding operational centres and supply of vaccines. Only then they can plan the rest of the day, which often leads to wastage of time and affects other programmes, said an official. “We get the details about the vaccination centres/vaccine supply either in the evening before the vaccination day or on the same day in early morning. The administration often closes or shifts vaccination centres due to insufficient supplies. Some times jabs arrive late. We also need time to plan things and guide our staffers accordingly,” said a South Delhi Municipal Corporation official. While some of their centres have been permanently closed, a few others recently shifted to government schools, said an official. “Of the 57 vaccination centres in our areas, 44 are operational now. We have pursued the administration many times to restart the rest, but there has been no reply,” said the official. Under East Delhi Municipal Corporation, 38 of the 41 centres are operational. “A centre in Mayur Vihar reserved for administering Covaxin to the 18-44 years group has been restarted and is offering Covishield,” said an official. Often temporary camps are organised in schools, community halls for two days and the corporations get to know only a day before, that’s also in the evening, said the official. Health workers are simultaneously working on other vaccination drives such as polio on Wednesdays and Fridays, he added. “If the chart is given at least a day before in the morning, planning will become easier. There are times when staffers are on leave or we have already reassigned them to other duties and changes have to be made at the last moment,” said the official. A Delhi government official said the planning was done by the district immunisation officer in the evening and usually communicated to all centres after 6pm. “Advance planning can be done only if we have surplus supply of vaccines, staff, including medical officers, nurses, data entry operators etc. But we always run tight,” he said. On opening a centre, even if temporary, planning starts at least a week before and information is given to the civic body three-four days in advance if its schools are part of the list, the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corporations-want-vax-info-early-for-efficient-planning/articleshow/84079762.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Goa||If Girish remains state president, it will be end of Cong in Goa, says South Goa MP Sardinha||MARGAO: South Goa MP Francisco Sardinha on Friday reiterated his view that there ought to be a change of guard in the state Congress for its fortunes to be revived. “If Girish Chodankar is retained as the party president, the party will be doomed,” Sardinha said at a press conference in reply to a query. “We will have no option but to helplessly and silently witness the party heading towards its destruction.” He said that most of the Congress’ workers and functionaries have made known their sentiments to the high command that the party president needs to be changed. “We have told them that this man (Chodankar) has never won an election, and that during his period (as president) several party candidates have lost elections and many others have run away from the party. Please remove him and place somebody who can take forward the flag of the party,” he said. Meanwhile, Chodankar, speaking to TOI, said that irrespective of whether he retains or loses the president’s post, it would have no bearing on his work towards strengthening the Congress party. “I haven’t been after any position in the party. My focus is party organizational work. Whether I am there or not (as a president), my work continues,” he said. “Party work shouldn’t stop even for a minute,” Chodankar said. Sardinha further demanded that the criminal cases booked against the residents of Melauli, Sattari during the anti-IIT protest, as also against those participating in the protests against Railways’ double-tracking project be withdrawn forthwith. “The cases need to be withdrawn because they were not fighting for their own interests but to open the eyes of the government,” he said. He also maintained that the public hearing on the coastal zone management plan (CZMP), scheduled for July 8, needs to be held in closed rooms and not at the open South Goa PDA ground, Margao, the venue fixed for the purpose. “Or have it village-wise. Call villages one by one and hear them so that everybody gets a chance to participate,” he said. Demanding that the Centre lower fuel prices, Sardinha said, “The opposition has been persistently demanding that the fuel prices be lowered, but our voices are falling on deaf ears.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/if-girish-remains-state-prez-it-will-be-end-of-cong-in-goa-sardinha/articleshow/84079761.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Erode||Stone well-like structure found at Kodumanal archaeological site in Erode||Archaeologists excavating the Kodumanal site close to the banks of river Noyyal near Chennimlai in Erode have found a rubble stone structure presumed to be a well. Though ring wells and brick wells have been found in other archaeological sites in Tamil Nadu like Keezhadi, a rubble stone structure was rare, say archaeologists. The well, measuring ten by ten metres, has two paths – one on the southern side and the other on the northern side which was 30 metres in length from end to end. This pathway was found during the excavations done before the Covid lockdown and the archaeologists had assumed that it could be a channel. Upon resumption of the excavations a few days back after the lockdown was lifted, they found that they were access routes with steps to the well. Over the past three days they have dug for about 2.3 metres and expect that the well could be ten metres deep. “Through excavations all these years we have found archaeological evidence for industrial activity in Kodumanl site. The discovery of the well has suggested it was not only an industrial site but was one of habitation as well,” said J Ranjith, archaeology officer and project director for Kodumanal site. In the past, archaeologists have found evidence for existence of iron smelting unit with furnaces besides urn burials, beads, pot shreds with brahmi inscriptions, aged 2,300 years. In fact, Kodumanal has yielded the highest number of pot sherds with Tamil brahmi inscriptions, said Ranjith. Ranjith said Kodumanal site has copper, gold, iron and glass pieces as well as artefacts. There were three types of burial methods – cairn circles, urn burials and urn burials with cists found at Kodumanal. On the logic for having a well dug here, despite being close to the river bank, archaeologists feel that there was a possibility of it being dug for industrial use. “There were evidences to show that the habitants were involved in stone polishing besides iron ore smelting. So, they would be required a water source close by rather than going to the river every time. It could have served drinking water purposes as well,’’ Ranjith said. The wall of well was built on natural bed rock using locally available material like porous granite.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/erode/stone-well-like-structure-found-at-kodumanal-archaeological-site/articleshow/84086154.cms||---

At least we can save lives,” said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkurni. The court heard a PIL by advocate Owais Pechkar, a regular commuter on NH-66, that the four laning work which commenced in 2011 is delayed, there are violations of tender conditions and recurring potholes. In Pechkar’s 2018 PIL on the same issue, the HC had directed the road widening work to be expedited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fill-potholes-on-mum-goa-natl-hway-soon-in-mumbai-hc/articleshow/84082773.cms||---
---||Pune||Level 3 curbs in Maharashtra till task force puts out fresh advisory, says principal secretary Aseem Kumar Gupta||PUNE: Restrictions pertaining to state trigger for level 3 will stay till a fresh advisory is issued by the task force since Delta variant cases are being reported, Aseem Kumar Gupta, principal secretary, state relief and rehabilitation, said on Friday. A government notification explains the state-level 3 trigger as continuation of restrictions in administrative units irrespective of the weekly positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy till the task force or public health department decides to withdraw them. “The present orders issued by the public health department, the state task force or the central government will continue. We will have an additional order from the education department after assessment. It is up to the districts to ramp up testing,” Gupta said. If the weekly positivity rate is high, then the restrictions will be more, and the situation will be assessed every week. If the positivity rate is maintained, then the state trigger of level 3 and the restrictions at the local level will remain, Gupta added. Pune rural, Raigad, Sindhudurg, Kolhapur and Ratnagiri are in level 4 while all the remaining units are in level 3. With the ratio of RT-PCR tests in the state less than the Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT), Gupta said the district disaster management authorities must use funds from the State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF) to ramp up testing. Nearly Rs 460 crore has been disbursed under SDRF to the districts so far, this fiscal. These funds will go up to Rs 1,000 crore by the year-end, Gupta said. Last year, Rs 860 crore was given to the districts. “There is no shortage of funds for districts needing support in ramping up testing,” Gupta said. Data from the public health department show the ratio of RT-PCR tests as 45% as against 55% RATs, this week. Some districts like Gadchiroli and Hingoli carry out more than 80% RAT tests instead of RT-PCR tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/level-3-curbs-till-task-force-puts-out-fresh-advisory/articleshow/84079772.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Kolkata||Four flights diverted due to heavy rain||KOLKATA: Torrential rain triggered by a cloudburst near the airport forced two flights to abort landing and led to the diversion of four flights to other airports on Friday evening. While the rest of Kolkata beyond Kaikhali remained overcast, blinding rain in the approach funnel that leads to Kolkata airport brought down visibility and made operations impossible. The rain that came down in sheets between 4pm and 6pm also led to waterlogging in some sections of the airport apron area. Nearly 100mm of rain was recorded. Two planes — an Air India flight from Agartala and an Alliance Air flight from Jharsuguda — had to go around after missing the touchdown approach due to poor visibility and wind shear. While the AA aircraft landed later, the AI flight was diverted to Varanasi. Three other aircraft were diverted. An IndiGo flight from Delhi was diverted to Ranchi. Another flight from Chennai was also asked to divert to Chennai. A Vistara flight from Mumbai was diverted to Mumbai. All four flights returned to Kolkata later. The cloudburst led to waterlogging on Jessore Road and craters resurfaced on VIP Road and Jessore Road that slowed down traffic. “It took me an hour and 15 minutes to reach Belghoria Expressway from Keshtopur, which on other days, takes barely 10-15 minutes,” said Kajal Mukherjee, who was heading home to Bally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/four-flights-diverted-due-to-heavy-rain/articleshow/84077619.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Efforts to raise funds for elephant conservation, assist villagers on||COIMBATORE: The Forest Development Agency is rolling out a number of initiatives to raise funds for elephant conservation activities and create awareness about the same among the youngsters. The funds, it said, would be used to protect and conserve the elephants and provide some livelihood to the people living in the villages along the forest fringes. On Friday, the agency that the Coimbatore forest division formed last year, released a collection of t-shirts that were themed around elephant conservation. Forest minister K Ramachandran unveiled the t-shirts that come in nine prints. They sport an illustration or picture of an Asian or African elephant with a message relating to saving wildlife or elephants. The t-shirts would be sold at eco-tourism spots such as the upcoming elephant interpretation centre at Mettupalayam, Monkey Falls near Pollachi and Kovai Courtallam, etc. I Anwardeen, additional principal chief conservator of forests, Coimbatore, and a member of the agency, said the t-shirts would be sold by the villagers along the forest fringes. “A t-shirt is priced at Rs 600. They are produced by Classic Polo, a garment manufacturer based in Tirupur.” The agency was formed to make the forest department and the communities living along the forest fringes work together and support each other. It has the chief conservator of forests as its president and the district forest officer as its secretary. Other members include panchayat presidents of the villages along the forest fringes. Funds are required for in-situ conservation, anti-poaching and rescue initiatives in forests and provide some livelihood to the villagers along the forest fringes. Trying to emulate the model of tiger reserves, where eco-tourism is promoted and proceeds from the same is used to conserve tigers, the agency is planning several initiatives to raise funds. “Once the pandemic is over, we plan to support different communities to come up with different products that could be sold with the elephant insignia on them. Once we have more such products, we will set up souvenir shops,” Anwardeen said. District forest officer Venkatesh Durairaj said they also have plans to approach big corporates to endorse wildlife and elephant conservation as they were a good source of funding and recognition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/efforts-to-raise-funds-for-elephant-conservation-assist-villagers-on/articleshow/84079750.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune retailers seek extension of store timings till 7pm every day||PUNE: City retailers selling essential commodities have asked for the existing 4pm deadline to be pushed by three hours. Retailers said being allowed to open till 7pm would benefit customers and help complete home deliveries of the orders. Sachin Nivangune, president of Pune District Retailers Association, said they will soon make a representation to the divisional commissioner, Pune municipal commissioner and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. “Crowds in the market will reduce if shops can function for three more hours. Private offices can adhere to the 4pm deadline, but there is no point telling shops to shut so early. We will soon submit a memorandum to the authorities,” Nivangune said. Rakesh Shendkar, a grocer from Shaniwar Peth, said the 4pm deadline was unviable. “Many traders and customers are facing problems with home deliveries. The government should not apply the same set of restrictions to everyone. There is rush at the markets as shops are shut on weekends. Also, shopkeepers are following all necessary precautions,” Shendkar said. Suraj Shah, another trader, said shopkeepers were encouraging home deliveries, but with a staff crunch, it was difficult to manage the counters and fulfil orders, all before the 4pm deadline. The Federation of Trade Associations of Pune (FTAP), a body of non-essential shop owners, has also made a similar demand to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. FTAP has claimed that morning hours were not suited to doing business. FTAP said non-essential shops should be allowed to operate from 11am to 8pm. Mahendra Pitaliya, secretary of FTAP, said most traders have reported a drop in business because of these restricted. “We are losing two entire days in a week due to the weekend closure. Restrictions cannot be long-term solutions for anything,” Pitaliya added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-retailers-seek-extension-of-store-timings-till-7pm-every-day/articleshow/84079759.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Bengaluru||Eight districts in Karnataka achieve negative Covid vaccine wastage||BENGALURU: Eight districts in Karnataka have achieved negative wastage of Covid-19 vaccines with healthcare workers carefully using each vial to inoculate more than the allocated 10 or 20 people. Covishield comes in vials of ten 0.5ml doses each and Covaxin in two sizes: 10 and 20 doses of 0.5ml each. Each vial has one or two doses more to account for spillage while drawing the vaccine. With experience and zero-wastage emphasis, healthcare workers in these districts have achieved negative wastage. Bengaluru city has topped the state in absolute terms in negative wastage: BBMP used 33,785 doses in excess of the allocated 10/20 per vial. In terms of excess dosage as a percentage of vaccine allocated, Dharwad (4.2%) and Haveri (4.1%) have done well. Dharwad has utilised 8,786 excess doses, followed by Belagavi (7,139), Uttara Kannada (6,381), Haveri (5,156), Chikkamagaluru (3,776), Kodagu (1,285) and Mysuru (497). “Bengaluru has vaccinated more than 10 persons from a vial of Covishield and more than 20 persons from a single vial of Covaxin,” said Randeep D, special commissioner (health), BBMP. As per WHO norms, each vaccine vial has extra doses to account for the wastage in syringes. Once opened, the vial must be used up in 4 hours. How dists made the best of dosesAmid continuing supply problems, eight districts in Karnataka have achieved negative wastage of Covid-19 vaccines. These are Mysuru, Bengaluru Urban, Kodagu, Belagavi, Chikkamagaluru, Uttara Kannada, Haveri and Dharwad. “These districts have ensured vials are not opened without enough beneficiaries around,” said Arundhati Chandrasekhar, mission director, National Health Mission, Karnataka. The state had logged a huge vaccine shortage four months ago. As on February 24, Bengaluru Rural and Hassan districts had 10 per cent wastage each, Bengaluru Urban 9 per cent and Chamarajanagar 8 per cent. However, wastage is still a matter of concern in the rest of the state. According to Co-Win and the state government data, eight districts are on the radar for reporting more than 3 per cent vaccine wastage as on June 25. The highest wastage is seen in Bagalkot at 12.6 per cent, followed by Hassan at 8 per cent, Koppal 5.4 per cent, Ramanagara 5.4 per cent, Yadgir 5.1 per cent, Chikkaballapura 4.1 per cent, Ballari 3.8 per cent and Chamarajanagar 3.5 per cent. “Thanks to vaccine eagerness, the wastage has reduced substantially in a few districts. There are strict instructions that no vial can be opened unless there are 10 people ready for the jab. If there are fewer than 10, they will be given tokens to come to the vaccination centre the next day so that wastage can be eliminated,” an official explained. The shift is driven by huge demand. “First two months of the drive were limited to healthcare and frontline workers, and the vaccination was in hospitals or offices. Demand picked up after the drive was extended to citizens. This led to a better usage of the stock,” said BBMP special commissioner (health) Randeep D. According to Chandrashekar, data entry could be an issue. “We have informed districts to carefully prepare a microplan and increase capacity building of the field staff. We have had training sessions and video conferences to monitor the same,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/8-districts-in-ktaka-achieve-negative-covid-vax-wastage/articleshow/84083193.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Kolkata||Archbishop urges churches in Kolkata to take care of elderly||KOLKATA: Catholic churches in the city will take care of elderly parishioners within their jurisdiction from now on. Each parish priest will form small teams of young members of the church and ensure that every senior citizen is visited, connected with and helped out. Since the elderly cannot visit their church amid the pandemic, the church is reaching out to them. This is the gist of the circular that has gone out to parish priests from Archbishop Thomas D’Souza, as he permitted all 65 churches under the archdiocese of Kolkata to re-open with extreme caution. All Catholic churches, under his leadership, will celebrate July 25 as Grandparents’ Day, as directed by Pope Francis. The pandemic has hit the elderly particularly hard and they need to feel the “church is close to them,” the circular says. The archbishop goes on to say that in every parish, the church priest will form small teams of priests, religious and lay people, including youth and children, who will visit elderly persons and cater to their needs. During the team members’ visits, sacraments of reconciliation and Holy Communion can be given to the elderly at home. Several elderly people live alone and have to fend for themselves as their children and grandchildren stay away. Margaret Coelho (76) and her husband Pius, who is 85 years old, live a lonely life at Picnic Gardens. They are members of the Church of Our Lady of Vailankani, which they cannot visit any more. “Our children are busy and stay apart. In May, when both of us had Covid, I was trying my best to look after my husband, who is so infirm that he cannot step out of bed. It will indeed be a relief if the church stands by us,” said Margaret. It is the responsibility of especially the young grandchildren to stay connected to their grandparents and the churches can advise those within their parish to do so, the circular says. Each parish priest has been asked to consider regular gifting, giving financial assistance to the elderly and starting a “monthly pension scheme” for those in need. “But utmost care has to be taken, keeping the safety of both the visitor and the visited in mind. We cannot let our elderly lead an isolated life. We need to immediately find ways to keep them connected and happy,” archbishop D’Souza said. A special mass, set to be live-streamed, will be dedicated to grandparents by the archbishop at the Church of Christ the King, Park Circus at 10am on July 25. This will be over and above what each church will organise for the seniors. Dorothy Manuk (86), who lives on Park Lane and is a member of St Thomas’ Church on Middleton Row, said, “I feel so lonely. Though I can walk to the church, the situation is such that it is not safe. I am yearning for communion and it will be a dream come true if the church visits me.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/archbishop-urges-churches-to-take-care-of-elderly/articleshow/84077674.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Goa||EDC makes biz loans cheaper, cuts interest rate by 100bps||Panaji: Bringing good news to Goan entrepreneurs, the Economic Development Corporation (EDC) on Friday decided to lower its interest rates by 1 percentage point, while also simplifying the procedure to apply for loans. The reduction in interest rates means that aspiring women entrepreneurs from Goa’s hinterland can access finance for as low as 0.5% per annum. By offering necessary financial support, the scheme aims to promote entrepreneurship, financial empowerment and self-reliance among women in the seven talukas of Goa which have been identified as backward areas. “The board met on Friday, where a decision was taken to reduce the interest rate. We had to do this because of competition from private banks and because market rates have also come down,” said managing director of EDC, K V Ballikar, speaking to TOI. The board’s decision effectively means that EDC is offering near interest-free loans to women who are looking to fund their small business. At present, EDC offers general term loans at 10.5% for amounts up to Rs 50 lakh, while the interest for a Rs 1 crore loan is between 10.5% and 13.5%. The board’s decision means that EDC will now offer term loans for business with an interest rate anywhere between 9.5% and 12.5%. However, under the interest rebate scheme, EDC offers a 2% rebate if the applicant is of Goan-origin, another 2% rebate if the unit is being set up by a woman, and finally a 5% rebate if the unit is being setup in any of the seven backward talukas. The state government has identified Pernem, Bicholim, Sattari, Dharbandora, Sanguem, Quepem and Canacona as backward talukas. Ballikar said that entrepreneurs had asked EDC to lower the interest rates and to ease the loan application process. Aside from this, the board also agreed with Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Ltd’s proposal to set up a recreational and commercial centre in 8,000 sqm of land at the EDC Patto complex. EDC had planned to set up a ‘Market of Goa’ centre at Patto, where cultural events, a food court and a green space would be created. “Now, the smart city mission has approached us to develop the space with the same concept. They will be spending Rs 26 crore from Central funds, of which Rs 7.5 crore will be used to develop the 8,000 sqm plot of EDC,” said Ballikar. He said that EDC will continue to own the land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/edc-makes-biz-loans-cheaper-cuts-interest-rate-by-100bps/articleshow/84079794.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Delta-plus surveillance in Maharashtra gets three-month extension, says health minister Rajesh Tope||PUNE: State health minister Rajesh Tope told TOI on Friday that the Delta-plus surveillance programme — and the entire genomic sequencing initiative to trace the variant — has been given a three-month extension. Tope said nearly 11,000 samples would be collected for genome sequencing during the 90-day period. “We had earlier tested 3,400 samples, of which 21 had returned positive for the Delta-plus variant. Each month, 100 samples per district are being collected. As part of our efforts to keep a close eye on the variant, the surveillance has been further extended,” Tope said. He also confirmed that only one of the 21 confirmed Delta-plus cases had been vaccinated against Covid-19. Tope refuted some online media reports that had claimed that an additional 14 Delta-plus cases were detected in the state. “There have been only 21 cases so far in Maharashtra. Barring an 80-year-old woman, who succumbed due to age-related factors and comorbidities, all the other patients have recovered and are at home,” Tope said. The minister said all protocols were being followed, including tracking and tracing of high- and low-risk contacts of the patients. “Though the severity of Delta-plus is still being determined, there is a general perception that the virus and its variants may continue to lose virulence with time. At the same time, it could become more transmissible. We believe that the coming surges are likely to see lower mortality rates. The important thing in such a scenario is to control the rise in cases with Covid-appropriate behaviour and vaccinating 80% of the population,” Kapil Zirpe, member of the Pune Covid-19 task force and head of neurotrauma at Ruby Hall Clinic, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/delta-surveillance-in-maharashtra-gets-3-month-extension/articleshow/84079805.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||India will stick to current testing strategy, says ICMR||PUNE: India would not need to immediately tweak the Covid-19 testing rules following the latest World Health Organisation’s guidelines because the “data driven district-level decision-making” process being followed at present was found to be effective, experts from the Indian Council of Medical Research stressed. Dr Samiran Panda, the head of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said, “Indian need not tweak rules for testing based on the recent guidelines because the testing rules being implemented for the last four to six weeks after the country witnessed a surge in cases in April-May are on similar lines.” Covid working group chairman Dr NK Arora also said the current testing strategy was effective. The World Health Organisation (WHO)’s interim guidance was issued on June 25 under recommendations for national SARS-COV-2 testing strategies and diagnostic capacities. Panda said the document was a compilation of what India was already carrying out. ICMR experts stated that they had started looking into the local epidemiological data and suggesting interventions much earlier. So, no new additions would be made at present, the experts stated, stressing on speeding up the vaccination process and ensuring Covid appropriate behaviour. Panda said, “ICMR being the apex government research institute critically analyses the available evidence. It analyses findings and share them with programme planners and policy-makers so that appropriate public health-level interventions are undertaken. During the second surge, ICMR drew attention of programme planners towards the necessity of categorising the districts according to the test positivity rate and suggesting interventions if their positivity rate was below 5%, in the range of 5-10% and 10%, besides suggesting restrictions accordingly with the help of community engagement. This will continue.” WHO stated that widespread screening of asymptomatic individuals was not a recommended strategy at present because of the significant costs associated with it and lack of data on its operational effectiveness. ICMR covered it in its recommendations to the health ministry during the second wave. “ICMR has recommended cluster-based testing only if there is an outbreak from a particular area,” Panda said. He said those testing Covid positive using home-based test kits should associate themselves with a testing laboratory so that they could follow the necessary treatment protocol of the local area. WHO in its directive for self-based kits recommended it to be linked to public health actions to ensure appropriate clinical care and support, and to carry out contact tracing to break the chain of transmission. ICMR issued a detailed guideline on self-testing kits in May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/icmr-india-will-stick-to-current-testing-strategy/articleshow/84079822.cms||Nisha Nambiar

A circular from archbishop Thomas D’Souza to all 65 churches under the archdiocese of Kolkata says that only those above 18 can be allowed to participate in church activities. Churches re-opened among restrictions on Thursday. This time, the re-opening is happening with a post-vaccination rider and hence, only those who have taken the jab are urged to come to church. “As things are now, only those above 18 are eligible to get the vaccine. So we are restricting holy mass, prayer and adoration on the church premises only to them. They can register their names with the parish priest,” archbishop Thomas D’Souza said. The archbishop in his circular has urged all parishioners to ensure that they are vaccinated before they attend church. Parish priests have been asked to help all those have not yet been able to get themselves vaccinated.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Laxmi Nagar market to open again, with riders||NEW DELHI: Following a meeting with various departments and assurance by traders, Delhi Police and East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC), Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Friday agreed to allow operation of Laxmi Nagar main market and neighbouring areas from Saturday, subject to terms and conditions. In an order issued by Sonika Singh, district magistrate, (East) stated that the markets would be allowed to open after the market associations and Chamber of Trade and Industry (CTI) ensured Covid-appropriate behaviour and DDMA guidelines would be strictly followed by visitors and vendors, shopkeepers, hawkers, etc. “Shopkeepers will have to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour is followed by those visiting their shops, and the number of people inside is limited. Visitors without masks and social distancing shall not be entertained by them. Further, the district police shall increase the presence of personnel and adopt measures for crowd movement and implementation of DDMA guidelines/SOPs,” stated the order issued on Friday evening.  It added that Delhi Traffic Police should regulate vehicular traffic and enforce no parking rule in and around the market to limit the crowd. “The civic body must ensure only authorised vendors/shopkeepers/ hawkers are allowed to sit, while the East chief district medical officer (CDMO) will place a mobile testing van for testing of all shopkeepers, shoppers, etc. Further, the CDMO and district immunisation officer should also arrange for vaccination drives at nearby centres, while area SDM shall submit reports regularly,” the order added. Meanwhile, the traders have welcomed the move and assured to take all the corrective measures. “We met the district magistrate on Friday afternoon, and she assured to allow operation of the markets after hearing our pleas. Traders have already suffered huge losses due to the lockdown and the pandemic. However, the official demanded strict implementation of norms and we assured adherence. We are thankful to the authority,” said Brijesh Goyal, chairman, CTI. On Tuesday, the East district issued an order in which Laxmi Nagar main market, Vikas Marg to Lovely Public School, Kishan Kunj, Mangal Bazar, Vijay Chowk, Subhash Chowk, Jagatram Park, and Guru Ramdas Nagar were directed to shut operation, except for essential goods, till July 5 for violating Covid-19 guidelines. The traders had criticised the move and argued that police and administration needed to work hard to maintain discipline on roads and public places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/laxmi-nagar-market-to-open-again-with-riders/articleshow/84079906.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Pune||Pune: 81% residents in PCMC areas have antibodies, says sero-survey||PUNE: Mass vaccination is likely to have played a major role in lending protection against Covid-19, Pune district’s latest sero-survey has revealed. The sero-survey, carried out in areas under the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), showed 81% (8,207) of the 10,082 residents in the sample were found to have immunity (Covid antibodies) against SARS-CoV-2. The sero-survey, the largest so far in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR), covered residents of 200 residential clusters, including slums, tenements and middle-class apartments, across the eight PCMC zones from June 16 to 26. In the 6-18 age group, the sero-prevalence was 70%, which experts have attributed to various factors such as direct or indirect exposure to the nCoV virus from the exposed family members. The antibody prevalence was highest (91.1%) in the 45-60 age group and around 90.5% in senior citizens (60 years and above). This was likely due to the higher coverage of adult vaccination in Pimpri Chinchwad, experts have said. The PCMC vaccination figures till July 2 revealed that 3.68 lakh beneficiaries from the 45+ group have been vaccinated with the first dose while 1.25 lakh have received the second. In the 18-44 age group, 1.65 lakh beneficiaries have received their first jab and 4,284 the second. The first sero-survey, involving 5,000 residents, was carried out in Pimpri Chinchwad from October 7 to 17 last year. Sero-surveys check blood samples for a specific class of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies called immunoglobulin G, or IgG, that appear within two weeks of infection. These antibodies may offer some immunity (protection). “The important take-home message from the two sero-surveys in Pune is that herd immunity has increased from around 34% at the end of the first wave to about 81% at the end of the second wave,” said senior clinical epidemiologist Amitav Banerjee. “The very important inference from this sero-survey is that natural infection may be giving the lasting immunity (protection). The results of the two sero-surveys in PMR should lead to the rational vaccination policy,” he said. Rajendra Wabale, dean of Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial (YCM) hospital in Pimpri, said, “The major difference between the sero-survey last year and the present one is vaccination, which has given the much necessary protection to the elderly population.” He said, “Since this was a random survey, it shows that apart from natural exposure to the virus, the inoculation drive has played a key role in generating antibodies across the different age groups.” PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil said, “The survey offers a bit of relief for the fact that 81% of the population showed sero-prevalence. But we cannot forget the remaining 19% of the population.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/81-residents-in-pcmc-areas-have-antibodies-sero-survey/articleshow/84079872.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: DG office says invoke section 328 in gutka cases||AURANGABAD: The state police has asked all the commissioners and superintendents of police to invoke section 328 of the Indian Penal Code in gutka cases. The section is defined as ‘causing hurt by means of poison’ and is cognizable and non-bailable offence. The violation of gutka-related orders involve sale, supply, manufacturing and transportation of gutka and related products for consumption in the state. Additional director general (law and order) Rajender Singh said, “Our directive to impose section 328 of IPC is an outcome of a petition filed before Bombay high court, which has supported the view to impose section 328 in gutka related cases.” Citing a communication from the FDA commissioner, the state directorate general of police had on March 8 communicated to all the units commanders that the petition related to slapping of the said section is pending before the High Court and so it should not be imposed in gutka related cases. In the absence section 328 of IPC, the sections from Food and Drug Act, and Food safety and standard rules 2011 makes the gutka related offence, bailable. Since July 19, 2012, Maharashtra government has imposed a ban on the sale, manufacture, distribution and storage of gutka and related products. The state government passed resolution on July 20, 2019 renewing ban on gutka, pan masala, flavoured tobacco and betel nut. However, different views taken by different courts from time to time, resulted to changes in the stand taken by the police in imposing of section 328 of IPC in gutka cases. In the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government, FDA minister Rajendra Shingne has been strongly pitching for imposition of section 328 against all the suspects dealing in gutka. He had even announced that they would appeal against the HC order about imposition of section 328. Legal experts pointed out that the Nagpur high court this year in January, while hearing a writ petition, clarified that there will be no ban on inter-state transportation of gutka and pan masala through Maharashtra. At the same time, HC has asked the FDA official to cross verify and ensure that the banned stuff is not unloaded in Maharashtra on the pretext of transporting from the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/invoke-section-328-in-gutka-cases-dg-office/articleshow/84073494.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Kolhapur||Four districts of West Maharashtra get above normal rain||KOLHAPUR: The four districts of western Maharashtra — Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli and Solapur — have received more than their share of normal rainfall in June. Last year, Satara and Kolhapur districts were rain deficient. This time, both the districts have received excess rainfall, 136.3% and 109.9% respectively for Satara and Kolhapur districts. Solapur district has received 135.2 mm rainfall this year, which is 131.9% of the normal rainfall. Last year, however, the rainfall for June in Solapur district was 142.2% of the normal rainfall. So far, Kolhapur district has received 398.7 mm, Satara 264.5 mm, Sangli 202.7 mm and Solapur 135.2 mm average rainfall for June. Experts said that the southwest monsoon advanced rapidly after its arrival in Kerala. The monsoon progress was such that it overtook the annual expected timelines. Weather expert Shantanu Patil said, “Monsoon started with a good note in Maharashtra. So far, 16 districts have noted excess rainfall, while 11 had normal rainfall. Two districts have reported more than excess rainfall. The excess rainfall in the region is due to constant presence of low pressure conditions in the seas along the west coast.” The rainy days saw moderate to heavy rainfall due to strong wind flow. This causes rapid insurgence of moisture and thereby cloud formation. The region experienced above normal rains despite the fact that there were less rainy days. Since June 22, the districts have not received much rainfall. The experts claim the rapid movement of the monsoon has caused a break. This is expected till first week of July. “The monsoon season is expected to experience normal rainfall. Our region experiences most rainfall in July and August. This second leg of the monsoon is expected to kick-start from next week,” said Patil. As compared to last year, a few circles from all four districts, especially Sangli and Solapur, reported deficient rainfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/four-dists-of-w-maha-get-above-normal-rain/articleshow/84073500.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Eight thrash two over old enmity in Amreli||RAJKOT: After a video on brutal thrashing of two persons confined in a room inside a crematorium in Babra town of Amreli district by eight persons went viral on social media, an FIR was filed against eight people on Friday and Babra police detained a few of the accused. In the FIR, victim Ghanshyam Dudhrejiya said he had gone to the samadhi of a priest near the crematorium on June 25 when the accused approached him and asked him to follow them to a room in the crematorium. Here they accused him of stealing a cot from the crematorium and when he refuted their allegations, they started thrashing him with a plastic pipe, which was soon replaced with a wooden stuff. The ordeal continued for over an hour and later, they locked him up in an adjacent room. The victim alleged that after the merciless beating, he had to be ferried in an 108 ambulance to Babra community health centre. Dudhrejiya said that the animosity originated from the fact that he had eloped with accused Dheeru Talsania’s daughter. Both Talsania and his wife too beat him up, he alleged. “Initially, the victim was reluctant to register an FIR. However, after much coaxing he agreed to give a complaint but did not disclose the name of the other victim. We will find it during investigation,” Amreli DySP Jagdishsinh Bhandari told TOI. A complaint under IPC sections 323, 504, 506 (2) registered against the eight accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/8-thrash-two-over-old-enmity/articleshow/84080028.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Court adjourns order on Shashi Tharoor in Sunanda Pushkar death case till July 27||NEW DELHI: A special court on Friday posted orders for July 27 on framing of charges against Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, in connection with the death of his wife Sunanda Pushkar. Special judge Geetanjli Goel in her order stated, “An application has been received on behalf of prosecution seeking one week’s time to file written submissions. Copy to be supplied to the counsels of the accused. The application is allowed. Put up for orders/arguments if any, on July 27, 2021.” Both Tharoor’s counsel, senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, and special public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava had concluded their submissions. While Pahwa sought Tharoor’s discharge, Shrivastava insisted that the court frame charges of abetment to suicide, Section 306 IPC, and the alternate charge of murder, Section 302 of IPC. Pahwa had, however, on behalf of Tharoor argued, “This case has absolutely no evidence. It is a baseless case where charges cannot be framed.” A magistrate court had on June 5, 2018 found “sufficient grounds” to proceed against Tharoor in the case and taken cognisance of Sections 306 (abetment to suicide) and 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) made out in the chargesheet against him. Pushkar was found dead in a suite of a luxury hotel in the city on the night of January 17, 2014.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-adjourns-order-on-tharoor-in-pushkar-death-case-till-july-27/articleshow/84082138.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Covid crashes Chandigarh dream of hosting 2022 CWG events||CHANDIGARH: Rising cases of Covid-19 in the country and the grim forecast of a third wave have led to the cancellation of the Commonwealth archery and shooting championships scheduled to be held here before the 2022 Birmingham Games. The decision was taken on Friday by the Commonwealth Games India (CGI) executive board with the support of the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF). “We are disappointed that the 2022 Commonwealth archery and shooting championships will no longer take place; however, this is the right decision to take in the current climate,” according to CGF President Dame Louise Martin DBE. “Despite this news, there are numerous key learnings that will benefit our ongoing work as we look to innovate and create new Commonwealth Sport Properties. The Chandigarh 2022 concept has identified exciting opportunities regarding future co-hosting possibilities that we must further explore,” the former Scottish athlete added. “We very much are looking forward to welcoming Team India to the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games,” she further said. The two events were scheduled to be held here in January 2022 while the Birmingham Commonwealth Games from July 27 to August 7 next year. Shooting and archery are among the various disciplines that fall under the optional category in the Commonwealth Games, which has 10 core sports. As such, it is the host nation’s prerogative to choose a few of the optional disciplines, and in 2019, the organisers of Birmingham 2022 CWG cited that the nearest shooting range was 210 km away while dropping the sport from the tournament. Considered one of India’s strongest medals tally booster, shooting’s absence from the roster, created an uproar, forcing the Indian Olympic Association to threaten a boycott of the 2022 CWG. The IOA, later, withdrew its call after a meeting with Martin and former CGF CEO David Grevemberg. The IOA, however, had proposed to host the Commonwealth Championships in shooting, as well as in archery, in 2022 with the condition that the medals awarded in these two events will be added to the final tally of the participating countries for the 2022 CWG. While the cost for the shooting championship was to be met largely by the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI), the archery event was supposed to be funded solely by the Indian government. But with the IOA failing to ratify the hosting of the championships till last month, due to the ongoing second wave of the pandemic that has accounted for nearly 4 lakh deaths, the event has finally slipped out of Chandigarh’s hands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/covid-crashes-city-dream-of-hosting-2022-cwg-events/articleshow/84077712.cms||Tridib Baparnash

---||Kolkata||Red Rd accident: Driver untraced||Kolkata/Jhargram: Cops are yet to identify and trace the driver of the mini-bus involved in the accident on Red Road, which claimed the life of a Kolkata Police constable and injured 18 others on Thursday. With the driver still at large and mechanical and final forensic reports being awaited, cops could not ascertain the exact cause behind the accident. The police claimed to have spoken to the injured and found that none of them was sitting near the driver’s seat. However, cops said that they can confirm the identity of the driver after going through the CCTV footage. “ A primary report by the forensic team claimed that rash driving led to the fatal accident. “The driver tried to take a right turn from Kidderpore Road to Dufferin Road at a high speed, disturbing the torque — a measure of the force that can cause an object to rotate on an axis. So, the bus moved right and hit the constable on the bike. After hitting the bike, the driver lost control over the bus,” said a forensic expert. When TOI called up the bus owner Khurshid Alam, the person, who received it, introduced himself as his son and said, “We are trying to trace the driver. We do not know who was driving our bus as the union takes the final call. We are helping cops in the probe. We will let you know when he is arrested.” Meanwhile, the deceased constable Vivekananda Deb’s family at Jamboni is still in disbelief about the accident. “I identified the bike initially in the TV visuals and got worried. I saw his son's name on it. Later, when a call came from Lalbazar, we were devastated. Both his parents — Ashish and Minati — are too shocked. He was the only son and the steady earning member of the family. I do not know about the future of his seven-year-old son,” said his cousin, Pabitra Deb. “He was a happy person and whenever he returned from Kolkata, he would tell us about the stories of hope,” he recounted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/red-rd-accident-driver-untraced/articleshow/84077795.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Kolhapur||Covid norms keep tourists far from monsoon getaways in Kolhapur||KOLHAPUR: The popular Monsoon getaways in and around Kolhapur will not see a spark in tourism activities for the the third consecutive year. Plenty of waterfalls, dams, forests, scenic beauty of ghats and the lush green landscapes make the district one of the much preferred monsoon destinations in western Maharashtra. However, this time, too, the district will not see much of tourism activities owing to the second wave of the pandemic. Most tourist spots and getaway destinations in the district will be shut for visitors this year. Prior to the pandemic, tourism during monsoon in Kolhapur was largely impacted due to 2019 floods. And, ever since the pandemic hit the country last year, tourism has taken another big blow. Resorts, halls and hotels in most places were temporarily converted into quarantine centres by the district administration to accommodate Covid patients. This year, owing to the fear of a new strain of Covid-19, various destinations in the district like Radhanagari, Shahuwadi, Gagan-Bawda, Chandgad and Panhala are set to remain shut, affecting local monsoon-related businesses. Pradeep Jadhav, a resort owner at Amba, said, “Last year, the resorts at Amba had been converted into quarantine centres till October by the district administration. Therefore, prime tourism period was completely wasted. This year too, waterfalls and other monsoon spots in Shahuwadi have been prohibited for visitors due to the second wave. We are yet to recover from last year’s losses and again this year the losses will get doubled. In monsoon, Amba stays full with tourists coming from Kolhapur, Sangli, Belagavi, Pune and Mumbai. But this year, akin to last year, the hill station will be deserted. We are unable to operate our resorts and pay our workers.” Abhijeet Lokhande, a city-based tours and travels company operator, said, “I used to organise monsoon bike rides, nature trails and waterfall rappelling activities during the monsoon with a huge number of adventure lovers opting for it. Last year, we faced heavy losses due to most places being shut in view of the pandemic. This year too, the scenario will be similar as most of the monsoon tourism places are shut.

---||India||We aren’t here to advise governor on upper house nominations: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday said it cannot direct framing of guidelines for selection of persons for nomination as members of legislative councils by the Governor, who discharges this constitutional duty on the aid and advice of the council of ministers headed by the chief minister. Appearing for Latur-based PIL petitioner Jagannatha S Patil, advocate Prachiti Deshpande told a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices A S Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy that under the mandate of Article 171 of the Constitution, the Governor is to nominate to Maharashtra Legislative Council 12 persons who have "special knowledge or practical experience in respect of literature, science, art, co-operative movement and social service". However, such nominations are bagged mostly by persons with certain political affiliation, she alleged. The CJI-led bench said, "The Governor is bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers headed by the CM. We cannot frame guidelines for selecting persons for nomination as MLCs. We are not here to advise the Governor." When Deshpande said that there is no mechanism to regulate the exercise of power by the Governor under Article 171, the bench said, "If a person is not qualified to be nominated as member of the Legislative Council, there is a separate procedure for seeking her/his disqualification. But, the Supreme Court cannot interfere in the selection of persons for nomination as MLCs". The SC dismissed the PIL, which claimed that "the spirit or soul of Article 171 indicates that in the policy matters these persons may enlighten the other members with the help of their special knowledge and it will be in the interest of the state. The usual modus operandi followed for nominations to vacant posts of nominated MLCs is altogether different than anticipated and contemplated in the Constitution and it is a matter of record that these appointments to said seats/posts have been always made under the political considerations which deprives the class of most eligible and deserving citizens from getting nominated to such seats."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/we-arent-here-to-advise-guvs-on-upper-house-nominations-sc/articleshow/84083343.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Teachers seek regularisation by banging empty plates||MOHALI: Members of the Temporary Teachers Union, Punjab staged a protest march on Friday and banged empty plates to express their resentment over the inability of the Congress government to fulfill their demands. Earlier, they laid siege to entry and exit points of the education secretary office as well as education board in protest. They have been sitting on dharna outside the education secretary’s office and education board in Mohali. Union leaders Jhujar Singh Sangrur and Ranjit Singh Bhattiwal said in 2016, before elections, Captain Amarinder Singh came to their protest site and promised that once their government comes to power, in the first cabinet meeting, they would regularise teachers’ services. He said, "More than four years have passed but the Captain government has not lived up to its promises. So we have decided to hold a massive protest till someone from the Captain government comes and gives us assurance. We also demand that our lumpsum salary be increased to Rs 40,000." Teachers took out a protest march from Ambanwala chowk to Phase X, banging steel plates with spoons. They said they wanted to communicate that the Congress government was trying to snatch their bread and butter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/teachers-seek-regularisation-by-banging-empty-plates/articleshow/84077832.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: No court relief for MCOCA accused||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Friday denied bail to an alleged member of an organised crime syndicate, saying that granting it may have an adverse impact on the trust that the society has reposed in the criminal justice system. A case was registered against Mohd Umar and his brothers at Seelampur police station under various sections of the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act in 2013. Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav said the nature of allegations against him was extremely grave and he might threaten the protected witnesses, tamper with evidence, and commit other offences if allowed on bail. “Prima facie, it is evident that the applicant has been an important member of the organised crime syndicate. The chargesheet filed against him discloses that he has been arrested in other six cases,” he noted. Denying relief, the court further relied on the claim of the prosecution that Umar conspired, assisted, and managed the organised crime syndicate, which he said was apparent from the unaccounted huge assets amassed by him and his family. “Eight protected witnesses are yet to be examined and the applicant, his brothers, gang members are cock of the walk in the area of police station Seelampur,“ the judge said. He also took exception to the submissions made by Umar’s counsel that his client was entitled to get bail since was in judicial custody for almost seven years, saying that long detention could not be a ground to grant bail to someone accused of a grave offence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-court-relief-for-mcoca-accused/articleshow/84080004.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC takes virtual view of Pune’s garbage processing plant||CHANDIGARH: The Municipal Corporation, on Friday, organised a virtual meeting to see the Pune-based garbage processing plant and observe its working to decide on the technology for the Chandigarh-based garbage processing plant. Municipal councillors, officers concerned and technical members were present to view the virtual presentation. Now, a decision will be taken. As per information, the Pune-based plant is based on the technology of waste to fuel and gas. The plant is being run by a private company which has a tie-up with India Oil, which purchases the entire fuel generated on a regular basis and sells it. In the presentation, the company also showed its pumps and other working processes. Mayor Ravikant Sharma said, "Every person of the MC watched the virtual presentation. Here, the issue is only of dry waste and energy is the only solution for it. Therefore, now the technical committee and other related people will discuss it and take a final decision about visiting Pune to physically see the plant or not. We will soon decide about the technology." Recently, Chandigarh Municipal Corporation presented a detailed report of New Delhi and Ambala-based garbage processing plants, which the councillors and officers had visited, to take a final decision on the technology to upgrade the city-based garbage processing plant. However, the general house on Tuesday asked to see more plants, mainly of Pune and thus the virtual presentation was organised on Friday. The matter has been lingering for more than one year. Despite multiple meetings, the MC has failed to take a final decision about the technology. On the other hand, the condition of the garbage processing plant has gone from bad to worse, as it is hardly processing 25% garbage of its capacity due to delay in upgradation. The Chandigarh Municipal Corporation had taken over the plant in 2020 but since it needs complete upgrade as recommended by the IIT Roorkee-based technical team, MC has been taking time to take the decision to choose technology to run this plant. 11 express keen interest Out of 13 companies, 11, including IIT Mumbai, had expressed keen interest to upgrade the existing garbage processing plant of the city to make it fully functional with the latest available technology in the world to run it to full capacity. Initially, all these 11 companies delivered their detailed presentations before the technical experts and senior officers of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation but on the request of councillors, presentation was again organised last month. All these companies showed their plan, technology, skill, viability, mode of processing etc and also explained their plan to process the city’s garbage. Since there are two types of garbage, namely dry and wet, the companies explained the technologies of both.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-takes-virtual-view-of-punes-garbage-processing-plant/articleshow/84077779.cms||Deepak Yadav

According to the data, a total of 3,031 deliveries were carried out at the civil hospital, of which 1,463 were during the peak Covid period. With most of the government hospitals in the rural areas being converted into Covid facilities, the expecting mothers from all across Nashik either had to go to primary health centres or rural hospitals in their respective village or taluka or come all the way to the Nashik civil hospital. Thus, despite restrictions mainly related to travel, pregnant women did manage to come to the civil hospital for deliveries. However, there was a marginal drop in the number of deliveries that were conducted between April and June. While 1,568 deliveries were performed from January 1 to March 31, the gynaecology department conducted 1,463 deliveries from April 1 to June 30. According to additional civil surgeon Kishor Shriwas, doctors in the gynaecology department worked overtime to carry out these deliveries despite the difficult times due to the Covid outbreak. “The pressure on Nashik civil hospital during the second wave of pandemic had increased for deliveries since most of the rural hospitals spread across the district were converted into DCHC,” he said. “A separate arrangement was also made for expecting women who were infected with Covid-19. The doctors and nurses took all the necessary precautions to ensure that they did not get infected by the virus at the time of delivery,” Dayanand Kamble, medical officer at the Nashik civil hospital, said. It should be noted that while maternal deliveries are performed even at the primary health centre level and rural hospital, complicated cases are referred to the Nashik civil hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/over-3000-babies-born-at-nashik-civil-hosp-this-year/articleshow/84073625.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Nagpur||Inferior quality Indonesian betel nuts worth crores flooding markets||NAGPUR: The recent raids by the central bureau of investigation (CBI) at a few places in the city on betel nut traders following an FIR filed in pursuance of a high court order seemed to have thrown open dark secrets behind crores of rupees worth low-quality material from Indonesia which is supplied to markets in central India. It’s learnt a sizeable numbers of betel nut traders from central India, especially Nagpur, are part of the international smuggling racket from the city of which even the armed guerrilla outfits are benefactors. With CBI already conducting its own probe, TOI too tried to trace the betel nut trail through insiders and reliable sources. Apart from being highly toxic for health, betel nut consignments are being channelled to Indian markets by evading duty and surcharge worth crores. It has also come to the fore that traders pay hefty ‘protection money’ to various extremist and ultra groups, armed outfits and guerrilla organizations to ensure their consignments pass through their dominated conflict zones safely. Most of these subversive groups are engaged in armed conflicts with the governments of India, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. Sources claimed that low cost and sub-standard betel nut from Indonesia is being routed to different parts of India, including Delhi and Uttar Pradesh to cater to the multi-crore market where flavoured tobacco, gutka and sweetened supari are in high demand. Nagpur is considered to be it’s prime hub in central India with smugglers setting up godowns in Itwari, Lakadganj, Kalamna and Pardi, Wardhaman Nagar and Wadi where they are known to be flourishing despite repeated raids by police and the food and drug administration (FDA). According to a source, betel nut traders from India avoid trading with Indonesia due to nearly 108% import duty being levied on such consignments. They look forward to route it through Myanmar via sea to the Rangoon port where the import duty required to be paid is around four percent on betel nut consignments from Indonesia. It’s learnt that traders purchase the lowest grade and poorest quality of betel nut from Indonesia which is much cheaper than the Indian varieties. According to sources, betel nuts come from Indonesia in 90kg sacks and are transported in light carrier vehicles to avoid suspicion. “Betel nuts in light carrier vehicles are transported to various border cities like Moreh (Manipur), Champai (Mizoram) and Tiau (Mizoram) from where they are routed to Hailakandi, Silchar, Karimganj and Lala Bazar in Assam,” said the source. The source also stated that betel nuts from Indonesia are transferred to smaller 50kg gunny bags at Guwahati and adjoining areas in Assam to give it an ‘Indian’ look and taken to markets as locally grown product. “Fake documents like receipts of purchases and sales, weights and measures are being prepared to project the consignments as locally grown farm products of Assam farmers before it’s journey into India’s heartland continues,” said the source who has also written to the police and other departments detailing the modus operandi of the smuggling racket. As per the insider, betel nut consignments are now loaded in bigger containers with fake documents before leaving Guwahati. “Consignments are sent to Nagpur via Odisha and Chhattishgarh. In Nagpur, the betel nuts are exposed to toxic s Sulphur dioxide gases at dens in Pardi and Chikli to harden them. Later, they are chopped into smaller pieces (called Chana cutting), flavoured with cheap sweeteners, flavours, tobaccos and sold in different packages,” said the insider. “While dealing with the Indian variety of betel nuts, traders would have to pay Rs 300-400 per kg. The Indonesian variety would cost Rs 220-250 per kg which also includes transportation and processing,” said the source. CP Amitesh Kumar said police had been informing and alerting agencies like FDA and the directorate of revenue intelligence (DRI) whenever there is an input. “Police had been taking joint actions too but the mandate to act on betel nut generally lies with the FDA and DRI with us playing the supportive role,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/inferior-quality-indonesian-betel-nuts-worth-crores-flooding-markets/articleshow/84077890.cms||Soumitra Bose

The total number of fake call centre arrests now stand at 19 with cops indicating that this might rise further. The accused hail from the areas of Tiljala, Karaya, Ekbalpore, South Port and Maheshtala. Police said that the arrest of one Amir Mehendi in the Tiljala fake call centre case and Shahnazwaz Siddiqui for his alleged role in the Ekbalpore shootout helped cops ascertain how fake call centres were operating. “For the last few days, we were getting complaints mainly Australian residents. Apart from that, we learnt of a rivalry ensuing over this leading to firing at Ekbalpore.

Kunte was in Nashik on Friday to attend the meeting of the board of directors of Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation Limited (NMSCDCL) of which he is the chairman. Talking to reporters, Kunte said coronavirus was constantly mutating and it was imperative to keep a constant watch on the Covid cases in the state. “It is still uncertain how the third wave will pan out in the state. The feedback that we are getting from the health experts is that if there is a third wave, it will initially impact the rural areas,” said Kunte. Maharashtra had registered 19 lakh cases in the first wave and around 40 lakh cases in the second one. “Our medical oxygen requirement had increased by over 7% in the second wave as compared to the first one, when the requirement of medical oxygen was only 8%. Though the Covid situation in the state is currently under control, the third wave can unfold anytime,” said Kunte. He also said the state government had taken up a genome sequencing project in association with the Centre, as part of which 100 swab samples were collected from each district. Around 1,000 swab samples were tested and the Delta plus variant was detected, he said “The central government has sent us a letter terming Delta plus as ‘a variant of concern’. We also had a meeting with the Covid task force of the state. The task force wants extra precautions about this new variant. All civic bodies and district administrations have been accordingly instructed,” said Kunte. On the issue of availability of vaccine, Kunte said the Centre had fixed the (vaccine) quota for all states till December. “In July, Maharashtra will get 1.25 crore doses,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ramp-up-beds-o2-in-dists-to-tackle-third-wave-kunte/articleshow/84073671.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||India||‘Can still hold Uttarakhand bypolls on request’||NEW DELHI: While the Election Commission is not under any legal obligation to hold bypolls in Haldwani and Gangotri, the two assembly seats currently vacant in Uttarakhand, as the vacancies arose less than a year before the state assembly’s term ends on March 23, 2022, EC sources said it could still be considered if a special request is received citing a Constitutional need to avert political instability. A Constitutional crisis may be implied if a chief minister who is not an MLA or MLC is not elected within six months of assuming office. In Uttarakhand, chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat must be elected to the assembly by September 10, as mandated under Article 164(4) of the Constitution. It was speculated that he may contest the bypoll from either of the two vacant seats. Section 151A of R P Act 1951 states that a bypoll should be held within six months of occurrence of a vacancy, provided nothing contained in this section shall apply if “the remainder of term of a member in relation to a vacancy is less than one year”. While Gangotri fell vacant upon the death of MLA Gopal Singh Rawat on April 22, 2021, the vacancy in Haldwani occurred due to the demise of incumbent MLA Indira Hridayesh on June 13, 2021. “There have been precedents when bye-elections were held to facilitate the election of the chief minister within six months of taking over, as mandated by Article 164(4) of the Constitution. The underlying principle is to avert any Constitutional crisis and ensure that the five-year term of a state assembly is not curtailed by not holding a bye-election when the remainder term is less than a year,” an EC functionary said on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/can-still-hold-ukhand-bypolls-on-request/articleshow/84083459.cms||Bharti Jain

The Supreme Court in its interim order in April said that the overhead transmission lines pose risk to the lives of the Great Indian Bustard and they need to be undergrounded. It is estimated that undergrounding of lines would require over Rs 70,000 crore and there is no clarity as of now who would bear the cost. He also highlighted the problem faced by farmers for setting up solar projects under the Kusum scheme. He said that banks are not forthcoming to fund these projects which is reason why many farmers despite having land and interest cannot take advantage of the scheme. He directed the officials of the department to take up the matter with the Centre so that the farmers can get access to collateral free loans at a subsidized rates. Under the PM-Kusum (Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan) scheme, farmers are encouraged to set up solar plants on their barren and semi-fertile land and the power is purchased from them by the discoms at Rs 3.14 per unit. While over 200 farmers have signed agreements with discoms to set up the plants, only three have worked on their projects and commissioned them. Bank finance has been a big hurdle for many farmers. Detailing the fiscal benefits that are provided to investors in the solar policy, 2019, Gehlot said that the state government has given customized incentive package to investments worth Rs 1.5 lakh crore recently. During his presentation, additional chief secretary and chairman and managing director of RRECL Subodh Agarwal said that Rajasthan is the second largest state in terms of installed solar power capacity of 6200 megawatt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/write-to-pm-on-scs-gib-ruling-gehlot-to-officials/articleshow/84077968.cms||---

The child’s family alleged that the accused had sexually assaulted her when she had gone to the neighbouring building to visit her grandparents. The accused worked at a flat in the building. The accused had maintained that the only time he interacted with the child was when she went up to the fourth floor where he was working, and even then he sent her back to her grandparent’s home on the first floor. “The girl, who was always escorted by a servant of grandparents, is not examined. Just because she went to another floor and the accused send her down cannot prove that she was sexually abused,” the court said. The child’s father deposed in 2018, but did not bring the child to court. The court said that it could not rely on the statement the child had given after the FIR as the defence lawyer was unable to cross examine her. “It creates doubt whether the child has actually disclosed any such incident against the accused to her mother as the mother made no mention of it in the statement given to police,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-faults-dad-acquits-man-charged-under-pocso/articleshow/84082266.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The party also slammed the government over slow pace of vaccination. AICC spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said Covaxin was developed by Bharat Biotech in partnership with the ICMR, which implied use of taxpayers’ money. But, she said, there were serious allegations raised in Brazil which cast shadow on all the entities involved in the vaccine. “We would want to raise some very important questions because this brings disrepute and taint to the entire pharma industry which has brought much repute and pride to India. Why is the Indian government and the PM silent on allegations of inflated prices by Bharat Biotech's partner -- Singapore's Madison Biotech -- which is at the heart of the criminal conspiracy and allegations,” the spokesperson asked, adding that the charges of laundering call for a probe by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office. Shrinate alleged that as per the charges being probed by Brazil, Bharat Biotech quoted a lower price for the vaccine but later hiked the rate after it diverted the jabs at lower price to its Singapore subsidiary Madison Biotech. “Why is the government quiet? The government needs to answer some very serious questions and order probe to come clean,” she said. Rahul Gandhi slammed the government over slow pace of vaccination, tweeting, “July has come, the vaccines have not”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/probe-covaxin-deal-with-brazil-congress/articleshow/84083486.cms||---

They also said AP CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi mainly to mislead the farmers instead of finding a solution. The ministers said the Telangana government’s irrigation projects were legal, which were sanctioned when the state was united. Addressing press conferences separately, the ministers said Jagan was doing more injustice to Telangana than what his late father YS Rajasekhar Reddy had done to the region in united AP. “The AP government is carrying out lift irrigation project works illegally in the name of survey works,” Jagadish Reddy said. He said the state government would go ahead with hydel power generation at Srisailam project, which was originally a hydel power project and later converted into an irrigation project. The minister said as long as K Chandrasekhar Rao is CM of Telangana, he would protect the interests of farmers of the state as the present projects of AP would badly affect erstwhile Mahbubnagar and Nalgonda districts. Excise minister Srinivas Goud said while the AP government was eligible for 30% of total Krishna waters, it was utilising 60% of waters by constructing projects and resorting to water diversions. The minister said the Telangana government had withdrawn the case in the Supreme Court for an amicable solution on the water sharing issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jagan-harming-ts-interests-more-than-ysr-ministers/articleshow/84080126.cms||---

In the same year, 2019, Alwar police subsequently did not act on a similar gang-rape complaint of a 20-year-old girl who had gone to the district’s Malakhera police to file a complaint that she was raped and her videos were recorded. She was turned away around same time in 2019 when Alwar police were facing flak for mishandling Thanagazi case. It was only when the video went viral and she again knocked at the door of police that the cops registered her FIR and arrested three persons. The girl in her FIR lodged on June 28 this year, had alleged that she had gone to complaint at Malakhera police station in May 2019, but cops did not act on the complaint. Incidentally, the FIR in Thanagazi gang-rape was also registered only on May 2, 2019, despite the fact that crime took place on April 26, 2019. The fact that two gang-rape complaints were overlooked in the same time period, indicate that Rajasthan police woke up only when the videos began to circulate. On Thursday, after police arrested two accused, Alwar police claimed that they were also probing the role of the staff that was posted at the Malakhera police station in May 2019. SP Tejaswini Gautam told TOI that the role of cops who allegedly did not act on the rape-survivor’s complaint is also being probed. “A DySP rank officer is investigating both the rape case as well as the role of the police station,” she said. Alwar police said that they will summon the record of Malakhera police station. Meanwhile, the two rape accused Vikas Chaudhary and Bhuru Singh Jat, and Gautam Saini who sent her a video clip of the rape and started blackmailing her, were arrested on Thursday. The accused were produced before an Alwar court on Friday where they were sent to two-day police remand. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/alwar-cops-fail-to-learn-from-thanagazi-gangrape-incident/articleshow/84077993.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: A day after govt fee order, some schools ask why two sets of rules||NEW DELHI: After Delhi government issued a circular saying the 460 schools that had petitioned against its fee order will have to provide a 15% deduction in annual and development fees for the academic years 2020-21 and 2021-22, other schools have questioned the orders, asking how will two different set of rules be applied to schools. The circular on Thursday had stated that schools other than the ones who had petitioned will have to abide by the April 18 and August 28, 2020 orders. When the lockdown was imposed last year, Delhi government had allowed around 1,700 private schools in the city to charge only tuition fee, and not the annual and development charges. Action Committee, an association of 460 private schools, had moved Delhi High Court against the order and a single-judge bench allowed them to charge annual and development charges with the concession. The government then moved the court and a double bench ordered that for 2021-22, the “fees levied would be recovered on the same principles applicable to the academic year 2020-21”. However, counsel for the Action Committee, Kamal Gupta, said that the government was looking to save face with the circular. “The high court judgment is applicable across the board. In any case, there can't be two sets of standards or laws applicable to two identically placed schools.” The government had also filed an SLP with the Supreme Court, however, the court refused to put a stay on the high court corders. A principal of one of the 460 schools, added, “Any decision regarding a petition filed by an association of private schools retrospectively applies to all. I don’t know why there are different orders for different schools. Never in the past have such absurd rules been implemented.” Following the single bench order, most schools have already sent bills to the parents including the annual and development charges. Even the parents’ associations say the circular is confusing. Ashok Agarwal of All India Parents Association, said, “Delhi government order on July 1 talks only about 460 schools that petitioned before Delhi High Court. Parents want to know whether they are entitled to the 15% concession.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-day-after-govt-fee-order-some-schools-ask-why-two-sets-of-rules/articleshow/84082283.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: President didn’t extend tenure of statutory development boards||NAGPUR: In an interesting twist to fight over reconstitution of statutory development boards, particularly of Vidarbha and Marathwada, between the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and opposition BJP, it came to fore that the President of India Ramnath Kovind didn’t extend their tenure after it lapsed on April 30 last year. Quoting Article 371 (2) of the Constitution, well-known lawyer Firdos Mirza clarified the Maharashtra government can’t do anything unless permission for extension came from the country’s highest office. “The last extension was granted by late President Pranab Mukherjee on April 30, 2015. After that no order was issued for their extension and hence their tenure lapsed on April 30, 2020. In view of the President's first order of 1994, now these boards can’t remain as legal entities and the governor has no powers to reconstitute them now unless new orders come from the President,” he told TOI. Endorsing his views, former advocate general Shreehari Aney said now the central government’s council of ministers need to float a proposal before the President for granting extension to these boards. “Only after his assent, the boards could be reconstituted. The state simply has no role to play in the entire episode until then,” he said. Aney said that deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’ statement in the assembly that the MVA government would reconstitute these boards if governor BS Koshyari nominates 12 MLCs as per demand has no significance. “Even the state can’t stop the governor from reconstituting these boards after the President’s nod, as it would be against the Constitutional requirement,” he said. The senior counsel advised the BJP leadership led by leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis to apprise Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah of the situation and request them to advise the President to extend the 1994 order for paving way for boards’ reconstitution. According to Mirza, then President in exercise of the powers under Article 371 (2) implemented the ‘State of Maharashtra (Special responsibility of governor for Vidarbha, Marathwada and the rest of Maharashtra) Order, 1994’, as per the resolutions passed by the Maharashtra legislature for establishing three development boards. On March 9, 1994, the President declared that the order would remain in force for five years. On April 30, 1994, the then governor constituted the boards specifically clarifying that his order would remain in force till as declared by the President, which is up to April 30, 1999. “This President’s order came into effect from May 1, 1994. In terms of its sub-clause (3) of clause 1, it was to remain in force up to April 30, 1999. President extended order in 1999 for five years, and then for one year in 2004, 2005, 2006. By second amendment in 2005, the order was again extended by five years till 2010. Lastly, President Mukherjee signed on its extension till April 30, 2020, after which it has lapsed,” Mirza, also a Constitution expert, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/prez-didnt-extend-tenure-of-statutory-development-boards/articleshow/84078010.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The DigiLocker, a Central government initiative, allows for government documents to be saved and be easily accessible 24x7 from anywhere with a simple verification through Aadhar. The governor also asked for degrees of students to be sent to them by post as soon as possible and for early vaccination of students, their parents and attendants of patients. This, she directed, should be done by holding special vaccination camps for them, ensuring 100% vaccination. “The governor asked the two medical universities to make arrangements for degree and certificates of students to be kept in the digital lockers. This will provide students the ease of accessing their documents anytime and from anywhere. Pending degrees and documents should be sent to students via post immediately,” said a press release issued by the governor’s office. During the meeting, chief secretary RK Tiwari suggested that in future all state universities opt for full online documentation. The governor also asked for recruitment of healthcare staff on sanctioned and vacant posts be done as per the timeline set for it in a transparent manner and the advertisement for the same be published clearly mentioning terms and conditions for the post. She said that all legal cases of the university be closed taking appropriate steps and no outsider be allowed to stay in hostels at any cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/upload-degrees-in-digilocker-guv-to-kgmu-atal-university/articleshow/84080165.cms||---

It will be completed within a year. He was accompanied by minister of state for Jal Shakti and member of parliament from Ambala (Haryana) Ratan Lal Kataria during his visit to the GIS division at GMDA on Friday. They interacted with the officials of the authority and took stock of the potential of GIS technology in water resource management. The ministers saw the presentation on how the advanced GIS technology was being used at the GMDA for monitoring various ongoing projects. He lauded the efforts put in by the GIS division of GMDA in creating a data of available statewide components like groundwater, surface water, drainage, ponds etc which will be useful for the ‘National Water Informatics Centre’ (NWIC), an organisation made by the Union Government similar to that of National Informatics Centre (NIC). “GIS can provide a platform to all stakeholders working in the field of water and their coordinated efforts would prove beneficial for the nation,” Shekhawat said. On the lines of ‘One Map Gurugram portal’, Shekhawat expressed that a ‘One Map Portal’ must be created at the national level too and asked the GMDA officials to provide assistance in creating the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gis-mapping-will-help-carry-out-heliborne-survey-says-gmda/articleshow/84080081.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi: Parents feel fee pinch despite breather||NEW DELHI: A Class X student has not been able to attend online classes for over three months because his parents have failed to pay the tuition fees. Everyone in the student’s family had contracted Covid-19 and all their savings were exhausted on the treatment. While his father’s business has taken a huge hit in the past one year, his mother is at sea on how they are going to pay the tuition fees as well as annual and development charges. They are just one of the several parents in the city who are struggling to pay their children’s school fees. While many parents are without jobs, several others have faced salary cuts and losses in their family. The mother, who did not wish to be identified, said, “My husband sells trophies and medals. The business has been hit hard because schools and colleges are closed. Right now, the earnings are just enough to sustain the family. In the last 11 years, we always paid the fees on time. I urged the school authorities to consider this, but they didn’t listen.” She has to pay around Rs 25,000 tuition fees, which is due. On Thursday, the directorate of education (DoE) issued a circular asking schools to implement Delhi High Court order on giving 15% concession in the annual fees for both the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic sessions. But for Pravin Kumar Sethi, another parent, even this concession is not going to be of much help. His son studies at Lancer Convent School, Rohini. “I was part of the tour and travel industry. Due to Covid-19, this sector has been badly hit and now, it is becoming extremely difficult. I don't know how I am going to manage. All my savings were spent on the education of my elder daughter who is in college.” Sethi is yet to get the bills of the arrears and the annual and development charges of 2021-22. For parents who have two children going to school, it is even more stressful. Sunil Kumar, a father of two children, said that just their tuition fees for one quarter was around Rs 27,000. “We also faced salary cuts and are yet to pay the entire fees,” said Kumar, a resident of Rohini. A woman whose two children study at Delhi Public School said, “I lost my husband to Covid. We have given our details to the DoE, but are yet to hear anything from them. Because of this, I haven’t even paid the children’s fees. But I want to clear it soon as I don’t want it to pile up.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/parents-feel-fee-pinch-despite-breather/articleshow/84082333.cms||Shradha Chettri

The court directed the state government to file its response on the petition within two weeks. A bench of Justice Abdul Moin passed the interim order on the petition moved by instructor Vikas Yadav and several others. The petitioners have challenged the government order of September 21, 2020 and an advertisement issued on January 21, 2021, whereby applications have been invited for filling the posts of part-time sports instructors. It was argued on behalf of the petitioners that though the contractual term of appointment ended in March 2020 they were entitled for being considered for one renewal in terms of a government order issued on May 31, 2019. After considering the matter, the bench observed, “It is prima facie apparent that no such renewal was done in the case of the petitioners.” Earlier this week, the sports department had released the appointment list of 97 part-time sports instructors under the new system (outsourcing). The petitioner, Vikas Yadav, said the court’s directives had given a ray of hope to them. Director, sports, RP Singh said he was yet to receive any order and appropriate decision would be taken after going through it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hcs-reprieve-to-part-time-coaches/articleshow/84080271.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Vaccine fraudster’s securityman in police net||KOLKATA: The Special Investigation Team probing the fake vaccine racket has arrested Arobinda Baidya, the personal security guard employed by fraudster Debanjan Deb. This is the eighth arrest in the case. Police said Baidya, a resident of AP Nagar in Sonarpur, was arrested after he failed to provide satisfactory answer to questions posed to him at Lalbazar on Thursday. Deb had employed Baidya for a monthly salary of Rs 60,000. According to joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma, not only did Baidya have knowledge of Deb’s illegal activities, he participated in some of them. Baidya is a former central force member. The arrest came within hours of Trinamool Congress MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy sharing photographs that show Baidya standing behind the Bengal governor. “We intend to share this with SIT. We do not know the link, but we did hear a lot of things. The CM has already said none, however high and mighty, will be spared. We hope the facts come before the public,” said Roy. Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar has not yet responded to the TMC statement. Baidya’s family said he was being made a political scapegoat. “There was only once when my son met the governor at an event at a five star hotel. He has several such photographs with a number of celebrities,” said Amulya Kumar Baidya, the victim’s father. The state on Friday filed a 13-page affidavit at the Calcutta High Court on the investigations. The report stated the circumstances under which Deb was arrested and then went on to specify the seizures. So far, police have identified 802 persons who had been administered fake vaccines. The report also stated that Deb had carried out transactions of over Rs 2.8 crore. His aides were transferred Rs 77 lakh. Police claimed that apart from amikacin sulphate, he might also had procured vials of triamcinolone acetonide. Cops have already recorded the statement of actor and Jadavpur MP Mimi Chakraborty (who helped lodge the first complaint against Deb), actor and Sonarpur South MLA Lovely Maitra (who attended one of his free Covid kit distribution camps), Rajya Sabha MP Shantanu Sen (regarding Deb’s relation with IMA) and TMC leader from Taltala, Ashok Chakraborty alias Mana. The statements of a medicine supplier and an employee will also be recorded before a magistrate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-fraudsters-securityman-in-police-net/articleshow/84078109.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Some of the major demands placed by the civil surgeon included Rs 18 crore for two operation theatres being planned at the Nashik civil hospital and general hospital in Malegaon that will cater to needs of people from rural areas. “The two operation theatres will have advanced facilities for minimizing infection to the patients. This in turn will help the citizens requiring complex surgeries,” Dr Nikhil Saindane, medical officer at civil hospital, said. Apart from this, the authorities have also sought funds from the state government under for setting up three Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plants in addition to the 24 PSAs for which the funds have been provided by the district planning committee (DPC). “We also need generators worth Rs 5 crore as back-up support to power the PSA plants especially in rural areas,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/civil-hospital-demands-rs-48cr-from-state-to-step-up-covid-infrastructure/articleshow/84073873.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Nadda’s office has been following up with the state unit and directed them to hold a press conference on June 30. Poonia’s meeting with party leaders centred around three issues —seeking central leaders support for Nimbaram, highlighting former CM Vasundhara Raje’s repeated violation of party rules and participation of state leaders in central committees. “Poonia did mention recent Raje projecting activities as an attempt to see differently in the state. He pressed on the need for disciplinary action against some party leaders for making statements hurting the prospects of the party,” said a party source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-state-prez-apprises-top-brass-about-bribery-charges-against-rss-man/articleshow/84078178.cms||---

DMK MLA from Tamil Nadu Rajendran’s daughter Priya, who met Sharmila at her Lotus Pond residence on Friday, is likely to be made the new strategist. Priya shared with Sharimla some of the social media strategies adopted by the DMK. Speculation is rife that Priya might be made the social media strategist before the launch of YSR Telangana Party on July 8. “The interaction was very brief. Nothing can be said as of now. Priya came here along with one of our associates from Tamil Nadu,” a source in the new party said.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: TB cases up, especially among young women, in 2 months||MUMBAI: For the last two months, pulmonologist Dr Vikas Oswal, who works in Govandi, has been witnessing a worrying trend: an increase in the number of women in the 15-30 age group coming in with severe tuberculosis. Tuberculosis diagnosis in the city fell in 2020 due to the Covid-induced lockdown, with around 40,000-odd cases registered as against 60,000-plus in 2019. “Before the Covid pandemic, I used to see 30 new TB cases in my practice every month,” said Oswal, who is attached to the TB control programme running out of the BMC-run Shatabdi Hospital in Govandi. After the lockdown-induced lull, he has been seeing 45 new cases a month. “It is a cause for concern,” he said. Most of these girls and women have severe TB disease affecting their lungs. “These girls stayed home during the lockdown and none in their homes had Covid or tuberculosis, yet they have worrying TB complications,” said Oswal. TB detection in Covid times fuels a worry that the SARS-CoV2 virus could be making the patient susceptible to a series of bacterial infections, including TB. A senior doctor in the BMC-run KEM Hospital in Parel said: “We have seen 150 youngsters who needed hospitalisation because of severe ill-health. They didn’t report a history of Covid, but had SARS2 antibodies. Some of these patients were diagnosed with TB later during their hospitalisation.” On June 14, the Kerala public health department issued a directive stating that post-Covid patients should undergo a TB screening test four to six weeks after recovery. Kerala health secretary Rajan Khobragade’s note said “temporary immunosuppressive effects and lung inflammation caused by Covid-19 might be leading to re/activation of the dormant bacilli to TB disease”. Incidentally, Govandi has the highest incidence of TB in Mumbai, which is often referred to as the TB capital of India. However, pulmonologists in other parts of the city haven’t reported any rise in TB cases yet. Dr P Prabhudesai from Lilavati Hospital said there has been no rise in TB cases among post-Covid-19 patients. “As per our protocol, we ask post-Covid patients to undergo a chest scan a month later. TB can easily be picked up,” he added. BMC’s TB control officer Dr Pranita Tipre said TB detections in 2021 so far are around 20,000. “In 2019, we had 60,000-plus, but we realised a third of these patients came from outside BMC limits. They couldn’t travel to hospitals such as JJ in Mumbai during the lockdown in 2020, resulting in a drop in numbers,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-tb-cases-up-especially-among-young-women-in-2-months/articleshow/84080360.cms||---

In a letter to KCR on Friday, CPI state president Chada Venkat Reddy said the dispute over sharing of Krishna river water between the two Telugu states is getting worse. Telangana can utilise its rightful share of Krishna river water mainly through lift irrigation projects but AP government is raising objections. The AP government has also written to the Centre to issue directions to Telangana government to stop hydel power generation in Srisailam reservoir. “Keeping in view the importance of the subject, a meeting with experts and political party representatives becomes imperative to come out with an amicable solution and ensure Telangana does not lose even a drop of its rightful share of river water,” Venkat Reddy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/all-party-meet-on-water-issue/articleshow/84080301.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Jaipur||Former CM Vasundhara Raje’s tweets on tech laurels find no takers in BJP||JAIPUR: Former chief minister Vasundhara Raje has accused the Congress government of allowing digital institutions like Bhamashah Techno Hub created by her government to go waste by putting it on hold. Raje in a series of tweets highlighted her regime’s projects related to digital literacy and start-ups on Thursday to mark six years of the digital India campaign. Her series of tweets didn’t find support from any senior leader in the state. Her first tweet reads: #DigitalIndia has been among the most striking of initiatives - allowing financial & social inclusion of the poorest and most remote. On #6yearsofdigitalindia I congratulate the nation while looking back at our pathbreaking digital initiatives in #Rajasthan. @_DigitalIndia She is the next tweet mentioned Bhamashah State Data Centre claiming it to be the first government Tier IV Data centre and second in Asia. “Not only that we have introduced people to the advanced technology-based structures like #BhamashahTechnoHub, iStart, Digifest and Gram,” tweeted Raje. She asserted that the state has been put backwards in the field of digitization. “It is unfair to the youth, unfair to Rajasthan . . .,” said Raje. Most of her programs like Rajasthan StartUP Fest, Rajasthan Hackathon, iStart and Rajasthan GREEN-A-THON are either shut or partially functional by the Gehlot government. The most ambitious Bhahashah Techno Hub, a program designed to promote start-ups have become partially functional. The series of tweets marking her government’s achievement and slamming state government doesn’t find many takers among the senior leaders. Even after the issue has been related to youths, the leaders including those considered close to her have ignored the issue. A senior leader told TOI that they didn’t have any official communication on highlighting the issue. The series of digitalization programs launched by Raje was the result of her high-profile advisory committee. She had during the all-party meeting held in July 2020 told the CM Gehlot glad to see the digital infrastructure created by her is being used in a crisis like situation. Box: An audio clip attributed to former CM Vasundhara Raje and district president of Vasundhara Raje Manch Jodhpur, Tarachand Sharma has gone viral on the social media. In the 1.59 minutes audio clip, Sharma can be heard informing Raje about smoothly running a program (free food distribution) for the past six months under the banner of VRM. Raje, in response, is asking Sharma to continue the program. The authenticity of the audio is yet to be verified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajes-tweets-on-tech-laurels-find-no-takers-in-bjp/articleshow/84078167.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Ahead of 2022 polls, top brass of state Congress camping in national capital to discuss new party chief & leader of opposition||DEHRADUN: With Uttarakhand assembly elections barely nine months away, senior state leaders of the Congress have been camping in New Delhi for the past few days to hold deliberations with the party high command. All the 10 Congress MLAs of Uttarakhand and former chief minister Harish Rawat have been staying in the national capital for several days now as the party high command is expected to take a call on the new leader of Opposition and the new party chief of the hill state. Sources maintained that two senior Congress leaders – Harish Rawat and state chief Pritam Singh – have been contesting for the two key posts. “If Pritam Singh is made the leader of Opposition, he would like a party leader of his choice to be made the state chief. On the other side, Harish enjoys the support of maximum legislators and wants his supporters to have both the coveted positions,” a source said. “As a consequence of this tussle, the issue remains unresolved for the last 10 days. Both are well aware that the new state chief would be the key person in the upcoming elections.” When asked to comment on the ongoing political developments, political analyst Jay Singh Rawat told TOI, “It is interesting to see the top brass of both parties in Delhi. Instead of preparing for the 2022 assembly polls in the state, they all are eying key posts. Despite having 57 MLAs in the 70 member House, the BJP has been unable to provide a stable government. On the other hand, the Congress leaders remain busy infighting rather than reaching out to people with issues on the ground. Both the parties aren’t sending out a positive message at present.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ahead-of-2022-polls-top-brass-of-state-cong-camping-in-national-capital-to-discuss-new-party-chief-leader-of-oppn/articleshow/84076035.cms||Kautilya Singh

In a tweet, he said, “The Modi government has increased the price of LPG cylinders by Rs 255 in the last 14 months. Gas subsidy has also stopped. Due to this, people are being forced to leave the cylinder for cooking and use coal and wood again.” The Centre had hiked domestic LPG cylinder price by Rs 25.5 recently. The Rajasthan PCC also launched a Twitter campaign against the price hike of cooking gas, attacking Modi government. Posting a picture of a woman cooking with wood, keeping aside the gas cylinder and stove received under the Ujjwala scheme, it said in Hindi — Mehengai ke andhkaar mein ‘Ujjala’ (‘Ujjala’ or light in the darkness of inflation). The Rajasthan PCC in a tweet said, “Modi government hikes gas prices again, gas cylinder costlier by Rs 25.5, gas cylinder will now be available for Rs 838.5, LPG is costlier by Rs 225 in 14 months, subsidy on gas cylinder stopped for 14 months.” Former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot also criticised Modi government on fuel prices. He tweeted, “The Central government is increasing the burden of inflation by increasing the prices of petrol, diesel and LPG on the people facing financial crisis even in this Corona period, due to which it has become difficult for the common man to run a house. In this crisis, it is the responsibility of the government to help the people and not to increase their troubles.” Posting a picture of a man carrying LPG cylinder, Pilot said the Centre has been a failure on all economic fronts. It has failed to control prices of petrol, diesel and LPG. The government which had come to power promising to rein in the prices, has betrayed the people. Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said that the Modi government at the Centre increased the price of gas cylinder 6 times in the last 7 months, which was Rs 598 on December 1, 2020 and has reached now Rs 838. Similarly, by increasing its revenue in the form of customs duty and excise duty on petrol and diesel, the Central government has spoiled the budget of the common people. He said the Centre earned about Rs 5 lakh crore from hiking petrol and diesel prices, but the people of the country are completely broken by the inflation of petrol and diesel and the price hike of LPG during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/congress-attacks-modi-govt-on-lpg-price-hike/articleshow/84078212.cms||---

Besides, people are also willing to pay for the shots at private vaccination centres. “Since the last few days, the number of vaccinations administered at private centres have gone up. Some of them have even crossed the 400-mark with many hospitals deploying additional staff for the job,” said incident commander Ganesh Misal. Echoing similar sentiments, vice-president of Hospital Owners Association of Nashik Dr Raj Nagarkar said that some centres operating round-the-clock have seen people walking in even during midnight. “The number of people taking vaccines at private centres has increased by 1.5 times the earlier figure, epsecially because people feel that the atmosphere at private centres is safe and hygiene is well-maintained. Besides, good number of people are also visiting these centres at night. On an average, we are giving 70 shots between 10 pm and 7 am as beneficiaries prefer the times slot to the get out of their daily schedule and take care of their health,” Dr Nagarkar said. Another reason people are preferring private vaccination centres is due to the assured availability of vaccines, he further said. “I tried to get the vaccine through government institutions, but was unable to book a slot. Besides, there is uncertainty. Therefore, I approached a private centre and got my first dose of vaccine there. I would only opt for the second shot from the government centre if the supply is normalized,” said Shantanu Patil who works at a city-based IT firm. Meanwhile, Misal said that since the stock of vaccines is limited, vaccination isnly being carried out in tribal blocks where the consumption had been lagging a bit while in other areas the centres were closed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/pvt-hosps-see-rise-in-vaccination-footfall/articleshow/84073880.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot headed to Delhi on Thursday night. According to sources, the party high command plagued by dissension in various states like Punjab, Rajasthan and Haryana, is busy finding an amicable solution to the factional fights by devising a way to accommodate the competing groups in the party and government. The prospects of imminent ministerial expansion led many aspirants to flock to Delhi. Three ruling party MLAs Amin Khan, Madan Prajawat and Mewaram Jain, all belonging to Barmer district, on Friday reached Delhi. They are scheduled to meet AICC general secretary Ajay Maken on Saturday. Madan Prajawat while speaking to TOI over phone from Delhi said, “It is a routine visit. Due to Covid, we were not able to meet leaders in the last few months. Now, we have decided to come here and meet various leaders. We will meet Maken and other Central leaders on Saturday.” However, he said no political motive be attributed to the visit. The MLAs loyal to Sachin Pilot in the state Congress have been vocal in their demand for political accommodation as was promised by the party Central leadership, while the Independent and former BSP MLAs joined the Congress, have been seeking rewards for saving the government during the political crisis triggered by the revolt of Pilot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mlas-flock-to-delhi-to-lobby-for-posts/articleshow/84078224.cms||---
---||Delhi||BSES discoms can exit 25-year-old Dadri pact||NEW DELHI: The central power regulator has allowed BSES Yamuna Power and BSES Rajdhani Power to exit a 25-year-old PPA (power purchase agreement) with state-run NTPC’s Dadri power station, a move that will help keep electricity tariffs low for the capital’s 45 lakh consumers served by the two discoms (distribution companies). BSES Yamuna had an allocation of 62 MW and BSES Rajdhani 560 MW from the Dadri Stage-I unit at roughly Rs 6 per unit, abundant supply is currently available on the exchanges at half the price. The ruling will allow the discoms to replace the costly power with cheaper supplies, especially from renewable sources to meet regulatory obligation to buy green power. This will help lower tariffs for consumers and subsidy burden for the Delhi government. Ruling on petitions by the BSES discoms, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) on Thursday said power ministry’s norms give discoms the right to exit PPAs after concerned power stations complete 25 years of commercial operation, considered the full lifecycle of a plant. The Delhi tariff regulator had also recommended to the power ministry to de-allocate the BSES discoms’ supply quota from the Dadri station so that they could buy cheaper electricity from renewable sources available on power exchanges. The discoms stopped requisitioning power, called ‘scheduling’ in industry parlance, from the allocated Dadri-I capacity once it completed 25 years of operation in November 30, 2020 and sought to end the PPA. But NTPC did not agree, forcing the discoms to move the CERC. The BSES case reflects an ongoing transition in the power market, where rising supplies from renewable sources are putting downward pressure on tariffs and squeezing demand for costly power from coal-fired plants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bses-discoms-can-exit-25-yr-old-dadri-pact/articleshow/84078240.cms||---

Telangana has not taken up the projects without seeking permissions of neighbouring states unlike AP, he said. “Telangana was carved out as it was not getting its rightful share of water allocation” the minister said. According to him, Telangana has every right to use the hydel power at Srisailam project. “AP used water in Krishna delta citing drought-like conditions. Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Project is being built illegally. Bachawat Tribunal when AP was united had said Telangana should take maximum allocation from the project,” the minister said. The minister sought to know how could RLIP be constructed without completing the existing projects. “Kaleshwaram project was constructed after taking all permissions,” he said.

Health minister Jai Pratap Singh said that though in the initial stage, the project offers hope to improve quality of health services in villages and difficult to reach terrains. “Many developed countries and some Indian states have given a thought to the idea. The UP government had also reviewed a proposal to this effect in 2019, but before things could take shape, the pandemic hit. The idea and its feasibility are being studied all over again,” Singh told TOI. A presentation on health ATMs was made before the CM and Team-9 here on Friday. The CM asked officials to draw a detailed plan of action. Officials said health ATMs are smart and modern machines which would be able to diagnose medical conditions in 16 minutes besides dispensing medicines free of cost. The health ATMs are a part of the government's ePHC (electronic Primary Health Centre) project that integrates telemedicine with free drug distribution. States of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Orissa among others have already tested the health ATMs successfully. To be rolled out in a phased manner, the project offers to find a solution to shortage of doctors in the periphery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-revives-health-atms-to-beef-up-rural-medical-infra/articleshow/84080348.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The two-day long search which began on Thursday evening, lasted till Friday evening. The search first began at the house and properties of executive engineer, JDA, Nirmal Kumar Goyal. The ACB found that his disproportionate income is estimated to be about 1,450% more than his known sources of income. The ACB teams found branded liquor bottles, 2,000 US Dollars and 245 Euros of foreign currencies, a sprawling farm house in Mansarover, luxury cars, gold, silver etc. The team in Jodhpur searched locations of SHO, Sursagar Jodhpur, Pradeep Kumar Sharma. He had allegedly amassed disproportionate income which is estimated to be 333% higher than his known sources of income. The third search was conducted in Chittorgarh district where district transport officer (DTO), Manish Kumar Sharma was found to have several properties in Jodhpur, Jaipur and Udaipur.

---||Kolkata||Petrol price crosses Rs 100 in Darjeeling, @Rs 99.04 in Kolkata||KOLKATA: For the first time, petrol price crossed Rs 100 mark in Bengal on Friday. It hovered between Rs 100.01 and Rs 100.10 in north Bengal and inched towards the three-digit mark in Kolkata. The places where the price of the fuel exceeded Rs 100, included Darjeeling, Cooch Behar, Alipurduar and some areas of North Dinajpur. In Kolkata, it was Rs 99.04. Sources in oil companies pointed out that the price crossed the Rs 100 mark due to higher freight cost in North Bengal while it may be inevitable in Kolkata in next few days. Snehasish Bhowmik, vice president, West Bengal Petroleum Dealers Association, said that the retail price is fixed only by the oil marketing companies and the main reason behind the rise in the price of petrol in these districts is the distance from the fuel loading point to the fuel stations. “But we are against such never-ending rise of fuel prices. We have decided to wear black badge on the day when it will cross Rs 100 a litre,” he added. A petroleum expert said that the price of petrol in the city too would have touched the three-digit mark had the state government not reduced taxes on the fuel by Re 1 earlier this year. Bengal was among few states to take up the challenge of the Centre to reduce taxes on petroleum products. The state finance minister Amit Mitra had announced that there would be Re 1 cut in state taxes on both petrol and diesel from February 22 midnight. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that states would have to reduce tax and then only the Centre could consider some steps of reducing the tax. This implies that the consumers in the state have been getting a Re 1 relief in petrol and diesel prices for the last five months. The state is, however, losing around Rs 50 crore per month due to the reduction in tax. The taxes in petroleum products include customs duty, excise duty, cess and sales tax. There has also been an additional excise duty along with countervailing duties (CVD). Incidentally, the total demand for petrol across the state is around 1.2 lakh kilo litre (1 KL is 1,000 LTR) per month while the demand for diesel is around 3 lakh KL. Kapin Goenka, a petrol pump owner at Alipurduar, said, “The price hike is affecting our business. Our profit share has remained the same. But we have to invest more in buying petrol. We have to pay salary to our employees. Earlier, one tanker would cost 7 lakh. Now the price has gone up to Rs 11 lakh. Ours is a rural area and people have specific monthly budgets for fuel. The price hike has brought down our sale.” Hemant Agarwal, owner of N C Prem Kumar and Bros in Darjeeling, said, “I am a petrol user and will feel the pinch.” He questioned, “Is the government working for the people or against them by hiking the fuel prices?” (With inputs from Deep Gazmer & Pinak Priya Bhattacharya)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/petrol-price-crosses-rs-100-in-darj-rs-99-04-in-kol/articleshow/84078234.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Nagpur||From Buldhana to UK: ‘Eklavya’ Kendre wins Chevening scholarship||NAGPUR: As 27-year-old Raju Kendre starts preparations for his September trip to the UK as a Chevening scholar, he can’t help but look back at the long journey which started from the small village of Pimpri (Khandare) in Buldhana district, about 500km from Mumbai. Born in a poor farming family with limited options, it was Kendre’s obsession with getting higher education that propelled him through multiple obstacles that came his way. The Chevening scholarship is a culmination of his involvement in the uplift of tribal community, primarily in Maharashtra, through his Eklavya Foundation. “Just like Eklavya (from ‘The Mahabharata’) was focussed on his goal and acquired skills regardless of the obstacles, I want tribal youth to realize their potential and reach greater heights,” said Kendre, who currently resides in Yavatmal district. Kendre’s parents, who are devout followers of poet-saint Tukaram and the Warkari movement, always wanted him to have a good education. “I completed elementary education in a ZP school, after which I shifted to Buldhana city. Though a small city, it was a cultural shock for me because my entire life had revolved around our small village,” Kendre said. The academically bright 27-year-old cleared the medical entrance exam after Std XII and was eligible for dental studies. “I checked out colleges in Pune but was always plagued by an inferiority complex. Feeling that I would not be able to match up to the city youths, I did not take it further.” Kendre rues the “lack of mentorship” at this juncture of his life. “You need someone to guide and empower you. That’s what Eklavya Foundation is doing with tribal youths; it is walking on that journey with them.” He ultimately opted for BA from the state’s open university. The turning point in his life came in 2011-12, when Kendre started his association with an organization working in the impoverished Melghat region of Vidarbha. “I joined as a volunteer and ended up working full-time for two years. That’s when I realized that conditions in this region are far worse than in the remote villages of my home district.” In 2014, he enrolled for a PG course at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (Tiss) but took a break the next year for a foray into politics. “We started the ‘village transformation movement’ with some youngsters and encouraged them to contest local body polls,” said Kendre. He added, “I contested the panchayat polls in my hometown and my manifesto was written on a stamp paper, to formalize my promises.” While he lost the polls and went back to Tiss to complete his course, Kendre said independent youths have started contesting and winning polls there now. After passing out from Tiss, Kendre’s tryst with Yavatmal started in 2017. He was awarded a fellowship from the chief minister’s office and came to Yavatmal to plan and implement social development schemes. “That’s how Eklavya Foundation was born, wherein we prepare youths from marginalized communities for entrance exams and guide them for admissions to various universities.” Empowered by his mentorship, around 125 tribal students are pursuing higher education in India. Every year the Eklavya Foundation takes such students under its wing so that no student ever faces the “lack of mentorship” which Kendre did, a decade ago. As the countdown to his UK trip begins, Kendre is convinced he won’t be the last one there from the Eklavya family. “I told the Chevening interview panel that even if I don’t make it, there will be at least 10 Eklavyas who will.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/from-buldhana-to-uk-eklavya-kendre-wins-chevening-scholarship/articleshow/84079399.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

As per the plan prepared by the district administration, major thrust is to install LMO tanks both in city and rural areas that will provide more than 70% of the projected requirement of oxygen if the third wave of Covid infection strikes. “A total of 14 LMO tanks storing 159.3 tonne of oxygen have been proposed in the district. Once the plan is finalized the tanks are expected to be installed by August,” incident commander Dattaprasad Nade, who is also the additional district collector, said. The officer pointed out that the preliminary plan has been chalked out and the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) headed by collector Suraj Mandhare would soon review it. The state government has stated that oxygen requirement could go up three times the demand during the peak of second wave. Considering there was demand for 135 tonne of oxygen during the second wave, the administration has planned to arrange for 404 tonne of oxygen with 282.8 tonne being stored in LMO tanks. Civic chief Kailas Jadhav said the corporation along with some major private establishments has nine tanks with a capacity of 90 tonne and six more tanks — two by the NMC and rest by major private hospitals who have more than 50 oxygen beds, will thus contribute to 90 tonne of oxygen through the LMO only. The oxygen tanks will have a refilling facility which will be used during the peak period only to ensure smooth flow of oxygen to all hospitals. Across the rural areas of Nashik eight such tanks have been proposed with a capacity of 70 tonne||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/plans-afoot-for-14-new-o2-tanks-in-nashik-dist/articleshow/84073913.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The court was reluctant to grant any such relaxation and it said that let at least 50% of the population should get vaccinated first. During the hearing of the suo motu PIL on Covid-19, advocate general Kamal Trivedi requested the court to permit the government to reduce the fine amount citing a feeling that is persisting among people at large. He submitted, “The fine amount was increased at the behest of the high court, when people were not observing the rule. But with the passage of time, great discipline has been inculcated.” The bench of Justice Bela Trivedi and Justice Bhargav Karia reminded the advocate general that the third wave is expected and unless there is a deterrence, people would not follow the rule of wearing masks in public places. The judges questioned as who has objection to this. The government counsel replied that people from lower strata and in rural pockets are feeling the pinch of high amount of fine and there is a demand for this. To this, Justice Trivedi quickly said, “Let them wear masks…There should be some deterrence of fine. People will remain in discipline. Let 50% of the population get vaccinated. This is the only weapon. You (the government) may succumb to popular demand, the court cannot.” Justice Karia said that in spite of the directions to increase the penalty, the second wave of Covid-19 occurred. He told the advocate general that the fine amount for not wearing mask outside India ranges between Rs 40,000 and Rs 45,000. “We may relax the rule after substantial number of people are vaccinated,” he said. Senior advocate Percy Kavina, who represents the Gujarat High Court Advocates Association, supported the government’s demand and submitted that a modest fine would have the deterrent effect and insisted that some relaxation is required. On his submission that the implementation of the rule leads to more complications, the judges said that there are CCTV camera installed at most of the places and it is easy to ascertain whether the cops are right in imposing penalty on defaulters. The judges also commented that the cops are not able to control the crowd and implement social distancing norms. The high court asked the government to withdraw its application with permission to approach the court on this issue at an appropriate time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-hc-relief-in-mask-fine-amount/articleshow/84078235.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Olympic-bound shooter from UP takes 1k-km drive from Italy to Croatia for vax||Fazal Khan Lucknow: How far can you go to get yourself jabbed? Can you take a 1000km drive from one country to another if you desperately need to get vaccinated? The answer is yes, if you have to represent your country in the Olympics in the next few weeks and the authorities concerned are unable to arrange a vaccine dose for you. Strange it may sound but an Olympic-bound skeet shooter from Uttar Pradesh’s Bulandshahr, Mairaj Ahmed Khan, who is currently training in Italy, had to drive down to Croatia’s capital Zagreb from Rome, just for a vaccine shot. Mairaj was accompanied by fellow shooter Angad Vir Bajwa. Mairaj had contracted Covid-19 in April and after testing negative in May, he had to wait for some time for vaccination. Later in May, he moved to Italy to prepare for the Olympics. While other pistol and rifle sport shooters got vaccinated in Croatia, where they had been training, Mairaj kept urging the Indian embassy in Italy to arrange for a Pfizer vaccine from him as it had a shorter gap of 21 days between two doses. However, when the vaccine could not be arranged in Italy, Mairaj decided to go for the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine but it could be arranged in Croatia. But what made the duo take a long drive instead of taking a flight to Croatia. “I did not want to get exposed to the coronavirus threat,” said Mairaj, who had bagged a silver medal in Rio Olympics in 2016 and is looking forward to clinching a gold for the country this time around. Asked if vaccination was mandatory for sportspersons to participate in the Olympics, Mairaj said it was not a must but the Indian Olympics Association (IOA) had given an undertaking that all athletes would come vaccinated. Peeved over inordinate delay and inconvenience caused to him, Mairaj said: “We should have been vaccinated on June 8 with all other rifle and pistol shooters. Why did they forget us? I lost five days of my training and a competition scheduled for the weekend. This is the time for preparation but we are running for the vaccine. The system is not very smooth and in the end they blame us as always.” Despite adverse conditions, Mairaj is all charged up. “I am a fighter. I never give up. Vaccine or no vaccine, my goal is the same – becoming an Olympic champion,” he said. General secretary, Indian Olympic Association (IOA), Rajeev Mehta pleaded ignorance on the issue and said he was not aware that any sportsperson was left to be vaccinated. General secretary, National Rifle Association of India (NRAI), Rajeev Bhatia said, "Meraj's vaccination got delayed as he had Covid. Now, all the players have been vaccinated." He said vaccination was mandatory for sportspersons from a few countries, including India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/olympic-bound-shooter-from-up-takes-1k-km-drive-from-italy-to-croatia-for-vax/articleshow/84080397.cms||Fazal Khan
---||Ahmedabad||Parsi body’s plea in Gujarat HC: Order reserved||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Friday heard the petition filed by a Parsi religious body and reserved its order on the demand to permit them to dispose of the bodies of those who died of Covid-19 according to their religious tradition and not to force them to cremate the bodies. The Surat Parsi Panchayat Board had filed the petition saying the central guidelines to dispose of bodies in case of Covid-19 death is silent on the Zoroastrian tradition of disposal of body and recognizes only two modes of disposal – burial and cremation. It sought directions to the authorities to permit Parsis to follow their tradition of leaving the body at the Tower of Silence, Dokhmenashini. The court said a plea was filed at a belated stage since guidelines were issued more than a year ago, and case has only academic importance. The petitioner’s counsel, Asim Pandya, submitted that there is no scientific data presented by the government to prohibit the Parsi community from carrying out Dokhmenashini. The Centre has not opposed the demand and the local authorities claimed that they are following the guidelines only. The state government is silent on the issue. Pandya also submitted that Parsis are such a miniscule minority that their religious practice of disposal was not taken into consideration while preparing guidelines. He argued that only a law can stop people from practising religious rituals and the guidelines are not a law. Senior advocate Percy Kavina, who was present at the hearing, interjected that for 7-8 decades, the Parsi community has started burying bodies at many places across India. He said it is not anathema or sacrilegious, if bodies are buried. To this the petitioner’s advocate submitted that liberal people may take liberty, but this is an individual’s choice . The judges commented that the present pandemic was novel and there is no question of individual’s perception.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/parsi-bodys-plea-order-reserved/articleshow/84078244.cms||---

The government issued a GO a couple of days ago implementing the new zonal system after the Centre cleared the zonal system in the state. While some new zones like Vikarabad and Charminar were created, the multi-zones were created for some departments such as police.

Similar scenes were witnessed at various vaccination centres as the state health department was left with a very less quantity of vaccines on Friday across the state. In its daily report the health department stated that 58,382 people of various categories got the vaccine on Friday out of which 42,750 got the first dose, while 15,632 got the second dose. The authorities however asserted that on Saturday the vaccination will gain momentum as at least 7 lakh doses have been sent to centres across the state. As the health department got nearly 2 lakh more doses in the afternoon, they were left with a stock of nearly 7 lakh doses. “Hopefully on Saturday, we will have good vaccination as this stock of 7 lakh doses will reach across the state by early Saturday,” said Raghuraj Singh, nodal officer, vaccination told TOI. “If they are getting 5 lakh doses on a particular day they consume the whole the next day is their policy so far. They are more interested in making records and creating hype but they should also take the responsibility when we are asked to return due to lack of doses,” said Digvijay Bhandari who was seen at a vaccination centre at Malviya Nagar and was keen to get his second dose of Covaxin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/vaccination-to-gather-pace-today-as-centres-get-7l-doses/articleshow/84078242.cms||Ashish Mehta

Measures were also undertaken to rectify the drainage system at the plant to ensure that the waste and leachate do not flow out of the compound. Rebello said that the problem of garbage flowing out due to heavy rain has been controlled and that the dumps have been covered with tarpaulin. Further, he said that construction of a drainage system has been planned so that the water entering the plant is diverted from the compound. “Our workers will recover and secure the garbage that flowed outside the compound due to rains,” Rebello said. Goa Waste Management Corporation and the contractor appointed for the work had commenced work on the treatment of garbage and even worked for nearly 10 days. However, work had to be abandoned due to sudden rain. The uncovered garbage was even processed, but couldn't be removed due to continuous rain, a source from the municipality said. Meanwhile, representatives from Revolutionary Goans (RG) visited the plant after reports emerged of leachate flowing into nearby fields and water bodies including the rivulet connecting to the Agonda river. “The municipal garbage treatment plant at Dumanem should not become another Sonsodo,” Canacona RG member Prashant Pagui said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tarpaulin-cover-for-dumanem-garbage-dumps/articleshow/84080481.cms||---

Tope said nearly 11,000 samples would be collected for genome sequencing during the 90-day period. “We had earlier tested 3,400 samples, of which 21 had returned positive for the Delta Plus variant. Each month, 100 samples per district are being collected. As part of our efforts to keep a close eye on the variant, the surveillance has been further extended,” said Tope. He confirmed that only one of the 21 confirmed Delta Plus cases had been vaccinated against Covid, but refuted online reports claiming an additional 14 Delta Plus cases in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/11000-more-samples-to-be-studied-over-90-days-for-delta-plus-in-mumbai-tope/articleshow/84080492.cms||---

With this development in place, the next step that the state cricket body will take before starting with the construction work is issuing of the tenders. “It is a major step in taking forward the construction work of RCA’s new stadium. We deposited the lease amount and JDA commissioner Gaurav Goyal handed us the land deed. The next step will be to float tenders for the construction work. After the entire verification, we will lay the foundation stone, and that will take two-and-a-half month or so,” said RCA president Vaibhav Gehlot during a media interaction. The new stadium will be the third largest cricket stadium in the world, after the Narendra Modi Stadium in Motera and the Melbourne Cricket Stadium, and will have a seating capacity of 75,000. RCA has also received an official letter from The Board of Control for Cricket in India regarding the infrastructure grant of Rs 100 crore. Talking about the other means to meet the stadium expenditure, Vaibhav said, “We are also in talks with different banks from which we can take a loan of Rs100 crore. There is a target of 80-90 crore that we are aiming for which we will try to secure from different corporate houses for the work pertaining to corporate boxes and pavilion. RCA will also add some amount in the kitty. In the first phase we will try to complete the seating capacity of 40,000 and the budget for the same has been estimated to be between Rs 300-350 crore.” He added that the completion of the first phase will take approximately 2.5 years. A JDA official said that around 40.6 hectares of land has been allotted at 30% District Lease Committee (DLC) rates. “The RCA will provide payment in four instalments. The JDA will give possession of land after the first instalment. The cricket body will also construct a hotel on the allotted land. However, a condition has been laid that JDA will approve maps of the hotel only after 50% of the stadium construction is completed,” the official added. Moreover, refurbishment of the Barkatullah Khan Stadium in Jodhpur is going at a fast pace. “The Rajasthan government had this year allocated a budget of Rs20 crore to get the Jodhpur stadium revamped and the work is in full progress there. A committee formed by us will visit the stadium on Monday and give us a progress report. The work will be over by mid-October and we can host the domestic tournaments there in November-December,” added the RCA president. The executive committee meeting of the RCA was also held where it was decided that the cricketing activity in the state can be restarted by mid-August or in the first week of September. “Training camps and other tournaments will be planned keeping in view the guidelines by the BCCI and the state government,” he concluded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jda-hands-over-lease-deed-to-rca-for-new-stadium/articleshow/84078237.cms||---

The specialist doctors’ advocates questioned the government’s bid to enforce bonds, saying that these former students, who studied at government medical colleges, are liable to discharge service on government orders. They also questioned the rationale for the government’s refusal to accept bond money and it instead resorting to provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act. They submitted that many had passed out from colleges 5 years ago and moved on with their lives. Chief Justice Vikram Nath said that it cannot be said that the emergency is over. The need may arise any time and government may require their services. Justice J B Pardiwala asked whether the government has lodged any FIR till date. To this, the government pleader termed the situation a “sorry state of affairs” because the specialists studied after paying nominal fees and signed bonds, but refused to serve the nation. The petitioner’s advocate countered by questioning why the state decided to call only bonded doctors only and not all doctors. The law is not meant for a select few. To this, the government pleader argued that the state required services of specialist doctors. The judges sought to know if these doctors had issued mandatory notices to state upon completion of course so that government could inform them about serving in rural areas in next six months. The court has posted a further hearing for next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-hears-bonded-doctors-plea-against-fir-orders/articleshow/84078252.cms||---

Conducted twice in a year, the first test was held in April. With the second test scheduled for July 15, the last date to apply was June 30 which was then extended to 8 pm on July 2. The program is offered by about 120 colleges affiliated to Anna University apart from several deemed universities and centrally-funded technical institutions. Many colleges are located in and around Chennai that attract students from various parts of the state and country. Students from metropolitan localities exposed to the field of architecture have been showing interest in joining this professional degree program. “The online free coaching was an idea to break the stereotype that such programs are meant for urban and the elite as it involves building architecture and interior designing,” said Mu Sarath Kumar, 25, a teacher and practitioner of sustainable architecture. He said a total of 31 students have joined the orientation program from Dindigul, Kovilpatti, Cuddalore, Thittakudi, Omalur, Alanthurai from Coimbatore and Madurai. Many rural folks stay away from the course as many colleges charge over Rs 1 lakh as annual fee. “We are educating students and parents on government scheme like the post-metric scholarship scheme, fee waiver for first graduate which brings down the fee,” he said.  Like many of her classmates, P Soni, 18 from Polur near Thiruvannamalai too wanted to pursue MBBS. Introduced to architecture by one of her seniors, she came to know about the diverse opportunities in this field. “I realised that I am more inclined towards this creative industry than conventional learning. The field of architecture fascinates me,” she said. “Knowledge of class 12 science subjects as the eligibility criteria to apply for B Arch may not be sufficient to clear NATA as questions from ancient building architecture are asked in the test,” said Syed Mohamed Murshid, an aspirant from Perambalur who has architecture as a career option. While candidates need preparation, coaching institutes charge over Rs 10,000 for NATA classes. The free NATA coaching has been helping in the preparation besides knowing the scope for such programs, he said. Architecture gradutes can take up practice independently by registering themselves as architects besides joining as junior architect or research work, art direction in cinema, interior designing, production designing among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/young-architects-hold-free-e-coaching-for-nata-aspirants/articleshow/84076076.cms||Sampath Kumar

Liquor was also found on one of the arrested accused during the raid and a seperate offence was registered regarding the seizure. Police had received a tip-off that a large number of persons had gathered for gambling in the Jimira Resort near Shivrajpur. On raiding, police found people gambling in five rooms in the resort. The group included Solanki. Cops got to know that the rooms in the resort were booked by one Harshad Patel, a resident of Ahmedabad. Sources said that the remaining people were called to gamble by Patel. The group included seven women who were called to work as dealers on the gambling tables or perform similar tasks. “People involved in gambling included those from Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Surat, Vadodara and Anand. The seven women held at the site included four from Nepal, two from Surat and Patel’s wife,” said a senior police official. Panchmahal crime branch police inspector D B Chudasama said that Patel used to hold trips to Goa for gambling as there were casinos there. However, the casinos were not working due to Covid-19 and hence Patel organized the gambling party in this resort. He used coins like those used in casinos and kept accounts in books. Chudasama said that two cottages that were secluded and not clearly visible from the outside were used for gambling. Patel and Solanki had been in touch with each other. The MLA denied involvement in gambling said that he had come to visit Pavagadh and stopped over at the resort where he was caught. Cash amounting to Rs 3.89lakh, 25 mobile phones, one laptop and eight cars were seized during the raid. The total value of the the seizure is valued at Rs 1.15crore. Solanki (43) had won on a BJP ticket for the first time in a byelection in 2014 after the Matar seat fell vacant as Devusinh Chauhan, the sitting MLA then, won the Lok Sabha polls. Solanki got the ticket again in 2017 and won again.

---||Surat||Surat health infrastructure to get a booster||SURAT: The Diamond City has set up a multifaceted health infrastructure, probably unique in the country, to stay a step ahead in the fight with the Covid-19 pandemic. This will particularly prove to be an advantage in face of the third wave that looms large over the country. The planned comprehensive urban health setup will comprise one health care centre, a vector-borne diseases control (VBDC) unit besides a sanitation unit to manage a population of 50,000. All these three facilities will come under one Urban Health Centre (UHC) of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC). “City will be the first in the country to have such an infrastructure,” said AK Naik, deputy commissioner, health. He said that the city already has some infrastructure ready which are still in use, it can be improved further to meet the targets set for better monitoring, management and implementation of healthcare facilties. As per the existing population, the city needs 88 UHCs. The city now has 52 health centres and 35 VBDC units. To develop the infrastructure, SMC will construct the health centre and VBDC units in each area and fresh staff will also be recruited for these. “With a high rate of urbanisation and industrialisation it was required to upgrade the existing infrastructure,” said a health official. SMC has proposed around Rs 250 crore investment for infrastructure of the health facilities in the city for the 2021-22 budget. Since the budget was proposed before the second wave of Covid-19 SMC officials claim that the spending on health will increase. Meanwhile, around Rs 75 crore funding will be done by the state government for new employees. “Every zone in the city has started working on improving the health infrastructure as per the plan and this will help us fight situations like Covid-19 in future. We are also doing health gap analysis depending upon the requirements of each area to achieve targets,” said Banchhanidhi Pani, city municipal commissioner. “Each unit will be able to perform better with a limited population.

---||Hyderabad||Amaravati: IAS officer Cherukuri Sridhar seeks protection after deposing in land scam||HYDERABAD: IAS officer Cherukuri Sridhar has sought protection as he deposed before the Crime Investigation Department (CID) as a witness in the alleged illegal land scam in AmaravatiSridhar had written to Andhra Pradesh chief secretary Adityanath Das on June 27 seeking security for himself and his family. Sridhar reportedly named top politicians and officials who were at the helm of affairs in his letter to the CS for their alleged role in the scam. Sridhar, a 2009 batch officer, was joint collector of Guntur district when the land deals were struck in then government and later officiated as Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) commissioner. Sridhar was questioned by the CID in March after an FIR was filed on March 12 in the alleged land scam case. The names of Mohan Rao and Ramaiah, who were experts in revenue laws and attached to the CRDA at that time, had also come up. While Mohan Rao has passed away, Ramaiah is working in Telangana state secretariat after his retirement. Investigations by the CID have found that returnable plots were given to encroachers as against the revenue laws. Investigators said the revenue records of Thullur mandal were called for specifically and land details were taken confidentially in October 2014 by then government. The CID is also likely to question then municipal administration minister P Narayana who oversaw the whole process of land pooling scheme and capital construction works. Then revenue officials were asked to submit one set of photo copies of all land records of Thullur mandal for the group of ministers to decide the location of the capital city. The original records were supposed to be returned to the MRO office, Thullur, but they were retained in the collectorate itself, the CID alleged. Though Sridhar had mentioned applicability of Andhra Pradesh Assigned Lands (Prohibition of Transfers) Act, 1977, if any assigned land was alienated to others as it was an offence and that the land should be resumed to the government, it was not taken into consideration, he claimed. Then minister Naryana himself made an announcement to allot returnable plots for various categories of land owners, the CID said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ias-officer-seeks-protection-after-deposing-in-land-scam/articleshow/84080441.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

In another significant decision, a state-level committee (SLC) headed by chief secretary was formed to regularly review and curb sale of adulterated biodiesel. It was decided on Friday that biodiesel can be sourced and sold only by oil marketing companies. The SLC will regularly review the implementation of the biodiesel sale policy in the state and check mixing of other substances in it. Rupani said strict action has to be taken in view of widespread complaints about unscrupulous elements mixing other substances in biodiesel. He asked the committee to frame rules of action to be taken against persons who mix solvent and other petroleum products in biodiesel. The meeting discussed how the Centre’s biodiesel policy can be implemented in Gujarat. The Centre’s policy is to sell biodiesel after blending it with high-speed diesel in fixed proportion, with a view to reduce dependence on foreign exchange to import petroleum products. Pure biodiesel is produced by extracting methyl or ethyl alcohol from jatropha, karanj tel, etc. At the meeting, it was decided that guidelines will be announced in the future to encourage private entrepreneurs in MSME sector to produce industrial biodiesel which can be mixed with high-speed diesel, as per norms fixed by GPCB and other agencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/state-govt-clamps-down-on-sale-of-adulterated-biodiesel/articleshow/84078997.cms||---

No power cuts. Uninterrupted power supply,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted in the evening. Power minister Satyendar Jain also tweeted, “Delhi successfully met ever highest electricity peak demand of 7,323MW today. Heartiest congratulations to Delhi power sector for this achievement (sic).” On Thursday, the peak power demand touched 7,026MW, crossing the 7,000MW mark for the first time in two years. While Delhi received some much needed rain in the evening on Friday, the largely hot and humid weather in June, coupled with the gradual unlocking, resulted in Delhi’s peak power demand crossing the 6,000MW mark on June 9 at 6,185MW. The next day, it was 6,499MW, which was not only the season’s highest till then but also above the last year’s peak of 6,314MW. In 2020, the peak power demand crossed 6,000MW by June 18. The last four days have seen the season’s and last year’s record being eclipsed consistently, starting with a peak power demand of 6,592MW on Tuesday, followed by 6,921MW on Wednesday and 7,026MW on Thursday. Officials said Delhi’s peak power demand was expected to reach up to 7,400MW, though the original estimate was around 7,900MW. This summer, the peak demand has already crossed last year’s peak of 6,314MW on seven occasions — June 23-24, 28-30 and July 1-2 . Due to the lockdown last year, Delhi’s peak power demand was recorded at 6,314MW on June 29, which was much lower than the previous year’s peak power demand. This season, Delhi’s peak power demand crossed 5,000MW for the first time on June 7, clocking 5,559MW at 11.19pm. From touching 4,614MW on June 1, Delhi’s peak power demand has increased by nearly 59% on Friday. This is only the third year in Delhi’s power history since 1905 that the peak power demand has crossed 7,000MW. In 2018, the peak demand had crossed the 7,000MW mark for the first time, clocking 7,016 MW on July 10, and the next year saw Delhi’s all-time high peak power demand of 7,409MW on July 2. The last winter, too, had seen more power demand than the previous winter season. As the capital faced cold wave conditions in January, the demand for electricity also went up and on 23 days in the month, the peak power demand was higher than the corresponding days in January 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/peak-power-demand-inches-ever-closer-to-all-time-high/articleshow/84078321.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The survival rate in patients receiving either or both the drugs was 64%; it dropped to 34% among those who did not get any of the two. In the group that benefitted, the rate of discharge among those given only remdesivir was 66%, for those who got only tocilizumab it was 80%, and 47% among those given both the drugs combined. Read AlsoI merely guided needy patients to where life-saving drugs were available: Sonu Sood tells Bombay HCMUMBAI: Bombay high court on Tuesday said it will hear actor Sonu Sood on his plea to intervene in a public interest litigation where it was alleged that he illegally distributed Remdesivir and Tocilizumab injections responding to requests on social media. A bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta andThe doctors studied the effect of remdesivir and tocilizumab on 521 patients at KEM hospital and compared it with retrospective clinical details of 214 patients from a time when they were not available as experimental drugs for Covid (from March 23 to May 31, 2020). Of the 334 (64%) patients discharged after being given either or both the drugs, only five needed supplemental oxygen. The doctors’ observational study was published on July 1 in the Journal of the Association of Physicians of India. The doctors found that hospitalisation (median days) was maximum in the tocilizumab group — 47 days. It was 14 days in the remdesivir group and 10 in the group receiving both drugs. Patients requiring vasopressors, medicines that help in tightening blood vessels and raising blood pressure, had higher mortality, said Dr Vishal Gupta, associate professor, intensive care, department of medicine, from the hospital and also the principal investigator of the study. Read AlsoAs 2nd wave ebbs, mucormycosis cases, deaths drop in MumbaiCity hospitals have witnessed a significant drop in mucormycosis cases after the huge spurt over the past two months. Hospitals said there was a marked decline in admissions—both local and through referrals—in the past 10-15 days.“The study observed that patients below 55 years are around three times more likely to get discharged. The chances of patients with face masks or nasal prongs surviving are 34 times higher than the ones on invasive ventilation,” said Dr Sushrut Ingawale, a third-year resident, who worked on the study with Dr Amit Bhondve, Dr Wasim Khot and nine others. However, most of these factors were not true for the tocilizumab group. “We observed that tocilizumab, if given at an appropriate time to the right patients, can help in improved survival and less need for mechanical ventilation. In old and fragile patients, it did not seem to have a similar outcome. For instance, the drug may not improve outcomes for patients who already have a secondary infection,” said Gupta. Read AlsoMumbai: Infections seen among HIV patients prey on Covid survivorsSuperinfections, which typically affect those with highly suppressed immune systems such as people living with HIV/AIDS or organ transplant patients, are increasingly seen in patients who have recovered from Covid-19. Notably, many are contracting these rare co-infections despite not being ‘bombed’“Our study states that these drugs can give better clinical outcomes, but a larger multi-centric trial is needed,” added Ingawale. Being a tertiary care hospital, KEM mostly received critical patients. The researchers classified the 521 patients in three randomised treatment groups based on the availability and supply of the two drugs between June 1 and September 30, 2020, and compared it with a fourth group, admitted to the ICU when these drugs were not available. More than half the patients were above 55, male (62%), with diabetes (41.8%) and hypertension (42.4%) as the most common comorbidities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/remdesivir-tocilizumab-helped-patients-in-mumbai-study/articleshow/84080533.cms||Yogita Rao

She said Akhilesh’s announcement shows the helplessness of SP since no major party is willing to ally with it. The acerbic equations between the two parties have only become bitter over few months as several BSP MLAs from UP have reportedly been in touch with SP and are alleged to have even met Yadav. Mayawati, who has accused SP of trying to weaken the Bahujan movement, said following BSP’s bitter experience of SP’s “selfish, narrow and especially anti-Dalit actions”, most major parties were keeping themselves away from SP. “SP has said it will take support of small parties to contest 2022 polls. This reflects utter state of helplessness that SP finds itself in,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-in-crisis-no-party-to-ally-with-it/articleshow/84080505.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||India||MEA: Treat vaccinated Indians on a par with Europeans||NEW DELHI: India said on Friday it expects Indians vaccinated in India to be treated on a par with Europeans who have been vaccinated in Europe. This came as the Netherlands became the 10th European country to approve Covishield vaccine for entry into the country. The Indian government has written to all 27 EU countries and those European nations outside the bloc to approve India-made vaccines for hassle-free travel. Several European countries are said to be considering the request. Answering questions at the weekly MEA briefing, spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said, “Our expectations is that Indians, vaccinated in India, should be treated at par with those vaccinated in the EU.” The Indian vaccination certificates can be authenticated on the CoWin portal, he said, making them credible and safe. “The genuineness of such vaccination certification can be authenticated on the CoWin portal.” On import of US-made vaccines, Bagchi did not report any progress, merely saying the government was committed to increasing vaccines availability, both by domestic production and by importing. However, India is still far away from being able to export vaccines to other countries. In an interesting development, Denmark announced on Friday it would gift 250,000 AstraZeneca vaccines to Bhutan. Freddy Svane, Denmark’s envoy to India told a TV channel, “Denmark stands with the people of Bhutan in its battle against Covid. Happy that we can contribute to the continued vaccination drive in Bhutan.” Bhutan has been dialling many world capitals for vaccines — they had used Covishield for the first shot of vaccinations. The second is due, but with India having stopped exports of vaccines, Thimphu has been desperate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/give-vax-parity-to-indians-with-europeans-mea/articleshow/84083621.cms||---

With the notification of this year’s NEET yet to come and arts and science colleges starting admissions, teachers designated to monitor these students say many of them are losing interest and they are unable to convince them to attend the daily online test. It was the previous AIADMK government in Tamil Nadu that introduced free NEET coaching for government school students in 2017. It was later shifted to the online mode in June 2020 after the pandemic struck. A private firm was hired for imparting NEET coaching on the E-Box platform. Classes for all the subjects under the online coaching got over about two months ago and since then students were made to take daily online test. To ensure better learning, one higher secondary teacher was designated for four students taking up the training to ensure effective monitoring. Teachers say there was not much cooperation from students in recent days. Many of them started believing that there would be no NEET this year. What strengthened their belief was the delay in NEET notification. “I could not establish contact with two of the four students over the last few days. They also exited from the WhatsApp group that I created for the four students,” said a teacher from Madurai adding he had informed the district NEET coordinator about the issue. This has been the case in many districts and teachers say that students are losing interest in being engaged in prolonged NEET coaching. A district chief education officer from a western district said arts and science colleges have been admitting students unofficially by taking a token fee advance in the last few days. While notification for NEET examination is being delayed inthe state, parents of wards in Class XII too cannot be blamed as they want to keep other options open for their wards. “But it is diverting students and it will be difficult to bring them back even if the notification comes in the next few days,” said the CEO. A government higher secondary school headmaster has been designated as NEET coordinator in each district. Further, six state coordinators were appointed to interact with district coordinators of six districts and discuss the progress of students with Chennai district chief education officer, who is the Tamil Nadu state nodal officer. “There has not been any interaction among them over the last few days and school teachers in the Trichy district were also not getting any inputs from the school education department. We are also hesitant to take up the matter with the higher officials as the newly elected government has come to power promising strong steps to abolish NEET examination in the state of Tamil Nadu,” said a teacher from Trichy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/neet-uncertainty-hits-students-interest/articleshow/84076122.cms||Sampath Kumar

We are very clear on this – no way will we have these people back, directly or indirectly or through any backdoor entry. This is the manifestation of the anger of the people towards the defectors,” Chodankar said. He made a similar statement at the condolence meeting held at Quepem to pay homage to former chairperson of Quepem municipal Council, Manuel Colaco, who was the Quepem block president until his death. “Congress in Goa has made it clear that defectors will not be re-admitted into the party. We will not forge alliance with NCP in the coming elections if NCP takes them into their party. People will not forgive us if we commit this mistake,” Chodankar said. NCP president Jose Phillip D’Souza had recently said that some of the 10 Congress defectors had shown willingness to join the regional party. Reacting to D’Souza’s statement, Chodankar said, “If NCP wants to keep relations with Congress, they must think twice before taking this decision” Chodankar said. Asked whether Congress will forge alliance if NCP if it doesn’t admit defectors, Chodankar said that’s was a secondary issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-tie-up-with-ncp-if-congress-defectors-given-ticket-chodankar/articleshow/84080598.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Centre on Friday said pregnant women can make an informed choice about getting vaccinated. Vaccination at public centres resumed on Friday after the city received over 1.25 lakh doses. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said the corporation may allow walk-ins for pregnant women and do away with the need to book slots online. “We will see how to ease their experience of getting vaccinated. For lactating mothers too, we had allowed walk-ins at limited centres. We will study the Centre’s order first and then take a call,” she said. BMC had on May 24 issued an order stating that pregnant women can get vaccinated by submitting a letter from a gynaecologist and their own consent in writing. But civic officials confirmed that no pregnant woman got vaccinated as on Friday. An official said they are unlikely to ask for the doctor’s recommendation or written consent as the Union health ministry has allowed vaccination now. The city resumed its drive at public centres with 1.25 lakh doses of Covishield received from the state early on Friday. A total of 83,644 people got vaccinated. The state had recently received 11 lakh doses from the Centre. As per CoWin, over 3.77 lakh people got vaccinated on Friday, up from 2.56 lakh on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-to-permit-walk-in-vax-for-pregnant-women-now/articleshow/84080656.cms||---

The BJP ally has decided to field party supported candidates in Jaunpur and Sonebhadra in the Zila Panchayat chairman elections, the polling for which will be held on Saturday. Anupriya also sought “proper” application of Swaminathan Committee report to help farmers get adequate price for their produce. Patel said that she has been vociferously demanding in the parliament that the farmers affected by natural calamities be compensated adequately. She also reiterated her demand for a ministry for OBC on the lines of minority affairs ministry. Pitching for a memorial in the name of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel in New Delhi, Anupriya said that her party has demanded the Centre to convert 1, Aurangzeb Road -- the house where Patel stayed, into a memorial in his name. The BJP ally has been terming Sardar Patel as its icon to woo the Kurmi voters which is considered to account for 24% of the total OBC block in UP. The saffron brigade itself has been seeking to make deeper inroads into non-Yadav OBC sub-caste which wields great political influence in UP by celebrating the birth anniversary of Patel on October 31. The ex-Union minister added that her party has also been raising the demand of conferring `Bharat Ratna’ to dalit icons, Jyotiba Phule and Savitri Bai Phule. In fact, she said that the birth anniversary of Savitri Bai Phule on January 3 should be declared as women literacy day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/social-disparity-despite-nda-reform-measures-anupriya/articleshow/84080603.cms||Pankaj Shah

Clarifying a legal issue surrounding Section 23 of the Registration Act, which lays down the four-month ultimatum, Justice N Anand Venkatesh directed sub-registrars to entertain the certified copy of the decree presented by petitioners and register it. The judge also made it clear that the registration fee shall be levied only on the total value of the suit and not based on the value of the property. In the process, the judge also refused to refer the case to a larger bench as requested by the state government. Senior counsel Veera Kathiravan, representing the state, said there were two sets of orders passed by the court -- while two single judges and a division bench order in 2016 had held that the decrees should be presented to authorities within four months as per Section 23, the second set of judgments of two division benches in 2019 and 2021 held that the limitation period under Section 23 would not attract in cases were decrees or orders passed by civil courts. In view of these contradictory rulings, the issue requires consideration by a larger bench, he said. Rejecting the plea, Justice Anand Venkatesh distinguished the rulings of the benches and observed that in the second set of judgements, both the division benches had clearly held that the limitation under Section 23 would not attract in cases to register decrees or orders passed by civil courts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/court-clarifies-on-deadline-to-register-property-documents/articleshow/84078284.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Describing tweets and reports to the effect as “false and mischievous” MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said there was no such meeting. “India supports a durable peace driven by an inclusive Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghjan-controlled peace process. We support all peace initiatives and have been in touch with all stakeholders,” he said. Explaining why India has just issued a 13-point advisory for Indians in Afghanistan, he said, “We’re concerned by the violence there based on which we have issued an advisory.” The advisory asked “all Indian nationals visiting, staying and working in Afghanistan” to exercise “utmost vigilance and caution with regard to security at workplace, place of residence and during movement to their place of work.” “Terror groups operating in Afghanistan have carried out a series of attacks in many parts of Afghanistan, including targeting the Afghan security forces and government institutions and even civilians. Indian nationals are not exceptions and they face a serious threat of kidnapping.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/concerned-about-af-violence-taliban-meet-talks-false-india/articleshow/84083622.cms||---

He developed breathing difficulties on Thursday and had to be taken to a private hospital. Though he returned after treatment, he died at his house in the morning. He is survived by his wife Chinnammal, 74, two sons and a daughter. Senguttuvan had served as minister for Hindu religious and charitable endowment (HR&CE) and animal husbandry in the DMK government from 1996 to 2001 after being elected from the erstwhile Marungapuri constituency in Trichy in 1996. Though he and a few officials were accused of committing irregularities in a tender process, a DVAC court discharged them from the charges. A seniormost leader, Senguttuvan held the post of DMK union secretary of Marungapuri seven times besides holding some local body posts. Fondly called Pulavar by former DMK president M Karunanidhi for his oratorical skills, he took part in several protests organised by DMK. He left the party and joined AIADMK in 2013 citing his ‘neglect’. Former CM J Jayalalithaa made him an executive committee member of the party, but he returned to DMK on February 25 this year. The funeral is scheduled to be held in his native village on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/ex-dmk-min-pulavar-senguttuvan-dead-at-80/articleshow/84076160.cms||---

---||Gurgaon||NGO chief ‘cheated bizman with forged papers’, booked||Gurgaon: The chairman of an NGO has been booked for allegedly duping a city-based entrepreneur of Rs 20 lakh by issuing a fake membership certificate.The NGO, Human Rights Council of India (HRCI), was registered as a trust in 2013. According to complainant Surya Prakash Mathur Vaish, a city-based entrepreneur, HRCI claimed it was certified by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC). Vaish said he got in touch with Kumar through a common friend several years ago. In 2018, Kumar allegedly borrowed Rs 20 lakh from Vaish but failed to return the amount. “When I insisted on it, Kumar persuaded me to become a member of HRCI and adjusted the money in membership fees. In January 2019, he gave me an identity card and sticker, as well as a membership certificate which stated that HRCI was certified by NHRC and CVC,” Vaish said.He added that Kumar kept on making excuses every time he requested him to show the papers of certification by NHRC and CVC. “I later came to know that no organisation had issued such certifications and the papers I was given were fake,” said Vaish.Vaish wrote letters to NHRC and CVC regarding the matter in March 2019. In September, he received a reply from both commissions confirming that the certificate was fake. “The certificate which I was given was a forged oath certificate. Anyone can get an oath certificate by registering online and taking a pledge,” said Vaish.For the past one year, Vaish has been filing complaints with NHRC, CVC, Prime Minister’s Office and even the President. On Thursday, a case was finally registered at Sector 50 police station under sections 465 (forgery), 468 (forgery for cheating) and 471 (using fake documents) of the IPC. “A case has been registered and investigation is underway,” police spokesperson Subhash Boken said.Ravinder Kumar, meanwhile, told TOI that they have already submitted a reply to a notice sent to them by NHRC and if they receive a notice from Gurgaon police, they will submit a response to them as well. “We are a social organisation and accept donations. There is no case of cheating and fraud. We haven’t taken any money for issuing certificates,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/ngo-chief-cheated-bizman-with-forged-papers-booked/articleshow/84082533.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: High court sets aside order cancelling licence of stone quarry in Virudhunagar hillock||MADURAI: The Madras high court has set aside an order of a single judge who had directed the authorities to cancel the licence granted for quarrying rough stones on a hillock in Virudhunagar district. The court passed the order on an appeal preferred by Sri Vidhya challenging the order of the single judge who had directed the authorities to cancel the quarry licence granted to her. A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi said that two brothers had filed writ petitions seeking to forbear the appellant from carrying out stone quarrying operations on a hillock situated at Mottamalai village at Rajapalayam taluk in the district. Though the authorities filed a counter stating that there is no statutory violation committed by the appellant, the single judge had imposed a ban on the quarrying operations done by the appellant. The judges said that prior to the licence granted to the appellant, quarry lease was granted to women self-help groups. It is not clear as to why at that juncture the brothers did not raise that issue. The judges further observed that the single judge, while taking note of the fact that earlier stone quarry was operated by women self-help groups, came to the conclusion that they would have been manually operating the quarry without using explosives. There was no material before the single judge to come to such a conclusion, observed the judges. The judges observed that they are in full agreement with the observations made by the single judge with regard to the need for preserving natural resources. However, it is to be noted that the writ petitions were not filed as public interest litigations, rather by two brothers, alleging that the appellant has violated the lease conditions. The judges observed that the matter before the single judge was whether the appellant had violated the terms and conditions of the lease or not. Therefore, it was incumbent on the single judge to examine as to whether there was a violation, without which the final conclusion and direction issued cannot be sustained. Hence, the judges set aside the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-sets-aside-order-cancelling-licence-of-stone-quarry-in-hillock/articleshow/84078285.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Delhi||Colour-coded response planned for third Covid wave; 6 of Delhi’s 11 districts now have less than 10 cases||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s expert committee on Covid-19, formed to chalk out plans to deal with the possible third wave, has prepared a colour-coded graded response plan in case of a surge in coronavirus infection. The different colours represent various degrees of response, including mini lockdown, as containment measures. Yellow, amber, orange and red are the four colour codes in the ascending order of severity. In case of a high positivity rate and high occupancy of hospital beds, the red alert will be activated while yellow indicates the lowest level. The different codes will also suggest the required Covid infrastructure like ICU beds. An official said the colour-coded action would ensure uniformity of response. The proposal by the eight-member committee, which was set up on May 27, is in the final stage and will need the approval of Delhi Disaster Management Authority before it can be implemented. Meanwhile, a district-wise report on Covid-19 cases reveals that six of the 11 districts had less than 10 cases each on Thursday, with North East reporting just one and Shahdara two cases, while districts with upscale colonies like New Delhi, South and North West districts had a higher positivity rate. As Delhi is fast reopening, the government is closely monitoring the district-wise positivity rate to take immediate measures in case of any increase in Covid cases. Amid reports of Covid-19 protocol violations being reported from across the capital, the government has asked the districts to ensure that civil defence volunteers deputed in the markets strictly enforce the safety norms. The district authorities have also been asked to monitor the presence of civil defence volunteers because reports have come from some markets about their absence even after marking attendance. In the past few weeks, the positivity rate has declined fast. Slightly over two months after the capital had witnessed 28,000 single-day cases, Delhi reported only 85 fresh Covid cases last Saturday, the lowest since May 1, 2020. On Friday, Delhi reported 93 fresh Covid cases in the past 24 hours from 73,565 tests and the positivity rate was 0.13%. Two deaths were reported. The number of new cases is now far less than the daily recovery count; 407 people were discharged on Friday. On July 2, the capital has 1,288 active cases as against 17,770 on June 2. New Delhi district reported 18 cases on Thursday, followed by South with 17 and North West with 12 cases. South East and South West districts reported 10 cases each. Among the districts with below 10 cases are Central and North (9), East (8), West (5), Shahdara (2) and North East (1). “All districts having less than 5% positivity rate can be called satisfactory. The districts with high population density like North East, East and Shahdara have very low positivity while districts with more upscale colonies and comparatively fewer unauthorised colonies have comparatively higher rates,” said a health official. “It is difficult to draw any conclusion from these figures or speak about the causes that have led to various positivity rates among the districts.” All districts are conducting 5,000-9,000 tests every day. The overall positivity rate for the last five days of June has been below 0.15%. It was 0.12% on June 30, 0.15% on June 29, 0.10% on June 28, and 0.12% on June 27 and 26. To revive the Covid-hit economy, the government has permitted almost all major business activities with some restrictions. A large number of tests are being conducted in crowded places so that they do not become super spreaders. Among the 73,565 tests, more than 51,000 were RT-PCR and the rest rapid antigen tests. Educational, coaching and training institutes, cinemas and theatres, spas, business-to-business exhibitions, swimming pools, and stadia and sports complexes are still closed. Various gatherings are also not allowed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/colour-coded-response-planned-for-third-wave-6-of-citys-11-districts-now-have-less-than-10-cases/articleshow/84078585.cms||AlokKNMishra

This boy attempted to trigger communal violence by abusing the leader of 2.5 crore vanniyar people periyapadaiyatchiyar Kaduvettiyar (Kaduvetti Guru). So, he is apologising for that. That’s it.” The video also shows the man advising the boy not to trigger any communal violence in future and to take care of his education and family. The police registered a case based on a complaint by the boy and booked eight people seen in the video. Acting on a complaint from the vanniyar community, police booked the boy also under the Information Technology (IT) Act for his derogatory video that triggered the incident. He was also arrested.

The civic body also said that in case of a doubt, nodal officers appointed for each drive should contact the ward war room. The ward war rooms had been set up last year by BMC to help arrange for hospital beds for Covid patients, especially when the second wave of the pandemic was at its peak. The 95 centres include major hospitals like Bombay Hospital, Jaslok Hospital, H N Reliance Hospital, Breach Candy Hospital, Hinduja Hospital, Kokilaben Hospital, Fortis Hospital (Mulund), Lilavati Hospital (Bandra), Holy Family Hospital and several nursing homes. The list has been attached to many additional guidelines issued by BMC as a part of its revised SOPs for vaccination in housing societies and workplaces. It includes responsibility of the cooperative housing society to display details like date of vaccination, name of private vaccination centres (PCVC) engaged and charge per dose on the society notice board. Goregaon corporator Srikala Pillai said, “Many people from highrises are coming to civic centres now, with the fear about whether camps held by private centres are genuine.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-scams-bmc-now-lists-95-pvt-vax-centres/articleshow/84080728.cms||Richa Pinto

The statement came in response to SP chief’s allegations of irregularities in panchayat polls, “It was the large scale corruption, lawlessness and nepotism of the SP that had prompted the people of the state to vote against it in the elections. Despite being voted out of power, the SP has not been able to shed the culture of lawlessness that is an intrinsic part of the party,” he said, adding that the SP chief’s open threat to state officials was an example of this. “The election commission should take note of such threats from the SP and party’s undemocratic conduct. “The SP chief is lost in his dream world and is far away from the ground reality where the party has been facing defeats in successive elections. Still he is unable to realize that he is losing the political ground every passing day,” Singh said. Instead of limiting himself to allegations and counter- allegations, Akhilesh Yadav should accept the reality and come out of the virtual world of Twitter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lawlessness-part-of-sp-culture-bjp/articleshow/84080675.cms||---

President of the chamber, Dr N Jegatheesan, said that the oil and marketing companies have hiked the price of domestic LPG cylinder by Rs 25. The price per cylinder in December 2020 was Rs 610 and it has been gradually increased to Rs 850. As India is largely import-dependent on crude oil and the prices are market-linked, the increase in international prices results in an increase in the domestic price of petroleum products. Notably, LPG prices had gone up by Rs 240 per 14.2 kg cylinder in the last six months, he added. General public from the middle and lower class are suffering due to the skyrocketing price of petrol, diesel and the LPG cylinders, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tncci-urges-centre-to-cut-lpg-price/articleshow/84078318.cms||---

More than 9 acres of the 142 acres of land belonging to the temple was encroached by the former minister’s relatives using fake and invalid documents and they had fenced the area. DMK’s Sivaganga town secretary Durai Anand had filed a petition in Madras high court and demanded the construction to be stopped. The court had directed that the construction of the complex be cleared by the encroachers or the cost of demolition be borne by them on June 28.

The minister conducted a review meeting with the officials of the southern districts, in the presence of minister for commercial taxes P Moorthy, Madurai district collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar and others. Line loss -- the discrepancy in the produced electricity and distributed and consumed electricity -- was resulting in the losses and this would be rectified through smart meters, he said. On being asked about former electricity minister P Thangamani’s remark that what the government was claiming to be losses due to corruption was because the previous AIADMK government had not increased the electricity charge, he said it was stated in the CAG report and not a allegation by the DMK. It was the CAG report that indicated losses in the 2G scam and the media hyped it, he said. The AIADMK government, which did not carry out the maintenance works for nine years, is responsible for the loss to the department, he added. “Thangamani and former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami should tell us where the Rs 4.5 lakh crore allocated for the development of the electricity sector under their Vision 2023 went,” he said. This was earmarked for developing infrastructure in the electricity sector, but no new power plants were established during the AIADMK’s 10-year rule, he said. The minister said there has been a high demand for electricity in 2006 - 2011, during the DMK rule. It was required to purchase electricity from the private sector for Rs 3.5 per unit. But now many new schemes have come, most of which were implemented during the DMK rule, but the AIADMK has purchased electricity from the private sector for Rs 5.01 per unit. They have not planned or implemented new electricity generating schemes. The AIADMK government had also entered into 25-year agreements with the private sector to purchase power for Rs 7 to Rs 9 per unit, and this too would further burden the department, Balaji said. He said that the activities of the AIADMK had pushed the Tangedco into debt where the interest alone amounted to Rs 15,000 crore. As many as 4.34 lakh farmers were awaiting free electricity connections in the state, though the AIADMK claimed that it was an electricity surplus state, the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/smart-meters-to-replace-digital-meters-min/articleshow/84078357.cms||---

The civic body also asked the generators to try and produce manure or biogas using the biodegradable wastes on their own premises. Commissioner of the corporation K P Karthikeyan said that the rule would apply to all commercial complexes, eateries, hotels, hospitals, residential apartments and markets, where a large quantity of garbage is generated on a daily basis. As per the rules, any building or complex occupying an area of 5000sqft or more or generating over 100kg of garbage per day will be considered bulk generators. Hence, all of them would have to find a method of recycling their non-biodegradable waste with or without the help of the corporation or converting their biodegradable waste into compost or biogas within a week. Meanwhile, a localised garbage management system based on a revenue generation model, has been chalked out and self-help groups (SHG) have also been identified to implement it in a phased manner. This would help in make the corporation bin free. The commissioner said that the civic body has 900 tricycles and about 1,000 battery-operated LCVs for door-to-door garbage collection. The SHGs were identified with the help of the Mahilir Thittam officials, to operate the 41 micro composting yards that had been established in the wards. They would be given the space and financed by the corporation for a year, after which they would have to generate their income. At present, the dumper bins are emptied only once a day in the morning.

They stated that the members were being threatened by Kannauj administration and were asked to stay away from voting for the district panchayat chief to be held on Saturday. The delegation accused DM and SP Kannauj of threatening the SP members and asking them to stay away from the election process. “All 17 members of the Kannauj district panchayat have told the SEC about the threats from the district administration. The panchayat has a strength of 28 members of which 17 are present here. We told the SEC that district administration has set up barricades leading to the venue where votes have to be polled. They aim to screen every individual heading towards the polling centre and stop these candidates,” Singh told TOI . The delegation urged the SEC to instruct the district administration to ensure that the 17 members present in the delegation were not stopped from casting their vote. “The administration must ensure that all 17 members are escorted to the polling centre safely and it should be the responsibility of the DM and SP Kannauj that no one stops them,” Udaiveer said. The delegation also cited similar instances being reported from Mainpuri. He said the SEC has assured them that it will instruct the Kannauj administration that the elected candidates are not stopped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-delegation-alleges-threat-by-kannauj-admin-against-voting/articleshow/84080717.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

While some startups engaged in these services are planning to hike delivery charges, others have decided to let their profits take a hit and not burden the consumer. From Rs 87 a litre in January and around Rs 93 in May, the price of petrol sold in Trichy city on Friday touched Rs 100.61 a litre. A large section of people, particularly senior citizens staying alone, have been relying on home delivery post the Covid-19 outbreak and imposition of lockdowns. With startups mushrooming to capitalise on the demand, many youths got employed as delivery boys earning about Rs 15,000 a month. There is also a big demand for door delivery of a wide range of cooking products and medicines, but the surge in fuel prices has put those who deliver them in a fix. “I am spending about Rs 300 a day on fuel to deliver, which is almost half of my daily earning. Six months ago, my fuel expense was below Rs 200 a day. Diversions due to traffic bottlenecks and road construction works are increasing fuel consumption,” R Bharathi, a food delivery boy said. Since all door delivery people ride petrol-powered bikes, the price hike has been felt across platforms resulting in job loss. “We were forced to terminate a few delivery boys to cut down expenses. Customers are hesitant to pay more for delivery, so increasing the charge will affect our business,” S Badrinath, proprietor, Ocean Pick, that delivers seafood, said. Trichy-based The Foodiee said entry-level players in the online food aggregator sector have no other go but to hike delivery charges. “Major food delivery partners are supported by investors, they can bear the fuel expense but we cannot. We have planned to increase the delivery charge by Rs 5,” Sindhuja Ajanthan, CEO, The Foodiee, said. In-house delivery service of hotels and supermarkets may also see a revision of charges||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/petrol-price-hike-to-impact-door-delivery-fee-of-food-groceries/articleshow/84076239.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand CM Tirath Singh Rawat’s four-month tenure ends with late-night resignation||DEHRADUN: Ending three days of intense political activity and speculation, Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat stepped down late on Friday night, at a little past 11 pm, just under four months after taking over the reins of the hill state. He tendered his resignation to governor Baby Rani Maurya at the Raj Bhavan in Dehradun. TOI had earlier in the week reported about the likelihood of yet another change of guard in the state. The reason given for Rawat’s resignation was that it was being done to avert a "constitutional crisis". Rawat, who is Lok Sabha MP from Pauri Garhwal, needed to win an assembly seat by September 10, but with the Election Commission not likely to conduct a bypoll in the state, it left him with no other option but to tender his resignation, highly placed sources told TOI. The decision followed hectic parleys throughout the week with Rawat meeting senior party leaders including BJP chief JP Nadda and home minister Amit Shah in Delhi after being urgently summoned there on Wednesday. He was scheduled to return on Thursday evening but was asked to stay back. Rawat met Nadda again on Friday morning. After the meeting with Nadda, Rawat had told reporters, “We discussed development projects related to Uttarakhand and the 2022 assembly elections.” On being asked about the bypoll, he said, “It is the decision of the Election Commission. Whatever the Centre decides, we will move ahead in that direction. We will follow the strategy decided by the Centre.” Soon after returning from Delhi on Friday evening, the CM addressed a press conference at the state secretariat in Dehradun. It was expected that he would announce his resignation there but instead he listed out the achievements of his government and announced that over 22,000 new recruitments would be done in over 21 government departments over the next six months. Meanwhile, the BJP legislature party meeting is to be held at 3 pm on Saturday where the name of the new CM is likely to be finalised. Union agricultural minister Narendra Singh Tomar has been appointed by the party as the central observer for the meet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-cm-steps-down-after-4-month-tenure/articleshow/84076237.cms||Kautilya Singh

Madurai district received thunder showers on Thursday and recorded an average rainfall of 40 mm, with Vadipatti, Sholavandan and Andipatti recording 115 mm, 108 mm and 124.60 mm respectively. Many parts of the city became inundated including the South Masi Street and Vilakuthoon, the commercial hubs of the city, where the Smart City works have been nearly completed and roads have been re-laid. Thursday’s rains exposed the poorly planned stormwater system that has small holes at regular distances but were not sufficient to drain the inundated water, traders said. Flood waters flowed over the pavements and entered many of the shops including textile shops that were allowed to open a few days ago. “The loss now incurred due to a single day’s rain damaging the stocks could cost the traders lakhs of rupees,” said Ashraf Tayub, secretary of the Tamil Nadu textile merchants’ association. Many shops used their workers to clean up the mud that had flowed into their shops. “Now, we have started fearing the rains more than Covid-19 as it is causing almost the same loss in a single day. The Smart City works seem to be useless when compared to the older system when rain water used to get drained easily,” said Ramanathan, a trader. Another trader said that the roads were also covered with garbage due to rain, which resulted in clogging of drains. The thunder showers also resulted in household goods getting damaged in many places like Chinthamani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/rainwater-inundates-madurais-smart-roads/articleshow/84078389.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Teachers must meet National Council for Teacher Education criteria, English schools told||AURANGABAD: Education officer, Aurangabad, has shot a letter to all private English medium schools running courses in Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), Indian Certificate for Secondary Education (ICSE) and state board to ensure that the teachers they have hired meet National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) criteria. An association of candidates, who have cleared TET exams, have already been protesting against the practice of hiring unqualified professionals, including engineers, doctors as teachers. As per the obtained figures, in the year 2013 a total of 31,072 teachers have qualified for state TET, in the following year, 9,595 teachers got qualified and in 2015, a total of 8,89 candidates cleared the exams. Accordingly, 10,373, 9,677, and 16,705 candidates cleared their state level TET exams in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. As on date, there are 86,411 qualified candidates in the state and a considerable number of them are yet to be absorbed in the system. Authorities have pointed out that many teachers hired by these private schools do not even have formal degrees of bachelor or Diploma in education Officials maintained that the letter is the outcome of objections and complaints being received by other eligible teachers. “One of the most common complaints against these English medium schools is that irrespective of a person holding D.Ed, B.ed degree or not, their command over English language is the only thing that is tested for hiring them,” said an education officer. A letter signed by education officer (primary) Surajprasad Jaiswal, citing different communications issued by NCTE on August 23, 2010, and July 29, 2011, has stated that it is mandatory for teachers to be TET qualified for teaching to Class I to Class VIII. The letter states that by hiring unqualified teachers, the institutes are committing injustice on teachers who not only have degrees in education but also have cleared mandatory TET exams. The education officer has concluded that ‘such acts are in violation of the Right To Education Act as well as section 254 of Constitution of India and has asked the school managements to follow the norms laid by hiring only qualified teachers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/teachers-must-meet-ncte-criteria-eng-schools-told/articleshow/84071441.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Trichy||Reconstruction work on truck terminal begins in Trichy||TRICHY: Trichy corporation has launched construction work to redevelop the city’s only truck terminal on East Boulevard (EB) Road at a cost of Rs 14 crore under the smart cities programme. Residents have, however, expressed concern at the proposal as it may result in trucks parked outside the terminal due to lack of space in the terminal. Corporation has leased out the terminal to a contractor who collects user charge from the trucks. Since the terminal lacks basic amenities, the civic body has approved a plan to construct a dormitory, canteen and toilets for the drivers in the 2-acre space. Similarly, a linear portion of the terminal facing the EB Road side will get a small commercial complex, in which the shops are to be rented out. With the Gandhi market, truck booking offices and wholesale grocery dealers operating near the terminal, the available space was inadequate and trucks are parked over the EB road, affecting the public. “The situation will worsen as the civic body has planned to utilise even the cramped space for constructing buildings in the terminal. Already buses avoid coming to our locality due to the traffic congestion,” B Kamaraj, a resident of EB Road said. Corporation had earlier utilised a portion of the terminal and constructed a night shelter for the homeless. Since then, parking woes aggravated. The haphazard parking of trucks on the road and perennial traffic bottlenecks were cited as the reasons for the poor growth of EB Road while the parallel West Boulevard (WB) Road has evolved as a commercial hub. “We are retrieving an unused area for parking trucks to compensate the space utilised for buildings. The redevelopment work will be completed in two years,” a corporation source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/reconstruction-work-on-truck-terminal-begins/articleshow/84076302.cms||Deepak Karthik

Some of his controversial remarks included those on women wearing ripped jeans, declaration that no RT-PCR was required for Kumbh, equating PM Narendra Modi with god and declaring that US, not Britain ruled India for 200 years. His predecessor Trivendra Singh Rawat's key decisions such as making Gairsain a commissionerate and Devasthanam Board were also either reversed or reviewed by him. Also, over 80 minister-level rank holders in the state who were appointed during Trivendra’s tenure were shown the door.

Cutting across age groups, people participated in the drive organised by the My Home Avatar's Residents Welfare Association (in Financial District) in collaboration with Apollo Hospitals and The Times of India (TOI), Hyderabad. Over 500 people were vaccinated across two slots — from 10 am to 1 pm and 2 pm to 5 pm. “The drive encouraged more people to get vaccinated. On a priority basis, our entire workforce—including maids, security guards, housing keeping staff, etc—were vaccinated. This drive certainly helped us spread more awareness among residents too,” said S P Bhaskar who played a pivotal role in disseminating information among people. Stressing the importance of getting the staff vaccinated, residents said how they acted as frontline workers for them, during the second wave. “The security staff, in particular, worked very hard to ensure that residents could get their meals among other essential items on time,” said Sundar Padhi. TOI’s initiative, Preparing Hyderabad for a New Normal, aimed at educating people on Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, with lockdown being lifted in Telangana, also received a positive from participants. Residents agreed that even those vaccinated need to be careful in public spaces — wear masks, follow social distancing norms and sanitise regularly. “Everyone uses different types of masks but there is certainly very little awareness among people. The TOI awareness drive certainly enlightened me on these subjects,” said Mrinmayee Gupta, a resident. The drive was followed by a quiz. Winners of the quiz were awarded prizes by the TOI team. The gated community is now holding a virtual drawing competition among children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/in-citys-tech-hub-hundreds-join-tois-covid-19-awareness-drive/articleshow/84078413.cms||---
---||Lucknow||After uniting Nishads in Bihar, Vikassheel Insaan Party set to test waters in Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: With focus on the Nishad community, a Bollywood set designer has fixed his eyes on the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. The UP unit of Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP), headed by ‘son of mallah’ (boatman’s son), Mukesh Sahani, started operations in the state on Friday with Lautan Ram Nishad taking over as its new state chief. The party’s office was inaugurated by Sahani, who arrived in Lucknow amid rousing welcome. Sahani, who owns Mukesh Film Works Pvt Ltd in Mumbai, has been into set designing for Bollywood films. Sahani’s company is credited with designing sets for several films and TV shows including Shahrukh-Aishwarya-starrer ‘Devdas’ and Salman Khan’s ‘Bajrangi Bhaijaan’. Sahani’s VIP is an alliance partner of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Sahani himself is animal husbandry & fisheries minister in the Nitish Kumar-led Bihar government. Formed in November 2018, VIP made its presence felt by uniting the Nishads in Bihar. Sahani started working on the political front even before 2018 with organisations like ‘Son of Mallah’ and Nishad Vikas Sangh but was finally able to showcase his strength when the BJP gave 11 seats to his party in the 2020 Bihar elections. Out of these 11, VIP managed to win four seats and Sahani got a berth in the Nitish Kumar cabinet. In UP, Sahani is throwing a challenge at the BJP with the slogan: “Aarakshan nahin, gathbandhan nahin(No reservation, no alliance)”. Talking to TOI, Sahani said his demand was clear and any decision on alliance with the BJP would be taken only if his party’s demand for reservation to Nishads was fulfilled. “Bihar had no party to cater to the demands of Nishads. Similarly, there is no one in UP to raise the issues of Nishads,” he said. When asked about the presence of NISHAD Party’s Sanjay Nishad, already an established Nishad leader, Sahani said, “Had it been the case, he would not have allowed his son to contest on a BJP ticket and earlier on Samajwadi Party ticket in Lok Sabha elections.” He, however, said he had no enmity with Sanjay Nishad and both the parties were fighting for the same cause. On the chances of alliance with other parties like the Congress, BSP or SP, Sahani said any decision would be taken after October, and till then, he would expand his party’s base across the state with focus on 150 Vidhan Sabha seats. Sahani will hold a press conference on Saturday to elaborate his party’s plans for UP assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/after-uniting-nishads-in-bihar-vip-set-to-test-waters-in-state/articleshow/84080760.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Mumbai||BMC calls for audit as Mumbai’s daily Covid toll over 20 for 3rd day||MUMBAI: For the third day in a row, the city registered more than 20 deaths, forcing the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to call for an audit of these deaths. On Friday, 673 cases and 27 deaths were reported in Mumbai. Considering that the daily deaths had dropped to single digits a couple of weeks ago, the sudden spurt has BMC health officials worried. Friday’s toll from the coronavirus was the highest in 23 days. “I have asked for the complete details of all these deaths as we fear that many of these victims may have been transferred from private hospitals to public ones in their last moments,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. He said that patients may have stayed in private hospitals till they had money to pay the bills and may have then been transferred to public centres. “The patients’ health parameters may have been very poor, and they could have succumbed thereafter,” he added. Kakani said that there is no fear of any rise in infection levels as the daily positivity rate in the city is low. “Despite conducting over 38,000 tests, we got the usual 600 positive cases every day,” he pointed out. Meanwhile, the state reported a dip in Covid-19 cases and fatalities on Friday. There were 8,753 cases and 156 deaths across Maharashtra, taking the state’s total cases to 60.7 lakh, and the fatalities reached 1,22,353. The state’s public health minister Rajesh Tope said that the state government is currently preparing for the third wave and is also focusing on vaccinating as many people as it can. “The state has enough capacity to vaccinate 10 lakh people in a day. The only thing stopping us is the availability of vaccine doses. If we can vaccinate a huge amount of the population in the next two months, we can bring down the severity of the third wave of Covid-19 to a large extent,” Tope said. He also said that the state government will be budgeting between Rs 1,500 crore and 2,000 crore to keep its hospitals ready for the next wave in the upcoming monsoon session of the legislature. He also said that there is definitely a worry about a few districts where the cases are still high, and those districts have been asked by the government to continue their surveillance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-calls-for-audit-as-citys-daily-toll-over-20-for-3rd-day/articleshow/84080791.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||India||Vaccine drive a ‘marathon, not a 100m sprint’: Govt||NEW DELHI: Calling the Covid-19 vaccination programme a “marathon and not a 100 metre sprint”, the Centre said there are mammoth logistics and planning involved to ensure the crucial jabs are delivered to the remotest part of the country at the earliest. “We are doing a marathon and not a 100 metre sprint and a day to day analysis of the vaccine delivery may not be contextually correct to explain the big picture. There is a very serious effort going on in the government in collaboration with states regarding two aspects — one is how to increase production and second is whatever gets produced expeditiously goes down to the field level in remotest parts of this country and we are able to vaccinate as large number of people as possible,” Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry said. The comments came in the wake of some states raising concerns about supplies and availability of doses. Responding to criticism about different projections of availability of vaccines between August to December, the government said this should be viewed in a proper context. Niti Aayog member, health, Dr V K Paul said the situation is dynamic and the projections were contextual. “When we gave a projection of 216 crore doses from August-December, it was based on optimistic aspirational projection given by our manufacturers. We thought it was apt to share it with the country because there was a feeling at that time whether vaccines are available or not,” Dr Paul said. Underlining that average daily vaccinations have increased to around 40-50 lakh per day from merely 2.5 lakh initially when the programme started, the Centre said the increase is a result of efforts in boosting not just production but also procurement and supplies. While vaccination against Covid-19 had slowed down significantly in May with a daily average of merely 19.69 lakh doses, the Centre implemented the revised policy for Covid vaccination taking charge of procurement and supplies of 75% of locally produced vaccines from June 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vaccine-drive-a-marathon-not-a-100m-sprint-govt/articleshow/84083640.cms||---

The developers have been booked on charges of cheating and criminal breach of trust. “Based on the complaint lodged by the woman, an offence against the suspected duo from Jalna district has been registered with Satara area police station of the city,” said investigation officer and police sub-inspector Vikram Wadne. Nanda Vaishnav (58), a resident of Sainagar in Cidco area of the city, purchased a plot sizing over 175 square metre in gat number 102 of Satara area on April 30, 2014. A few months later, the suspects, who are her son’s friends, reached out to her offering to develop the plot. The duos, who are siblings, proposed to construct eight flats, of which, four were assured to be given to Vaishnav. The woman said in the agreement deed signed on September 30, 2014, the duo had taken the responsibility to bear all the construction expenses and assured of completing the construction in 18 months. After the construction started, the two flats on the first floor were sold at Rs 27.50 lakh and Rs 17 lakh. The suspects at the end of 2015 sought a hand loan from Vaishnav for completing the structure. The suspects assured of returning the amount once the flats were sold out. Falling prey to the trap, she agreed to transfer Rs 27.50 lakh to the duo’s account between January and May 2016. During the development of the project, the suspects allegedly even made her pay the bills for sand, bricks and other construction material. Later the duo, not only failed to complete the project but also defaulted on returning Rs 44.50 lakh. Failing to get back her money, the woman reached out to the police and lodged a complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/developers-booked-for-duping-woman-of-over-rs-44l/articleshow/84071463.cms||Mohammed Akhef

According to SIT sources in Thrissur, Surendran has been asked to appear at Thrissur Police Club at 10am. Police officials had directly served the notice to Surendran at his residence in Kozhikode. BJP leaders, however, indicated that Surendran was unlikely to appear before the SIT on Tuesday. The BJP state-level office-bearers’ meeting is scheduled in Kasaragod on the day and Surendran was unlikely to skip it, they said. The SIT officials, led by Thrissur range DIG A Akbar, had questioned Surendran’s secretary Dipin and his driver Ledheesh on June 5. The team had also questioned several BJP leaders, including state organising secretary M Ganesh, state office secretary Girish, Alappuzha district treasurer K G Kartha, Thrissur district president K K Aneeshkumar and central region secretary L Padmakumar, in connection with the case. The heist had taken place on April 3, and the money involved was being transported in a car allegedly for the BJP's election work. The goons who executed the action had followed the car in two other vehicles, and intercepted it by creating an artificial accident near Kodakara. According to Thrissur rural SP G Poonguzhali who initially investigated the case, Dharmarajan who allegedly sent the money in the car had told police that he was an RSS activist. Dharmarajan had also reportedly told police that Sunil Naik, former state treasurer of Yuva Morcha, had given some portion of the money to him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sit-asks-surendran-to-appear-for-questioning-in-heist-case/articleshow/84078459.cms||T Ramavarman
---||Ahmedabad||Getting vaccinated is a service requirement, says IAF to Gujarat HC||AHMEDABAD: Opposing the petition of a corporal refusing to take Covid-19 vaccine, the Indian Air Force (IAF) has told the Gujarat high court that refusal to get inoculated may spread the disease among air warriors leaving the whole section of his workplace non-functional. It also highlighted that a combatant is mandatorily required to get sufficiently vaccinated to ward off ill-effects of biological weapons used by potential adversaries. Corporal Yogender Kumar has challenged the show-cause notice on why his services should not be terminated for refusing to take a jab. He has urged the court to protect his service saying that taking vaccines is a matter of individual choice. Upon notice from the court, Vineet Jindal, the air officer commanding the wing, filed an affidavit on Thursday and submitted that Kumar’s refusal to get vaccinated could spread infection of the disease, because asymptomatic patients cannot be identified. If this happens and his colleagues are tested positive, “the whole section of his workplace can be rendered non-functional as everyone exposed to the infected individual will have to be placed under mandatory quarantine… Individual good must merge with the larger good”. The officer further stated, “It is to be highlighted that to ward off ill-effects of the biological weapons used by potential adversaries in their military strategies in modern warfare, a combatant is mandatorily required to get himself sufficiently vaccinated. Therefore, getting vaccinated is a service requirement and not an individual option.” The IAF has submitted that during enrolment, like all others, Kumar had also signed a form in which there was a question ‘Are you willing to be inoculated or re-inoculated and vaccinated or unvaccinated?’ The answer to it was ‘Yes’. He was administered an oath on the same day that he would obey and observe all commands. It further said that Kumar’s refusal to Covid-19 vaccine is construed as a serious action of indiscipline especially in these testing times when the entire nation is trying to get rid of the pandemic. “His refusal to get vaccinated becomes more serious in nature considering that at the time of enrolment, the petitioner had expressed his willingness to get vaccinated. Moreover, he is under oath to follow the command of any officer set over him even to the peril of his life,” IAF’s affidavit reads. It has also been contended that Kumar is an airman and part of the IAF. He cannot be allowed to compare himself with civilian counterpart when he seeks an individual’s right. “Such a comparison is totally misplaced and unjustified,” IAF said. The IAF also submitted that Kumar’s petition is not maintainable because he approached the high court at a pre-mature stage. This issue falls under service conditions and therefore, Kumar should have first approached a tribunal under the Air Force Tribunal Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/getting-vaccinated-is-a-service-requirement-iaf/articleshow/84078446.cms||---

According to SIT sources in Thrissur, Surendran has been asked to appear at Thrissur Police Club at 10am. Police officials had directly served the notice to Surendran at his residence in Kozhikode. BJP leaders, however, indicated that Surendran was unlikely to appear before the SIT on Tuesday. The BJP state-level office-bearers’ meeting is scheduled in Kasaragod on the day and Surendran was unlikely to skip it, they said. The SIT officials, led by Thrissur range DIG A Akbar, had questioned Surendran’s secretary Dipin and his driver Ledheesh on June 5. The team had also questioned several BJP leaders, including state organising secretary M Ganesh, state office secretary Girish, Alappuzha district treasurer K G Kartha, Thrissur district president K K Aneeshkumar and central region secretary L Padmakumar, in connection with the case. The heist had taken place on April 3, and the money involved was being transported in a car allegedly for the BJP's election work. The goons who executed the action had followed the car in two other vehicles, and intercepted it by creating an artificial accident near Kodakara. According to Thrissur rural SP G Poonguzhali who initially investigated the case, Dharmarajan who allegedly sent the money in the car had told police that he was an RSS activist. Dharmarajan had also reportedly told police that Sunil Naik, former state treasurer of Yuva Morcha, had given some portion of the money to him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/sit-asks-surendran-to-appear-for-questioning-in-heist-case/articleshow/84089646.cms||T Ramavarman

Justice N Anand Venkatesh was hearing a petition filed by the woman from Tuticorin district, seeking to cancel the marriage certificate. The petitioner claimed that she was misled by a 22-year-old man who took her to the sub-registrar office on August 8, 2017 and made her sign. It was only later she came to know that the man had registered the marriage. The judge said that it is clear from the facts that the petitioner and the man were known to each other. However, it is not clear as to why she accompanied the man to the sub-registrar office. The judge took note of the submission by the parish priest that no marriage certificate was issued by him. The judge said that the sub-registrar ought to have confirmed with the priest, since both the petitioner and the man were very young. “The sub-registrar failed in his duty by not ascertaining the age. Unfortunately, the registration of the marriage is now standing in the way of the petitioner and it will affect her future prospects,” observed the judge. Taking into consideration the fact that the very registration of marriage is bad in the eyes of law, the judge quashed the marriage certificate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-cancels-womans-marriage-certificate/articleshow/84078448.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The deceased’s kin who were staging a protest for the past 71 days pressing several demands including seeking compensation, went to the Tirunelveli collectorate and submitted a representation on Friday. Later, Paavanasam’s father collected the body from the Tirunelveli Government Medical College Hospital. The body was taken in a procession to Vaagaikulam village where the final rites were performed. Heavy police personnel were deployed. Paavanasam had moved the HC Madurai bench seeking CB-CID probe. When the petition was heard, the state informed that the all the accused were arrested and relevant sections under SC/ST Act were invoked. It was submitted that the six prison officials were arrested and the case was transferred to CB-CID. Subsequently, the court had directed the petitioner to receive the body within May 1. However, Paavanasam had filed a second petition seeking a judicial inquiry by a sitting judge of the HC. The court said that the petition would be heard only if he receives the body. Despite giving several opportunities, he did not do it. Since the state informed about the law and order situation caused by the protests, the court had ordered the authorities to perform the final rites by 7pm on Friday, if the father fails to receive the body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/after-71-days-kin-receive-body-of-murdered-prisoner/articleshow/84078436.cms||---

The move aims at avoiding unhealthy cooking oil from being used repeatedly in food production. The repurpose used cooking oil (RUCO) project of the food safety and standards authority of India (FSSAI) has said the total polar compound in cooking oil should be less than 25%. “Reusing the cooking oil more than two times will result in a spurt of bad cholesterol paving the way for obesity, hypertension and heart ailments. RUCO project will monitor hotels, sweet stalls and cottage industries to ensure cooking oil is not overused,” M Kavikumar, food safety officer said. A Trichy-based startup was identified to collect the oil from hotels. The hotels will be paid Rs 25 to Rs 30 per kilogram of used cooking oil. Perambalur district is expected to generate 2,000 litres of used cooking oil every month. The quantity may increase once dine-in is allowed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/hotels-to-sell-used-oil-for-biodiesel-prodn/articleshow/84076337.cms||---

With 138 vaccination centres operational there was a marginal rise in the number of vaccination centres that were open on Friday. In all 26,544 Amdavadis received their jabs. There were 17 to 24 vaccination centres in the city, mainly in the south, east and central municipal zones of the city where 24 to 150 vaccines shots were administered. But at several centres where a fixed 100 people were administered vaccines a day, over the past five days, the situation improved on Friday with numbers ranging from 250 to 450. At Tagore hall in Paldi, some 946 vaccines were administered which was a marked improvement over the usual 400 vaccines a day for past five days. A senior Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation official admitted that there are far less vaccines being allotted in the south and east zones. Vaccination has not picked up in hospitals like Shardaben, IKDRC, GCS, LG and VS hospitals. “We will be receiving a fixed quota of 25,000 vaccines a day from the state government for the next three days after which the quota is expected to rise by 2,000 vaccines a day. We will gradually increase the number of vax centres to 180 by Monday,” says a senior AMC health official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/with-bigger-vax-quota-city-may-see-shorter-lines-from-monday/articleshow/84078495.cms||---

He was responding to a query posed by Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy. The judges took up the hearing into a PIL filed by C Damodar Raja Narasimha, former deputy chief minister in the combined state of Andhra Pradesh. Narasimha was seeking the labour welfare board for migrant and unorganised workers in the state to ensure that welfare schemes and benefits meant for them reach them. The judges directed the state government to take up a massive awareness campaign to make the migrant workers aware of the existence of such a board and to learn ways of deriving benefits from it. The bench gave time to the state government till July 31 to react. Thousands of migrants endured a tough time when the lockdown was imposed last and once again this year due to the impact of the second wave.

---||Lucknow||RSS plan to tackle third Covid wave; raise women force, train village doctors||LUCKNOW: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is working on a two-pronged strategy to counter the third wave of coronavirus --raising a grassroots-level workforce comprising mainly of women, to support the families hit by the pandemic and making arrangements for a basic training of village doctors to deal with Covid cases at the primary level. "They are referred to as quacks but the village doctors are the ones who work as the first line of medical workforce who people in rural areas approach. Therefore, their training of Covid management is necessary," says a senior RSS functionary. Besides, the ‘Maatra Shakti’ workforce would provide both mental and physical support to families in grip of coronavirus. Political observers feel that this workforce would come handy during the forthcoming Vidhan Sabha elections. The decisions to be ready for the anticipated third wave were taken recently as the second wave wreaked havoc throughout the country with medical facilities and infrastructure crumbling under the pressure of surge in the number of Covid patients. The RSS volunteers have been briefed about this action plan to tackle the third wave at the shakha level through virtual meetings by RSS Sarkaryawah (general secretary) Dattatreya Hosabale, number two in the organization, himself. Justifying training 'quacks' in rural areas, a senior RSS office-bearer told TOI that at the time of emergency or health crisis, villagers first knock at the door of these local medicos. The RSS, therefore, has decided that its members would train these quacks along with local ayurvedacharyas and vaidyas to tackle the situation arising out of the anticipated third wave. Backing the idea, expert on infectious and communicable disease Prof Ram Shanker Upadhayaya said that the kind of scenario we are in, even the best of infrastructure will not be helpful. Even the government cannot have the desired level of penetration of medical services at the village level. "As the Covid treatment protocol in the primary phase doesn’t call for invasive treatment of large number of medicines, village doctors could be trained to handle the emergency cases with basic training in giving oxygen support," Prof Ram said, adding " though I live in Sweden, I come from a rural background and have seen how people in villages rely on such practitioners during emergency." The programme has been taken up at the all-India level, a senior RSS functionary told TOI, adding that the training programme and creating of workforce, comprising mostly women, started about two weeks ago and is likely to be completed by July end. Almost all the major RSS frontal organisations like Sewa Bharti, Arogya Bharti, Vanasthali Ashram, etc, have been asked to focus on training and creation of new workforce, the RSS functionary said. Medical experts from these organisations have been asked to train the village doctors, ayurvedacharyas and vaidyas at the grassroots level on Covid patient management, while other members have been asked to contact villagers and create a women workforce group. Talking about the proposed woman workforce, the RSS functionary told TOI that each village would have a group of maximum 11 members and a minimum of seven members. They would be briefed about the preliminary measures to be taken in case of detection of Covid patients in a village. They would also be taught how to provide physical and mental support to the family members of such patients. However, political observers see a strong possibility of this workforce, mainly composed of women, as a strong team for the BJP during the coming vidhan sabha elections in 2022. An RSS functionary told TOI that since this new workforce would work for six to seven months, it would certainly give advantage to the BJP even during the assembly polls. Like RSS, Bharatiya Janata Party is also creating a workforce of two members in around 50,000 villages. Each village will have one youth and one woman as the member. Their job will be to provide help during the anticipated third wave, a senior BJP functionary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rss-plan-to-tackle-3rd-wave-raise-women-force-train-village-doctors/articleshow/84080840.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

This vulnerable section of youngsters in AP and Telangana have not shown consistent improvements. Researchers from Hyderabad-based Centre for Economic and Social Studies (CESS) were also part of the study. “Though Covid-19 presents less risk to young people of serious morbidity or mortality, the resulting economic crisis has impacted their livelihoods,” the study said.  As part of the research data was collected during August-October and November-December 2020 to investigate how young people’s mental health has evolved during the pandemic. Apart from CESS, the research team comprising Catherine Porter, Annina Hittmeyer, Marta Favara, Douglas Scott and Alan Sánchez was drawn from the Lancaster University Management School, Lancaster, United Kingdom, Oxford Department of International Development, University of Oxford, United Kingdom and Grupo de Análisis para el Desarrollo, Peru. The study outlined how young people’s mental health has evolved in India (AP and Telangana) and three other low and middle income countries during the pandemic. It has provided preliminary descriptive evidence of the association between food insecurity and mental health. It has also brought to the fore the characteristics of the food insecure groups. “Pre-pandemic research shows that 75 per cent of mental health conditions develop by early adulthood and that the poorest are more likely to suffer from anxiety and depressive disorders,” the researchers said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/poor-youth-of-t-ap-developed-anxiety-depression-study/articleshow/84078506.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Ahmedabad||From Obsessive compulsive disorder to insomnia, experts see it all||AHMEDABAD: In mid-May, a man in his forties approached a psychiatrist after a suggestion from his physician. His primary complaint was sleeplessness. Probing further, the psychiatrist got to know that the man had tested positive for Covid-19 and had spent seven days in hospital. He did not have severe symptoms, but looking at deaths all around him, he was apprehensive about his own life. “The patient was given medication and was asked to talk to those who had recovered from Covid. The cases of severe distress and anxiety were seen after April-May peak of daily Covid cases,” said the psychiatrist. After the pandemic, experts in the city are witnessing ‘mindemic’ or spike in mental health issues affecting a large population. Experts cite prolonged isolation, trauma of losing someone or witnessing them scurrying for beds during pandemic, excessive exposure to screen, sudden change in economic stature and constant proximity to the family members as some of the reasons for the phenomenon. Dr Kevin Patel, a psychiatrist, said that they also saw spike in patients reporting obsessive compulsive disorder primarily associated with cleanliness. “In one of the cases, a young woman was not infected herself, but had witnessed multiple deaths around her. She was under constant duress due to fear of being infected by Covid or passing on infection to her kin,” he said. “Thus, it got manifested by excessive cleaning of house and not allowing any person to go out from home or come inside, lest they bring virus in.” Experts also reported hoarding behaviour in several citizens who bought prescription medicines in bulk in anticipation of getting infected. “Almost all members of society have been affected by the pandemic at varying degrees. We often compare it with the impact of World Wars. While moderate to extreme cases need due examination by experts, citizens can take simple steps such as talking about anxiety, sticking to routine and light exercises,” said Dr Pradip Vaghasiya, a psychiatrist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/from-ocd-to-insomnia-experts-see-it-all/articleshow/84078539.cms||Parth Shastri

The decision was taken keeping in view of a possible third wave of Covid, it said. “In the last two surges, we noticed nearly 12% of the patients were below the age of 20. About 5% of them needed hospitalisation. Among those hospitalised, 3% required ICU while 2% needed ventilator support. Therefore, we have decided to increase the present paediatric bed capacity by 10% in case of another surge,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. Meanwhile, 21 of the 96 hospitals treating Covid patients were informed that they would not be allowed to do so if they failed to submit details about isolation beds, suspected Covid cases, isolation beds for paediatric ward, oxygen support for isolation and confirmed wards, neonatal beds, ventilators reserved for paediatric patients by July 10. The hospitals were asked to put together a plan in case cases increase again. “We have got status reports from only 75 hospitals explaining status of beds, oxygen plant, D-type cylinder and giving details about paediatric wards. We have asked the rest to share their details, failing which they will be prohibited under the Clinical Establishment Act to carry out Covid treatment,” the CMO said. In the 75 hospitals that shared data, there are 2,555 isolation beds for Covid patients, including 294 ICU beds without ventilators and another 576 with ventilators. The district also has 809 beds for paediatric patients, including 287 ICU beds and another 89 with ventilators. The health department said 15 hospitals have updated their oxygen plants’ capacity or have installed new PSA units. “The hospitals should increase their D-type cylinders to avoid any last-minute issues if and when the cases start to rise again,” said Gurugram deputy commissioner Yash Garg. About seven or eight hospitals have declared that they have less than 20 beds and will not be allowed to carry out Covid treatment in the future, the health department said. The department also advised hospitals to procure intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) drugs for emergency use among children. IVIG is given to patients with diseases that affect the immune system and is also used to treat autoimmune disorders. Children who do not have enough antibodies are given IVIG to help boost their immunity. The IVIG drug costs Rs 15,000 for a vial of 5 gram and is administered based on the child’s weight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/increase-beds-for-kids-hosps-told/articleshow/84082578.cms||Ipsita Pati

This is a new UP with a new work culture. There is no place for corruption,” he said. The CM personally handed over the provisional appointment letters to 12 candidates. The CM said those who get jobs without recommendation and through a transparent system should also be upright and honest. “Your salaries are paid through public funds so you should also be answerable to the public,” he said. He said till four years back, jails had become a rest house for criminals and goons from where they used to run their operations. There was corruption and anarchy at every step. Today, criminals are terrified of the police, he said, crediting team work by everyone, from the director general of police to a constable. Talking about the appointments made in his regime, Yogi said some people tried to derail the appointment process and in face of that, making 1.5 lakh appointments in just the police department was not easy. “The youth in UP has benefitted from not just government jobs but also private investments. When we were organising the investors’ summit in 2018, people said nobody will invest in UP. I personally made an effort and in one day, we received proposals of Rs 2.10 lakh crore. We received proposals for Rs 4.5 lakh crore during the summit,” he said. The CM expressed happiness at the appointments of firemen and mounted police, saying that these have taken place after several years. Finance Minister Suresh Khanna said the Yogi government has established the rule of law in the state. In the past four years, there has been a behavioural change in every sector. Minister of state for jail Jai Kumar Singh said modernisation of jails had also taken place where CCTVs and video walls were established in jails to improve security and management. He said that crucial changes were also made in the jail manual.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-no-place-for-graft-in-new-work-culture-in-new-up/articleshow/84080889.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Heroin is the most commonly trafficked substance in India, followed by cannabis and cocaine. The contraband was declared as gypsum stone and talcum powder and was brought through JNPT when officials intercepted it. The import export code (IEC) was in the name of Singh and the consignment was meant for Punjab. Singh has been importing gypsum stone and talcum powder through JNPT for the past one year, sources said. “The consignment had arrived from Afghanistan via Iran which raised suspicion that it may contain some banned goods. During physical examination, we discovered it was narcotics mis-declared as gypsum,” said an official. “A test using an NDPS kit confirmed it was heroin,” said an official. The consignment was seized under provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Last year, the DRI had seized 191 kg heroin which was falsely declared as mulethi, an Ayurvedic herb. The special task force of the Punjab police had also seized 194kg heroin and other contraband from a rented house in Amritsar district and arrested six persons, including an Afghan national and a woman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nearly-300-kg-heroin-worth-rs-879-crore-seized-1-held/articleshow/84082597.cms||Ahmed Ali

At the first ordinary council meeting, the CCP approved a one-time settlement (OTS) scheme to recover at least half of the Rs 39 crore of outstanding dues. The CCP has also extended the deadline for renewal of trade licences from July 15 to September-end. In a bid to recover pending house, trade taxes, CCP has offered to waive all interest on dues if residents pay up within six months. CCP mayor Rohit Monserrate said the OTS scheme will be implemented only once the government gives the go-ahead. “I want to appeal to everybody in Panaji to pay the principal amount. Rs 16-17 crore is the principal amount while the remaining is the interest. For six months, once the government approves, we are willing to forego every single error,” said Monserrate. The mayor said that recovery of the dues will help CCP meet its expenditure commitments, particularly payments of salaries and for solid waste management. The OTS scheme will benefit traders and businesses to clear their pending taxes and reduce their burden during the pandemic. The Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) had sent a detailed proposal to the CCP to provide some form of relief in terms of taxes and other fees and CCP has indicated its willingness to reduce the fees. A decision to reduce sanitation fees for door-to-door collection of garbage was also taken up for discussion. “A lot of people cannot pay the trade tax, house tax and other taxes because of Covid-19. We have reduced the sanitary charges and have taken the opinion of business people. We have consulted with them closely,” said Monserrate. Referring to extension in renewal of trade licences, Monserrate said he had held discussions with local traders and businessmen who said they did not want “discounts” but wanted additional time to make payments. “We are just delaying the payment so that we can help the people of Panaji,” said the mayor. He said the CCP will also be conducting a door-to-door assessment of government buildings in the city in an effort to collect tax from these offices. The council also discussed projects proposed by Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Ltd (IPSCDL).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ccp-nod-for-ots-scheme-to-recover-rs-39-crore-dues/articleshow/84080947.cms||---

A group of more than 100 home chefs, volunteers, doctors, security guards among others had worked relentlessly to extend help in terms of food, essential items, finding hospital beds and oxygen cylinders to Covid-19 affected families. My Home Avatar residents claims it to be one of the first gated communities in the financial district to begin such an initiative of having an in-house Covid-19 food help in place. A telegram group, constituted by three primary members _ Shubham Srivastava, Sundar Padhi and Rakesh Sharma _ eventually emerged as a war room for the residents to extend aid. “We distributed more than 4,000 meals per day. It was a self-sustained model with zero monetary help from anyone. As people started recovering, they too joined our efforts, thereby keeping the cycle of goodness rolling,” said Srivastava, who works as a software engineer at a private firm. Residents of the gated community showcased unity during the Covid-19 second wave. “People were procuring the raw material by themselves and were meeting the requirement of those in need. We were only accepting disposables if someone wished to help us,” said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/teaming-up-to-help-covid-19-affected/articleshow/84078543.cms||---

Amit Chhabra, head-health insurance, Policybazaar.com pointed out that at any given point of time the online insurance aggregator has around 7-8% of its existing policyholders availing porting options but this number has shot up to over 20% in May and June of 2021. As per data shared by Policybazaar, between March-May 2021, 80% of the customers, who opted for porting, have ported to higher health cover as compared to 30% during March-May 2020. Policybazaar accounts for over 10% of India’s retail health business. It accounts for roughly half of all internet-based insurance purchases in the country. Gurdeep Singh Batra, head (retail underwriting), Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, said that the enquiries for porting are higher as compared to pre-Covid as well as the first wave period. Batra said people are looking at health covers that have no room rent capping as many policyholders faced challenges during the pandemic’s peak because bed charges levied by hospitals were much higher than their eligibility on account of room rent capping in their policy. Besides, post Covid, there is also a rise in enquiries for critical health covers, he added. Meanwhile, Priya Deshmukh Gilbile, COO, ManipalCigna Health Insurance, pointed out that the insurer witnessed an increase in portability cases by over 30%. “Also, people are thinking proactively around what insurance plans can future-proof for them considering that life expectancy has gone up, which might give rise to new risks beyond the existing ones,” she said. Apart from revising the sum insured upwards in their new health policies, people are also looking for policies that cover consumables, Chhabra pointed out. He explained that consumable items like gloves, masks, PPE kits and sanitisers, among others, in pre-Covid times would constitute only 2-3% of medical bills and were not paid by health insurers but during the pandemic, it shot up to nearly 20%. Besides, many are also porting to policies that ensure home care coverage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/more-people-porting-health-policies-for-higher-covers/articleshow/84078588.cms||Swati Rathor

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh to open multiplexes, cinemas, gyms from July 5||CLUCKNOW: As total active cases of Covid-19 continued on their downward trend in Uttar Pradesh and touched 2,560 on Friday, the state government has announced opening of multiplex, cinema halls, gyms and stadiums from Monday, July 5. These will be allowed to function up to 9pm, in accordance with night curfew rules. The permission to open these, said a government spokesperson, would be dependent on adherence to Covid-19 protocols like social distancing and wearing of masks, and only 50% occupancy was likely to be permitted. A detailed order from the Home Department will be issued later this week. The official added that cinema owners had faced massive losses due to Covid restrictions over the past few months and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has said that the government will assist them in whatever way is possible. He has asked officials to draw up a relief package for them. While relaxing the corona curfew 10 days back, the government had permitted opening of malls, restaurants, bars and street food stalls, subject to a maximum of 50% occupancy, from June 21. It also altered the night curfew timings, allowing leniency for two more hours. It is now in place from 9pm to 7am. The weekend curfew will also persist, from 9pm on Friday to 7am on Monday. “The night curfew and weekend curfew will continue for the time being. The virus is considerably weak but it doesn’t mean that is has ended totally. Till we are not confident that we have managed to defeat the virus, certain restrictions will remain in place,” said a senior government official. He added that there would be no restrictions on essential services, industrial and agricultural activity, even during the weekend. While allowing relaxations in curfew rules, the government has also said that if active cases in any district rise above 500, curfew will be implemented automatically in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-to-open-multiplexes-cinemas-gyms-from-july-5/articleshow/84080972.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM responds to governor, backs 2-day assembly session||MUMBAI: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday defended the business advisory committee (BAC)’s decision to hold a two-day monsoon session of the state legislature in view of the pandemic situation. Following a letter by leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari had on June 24 sought an explanation from the CM over the short duration of the session, election of the Speaker and reservation for OBCs in elections to local bodies. Thackeray, in his three-page letter, has said the duration of the session was decided by the BAC on June 22. “The committee took note of the pandemic session, views expressed by members of the task force and alert sounded by the Central government. The second wave is yet to subside and the possibility of a third Covid wave is not ruled out. Taking into consideration all these aspects, the Business Advisory Committee decided to hold the session only for two days,” he stated. On the Speaker’s election, Thackeray said the legislature rules provide for election, but no time frame has been laid down. He said deputy speaker Narhari Zirwal currently holds additional charge as Speaker. He said this did not cause any difficulty nor posed a Constitutional problem during the budget session. “We are making all possible efforts to hold the election of the Speaker as early as possible. Since the validity of the RT-PCR test is only for 72 hours, it will not be appropriate to declare the dates for election in advance. We will take into consideration the pandemic situation, health status of the members and whether they will remain present and then elect the new Speaker at an appropriate time,” Thackeray said. Addressing the issue of OBC reservation, Thackeray said the state government had asked the State Election Commission (SEC) to postpone the polls to local bodies due to the pandemic as well as the fact that a review application on OBC reservation is pending in the Supreme Court. “We are concerned about the reservation for OBCs. During our recent meeting with the Prime Minister, we had raised these issues. We need specific data on the backward class communities, which is in possession of the Central government. We feel you too should pursue the matter for securing the data,” Thackeray said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cm-responds-to-guv-backs-2-day-assembly-session/articleshow/84082615.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Goa||Crime branch to probe Vasco suicide case||VASCO: A copy of the suicide note written by three Ambigera members who committed suicide on Tuesday at Zuarinagar and available with TOI reveals that Ambigera’s family members had borrowed money from the three deceased. The note written in Kannada was translated by Verna police through the staff of a local school. In a related development on Friday, the suicide case has been transferred from Verna police to the crime branch of Goa Police. Sources said this move came after allegations were made against Verna police by human rights’ activist advocate Albertina Almeida as well as the family of the three deceased. Almeida had demanded a separate inquiry into the matter by a core committee. The deceased have addressed the note to the villagers of Sultanpur, Kawar and have mentioned names of four of their family members who they allege, borrowed money from the trio. The note stated that these four relatives were responsible for their suicide. An account of how much was owed and other details has been mentioned in the note. The deceased had earlier pleaded with their village panchas to sell vehicles belonging to their relatives to recover the money and give it to the couple’s two minor daughters. As reported on Wednesday, Halagappa Ambigera, 35, his wife Devamma Ambigera, 28, and Halagappa’s brother - Gangappa Ambigera, 29 were found hanging at their rented house near MES college, Zuarinagar on Tuesday morning. Family members had approached human rights’ activists alleging that police were pressurising them to collect the bodies after the postmortem was conducted. Devamma’s brother told activists that he had seen Verna police torturing them physically in his presence in connection to an earlier theft case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/crime-branch-to-probe-vasco-suicide-case/articleshow/84081019.cms||---

Highlighting the state’s notable efforts in improving its ease of doing business rankings, the PM has retweeted chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s tweet on investments in UP and said that the impact of this change is visible in small cities and rural areas as well. “UP Government has made a commendable effort to increase investment and improve ease of doing business over the past four years. उत्तर प्रदेश ने पिछले चार वर्षों के दौरान निवेश बढ़ाने और 'Ease of Doing Business’ को सुधारने में उल्लेखनीय प्रयास… https://t.co/kD1L11yW1e— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) 1625233975000It is worth noticing that small towns and rural areas are also witnessing this improvement,” the PM Modi said. Highlighting the work done by the UP government to increase investments in the state, industrial development minister Satish Mahana said that due to the government’s proactive policies, it had managed to draw thousands of investors to the state. “For the MoUs signed during the 2018 investors’ summit, where the PM was the chief guest, we have a conversion rate of over 50% whereas anywhere else in the world it is not more than 15%. This has happened because the government has proactively pursued investors, given them hand holding, announced investor friendly policies, and brought transparency in the system,” he said. A government spokesperson said the government had made significant improvement in infrastructure, from creating airports to expressways, all of which encouraged investments. Policies by the MSME department resulted in massive job creation in the sector while the CM’s pet project, one district-one product, saw improvement in the state’s exports as local handicrafts and specialised produce like Kala Namak rice, mangoes etc were given an international platform. “Samsung has set up a display unit in the state, having moved its operations from China. We have started ventilators in the state while we are in the process of establishing one of the two defence corridors sanctioned in the country and already have commitments of over Rs 2,000 crore for a single node in Aligarh. Sector-wise policies for food processing, electronics and IT, toy manufacturing, medical equipment have promoted investments in specific sectors,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pm-modi-lauds-ups-industrial-devpt-ease-of-doing-business/articleshow/84081013.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||India||Religion takes backseat when right to life is under threat: Madras HC||CHENNAI: When the right to life is threatened, the right to practice religion can take a backseat, the Madras high court said, refusing to order a full-fledged reopening of places of worship in Tamil Nadu. The right to practice religion is certainly subservient to the right to life, said the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy on Friday, adding that such matters should be left to the state to obtain relevant data and expert advice before imposing or easing restrictions. In any case, there does not appear to be any arbitrary action on the part of the state for the court to interfere in the matter, the bench said. While hearing another PIL, this one seeking full restoration of bus services, the bench remarked: "We cannot jump into normalcy and invite a third wave." The first PIL wanted the court to intervene and order the reopening of all places of worship as they were in pre-Covid times. Refusing to entertain either PIL, the judges said baby steps have to be taken to return to normalcy and it is better to err on the side of caution than to open up everything and be caught unaware, as the country was when the second surge occurred. While the state has permitted hotels and shops to function during the lockdown, restricting the operation of buses and opening of temples is arbitrary, the petitioners said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/religion-takes-backseat-when-right-to-life-is-under-threat-madras-hc/articleshow/84083645.cms||Suresh Kumar
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Social bug back to the clubs; footfalls surge to 50% of pre-Covid levels||AHMEDABAD: Before the pandemic, clubs in Ahmedabad were abuzz with people and their chatter. One could see a few regulars who would come for a walk, workout, swim or their favourite sport and others who would spend leisurely mornings over a plate of poha and chai with a generous dose of discussions or evenings over slow long dinners and socialising. A year and a half after the pandemic’s first wave of infections, and the second wave over, the social bug and chatter is finally back to the clubs as footfalls have once again begun to surge up to 50%of pre-Covid levels. “Since the past week, we’ve been witnessing a footfall of some 1,000 people at the club which is significantly high. Most people come in for morning walk as the jogging track at the club is a main attraction whereas the rest come for workout and other sporting activities,”said Mishal Patel, secretary of Rajpath Club. The footfalls at clubs have gone up within a fortnight of resuming. Most clubs unlike last year, have not imposed restrictions on the amount of time spent at the club by a certain member, which has led to an increase in footfalls. Since a week, as restaurants at clubs have also resumed, the footfalls have gone up. “People feel cooped up being locked inside homes throughout the second wave and the mental fatigue acts up on many. Ever since the restaurant opened, the club has been witnessing good number of footfalls as people come in to catch up with friends and family,” said Naimish Marfatia, honorary secretary, Gujarat Sports Club, where footfalls have reached upwards of 300 persons in a day. Swimming pools are crowd pullers at clubs and since the government has yet not given a nod to reopen pools, club footfalls continue to remain less. “A lot of people used to come to use the swimming pool at the club. If that is allowed, the footfalls would have gone further up. At present some 1,100 persons visit the club every day. We will get to know how it pans out over the coming weekend. It’s good to see some vibrancy at the club as members have begun frequenting more to the club, albeit with all due precautions and protocols in place,” said Jayesh Modi, vice- president, Karnavati Club.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/social-bug-back-to-the-clubs-footfalls-surge-to-50-of-pre-covid-levels/articleshow/84078751.cms||---

For the entire year academic year 2020-21, the university did not carry out the process for the scholarship scheme which otherwise is an annual process since 2012. The Directorate of Students Welfare (DSW) has now invited applications from students for the academic year 2020-21 even as the new academic year 2021-22 will begin shortly. MSU officials said that as part of the process, personal interview of students are carried out and it also includes physical verification at residents of the beneficiaries. Since this process could not be carried out in wake of Covid-19 induced pandemic, MSU vice-chancellor professor Parimal Vyas has now asked that the DSW scholarship process should be initiated as the situation is improving. Students seeking scholarship support can submit applications on MSU’s website from July 5 to July 15. It is mandatory for students to have account in nationalised bank – details of which have to be mentioned in the application. Those students whose family income is not more than Rs 3.5 lakh per annum are eligible under the scholarship scheme. “Those students who have lost an earning member of their family during Covid-19 pandemic should apply with necessary documents,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/msu-declares-dsw-scholarship-to-economically-poor-students-for-2020-21/articleshow/84079396.cms||---

---||Delhi||61-year-old man kills wife, hangs himself in south Delhi’s Vasant Kunj||NEW DELHI: A 61-year-old man ended his life after allegedly killing his 53-year-old wife in their house in south Delhi’s Vasant Kunj on Thursday evening. The incident took place when the couple’s 16-year-old son was studying in an adjoining room. Preliminary police enquiry found the couple had frequent fights and this was possibly the reason for the murder. The deceased was identified as Jahid Ali, 61, and his wife as Nazneen, 53. The couple hailed from Odisha and lived in Vasant Kunj in south Delhi. Around 7.30pm on Thursday, some neighbours of the couple called the cops to inform them that a body could be seen hanging in the room and that of a woman bludgeoned to death lay in the house. A police team reached the site and saw Nazneen unconscious on the floor in a pool of blood while Ali’s body was hanging from the ceiling. Both the bodies were sent to a hospital where the doctors confirmed their deaths and sent them for post-mortem examination. Ingit Pratap Singh, DCP (Southwest), said they received a call at 7.50pm about the incident from the couple’s neighbours. “Inspection of the crime scene suggested that Ali hit his wife with some heavy, blunt object and she collapsed. He continued hitting her until she died. He then went to his room and hanged himself,” Singh said. Police disclosed that all this while the couple’s son, who is a Class XII student, was studying in the room adjoining the one where the murder took place. He heard his parents arguing. When he came later to check on his parents, he saw his mother prone on the floor and the body of father hanging from the ceiling. He rushed outside and screamed for help from his neighbours. DCP Singh said a crime and forensics team scoured the spot for clues. “The initial findings suggest that the murder and suicide took place following one of the frequent fights between the couple. A case has been registered and all possible angles are being looked into,” he said. Police said Ali was originally from Odisha and owned properties there. He had no job in Delhi and his wife's family often sent the family daily essentials. Some relatives claimed that the couple often had fights and a case was going on as well. According to the woman’s brother Moeem, his sister was allegedly killed by her husband who then hanged himself. “A case related to their relationship is going on and they often had quarrels. They got married in 1990,” said Moeem. “The two had, in fact, filed several complaints against each other, though nothing substantial has come of them. But today, this extreme thing happened.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/61-year-old-man-kills-wife-hangs-himself/articleshow/84078714.cms||---

In his first interaction with the media, Goel stressed on better police-people relationship, stating crime control will be easier and effective if the two work in tandem. He said use of technology was essential to cut time in cracking cases, which in turn leads to better evidence gathering. Officers of any rank should directly interact with people as a confidence-building exercise and this holds the key to better policing, he said. “Petty crime must not be overlooked as it might later spiral into a bigger issue,” he said, while advising officers to hit the ground and not stay put in their offices. “Maintaining law and order is a challenge, but I have faith in my team,” said the top cop. Replying to a query on assuming charge on the anniversary of the Bikru massacre in which eight cops were killed, Goel said, “If local cops would have controlled the situation long back, the carnage could have been avoided. It’s important to take up petty crime seriously.” Talking about illegal religious conversions, the DGP said, the innocent will not be harassed. Goel also added if police remain vigilant, there would be no rerun of the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots. “The safety and security of people is the responsibility of the police,” he said. On the Aligarh hooch tragedy, the DGP vowed swift conviction of the guilty. Earlier, Goel offered prayers at the Hanuman Setu temple with his family and then met chief minister Yogi Adityanath. He was given a guard of honour at police officers’ mess on Shahnajaf Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/new-dgp-goel-stresses-on-bridging-police-people-gulf/articleshow/84081049.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: After plea bargain, two forgery convicts get 25% of maximum term||MUMBAI: In a rare instance of plea bargaining, two female foreigners, including a senior citizen, were jailed for 21 months for trying to travel on forged passports and documents in 2019. It was a quarter of the maximum sentence of seven years that the charges against them attracted. A magistrate court this week convicted and sentenced 61-year-old Finnish national Pasma Miira Mira and 30-year-old Sri Lankan Kuhapriya Thevarasa. They had tried to travel on each other’s identities as Mira was helping Thevarasa to illegally migrate to Europe. The court pronounced the sentence after finding that a “mutual satisfactory disposition” was reached between the prosecution and the accused. Thevarasa, who had been living for a few months in Delhi before the incident, wanted to migrate to Germany. After her parents paid an agent Rs 14 lakh, the plan was she would assume Mira’s identity and travel to Frankfurt on a forged French passport. On June 28, 2019, an officer at Mumbai airport suspected Thevarasa and she was not allowed to board her flight. Interrogation revealed that Mira had allegedly given her the fake French passport she was flaunting. Mira boarded a domestic flight to Ahmedabad pretending to be Thevarasa. Both were arrested. The court has now directed authorities to return Mira’s Finnish passport, which it said was “prima facie genuine”. In addition to charges of cheating and using forged documents, Mira was booked under section 370 of the Indian Penal Code that relates to human trafficking. However, this March, a sessions court discarded the charge. “At the outset, it is seen that accused no 1 (Thevarasa) was not sought to be sent abroad for exploitation by accused no 2 (Mira). But she was sought to be sent abroad in connection with her own benefit,” the sessions court had said. In February, the Supreme Court had asked for the trial to be expedited. The accused had earlier pleaded not guilty, and the trial had started with two witnesses deposing. At this stage, the accused moved plea bargaining applications before the magistrate court. The court spoke to the two and said it was satisfied the duo had moved the applications voluntarily. The procedure was set in motion and ended with the sentencing. The time the accused spent in jail will be set off against the sentence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-plea-bargain-two-forgery-convicts-get-25-of-max-term/articleshow/84082625.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Delhi||Delhi: Man fakes his own abduction to extort Rs 25 lakh from parents||NEW DELHI: A 28-year-old man from Aman Vihar, who fled to Rishikesh without telling his family and staged an abduction drama, was caught on Thursday. Police said the man was under a debt of Rs 25 lakh and had staged the drama to get the money from his parents and relatives. A woman who assisted him in the forgery has also been arrested. The accused has been identified as Shubham and his female friend as Anita who is married to Shubham’s colleague. On June 29, Shubham’s father Sunil Garg had filed the missing complaint. During preliminary inquiry, police found that Shubham was last seen in Rohini Sector 22 at a hotel. Further investigation revealed that a woman Anita had contacted his parents on June 21, stating that Shubham is in a debt and he needs Rs 25 lakh immediately. “She also gave them five different account numbers in which the amount of Rs 25 lakh was to be deposited. Raids were conducted on various places in search of Anita and she was finally detained from Agra. During interrogation, she disclosed that Shubham was in Rishikesh, Uttrakhand and that he is in constant touch with her through phone,” said a senior police officer. Accordingly, a police team was rushed to Rishikesh and Shubham was traced in a hotel. “During interrogation, Shubham said he is in a relationship with Anita, who is the wife of his colleague working in the same company. Shubham took money on interest and spent it for fun and enjoyment. He could not repay the loaned amount and took another loan on interest to pay back the previous dues, but it did not work as per his plan. The total loan amount, therefore, rose to Rs 25 lakh, which was beyond his paying capacity. He and Anita then plotted to extort money from his father by faking his abduction,” the officer said. Both Shubham and Anita had plans to settle abroad using the money, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-fakes-his-own-abduction-to-extort-rs-25l-from-parents/articleshow/84078859.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Increasing sand erosion seen at Sernabatim beach||COLVA: Rough sea and mighty waves have caused soil erosion in Salcete beaches of Cavelossim, Varca, Benaulim, Sernabatim, Colva and Betalbatim. Every year the sea seems to be changing its pattern. In 2019 it was Betalbatim and Velsao beaches to be hit badly. Last year it was Benaulim and Cavelossim, while this year it seems that Sernabatim beach has been targeted by the natural forces. In Sernabatim, during the high tide, the sea water reaches the sand dunes. Goa seems to be witnessing increasing erosion of its beaches, due to the onslaught of the Arabian sea on the shore. Changes in sea level, seawater temperature, and other ocean dynamics may change how much the ocean contributes to the erosion of beaches, said an environmental activist. Large parts of the sandy beaches along the state’s coast are being gobbled up by the tumultuous sea. The fisherfolk and others residing near the beaches, while agreeing that sand erosion is a normal phenomenon are of the opinion that the erosion has been unusually severe for the last few years. When the tumultuous sea comes against people's property, the tendency is for them to try and stop the encroaching sea. They armor the shoreline with sandbags, seawalls and jetties. These have a negative effect on beaches because once sea water reaches them, it "bounces" off them with more energy than a wave washing back off a normal sand beach. More sand is carried off shore, promoting beach loss, a scientist quipped. The ingress of the sea is seen on a number of coastal villages along the Salcete coastal belt during different seasons, in the last few years. Sand dune vegetation on a part of the beach has been washed away by the raging waves. A large number of casuarinas, palm trees and other beach foliage or vegetation have been uprooted and washed away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/increasing-sand-erosion-seen-at-sernabatim-beach/articleshow/84081135.cms||Nisser Dias

Based on the complaint, an ACB team arrived at the society’s office in Nampally on Friday evening to verify the records and conduct an inquiry. “The complainant alleged that during the past few years, misuse of society funds and administrative powers took place in Exhibition Society. It was alleged that funds were misused and several people were given membership in violation of administrative powers,” ACB DSP K Srikanth said. AIIE Society’s Dr B Prabha Shankar said ACB officials looked into the papers. “It was not a raid. They wanted clarification on our society and we provided all the details. Basically, ours is a registered company under Companies Act 1956. We comply every year to all the audited statements and general body decisions.” Shankar said he had no clue whether the ACB visit was raids linked to Eatala. “Rajender resigned from the post of Exhibition Society president about a month ago. The complainant did not mention the misappropriated amount. After verifying the records, we will act based on the findings,” the DSP said. Eatala first became president of AIIE Society in 2014 and continued till June 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-exhibition-society-tenure-under-acb-lens/articleshow/84081142.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: No rift in MVA, speaker will be from Congress, says Nana Patole||MUMBAI: Even as state Congress president Nana Patole on Friday said there was no rift in the Maha Vikas Aghadi government over the speaker’s nomination, there is complete uncertainty over the elections in view of the pandemic situation. Revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat said all will depend on the outcome of the RT-PCR test of the legislators. “All legislators will have to undergo RT-PCR test to ensure they are not suffering from Covid-19. If a large number of legislators test positive, we will have to postpone the speaker’s election,” said Thorat. CM Uddhav Thackeray too expressed similar views in his letter to governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. “We will take into consideration the current pandemic situation. We will have to take note of the health of the legislators, ensure they can be present and then take a decision on holding the election,’’ he said. Patole reiterated that the new speaker will be from the Congress. Situation will be clear only after the outcome of the RT-PCR test of the legislators. “It is unfortunate that BJP is using Raj Bhavan and playing politics over speaker’s election,” he said. On the Maratha reservation, Patole said following the apex court verdict, it has been clearly established that the ball is now in the NDA government’s court. “Following the 102nd amendment to the constitution, powers of the state government to make reservations have been withdrawn. Despite such a situation, Devendra Fadnavis brought in a legislation to provide for reservations to Marathas. In view of the Supreme Court verdict, BJP has been completely exposed. BJP is misleading the Marathas,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-rift-in-mva-speaker-will-be-from-cong-says-patole/articleshow/84082648.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Gas, fuel prices vary as per supply location||HYDERABAD: While everyone is fixated with the rising prices of LPG, petrol and diesel, what has largely gone unnoticed is the fact that your place of residence also determines the rate of these products. Currently, a 14.2-kg LPG cylinder costs Rs 904 in Nizampet, while in Hyderabad main city it costs Rs 887. Similar is the case with petrol and diesel prices. Point to note is that even when the prices are on an upward trend, there remains a slight variation in rates from one petrol pump to another. For gas cylinders, while remote districts in the state have slightly higher rate than cities, price variation is also seen within different parts of a city. “The variation is due to two reasons,” said Rajiv Amaram, joint secretary, consortium Indian Petrol Dealers. “First is dynamic pricing (where the price is fixed depending on the oil company), and second transportation.” Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited, Indian Oil Company and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited are major suppliers. Among them, one company has a direct pipeline from Visakhapatnam to its filling unit in the outskirts of Hyderabad. The other two don’t run direct pipelines, but take supply from a company having a direct link with Visakhapatnam. When the companies supply petrol and diesel to various points in state and within a city, dynamic pricing and transportation comes into play. Similar is the case with gas prices. Companies having bottling units in city outskirts get their supply from Visakhapatnam via road link. “The transport cost from Visakhapatnam comes into picture, resulting in slight variation in prices depending on the supply location,” said Mellacheruvu Venkateswara Rao, president Telangana LPG distributors association. Worried over increasing trend of prices, urban consumers say that prices of other essential commodities are also a factor to worry about. “Usage of cooking gas or liquid fuels by individuals can be limited, but their rising prices have an effect on prices of vegetables, grains and and other commodities,” said KV Vishnu Rao, a private teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gas-fuel-prices-vary-as-per-supply-location/articleshow/84081104.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Lucknow||Make the right mask your defence against the third Covid wave||LUCKNOW: The danger posed by any degree of unlock and relaxations is people getting ignorant towards the situation. They tend to break the basic rules of social distancing that eventually leads to a mass spread of the infection. With reports of the third wave of coronavirus hitting us any moment, it is extremely important to undertake measures to curb the deadly transmission. The consequences of the pandemic since its inception in March 2020 have been grave. People have witnessed heavy financial and economic losses along with failing healthcare systems around the world. Vaccination will definitely play a key role in containing the transmission. However, one must not forget the use of basic tools of safety to protect ourselves and most importantly the ones around us. Wearing a mask is now mandatory when around people, along with practising physical distancing and good hand hygiene. But the question for everyone still remains: What is the right mask and how do you choose one? The past year has seen almost every establishment, big or small, making and selling masks with not much expertise on the subject. The size of a coronavirus particle is around 0.3 microns, so a basic fabric or even surgical mask is not the right one to filter any form of virus. It is only the likes of ISImarked FFP2 (filtering face piece) face mask that has the capability to filter coronavirus. It not only protects the user efficiently but also others around them. FFP2 face masks are personal protective equipment that protect the user from airborne particles and aerosols. They prevent the entry into the respiratory system due to the presence of an efficient filtering fabric. It is impossible for someone to identify whether a face mask has an efficient filtering fabric. That is unless they have access to testing labs with machinery that costs millions. So the best method to check for a user is to locate the ISI logo on the packaging and marking of any face mask to verify its authenticity. Every ISI certified manufacturer is given a unique licencee number called the CML number that can be tracked on the BIS website. If the mask is ISI certified, it will be present on the online Bureau of Indian Standards portal. Secondly, users need to be aware of the fact that the number of layers of the mask does not affect its filtering efficiency. It is the filtering fabric inside the mask that makes it efficient to protect the user from entering their system. Multi-layered masks tend to decrease breathability and increase suffocation as they are heavy on the face. The next criterion for selecting the right mask is that it should be able to completely seal the nose and mouth. This must be done in order to prevent any air leakage. The nose clip should be flexible enough to take the shape of the nose and you should be able to breathe properly. A basic cotton or fabric mask is a loose-fitted mask that merely creates a physical barrier between the mouth and nose of the wearer and potential contaminants in the immediate environment. On the other hand, a surgical mask is a three-ply mask meant to be used by medical personnel primarily during procedures. Wearing the right face mask is most essential in today’s world. Putting on a helmet or wearing a seat belt has become mandatory while driving because it protects a person’s life. Similarly, people need to understand the importance of wearing the right mask. It not only protects one from getting infected but also others around them. This is the one-stop defence system to reduce the transmission of the deadly coronavirus. With the rising challenges of the projected third wave, people need to be ready with the right tools to fight it efficiently. The right mask is one such vital tool. Even after vaccination, strict protocols of appropriate social distancing and good hygiene practices of washing hands regularly and wearing face masks need to be followed. Pandemic or not, face masks are here to stay. They should consciously be made a part of our lives for the good health and safety of loved ones.

---||Lucknow||Your voice in Protect UP||India Mobile Shield: No one is safe until everyone is safe Challenges to vaccinating rural India include inadequate information, traditional thinking, difficulty in registration process and non-availability of vaccines. A part of the solution are mobile vaccine clinics on wheels (MVAC) that can go to the target zone and deliver solutions. The MVAC can: a) Disseminate correct information, advocacy stories of vaccine recipients b) Demonstrate the registration process d) Vaccinate a key group in each village e) Transport small medical equipment like PPE, oximeter, thermal temperature guns, concentrators We have designed two kinds of such vehicles. A large MVAC would include small cold storage unit (refrigeration) for storing of the vaccine vials in 0-8 degree C temperatures for 96 hours at a stretch and capacity of up to 5 staff along with GPS tracking, Wi-Fi, laptop and camera/printer setup. Methodology 1) MVAC stops at a village, sets up tent, chair, table, peripherals in best available location (covered/open air). 2) Plays pre-recorded vaccine advocacy content, flip charts, live demo of registration process, vaccinates the identified key group of villagers, prints and distributes vaccine certificates and MVAC moves to next village. 3) Four-six weeks later, revisits and administers second dose. - Vijay Cavale Despite all prevention, many lives were lost to this pandemic. To avoid more fatalities, especially among children, the following major steps should be followed 1. Medical kits should be distributed for pregnant women as there is lack of research how Covid can affect them and their babies 2. Ask schools to report if any student is missing from online class due to common cold, fever, or low immunity - Gulam Abbas It is a great idea to ask citizens of India for ideas to protect our nation from the third wave of Covid-19. I am impressed with your forecast and determined focus to save us all. Here are my suggestions 1. Due to fear, some people are still reluctant to get vaccinated. They should be completely educated on the importance of vaccination 2. Make vaccination compulsory. Cross-check family members through voter list and if they refuse vaccination, their names should be deleted from voter list. 3. Door to door vaccine service must be implemented by medical team - Gopinath Rajendran||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/your-voice-in-protect-up/articleshow/84081195.cms||---

He was speaking against the backdrop of ongoing action by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which has attached a sugar mill worth Rs 65 crore in Satara, leased to a company related to deputy CM Ajit Pawar and his wife Sunetra. The action was part of a probe into a money laundering case involving Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSCB), an ED release said. Over 70 politicians are accused in the case and this was the first attachment. The ED statement details a sequence of transactions which link the assets to Ajit Pawar. It said the mill was purchased during the auction by a company called Guru Commodity Services Private Ltd and leased to another company named Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills Private Ltd. “Jarandeshwar is the tip of the iceberg. I am writing a letter to Union home minister Amit Shah,” said Patil. Patil further said the state government should get empirical data about OBC and Maratha reservation. “The state authorities should undertake a survey to help define the ‘backwardness’ of the Maratha community and the percentage of OBCs,” Patil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bjp-seeks-probe-into-auction-of-co-op-sugar-factories/articleshow/84078799.cms||---

Teachers said that the state should not make any delay in releasing these funds as many are dependent on them and added that it should continue to provide aid to private teachers until schools reopen physically. “The last two months have been slightly better as I could pay my rent using Rs 2000 given by the government and could feed my family using the rice distributed. But, in June, I did not get the aid and I am once again struggling to make the ends meet,” said D Surya Chandra, a Hindi teacher, who used to earn Rs 15, 000 per month before the pandemic. He said that although he has been working as a labourer, he is unable to get work every day. “I am able to find work only once or twice a week. So, I can’t rely on that income to feed my family. The only good thing is we got Rs 25kg rice from the state,” he said adding he has two daughters—a9-year-old and a two-year-old and a wife, who are all surviving with the aid. As per the figures available with the education department, as many as 2, 0 4, 743 have been given aid and over 90% of them are also receiving rice. In April and May, the state has spent about Rs 120 crore to provide financial aid and rice to teachers. The state needs to allocate a budget of Rs 41 crore per month to pay Rs 2000 to these teachers. “A majority of teachers are still out of work as managements have tied up with third-party apps to provide online classes to students. They are completely dependent on this money for survival. The state should immediately release the amount,” said Shabir Ali, president, Telangana Private Teachers Forum (TPTF). According to officials, the state is said to have released the budget to provide aid to teachers and the same will be deposited in the accounts of teachers in the next couple of days.

Later, on a plea by his counsel, the court on June 29 stayed the effect and operation of its order till July 17 to enable Bagwe move an appeal in the Bombay high court. Rival candidate Bhupendra Shendge had filed an election petition against Avinash, who is the son of Congress city unit president and former minister of state for home Ramesh Bagwe. When contacted, Avinash told TOI, “We will file a writ petition in the high court challenging the lower court’s order, as we feel the petitioner has misled the lower court. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had in 2014 given permission to repair a shed at my residence and we have followed all the rules and regulations. We have deposited compounding fees of the structure with the civic body in 2015.” Abinash added, “It is a matter of interpretation of legal provisions of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act and government notification. We believe in the judiciary and have a strong hope of succeeding in the petition to be filed before the high court.” Lawyers Yogesh Davare and Rafique Shaikh had moved the election petition on behalf of Shendge before the small causes court after the returning officer rejected the latter’s objection to his nomination as a Congress candidate. The court observed, “The returning officer had wrongly accepted the nomination form of respondent number one (Avinash) though he was disqualified under section 10 (1D) of the MMC Act. The respondent was elected a councillor even though he did not qualify as a councillor. Such wrongful acceptance of the nomination form becomes material irregularity in the election process. The election needs to held invalid.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/court-disqualifies-pmc-corporator-avinash-bagwe/articleshow/84078865.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Pune||Proposal for constables retiring as PSI, says Maharashtra minister Dilip Walse Patil||PUNE: State home minister Dilip Walse Patil said here on Friday that a proposal envisaging retirement of police constables as subinspectors was under consideration. As of now, when someone joins the state police as a constable, s/he retires as an assistant sub-inspector, which is the top rank in the constabulary. “However, the new proposal will ensure that such a candidate gets four years towards the end of his/her career to work as a police subinspector, which is the first post in the officers’ cadre,” the home minister said. Most of the constabulary retires before becoming assistant sub-inspectors, while only a few manage to get the post. Walse Patil and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar were at a function to commission two fuel pumps at Pune rural police’s Baner and Pashan facilities. Pawar, who is also the state finance minister, said, “I will call a meeting after the monsoon session of the state assembly next week and take a decision on the tabled proposal.” Walse Patil said that while retiring after four years of service as officer, police personnel would certainly get better monetary benefits. “We have drawn up a proposal in such a way that the police personnel retiring as officers will get better benefits that, too, without incurring any extra financial burden on the government,” he said. Walse Patil also said that the government was keen on providing housing facilities for the state police force. “We are planning to make a provision of Rs 700 crore for the same during the current financial year,” the home minister said. Praising the Pune Rural police for their efforts in starting the fuel pumps, Pawar said that the police should also make arrangements for compressed natural gas (CNG) stations and charging points for electric vehicles considering the daily increase in the prices of fuel. Pawar also made an appeal to the people to preferably travel by either electric vehicles or by public transport. Abhinav Deshmukh, superintendent of the Pune Rural police, said, “These fuel pumps will be operating 24/7 and will be managed by women. We are expecting a monthly profit of Rs 8 lakh from each pump, which will be utilised for the welfare of the police personnel.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/proposal-for-constables-retiring-as-psi-minister/articleshow/84078889.cms||---

Bikhchandani, the founder of Info Edge India Ltd. — the company that owns Naukri.com and co-founder of Ashoka University — interacted with EMC students of Delhi government schools on Friday, saying that dream big, start small is a mantra he follows that has always helped him.  “Successful businesses are built on deep customer insights. You must study customer behavior when you want to set up a business so that it solves a problem they are facing,” he told the students. “There is no substitute for hard work. You will face hardships, especially in the initial years. Think of the long term and keep persevering.” An alumnus of St Stephen’s College, Delhi University and IIM Ahmedabad, he began his career in advertising. Eighteen months later, he quit his job to become an entrepreneur and co-founded Info Edge. For the first seven years as an entrepreneur, Sanjeev dabbled in a number of small businesses — from salary surveys to databases; from feasibility studies to training. In 1997, Info Edge launched Naukri.com and transformed itself into an Internet company. Recalling his childhood days, he said, “I dreamt of starting my own company when I was a teenager. My first office space was my father’s servants quarters that I rented from him. I spent the weekends teaching at management schools in and around Delhi,” adding that for the first six years in entrepreneurship, he managed his finances by taking up part-time assignments. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia asked Bikhchandani his definition of an entrepreneurial mindset. He replied, “Any person who is successful as a professional or entrepreneur has a bias for action. He is thinking of creative solutions to problems and is action-oriented.” Answering what was his key motivation to becoming an entrepreneur, Bikhchandani said, “I wanted independence in the work I did. Coming from a middle-class family, I knew that financial stability was also important. After deliberating for a few months, I finally took the leap with a commitment to work hard and succeed.” He added, “Your first job is very important. Just like the first few years at school are crucial for learning, the initial 3-4 years of your professional life teach you a lot about work ethics, professional relationships, and working hard. It forms the foundation of your career.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mantra-for-budding-entrepreneurs-dream-big-start-small/articleshow/84081230.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The police seized three cars, worth Rs 18 lakh from the accused. The accused Md Haseen (34), who is a car mechanic, K Seshu Kumar (35), a bike mechanic, and Madhusudhan (37), a businessman from Shamshabad, were arrested by East Zone Task Force for stealing cars and selling them to gullible people as used cars. “We have detected three car theft cases registered at Kanchanbagh, and Malakpet in 2021 and at Banadadevi PS limits in Aligarh district of UP in 2020. Haseen’s associates, Mahbub and Abed of Meerut, who assisted him in committing car thefts are absconding,” Hyderabad CP Anjani Kumar said. Haseen was disposing the stolen cars through Seshu Kumar and Madhusudhan, who are into used car sales business. “The accused replaced stolen car’s registration plates with the plates of same model vehicle procured as scrap. They used registration papers of old vehicles to sell the cars to gullible customers,” the police said. Haseen has already been accused in three cases registered in Delhi. “All the cases are related to car thefts, and we suspect he was involved in several unreported crimes,” the police said. The main accused came to Hyderabad in 2014 and worked as a mechanic in Attapur. In 2019, Delhi police arrested Haseen and Aslam in three car theft cases. After coming out of prison, Haseen committed three more offences in Hyderabad and Aligarh. “We advise people to park their cars in well lit areas and use anti-theft devises. The documents of the vehicle have to be verified thoroughly while purchasing used cars,” Anjani Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/interstate-gang-of-car-thieves-busted/articleshow/84081211.cms||---

Its nursing home licence has been cancelled too, which means it cannot operate any longer. Meanwhile, a 20-year-old driver, Anurag Tripathi, was arrested on Friday for his alleged involvement in fake vaccine drives. Police have made 14 arrests in the case so far. “We have cancelled Shivam Hospital’s registration licence under Bombay Nursing Homes Registration Act, 1949. We have also sealed the building so that no illegal activity is carried out there. We have taken action as per the suggestion of the police that Shivam Hospital was the hub of fake vaccination drives,” said Sanjay Kurhade, assistant municipal commissioner, R-South Ward. Anurag worked as a driver for the family of Dr Manish Tripathi, a key accused in the scam. He has been arrested by Samta Nagar police in connection with an “inoculation camp” for 618 employees of four different companies in Kandivli (East) in April. Police said he was involved in entering Aadhar data of beneficiaries into a computer. Anurag has also been booked in a separate FIR lodged by MIDC police where over a thousand employees of a gold trading company were given shots. “Anurag belongs to the same hometown as Manish. A BSc dropout, he was brought to Mumbai to work as a driver for Manish’s ailing father,” said an acquaintance. In the wake of the scam where used vials were refilled with saline water, the police have made a few suggestions to the BMC. “A mechanism needs to be devised to monitor the disposal of used vials. It shouldn’t be left entirely to the private Covid vaccination centre (PCVC),” said a police officer. “There also needs to be a system to keep the records of who is the end user of every dose,” he added. Civic officials said as per the revised guidelines, all PCVCs have been asked to remove stickers mentioning batch numbers from vaccine vials after use. “PCVCs can either destroy the stickers or remove and preserve the stickers if they want to keep track of the batch numbers,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health). Vials should be disposed without stickers to prevent reuse, said officials. Meanwhile, Borivli police on Friday took custody of five of the accused—Mahendra Singh (alleged mastermind), Sanjay Gupta and Kareem Ali in connection with a fake vaccine camp at Aditya College in Borivali, and Nitin Mode and Chandan Singh in the Mansi Stocks and Shares Advisory case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-shivam-hosp-loses-licence-one-more-arrested-in-vaccine-scam/articleshow/84076021.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Kozhikode||Kerala government trying to nix 3 major cases: Opposition leader V D Satheesan||KOZHIKODE: Opposition leader V D Satheesan said that the state government was trying to cover up and settle the three main criminal cases which have come up during the tenure of the new LDF government, including the illegal tree felling case, gold smuggling case with alleged CPM links and the Kodakara heist case having links to BJP leaders. Speaking at a meet-the-press programme at the Press Club here, Satheesan demanded that former revenue and forest ministers should be included as accused in the illegal tree felling scam as it was carried out with their support. Satheesan said that on the day after the controversial order of the revenue department was withdrawn, the additional principal secretary of the then forest minister spoke to a member of the timber mafia, and on the same day the illegally-cut timber was transported from Muttil through the forest department checkpost at Lakkidi to Ernakulam on February 3. He said that the register at Lakkidi forest checkpost for the day has two columns erased with a whitener, which raises suspicion that the number of the vehicle could have been entered initially. “The illegal tree felling in nine districts have taken place with the support of the former revenue and forest ministers and cases should be registered against them as they have responsibility for what has happened and they have also consulted each other before issuing the controversial order issued by the revenue department. The order was actually a license to the timber mafia as it was issued by hiding provisions in existing rules and by twisting some provisions,” he said. He said that UDF has asked an independent three-member fact-finding committee comprising environmentalists and lawyers to undertake a study and submit a report on the illegal tree felling. On the Karipur gold smuggling case, Satheeshan asked how could the party not know of a person connected to it having smuggled gold around 22 times through Karipur airport. “CPM is now fearing the quotation gang and has to provide lifelong support to them. Otherwise, they would make public the incidents in which the party used them for various crimes, including political killings,” he said, adding that the Kodakara heist case has links with BJP leaders. “The government is trying to cover up and settle the major criminal cases which have come to light after the new LDF government came to power including the illegal tree felling scam, hawala case and gold smuggling case. The chief minister is repeating his constant refrain that the guilty will be brought to book while the probe is going in the wrong direction,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/govt-trying-to-nix-3-major-cases-oppn/articleshow/84076827.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kol records 4th organ donation this year||Kolkata: On Friday, the city saw the fourth deceased organ donation of the year so far. Three different transplant teams at the state-run Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research (IPMGER) was conducting the transplant surgeries till reports last came in. The donor’s liver and two kidneys were being transplanted into three patients suffering from end-stage organ failure.What struck the counsellors at SSKM Hospital was the readiness of the family of Manasa Singh (51) — the deceased — to donate her organs. The husband, Nabakumar, is a farmer. None of the family members is educated enough to know about brain death, or organ donation and even transplant. But it did not take much for the counsellors to convince that the 51-year-old could save the life of at least four persons.The homemaker from a village near Khanakul in Hooghly was riding pillion on a motorcycle on Sunday when it hit a pothole. Singh tumbled off the bike, her head hitting the ground. She was initially rushed to the nearby rural hospital from where she was shifted to IPGMER’s Trauma Care Centre. When treating, doctors realized that she was brain-dead. They then roped in the transplant counsellors.“We understood that her organs could save many lives. So why turn those into ashes instead of giving a fresh lease of life to the dying?” said Singh’s son Raju. The donor’s liver, two kidneys and cornea was retrieved. Even as the heart was also being planned for retrieval, it was aborted at the final moment.“The heart was found unfit and hence the liver and the kidneys are being allocated,” said nephrologist and ROTTO joint director Arpita Ray Chaudhury.Due to the pandemic, the process of retrieval took longer. Doctors had to check the Covid status of the donor as well as that of the recipients. In the meantime, the donor’s heart failed. “Our heart recipient as well as the heart transplant team was all prepared. But finally the heart could not be transplanted,” said IPGMER director Manimoy Banerjee.“Families from such humble background agreeing to the donation is encouraging.

---||Nagpur||Schools can’t stop students from attending classes over unpaid fees: Bombay high court||NAGPUR: In a jolt to private schools, which are allegedly harassing students and parents over unpaid fees despite clear directives from the Supreme Court, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Friday clarified that no school can stop a student from attending online classes or withhold their results over unpaid fees. A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor directed Centre Point School, Katol Road, to immediately comply with the Supreme Court directives that “no management shall debar any student from attending either online/physical classes on account of non-payment of fees, arrears/outstanding fees including the installments, and shall not withhold the exam results on that account”. The apex court’s directives had come on February 8 while hearing a case of Gandhi Sewa Sadan against the Rajasthan government and others. Censuring the school management, justices Shukre and Kilor made it clear that it can’t withhold the exam result of petitioner’s son, nor can it debar him from attending Std VII online classes. “If the school doesn’t comply with these directives, a serious view of this matter shall be taken by this court,” they warned. Petitioner Ritesh and wife Nehal Agrawal had approached the judiciary through counsel Ashwin Ingole after school authorities refused to declare result of their son Shivansh, who was studying in Std VI. The school also discontinued his online classes for Std VII, asking them to pay entire fee first. The parents said they had already paid Rs81,080 and only Rs29,040 was unpaid, which they intended to deposit by August 31. Still, the school resorted to the pressure tactics despite clear directives from the top court on allowing parents to pay the fees in six instalments and not to prohibit any student from attending online or physical classes or withhold their marklist. While issuing notices to the Union ministry of education, state school education department, and Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), the bench kept the petition for final disposal. The judges asked the respondents, also including deputy director of education and Zilla Parishad education officer (primary), besides Centre Point School, to file a reply within two weeks. The petitioners charged the school with illegally fixing fees without forming the Parents Teacher Association (PTA) or making them as members. They prayed for directives to the respondents to launch an inquiry into excess fees collected by the school over the years. According to the petitioners, the action of the school and all other private schools of debarring students from attending online classes and withholding their results is violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India and the provisions of the Right To Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/schools-cant-stop-students-from-attending-classes-over-unpaid-fees-hc/articleshow/84078911.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Citizens recently collaborated with NGO Anandvan Mitra Mandal and the forest department to turn an 11-acre barren land in Mohammadwadi into a mini forest and planted over 500 trees to rejuvenate the forest area in Pisoli. The Forest department is ready with a list of barren lands in Pune district which could be turned green with the help of the citizens and NGOs. This includes 18 hectares of land in Daund to be voluntarily worked upon by Environmental Forum of India, 63 hectares in Lonikand and Wagholi to be cultivated by Sayukt Vanvavastapan Samiti, 20 hectares in Warje by Tree Public Foundation, and18 hectares in Mohammadwadi to be turned into a green oasis by the Rotary Club. The forest department is eager to bring citizens together in different parts of the district for the purpose of rejuvenating forest areas through community building. While in Pune, the main collaborators are The Forest Raisers and Anand Van Mitra Mandal, there are six NGOs volunteering in Vadgaon Maval, three each in Indapur and Paud, two in Baramati and Bhamburda, and one in Daund, Shirota, and Tamhini. “After seeing the good work done by NGOs and citizens, we have realised that we need their help to increase the green cover in Pune. In fact, citizen participation is necessary to make it a better, greener and a cleaner place,” said Rahul Patil, deputy conservator of forests (Pune region). He added, “The forest department is providing the land, and the NGOs are collaborating with local citizens to give these barren spaces a green makeover.

Though the police initially conducted a detailed investigation touching upon each and every aspect of the complaint filed by AIMIM candidate J Ravindra and registered a case under IPC Section 199 (false statement made in declaration which is by law receivable as evidence), on April 30, the Abids police had filed a chargesheet against the BJP corporator after the magistrate sought a ‘status report’ to be filed by April 23 before the court. After finding certain flaws, the court had returned the chargesheet and directed the police to correct the same, however, the police closed the case by filing a final report under the clause ‘mistaken fact’. The final report was challenged by the AIMIM candidate and upon hearing the arguments of the counsel Khaja Aijazuddin, the court had set aside the final report filed by the Abids police and directed the police to re-submit the charge sheet. Acting on the complaint filed by the AIMIM candidate, Abids police registered a case against BJP Jambagh corporator Rakesh Jaiswal for allegedly submitting a false affidavit with the returning officer during the GHMC polls and allegedly suppressed the fact that he has three children, which is against the GHMC election norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/case-against-bjp-corporator-closed/articleshow/84081272.cms||---

The four have been held under section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code and the relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. An officer from the Pune Rural police said that the complainant came in contact with the four men about two years ago. “They clicked photographs with the girl and later started blackmailing her by threatening to show the photographs to her parents,” the officer said. The suspects then used to take her to a lodge and rape her repeatedly. “They had threatened the girl that if she told about it to anyone, they would kill her father,” the officer said. The terrified girl suffered harassment at the hands of the men for two years out of fear, police said. On Thursday, she gathered courage and filed a complaint with the police. “We have arrested the four suspects. One of their accomplices is on the run,” the officer said. “We are working on certain clues and hope to arrest their accomplice soon,” said a police officer investigating the case.

According to DPCC, DG sets having capacity of 125kVA and above should be fitted with an emission control device or equipment having a minimum specified particulate matter capturing efficiency of at least of 70% in five mode D2 cycle. The emission control device or equipment must be tested over an ISO-8178 5 mode D2 cycle for equivalent kVA rating at any one of the five Central Pollution Control Board-recognised laboratories. “If the users cannot install emission control device, they should shift to gas-based generators. If the order is not complied with within 120 days from the date of issuance of this order in Delhi, the users of such DG sets would attract action as per the provisions of Air (Prevention and Control of pollution) Act 1981,” said the DPCC’s order. As DG sets contribute to pollution, they are banned in Delhi-NCR during the winter season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/install-device-to-control-emission-from-dg-sets-dpcc/articleshow/84078925.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Property tax kitty of civic body set to swell by Rs 150 crore||PUNE: The civic body’s property tax revenue is likely to go up by Rs 150 crore with the merger of 23 villages. The civic administration has set a target of Rs 2,000 crore for the 2021-22 fiscal. “The villages have been added to municipal limits. The property tax rates in civic limits can now be made applicable in these villages,” said Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer of Pune Zilla Parishad. As per officials of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), the civic administration has already started collecting property tax from 11 villages that were merged in 2017. PMC is collecting around Rs 60 crore from these villages. “A survey of properties in 23 merged villages will be carried out and property tax bills will be dispatched to them accordingly,” said a senior PMC official. The civic body has collected around Rs 902 crore property tax so far. As per PMC data, around 10.6 lakh properties are in the tax net and around 2 lakh properties are likely to be added from the 23 villages. Property tax is one of the biggest sources of revenue for PMC. On an average, around Rs 1,400 crore are collected from the source. However, the civic body has set itself a bigger target this year. With the state government issuing a notification merging 23 villages, PMC is now the largest civic body in Maharashtra. The total area under PMC is 518 sqkm, overtaking Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s 440-odd sqkm. Unlike similar mergers in the past, all 23 fringe villages, including Wagholi, Khadakwasla and Pisoli have been added “fully” to the limits of the civic body, the state urban development department’s notification stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/property-tax-kitty-of-civic-body-set-to-swell-by-rs-150cr/articleshow/84078958.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

Investigative agencies are probing whether the small explosive-laden drones used in the terror attack on the Jammu air force station on June 27 were launched from Pakistan or from within the region, and whether the intent was to deliver a message of a new capability or actually cause damage on the ground, said Gen Rawat.

Referring to“We do not yet know the ultimate intention. But let them (Pakistan) attempt to do something to damage our assets, and the reaction from our armed forces will be very different. The political will is there. Our armed forces are ready,” he said, speaking at a webinar here. “A strong message has to be sent that anything of this nature, grey-zone tactics or hybrid warfare, if it damages our assets and affects our national security, we reserve the right to respond at a time and place of our choosing and the manner in which we wish to respond,” he added.

"What happened at Jammu was essentially a terrorist act which attempted to target our assets (Mi-17 V5 helicopters) there. The attempt failed. Two explosives, one HE (high explosive) in nature and the other fragmentation, were used,” said the IAF chief.

Many of the projects have already been undertaken and some of the systems were already fielded," he said. Gen Rawat said the armed forces will have to dynamically keep on adapting to new threats because the next attack could well be through rockets, as was seen in the recent Israel-Hamas conflict, and not drones. “Grey-zone warfare can involve anything and we have to be prepared for it,” he said.

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Best of three from Std X marks for all other boards too in higher secondary certificate results||PUNE/MUMBAI: Considering Std XI marks in the final assessment formula for higher secondary certificate (HSC, Std XII) students by the education department has drawn criticism from students. Also, students and their parents said the government had imitated the CBSE’s formula ditto and still took very long to announce it. School education minister Varsha Gaikwad announced the modalities of the HSC assessment on Friday. She said it was decided to consider the marks of students in college-based assessments in Std XI and Std.XII exams, and the best of three performing subjects in SSC exams two years ago will be considered. For the theory portion, scores in one or more (unit test/first semester exams/practice exams) theory papers of Std XII will carry 40% weightage whereas marks in the final exam of Std XI and the average of the best three performing theory papers of Std X will have 30% weightage each. A candidate who is not satisfied with the marks allotted can appear in the improvement examination to be conducted by the board later. Gaikwad said, “It has been a school year like no other. The 2020-21 batch has had to adjust a lot. But the students have managed to weather the storm with help from our able teachers. Junior colleges must meet the timelines for various activities to allow the board to declare results in a timely manner. The board will organise webinars, upload FAQs and set up helplines to give colleges, teachers a detailed understanding of the evaluation process.” For the improvement scheme candidates, the cancelled board exam of 2021 won’t be counted as a missed opportunity. They can still avail their eligible number of attempts. Separate assessment plans have also been finalised by the education department for external, repeater candidates and those appearing for isolated subjects. All students and their parents must read the policy details carefully, Gaikwad said. The same mode of assesments will be used to evaluate the performance of a candidate appearing for minimum competency vocational courses, bifocal vocational courses & courses aligned with the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF). A result committee headed by the college principal and comprising six teachers will be responsible for finalisation of results & safe keeping of records. Gaikwad said colleges and teachers would live up to the task. The education department has been pushing for a uniform assessment formula across India for Std XII. The evaluation method is similar to the one devised by the central education boards. Gaikwad said, “It is an ad-hoc arrangement but one that attempts to capture the spirit of continuous assessments using credible data points. It also offers some semblance of ‘normal times’, with computation of Std X and Std XI marks based on assessments during pre-Covid times.” CM Uddhav Thackeray had earlier hinted at a marking policy similar to the CBSE (30:30:40). Most colleges had conducted online tests and the first semester exams for Std XII. Colleges that were unable to hold written and oral exams, can do it online or over the telephone, states the government notification on the marking process. For private students, Std X and XII scores will be considered in a 50:50 ratio. Other boards, including CBSE, are still to announce their assessment policy for students appearing as private candidates, for isolated subjects and repeaters. Anubha Sahai, president of India Wide Parents Association, said the Maharashtra government is the only to have come out with a marking process for private students. She requested other states to declare the marking process for private candidates. Teachers were of the opinion that the least weightage be given to Std XI for regular students, as they do not take the exam seriously. There will be no revaluation. The Supreme Court has directed all states to declare results by July 31 to maintain uniformity. Students are waiting for their results to pursue higher education abroad and in colleges across the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/best-of-three-from-std-x-marks-for-all-other-boards-too-in-hsc-results/articleshow/84079006.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Delhi||As Central Vista Readies For New Avatar, IGNCA Revels At Its Temporary Address||New Delhi: The new, though temporary, home of Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts at Hotel Janpath is as spacious as earlier and has the bonus of natural lighting and extra storage space. The new IGNCA is open to the public and the institute plans to conduct guided tours to show people how the art institution works. At the moment, the conservationists are focusing their efforts on the paintings of Elizabeth Brunner, a 1965 movie poster starring Dara Singh and an almost century-old copy of the Holy Quran. Dispossessed of its complex due to the redevelopment of the Central Vista, IGNCA will call Hotel Janpath home until its shift to a 15-acre area at Jamnagar House in a few years. The conservationists are delighted with the space and the sunlit rooms. Simran Sangal, a conservation assistant, happily remarked, “The abundance of natural light will help us study the paintings in their natural colors. We also now have two huge rooms for storage.” This was reiterated by Achal Pandya, head of conservation, who said, “Our previous working area was dingy but this is world-class. From a utility point of view, the space here is better because there are hardly any dead spaces.” The conservation and cultural archives division finished shifting by March 25. It was this division that has adorned the walls at the new location with over 200 digital prints, including paintings and pictures of Mahatma Gandhi and photographs clicked by Raja Deen Dayal, a 19th-century photographer. The division began working from the very next day on conserving some important objects. “We did not miss a single day, working even during the lockdown,” disclosed Pandya. “As soon as we moved here, we began restoring a nearly 100-year-old copy of the Quran that we got from the Shah Waliullah Library of old Delhi. This volume was damaged and had more than 300 torn pages that we have managed to put together.” Work is under way on an Elizabeth Sass Brunner painting of Lord Mahavir, part of IGNCA’s in-house collection. Conservation assistant Simran Sangal said the painting had got loose from its stretcher and had bulged out at certain places. “There was also a layer of dust on the canvas. We re-stretched it and strengthened the edges. Plus, we also consolidated the flaking bits of paint and are touching up art,” said Sangal. A 1965 poster of the film Mahabharat gifted to IGNCA by the BD Garga Collection is also being conserved. “This poster was affected by acidity and the paper was turning brittle. It was stored rolled up and could not be unrolled without damaging it. We have now lined it with Japanese tissue paper and given it archival retouching,” Sangal revealed. An exhibition titled Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav with Brunner’s artworks of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawarhalal Nehru, Rabindranath Tagore and photographs of DRD Wadia, Shambhu Saha and Henri Cartier Bresson is on. Keen to attract people to the centre, Pandya said, “The glass walls will allow people to come and see how we conserve precious artistic heritage.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-central-vista-readies-for-new-avatar-ignca-revels-at-its-temporary-address/articleshow/84081330.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

At some of these, cops manage the traffic manually for short durations. However, the situation at these traffic junctions worsens during peak hours. Residents say that the Nehru Colony road and several stretches at the Rajpur Road have become accident-prone for commuters in absence of functioning traffic lights. Sujeet Kandpal, who runs a business establishment at Behl Chowk, said, “The traffic lights here have been out of order for the last few days. The area witnesses heavy traffic volume and hence, authorities must ensure that the lights are fixed at the earliest.” A spot visit by TOI revealed that traffic lights were lying defunct at Inder Road and near Crossroads Mall as well. “In absence of traffic lights, it feels like we are driving in a maze. It gets scarier when people resort to rash driving,” said Bainkunth Tripathi, a city resident. Meanwhile, SP traffic Swapn Kishore Singh told TOI, “The Uttarakhand Information Technology Development Agency manages real-time data related to traffic lights. In case of any faults, the team alerts the ones on the ground and the fault is fixed. The defunct traffic lights will be repaired soon to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.” Watch Uttarakhand: Defunct traffic lights in several parts of Dehradun lead to regular traffic snarls||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/defunct-traffic-lights-in-several-parts-of-doon-lead-to-regular-traffic-snarls/articleshow/84076857.cms||Abhijeet Singh
---||Mumbai||As 2nd wave ebbs, mucormycosis cases, deaths drop in Mumbai||MUMBAI: City hospitals have witnessed a significant drop in mucormycosis cases after the huge spurt over the past two months. Hospitals said there was a marked decline in admissions—both local and through referrals—in the past 10-15 days. The state-run JJ Hospital is now recording one mucormycosis admission in 2-3 days. During the peak in May and early June, the hospital had admitted over 22 patients in a single day. “The decline in Covid could have led to a fall in mucormycosis, but the traffic has definitely reduced,” said JJ dean Dr Ranjit Mankeshwar, adding there are fewer deaths too. JJ Hospital treated 204 patients since April, of which 162 needed surgeries to stop the spread of the fungal infection. Parts of northern Maharashtra and Vidarbha started seeing a rise in cases of mucormycosis since April. Doctors sounded an alarm when Mumbai hospitals started seeing an influx of patients who needed urgent palate and eye removal surgeries to stop the infection. Till June 24, the state had reported 8,367 cases and 780 deaths. Mumbai reported over 529 cases, including 50 deaths. Pune reported the highest cases (1,234), followed by Nagpur (1,339) and Aurangabad (945). Parel’s KEM Hospital started seeing a drop about a fortnight days ago after seeing a deluge of admissions starting May. It had admitted 128 patients till Friday, of which 74 continue to be under treatment. At its peak, up to 100 patients were admitted in the dedicated ward. Dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh said that mucormycosisis is mimicking the Covid curve. “As Covid came down, cases of mucormycosis too dropped. Another factor could be early detection as doctors are aware of the red flags,” he said. In May and June, KEM doctors performed more than 350 surgeries on patients of mucormycosis. A single patient would need up to three major surgeries to stop the infection, which would start from the nose, but rapidly spread to the upper jaw and to the brain. Dr Deshmukh said that up to 40% needed ENT surgeries, while 30% needed eye surgeries. Nearly 10 patients needed neurological and cardiac interventions as the fungus invaded the carotid artery. As on Friday, five mucormycosis patients were on oxygen and two were critical, the dean added. “The recovery takes longer in severe cases, but 36 patients have gone home so far,” Deshmukh added. From 10-15 consultations daily in May and the first half of June, the number has dropped to one or two cases on alternate days at the civic-run Sion Hospital now. The management was forced to create a special ward under combined teams from medicine, ENT, neurology and ophthalmology in May as patients came in advanced stages and would lose an eye or palate. “A crucial change visible now is a drop in advanced cases of mucormycosis. Delayed diagnosis means more debilitating surgeries to save the life of the patient,” said oculoplastic surgeon Dr Akshay Nair, who consults at Sion hospital. The hospital has treated over 140 cases till now. The onset of monsoon and control of dust could have also played a role since dust particles can act as a vehicle for fungal infection, according to Dr Ravikiran Vernekar, ENT surgeon at LH Hiranandani Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/as-2nd-wave-ebbs-mucormycosis-cases-deaths-drop-in-mumbai/articleshow/84081465.cms||Sumitra Debroy

At present, the water level in the dam is 309.70 RL metre and around 9.98 TMC, which is said to be sufficient for the city in the coming days, until monsoon arrives. Monsoon is said to be delayed this year but due to heavy rainfall last year, the water in the dam is said to be sufficient. Superintendent engineer of PHED, Shubhanshu Dixit said, “We are not worried about the level at present as monsoon is round the corner. With more rainfall, it is expected that water level will rise. At present, we have also increased the water supply quantity in Jaipur due to lockdown. Still, we have sufficient water for that.” At present, the water production from the dam is about 2cm to all the three districts — Jaipur, Ajmer and Tonk, which is around 900 MLD. From this, a daily average of 580 MLD water is supplied to Jaipur, 310 MLD to Ajmer and 40 MLD to Tonk. At present, in Prithviraj Nagar, Amber, Jamdoli, Kho Nagoriyan and Jagatpura areas of the city, new pipelines are been laid, to connect more areas of the city with direct supply from Bisalpur Dam. Apart from Prithviraj Nagar, other projects will be completed by September 2021. In Jagatpura area, pipeline will be completed by August along with distribution of pipeline connection to the public. There are four zones in Jagatpura, out of which in three zones, water connections have been given to public where the work is completed. In Kho Nagoriyan, Amber and Jamdoli, it is expected that the lines will be laid down by September and water connections will be distributed as well. Due to pandemic, the work of pipelines was delayed but department is trying complete the project as soon as possible. However, Prithviraj Nagar scheme that was launched in March 2021 is expected to be complete by 2023.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bisalpur-water-can-quench-pink-citys-thirst-for-5-mths/articleshow/84078987.cms||---
---||Kolkata||We’re teachers, not chowkidars: Visva-Bharati science HoDs||KOLKATA/SANTINIKETAN: Peeved with the Visva-Bharati authority’s order to restrict entry into the various Bhavans or schools at the university and entrust the responsibility of access with the respective heads of departments, some science department heads have threatened to quit from their post, saying that they are academics, not chowkidars.  While V-B officials refused to comment, sources said the university authority had requested the HoDs to continue functioning with an assurance that their peeve-points will be reviewed. The verbal order to hand HoDs the responsibility of controlling access to their departments was issued after a plumbing pipe was stolen from the chemistry department and a basin in the toilet damaged a week ago. Though a police complaint is usually lodged when there is a theft or damage, it was not done in this case. VC Bidyut Chakrabarty visited the department on Wednesday and asked for the closure of the Siksha Bhavan gate. On Thursday, Chakrabarty reportedly instructed Siksha Bhavan principal (dean of science) Taraprasad Chattopadhyay to tell all HoDs to maintain a report of everyone entering their respective department and send it to the registrar from time to time. On Friday, the gates of Siksha Bhavan, Vidya Bhavan and Bhasha Bhavan were shut with only two persons being allowed to enter at a time after prior permission from the registrar. A third person will have to wait for one of the two to leave before being allowed in. “Anyone wanting to access any Bhavan will first have to send a message to the principal concerned, who will then forward it to the security officer. A register will be kept at the entrance of each Bhavana,” a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/were-teachers-not-chowkidars-v-b-science-hods/articleshow/84076890.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The arrested persons are from Koduvally and were allegedly part of the gang that tried to rob smuggled gold brought through Karipur airport. The arrested were identified as Riyas (33), Mohammed Basheer (39), Mohammed Hafiz (28), Mohammed Fasil (28) and Shamsuddin (35). With their arrest, the number of persons currently nabbed by the police in connection with the case —registered under IPC section 399 (making preparation to commit dacoity)— has risen to 16. Earlier, police had recorded the arrest of Sufiyan TK (33), one of the key accused in the intended dacoity case, from Vavad in Koduvally. That apart, an eight-member Cherpulassery gang, and two other persons —Fijaz (brother of Sufiyan) and Shihab from Manjeri— were also arrested in connection with the case. Five persons belonging to the 15-member Cherpulassery gang had died in a road accident after their car collided with a lorry while they were returning after pursuing a car under the belief that a carrier, who had brought gold, was in the vehicle, not knowing that customs had seized the 2.3kg gold which the gang had planned to rob.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/5-more-held-in-kozhikode-gold-heist-bid/articleshow/84076879.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh’s lawyer says even Kasab got benefit of rule of law||MUMBAI: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), in registering a corruption case FIR, had not followed the legal provisions of seeking the state’s consent and prior sanction, said counsel for former home minister Anil Deshmukh on Friday before the Bombay high court. Senior counsel Amit Desai for Deshmukh said, “Even a person like (Ajmal) Kasab got the benefit of rule of law in this country.” “If we bypass procedure, then we have a challenge of the rule of law,” said Desai, while arguing Deshmukh’s quashing petition. Desai was making his submissions before a bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar. He focused on the necessity to ensure principles and procedures of law are not given a go-by. The HC had directed that post its preliminary enquiry in the complaint by advocate Jaishri Patil, based on ex-police chief Param Bir Singh’s letter, the CBI should take steps “in accordance with law.” Desai said this would mean applying for the government’s consent under Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act and for prior sanction as mandated by Section 17-A of the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA). The April 21 FIR does not even mention commission of any “substantive offence” and merely says that he “attempts” to take undue advantage and the FIR has thus invoked Section 7 of Prevention of Corruption Act that deals with public servants taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of an official act, Desai said. The FIR says the reinstatement of Sachin Waze as an API was done after his 15-year suspension, and important or sensational cases were entrusted to him and Deshmukh had “knowledge” of it. “Knowledge” in law does not amount to offence, Desai argued. “No judgment of any court can be read or interpreted in a manner that nullifies the express provisions of an Act,” he submitted, citing SC judgments. He said, “Every allegation does not mean corruption. Every allegation if suo motu taken for a probe, there will be a collapse of the system…there will be anarchy.” “We have forgotten the legal doctrine of presumption of honesty when discharging public duty. We have attuned ourselves to believe in presumption of dishonesty…Your lordships are the filter to protect the society.” The HC bench said, “Laws have to operate in society, not in a vacuum. Law is a process of social engineering.” Citing an SC order, Desai said CBI probe “should be passed only when HC, after considering material on record, comes to a conclusion that it does disclose a prima facie case calling for such investigation.” In this case, he said the HC had no material before it. Nothing prevented CBI from seeking the state’s consent, as was done in a case before Guahati high court. The arguments will continue on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-deshmukhs-lawyer-says-even-kasab-got-benefit-of-rule-of-law/articleshow/84081598.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Nagpur||Ordinance bars strikes by OFB, private defence services staff||NAGPUR: The Essential Defence Services Ordinance 2021, promulgated on June 30, not only makes strikes in government’s ordnance factories illegal but extends its scope to any industry related to defence production. Going by the wording, a strike even in a private company engaged in defence production or related services may be against the law. While workers are prohibited from going on a strike even on token basis, employers of industrial organizations can also be restrained from laying off employees. There are provisions of jail terms for workers and employers both, for violation of the order. The ordinance also empowers the police to arrest suspects without a warrant. The ordinance coincides with declaration of indefinite strike by unions in ordnance factories. This was against the government’s move to convert the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) into a public corporation. Once a corporation, the factories will have to be self-sustaining, which may not be feasible due to irregular orders from the defence forces, say unions. The ordinance says “any service in any establishment or undertaking dealing with production of goods or equipment required for any purpose connected with defence” will be included among essential defence services. The ordinance also empowers central government to issue a gazette declaring any service essential to defence, if its cessation of work may hamper production of defence goods, operation or maintenance of any industry engaged in the defence sector. The term ‘strike’ covers even token or sympathetic strikes, refusal to do overtime or mass casual leave, reads the ordinance. The penalty includes dismissal and prison term, ranging from one to two years. Union leaders said the order directly hits ordnance factories, as the definition of services includes any establishment engaged in defence production, so “it can cover the private sector too”. There are a number of private companies exclusively dealing in defence production. Apart from that, there are corporates like Bharat Forge, L&T and the Tata group, that have major stakes in the defence business. They either have separate companies or dedicated divisions within the same corporate structure catering to defence sector. In Nagpur, Solar Group is a major player in ammunition manufacture. Its defence business is handled by Economic Explosives Limited (EEL), a wholly-owned subsidiary. There are private units also catering to the ordnance factories on job work basis. C Srikumar, general secretary of All India Defence Employees Federation, said the ordinance not only covers ordnance factories but also private units. “That is the reason why unions have termed it as draconian and are planning to challenge it in the court,” he added. Bhartiya Pratiraksha Mazdoor Sangh (affiliated to the RSS) general secretary Mukesh Singh said, “The ordinance covers any unit that will be engaged in defence production, leaving no scope for agitation.” Singh said there were plans to meet the President, along with senior leaders of Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh and express views against the ordinance. The order makes strikes illegal, but is also stringent on employers. The central government has been empowered to prohibit any kind of lockout in such industries by the employer. Even layoffs of on-roll employees can be prohibited if it is being done for reasons other than shortage of power or natural calamity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ordinance-bars-strikes-by-ofb-private-defence-services-staff/articleshow/84078974.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Nagpur||Covid-related swelling issue cured by team of Nagpur doctors||NAGPUR: A 32-year-old man from Katni (MP), who was suffering from severe Covid, experienced a rare complication known as pneumomediastinum. As his lungs had weakened, air leaked into the mediastinum, a space between both the lungs inside the chest cavity where the heart is. Gradually, the air continued to accumulate under the deepest layer of the skin and the man experienced unusual swelling all over his body. This condition may have been the outcome from physical trauma to death. Doctors from his native place referred him to Nagpur as a last chance. City doctors treated this man by inserting a tube in mediastinum. The process, known as ‘pigtail insertion’, is performed very rarely in the mediastinum area as it may prove fatal in case it hurts the heart. “Intubation is the common process to drain out the fluid or air accumulated in the chest around the lungs. But inserting the tube into the mediastinum is very risky. In this case, the patient was admitted in a critical condition. He was also Covid positive with swelling from head to toe,” said Dr Parimal Deshpande, pulmonologist, who took the risk to save his patient’s life. Veteran pulmonologist Dr Ashok Arbat guided him in taking the decision while radiologist Dr Nilay Nimbalkar handled the important imaging part of the process. Doctors told TOI that the patient was kept on a ventilator. The tube remained in the cavity near the heart for ten days. Gradually, air deposited in this cavity began to release. In the later phase, the air deposited under the subcutaneous tissue also decreased and the swelling subsided. In 15 days, the patient got more than 90 percent relief. The impact of Covid on his lungs also diminished gradually. Finally, the patient was discharged earlier this week. He is doing well now. “Many Covid patients, who turn critical due to this phenomenon of lung weakness, die after suffering from swelling all over the body. According to the available literature, only 2 out of 10 such complicated cases survive. We were lucky that the only bread earner of the family was saved after we took the daring decision,” Dr Deshpande added. According to Dr Arbat, its a rarest of the rare survival. “Covid reduces the elasticity of lungs due to which air leaks air into the chest cavity. In this case, it leaked into mediastinum and later spread under the skin throughout the body. This is called surgical emphysema. In this case, the patient had a dramatic recovery,” said Dr Arbat. Family members of the patient said it’s a miracle. “We were told that he has just a few hours left. But, within 24 hours of the tube insertion, his swelling receded. He left the hospital walking on his own feet which is the best feeling for us,” said a family member. HOW IT HAPPENED * As lungs lost elasticity, air deposited in mediastinum a cavity between two lungs where heart is located * In later phase, air started depositing under subcutaneous tissue, deepest layer of skin * This resulted in heavy swelling all over the body, weak lungs and critical condition * Doctors took daring decision to insert a tube inside mediastinum as last remedy * Patient recovered from swelling, Covid, and walked out of hospital, hale and hearty||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-related-swelling-issue-cured-by-team-of-city-doctors/articleshow/84076917.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Primary schools to hold online classes in morning shift||AHMEDABAD: The state education department has directed primary schools to run in morning hours and carry online education sessions in this period. The director of primary education issued a circular in this regard on Friday, said sources in the department. The decision comes after a group of primary school teachers recently made representation to the state government, seeking to allow schools to function only in morning shifts, according to sources. Schools are closed due to Covid-19 for on-campus education and teachers are holding online education for the new academic year that began on June 7. The State Primary Teachers’ Association has recently written to the director of primary education in this regard. After a long hiatus of about nine months, the government had started opening schools for on-campus studies in the month of January in a staggered way but had to soon close them and switch to online education after there was a surge in the number of Covid-19 cases. “Teachers have been facing issues as many schools were running in both morning shifts and afternoon shifts. It is easier for students to attend online classes in the morning with both parents around at this time,” said a member of the association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/primary-schools-to-hold-online-classes-in-morning-shift/articleshow/84079021.cms||---

Goa Airport has topped the ranking. The ranking was done by Airports Council International (ACI) on the basis of 33 parameters for the first quarter of the year from January-March 2021. ACI World has revealed this year’s Airport Service Quality awards which highlight the world’s best airports as judged by their customers. The Covid-19 pandemic had a dramatic impact on the global passenger traffic in 2020 and it transformed the customer perceptions and expectations of the airport experience. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, airports managed to collect ASQ surveys from their customers to give the rankings. Jaipur was followed by Calicut, Guwahati and Kolkata. Total 22 airports were considered for the ranking, but data of nine airports was not taken due to certain conditions. "In the last survey, Jaipur airport was ranked at 14th position because of the construction which was being done here and now that we have got better facilities, the ranking has also improved. Apart from more departure and arrival halls, luggage conveyor belts were also added. Moreover, the parking situation was bettered with segregation of space for passengers who were boarding and arriving. The rankings are done every quarter and total points taken to give the annual ranking," said an airport official. There are 33 parameters on which the airports are surveyed. These include ground transportation to/from the airport, parking facilities, availability of baggage carts/trolleys, waiting time in check-in queue, flight information screens, restaurants, cleanliness of toilets, comfort of waiting areas and behaviour of the staff, amongst others. In 2017, Jaipur had topped the same survey. To deal with space constraints, various infrastructure development projects were started at the airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/out-of-13-airports-in-country-jaipur-ranks-second-survey/articleshow/84079038.cms||---

Nimisha’s husband, who was allegedly an ISIS fighter, had died in a fight. The petition filed by Bindu K of Attukal in Thiruvananthapuram said by abandoning Nimisha and other Indian women detained in Afghanistan, Indian government is inadvertently bolstering the falsehoods being propagated by radical outfits. Not repatriating Nimisha and her granddaughter amounts to violation of fundamental right to life and denial of right to education to the granddaughter, the petitioner contended. Upon their return, Nimisha can be subject to due process of law whereas the granddaughter can be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society, the mother pleaded. In November 2015, Nimisha, a BDS student, went missing from her college in Kasaragod, got converted along with her prospective husband and they married. In May 2016, the couple travelled to Sri Lanka in the name of opening a business. In July 2016, the news of 21 Indians traveling to Afghanistan to join ISIS broke out and the petitioner saw photos and names of Nimisha and Bexen. In June-July, Nimisha gave birth to a girl named Ummu Kulusu. In August 2016, NIA registered an FIR and issued red corner notices against the 21 persons. Following death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, a group of 10 women and 21 children (including Nimisha and Ummu Kulusu) surrendered before Afghan authorities in October 2019. In June 2021, Centre denied Afghanistan’s request for deportation of these Indian women and children, the petition said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nimishas-mother-moves-hc-for-repatriation/articleshow/84076980.cms||---

The proposal has been sent to Nabanna. According to the proposal, the areas under Belgharia police station will be divided into three, including Dakshineswar, Kamarhati and Belgharia while the Dum Dum police station will be broken into two — Dum Dum and Nagerbazar. “Besides the huge footfall at the Kali temple, Dakshineswar also has the Metro crowd and Nagerbazar and Kamarhati, among others, have seen a huge population growth over the past decade. The new police stations will help manage these areas efficiently,” an officer said. Other areas likely to get new police stations include Halisahar, Jethia, Mohanpur, Shibdaspur and Shyamnagar. Most will be set up off Kalyani Expressway, which is accident-prone besides being prone to crime. There are also plans to carve out three new police outposts out of Bhatpara and Jagaddal police stations.

Inoculation will again be affected on Sunday as the district has received only 45,100 doses of Covishield as against the demand of 3.5 lakh doses. Vaccination will not resume at the usual timing of 9am on Saturday. It will be delayed and is likely to resume around 11am-12noon. The NMC and ZP received doses at around 9pm on Friday. The distribution of doses will be done in the morning on Saturday. Therefore, it will take time to supply doses at all centres. For the last four days, there was no vaccination at 121 of NMC’s 122 Covishield centres in city for lack of doses. In rural areas, there was no Covishield vaccination for the last two days. As per data of the state’s public health department (PHD), the district got 45,100 of the 11 lakh doses supplied to Maharashtra by the Centre. NMC received 26,000 doses and the remaining 19,100 went to ZP. The doses are sufficient for only one day. Sources from NMC said there were no chances of fresh stock on Saturday, so vaccination was likely to be affected again on Sunday. On June 28, guardian minister Nitin Raut had told TOI that he had demanded supply of 3.5 lakh doses per day for the district, and that it should receive at least 3.5 lakh doses in a week. He also went on to say that the district can also administer 3.5 lakh doses in a day. Centre was not supplying the requisite amount of doses to the state, he had added. The demand for vaccine vials has increased manifold since the resumption of vaccination for 18-44 years age group on June 23. After resumption, the district had received 40,600 doses on June 24 and 24,000 doses on June 26 — a total of 64,600. On Friday, the district received 45,100 doses. Thus, it got 1,09,700 doses in the last nine days. On Friday, Pune district received 1.25 lakh doses. On June 24 and 26, this district got 2,48,280 doses. This takes the total doses allotted to Pune district up to 3,73,280 in the last nine days. As per PHD, the estimated population of Nagpur district is 52.72 lakh, and that of Pune district 1.17 crore. While the population of Pune district is roughly double that of Nagpur district, the former received 3.4 times the vaccine doses that the latter did. Nagpur district also got 4,400 doses of Covaxin, while the allocation was 30,600 for Pune district. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said the number of centres in the city had been increased from the existing 126 to 143. “Four centres will be for Covaxin and the remaining 139 centres for Covishield. First and second dose for 18-plus age group will be provided at the 139 centres of Covishield,” he said. Joshi added, “First and second dose for only 45-plus will be permitted at three centres of Covaxin — Mahal Diagnostic Centre and Khobragade Hall (Dr Ambedkar Hospital’s extension). Second dose for 18-44 years age group will be allowed at Mahal Diagnostic Centre’s other centre.” Vaccination has continued at 10 private centres. 2,531 people took the jab at these centres on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vax-to-resume-but-stock-may-last-1-day/articleshow/84079047.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Kolkata||Heritage plaque for Satyajit Ray cinematographer’s house in maestro’s birth centenary year||KOLKATA: The West Bengal Heritage Commission will be installing a blue plaque in front of the residence of cinematographer Subrata Mitra on 70, Sarat Bose Road, on Saturday. For his admirers, it is only fitting that such an initiative coincides with the birth centenary year of Satyajit Ray, with whom Mitra had done 10 classics. The Commission had declared Mitra’s residence a heritage structure on January 23 this year. “The installation of the plaque got pushed back because the election date was declared and the model code of conduct was put in place. On Saturday, the plaque will be installed in presence of various dignitaries, including Sandip Ray, Goutam Ghose, Ashoke Viswanathan, Sunanda Basu, Samik Bandopadhyay and Raju Raman,” said commission chairperson Shuvaprasanna. Despite his debut in ‘Pather Panchali’ in 1955 and then working with Ray in ‘Aparajito’, ‘Paras Pathar’, ‘Jalsaghar’, ‘Apur Sansar’, ‘Devi’, ‘Kanchenjungha’, ‘Mahanagar’, ‘Charulata’ and finally ‘Nayak’ in 1966, Mitra was bestowed his single National Film Award in 1986 for ‘New Delhi Times’. The same year, he was also awarded a Padma Shri. For years, his admirers had hoped his name would be considered for the Dadasaheb Phalke Award. But that never happened and Mitra passed away on December 7, 2001, as the emeritus professor of cinematography at the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute. An excellent sitar player, Mitra also played a piece in ‘Pather Panchali’. Describing the autodidact’s camerawork, Ray used the phrase “truthful, unobtrusive and modern”. After Ray’s demise, internationally-acclaimed restorer David Shephard, known for his work on restoring Chaplin’s cinema, had come to check the original negatives of ‘Pather Panchali’.  “He was surprised that Subrata Kaku had never held a film camera before shooting this film. I remember him saying: ‘He knew what he was doing’. That’s a big compliment,” said filmmaker Sandip Ray. Subrata Mitra's house on Sarat Bose RoadIf Mitra’s use of bounce lighting in ‘Aparajito’ became a trend-setter, so did his interest in working with mist and fog in ‘Kanchenjunga’. His filming of the lonely Charu walking along the window while checking out the passersby through her opera glasses has become iconic. The train in ‘Nayak’ was shot in a set. In order to make it seem real, Mitra had gone to Delhi in a vestibule to separately film the back projection plates to simulate the whizzing landscape outside the train window. On his return trip, he had recorded the sounds that is heard in the film. When a moving train crosses a tree, a shadow is bound to fall on the actors sitting inside. “To recreate this effect in the back projection plates, Subrata kaku had got his crew to move around with trees and branches to create shadows on the artists. Many couldn’t even believe that this was back projection. This blue plaque is truly long overdue and I am so happy that it is being installed,” he said. Talks were on to set up a museum on the ground floor of Mitra’s residence, but that might not be an easy process. The Subrata Mitra Archives is housed in the building and secretary of this trust Subimal Chakraborty told TOI, “Subratada’s brother, Pragyan, had rent out the building to tenants. I have no right to evict them.” Shuvaprasanna said, “We will look into the legal issues and try to ascertain the rightful owner. Subsequently, a committee will be set up so that a museum to display his works and collections can be set up there.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/heritage-plaque-for-ray-cinematographers-house-in-maestros-birth-centenary-year/articleshow/84076971.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Delhi||Delhi: BJP MPs seek an AIIMS-like hospital in trans-Yamuna||NEW DELHI: Former Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari and East Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir on Friday called upon Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan and demanded an AIIMS-like hospital for the trans-Yamuna area in the capital. The BJP functionaries submitted a memorandum to the health minister alleging that the area is home to over 80 lakh people, but lacks good healthcare facilities. Due to lack of adequate healthcare facilities, many people die every year, they claimed. Tiwari, an MP from North-East Delhi, said that after Independence, there has always been apathy towards the trans-Yamuna in terms of development. “During the Covid-19 pandemic, hundreds of families living in this region suffered miserably. An AIIMS-like hospital will prove to be beneficial for more than a crore population, including a large number of people from nearby urban and rural areas of Uttar Pradesh,” Tiwari stated. Gambhir said, “ The AAP government has not implemented the central government’s Ayushman Bharat scheme, which is proving to be life-giving for the poor across the country”. He also pressed for the need for the state-of-the-art health facility. The East Delhi MP stated that the opening of such a hospital will check the arbitrariness of private hospitals as well. Neelkant Bakshi, political advisor to Tiwari, said the health minister assured the two MPs that he would look into their demand and a meeting of senior officials of the ministry would be soon called to explore the prospect of opening the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-mps-seek-an-aiims-like-hospital-in-trans-yamuna/articleshow/84079082.cms||---

The city police on Friday reached Mohali, where a similar centre was being run from a flat in the outer area of Kharar. After arresting 27 accused in the Ludhiana fake call centre case, the police came to know about a Gujarat resident through whom hawala money was being received. According to the officials, the Gujarat resident has also been nabbed from Mohali. A cop said, “The accused running Ludhiana and Mohali call centres are inter-linked. On information gathered from the arrested accused, a team of Ludhiana police reached Mohali and conducted a raid at a centre being run from a flat in Kharar. About eight persons were present there and have been detained for questioning.” The official said, “The accused had been taking help of the Gujarat resident who used to provide them hawala money made by duping the UK and the USA nationals. Besides, another aide of this gang is in Delhi and will be traced soon.” Additional deputy commissioner of police (investigation) Rupinder Kaur Bhatti, confirming the development, said, “The police will share further details after questioning the accused.” The city police had busted a fake call centre on Wednesday evening and arrested 27 accused, who were duping foreign nationals. The accused used to contact them and say that their identities have been used to execute different kinds of frauds and a case would be lodged against them. Thereafter, the accused would make them transfer money to UK and USA-based accounts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/fake-call-centre-racket-had-inter-state-links-finds-probe/articleshow/84074943.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Hyderabad||Threat of nalas continues in Secunderabad Cantonment||SECUNDERABAD: Seven-year-old Anand Sai died after he fell into an open nala in Bowenpally’s Bhavana Colony on June 5. Mekala Ramesh (31) was swept away after he fell into a nala at an under construction bridge on Bowenpally main road in August 2016. Are nalas in Secunderabad Cantonment death traps? Residents say in affirmative. And five years after Ramesh’s untimely demise and a month after Sai’s tragic death, very little has changed as open nalas continue to pose threat to residents. “We have been residing here for more than three decades. We spend sleepless nights during every monsoon and live with overflowing nalas, inundation of colonies and battered roads,” residents of Indirammanagar, Chandrababu Naidu Nagar and Sri Lanka Basthi told TOI. Existing nalas like Hasmathpet nala and Picket nala, which cover over 50 residential colonies, were constructed during pre-Independence era and no major facelift was given to them despite population and colonies having doubled in the last 20 years. Several pleas of residents to repair the nalas have fallen on the deaf years of Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) officials. Various residential welfare associations in the Cantonment allege that nalas pose danger to their lives and recall that they had lost property worth crores in 2020 floods. “Yet, the officials have not undertaken repairs,” said a resident of Royal Enclave. Voicing concern, residents of Radhika Colony in West Marredpally urged the Cantonment Board to resolve the nala problem. “We do not want a repeat of 2020 flooding because of overflowing nalas,” PC Suresh, a resident of Radhika Colony, said. Officials, however, said steps have been taken to address residents’ concerns. To ensure free flow of nalas, the Cantonment Board spent Rs 50 lakh on cleaning them. “Our engineering wing took up a special drive by demolishing as many as 70 unauthorised structures built on open nalas. In some areas, nalas have shrunk because of garbage and encroachment,” said SCB senior superintendent (solid waste management), M Devender. SCB CEO B Ajith Reddy told TOI they have approached the MA&UD department to include the SCB in the Strategic Nala Development Plan to refurbish and widen the existing nalas. “Civil works like raising retaining walls, building culverts and widening the nalas were taken up in view of the last year’s flood,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/threat-of-nalas-continues-in-cantt/articleshow/84076978.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Ahmedabad||CBI traps two ED officers accepting Rs 5 lakh bribe in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: The anti-corruption bureau (ACB) of the CBI office in Gandhinagar on Wednesday trapped two senior enforcement directorate (ED) officers allegedly accepting Rs 5 lakh as the first instalment of a Rs 75 lakh bribe, to not harass a Kapadwanj-based industrialist who is accused in a Rs 104 crore bank fraud case, officers said on Friday. According to the CBI FIR, the accused officers were identified as deputy director Purnakam Singh and Bhuvnesh Kumar, assistant director, who served at the ED office near Helmet Circle in Memnagar.  The CBI FIR states that Paresh Patel, who runs a firm that processes castor oil and is also into the production of steel pipes in Kapadwanj town of Kheda district, on June 28 filed a complaint against the two officers. “Patel has been facing an investigation by the ACB of the CBI’s Gandhinagar office for allegedly defrauding the Kapadwanj branch of the Bank of Baroda of Rs 104 crore. The ED Ahmedabad is simultaneously investigating the fraud under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA),” the FIR states. Patel and his two sons were summoned to the ED office on April 22 and May 25 by Singh and Kumar, to record their statements, the FIR states. “Patel alleged that and his son Hardik Patel went to the ED office on the instructions of Singh and Kumar on June 18. Patel alleged that he and his son were beaten up badly and abused by Singh and were threatened with the attachment of their properties,” the FIR states. Patel alleged in his the FIR with the CBI that, “Singh then demanded Rs 75 lakh in the presence of Kumar to settle his and case and assured Patel and his sons that they would not be beaten up if the money was paid.” On June 26, Kumar called Patel and demanded Rs 5 lakh as the first instalment of the Rs 75 lakh bribe through a Delhi-based angadia firm. Acting on Patel’s complaint, CBI ACB DySP S S Bhadoriya verified the allegations and a trap was laid in which the two ED officers were caught accepting the Rs 5 lakh instalment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cbi-traps-two-ed-officers-accepting-rs-5-lakh-bribe/articleshow/84079096.cms||---
---||Delhi||AUD fines student Rs 5,000 for ‘derogatory comment’||New Delhi: Ambedkar University Delhi (AUD) has fined a student Rs 5,000 for allegedly writing a derogatory comment against chief minister Arvind Kejriwal during the live broadcast of the December 2020 convocation on YouTube. Student groups, however, termed it as “fine raj” and claimed this was an attempt to thwart their protests. In a statement, Left-leaning students’ group AISA said, “The tendency to silence and punish students raising voices against anti-student policies has reached AUD where a second-year MA student and AISA member, Neha, has been fined Rs 5,000 by the university administration for an online protest against the fee hike and discrepancies in implementation of the reservation policy.” During a proctorial inquiry, the student was found violating AUD’s code of discipline for posing questions to Kejriwal, who was the chief guest at the online convocation. Raising the issue of the fee hike, the student had written with the hashtag #AntiStudentKejriwal: “The people’s CM does not have the time to listen to students. What alternative is the student left with? Fight the government, fight oppression or study, please help us out brother CM.” The proctor office, in its June 30 order, stated that the student had to pay the fine as punishment for use of “slur and disrespectful remark.” Asking the university administration to immediately withdraw the punishment imposed on the student, AISA alleged, “These attacks are not new. In another incident, a student was suspended by the administration for sharing an email regarding a Twitter Storm against the AAP government and exposing the university’s anti-student policies.” The AUD PRO office told TOI that during the convocation, the student had started disturbing the programme by using the YouTube chat room. “The comments and remarks made by her were derogatory, slurful and distasteful. The convocation is the most auspicious programme in the academic cycle of a student. The conduct of Neha was unbecoming of a student and against the values of AUD. The action was taken as her conduct was in violation of the prescribed and notified code of discipline,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aud-fines-student-rs-5000-for-derogatory-comment/articleshow/84079214.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

Dip in groundwater level has been noticed in Tirumalagiri, Shaikpet, Secunderabad, Marredpally, Khairatabad, Ameerpet, Charminar, Bandlaguda and Bahadurpura among the mandals in Hyderabad district. “The dip in groundwater level is because the use of groundwater doubled after lockdown was lifted completely. Unless it rains continuously for atleast three weeks, the groundwater level may not rise,” said a Ground Water Department official. Earlier, the GWD had predicted that groundwater may rise during the rainy season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/groundwater-levels-dip-despite-rains/articleshow/84077025.cms||---
---||Patna||West Champaran bears brunt of heavy rain, link road caves in||CHANPATIA/BETTIAH: Heavy overnight rainfall in the Terai region on both sides of the India-Nepal border have wreaked havoc in West Champaran. Over 150 mm rainfall was recorded overnight in the district. The approach road to the Ratwal-Dhanaha Gautam Buddha Setu caved in Thursday night, disrupting traffic to the four trans-Gandak blocks of West Champaran and onward to Uttar Pradesh. By Friday evening, the local administration was reported to be plugging the breach even as villagers living along the Gandak diara stepped up vigil, fearing heavier release of water from the Gandak barrage at Valmikinagar. At Laukaria Vritti Tola in Bairiya block adjoining Bettiah, villagers rushed to plug the embankment that caved in due to heavy rain. Government engineers later reached the spot to reinforce the sagging embankment. The overflowing Sikrahana inundated the Puroshattampur police station on the Bettiah-Sikta road. This road leading to Mainatar further up was overtopped with around three feet water by Friday afternoon. Bettiah, the district town, turned into a floating hell as incessant overnight rain led to waterlogging. The collectorate, court compound, the main roads and adjoining areas like Banuchapra that have been waterlogged for over three weeks witnessed rising water levels. A strong current flowed outside the Bettiah railway station. A district IPRD press release said restoration in the inundated areas of the town was proving difficult due to heavy rainfall. The Sikrahana has overflowed at several places. On the Bettiah-Narkatiaganj highway, the overflowing Sikrahana is gushing in strong current near Chanpatia adjoining Basantpur and Satwaria villages. What was just a strong current on Thursday night became a high flowing torrent by Friday morning, disrupting traffic on both sides. Enterprising young men from the vicinity brought in pushcarts that were soon pressed into a ferrying service of pull-carts. Motorbikes were loaded at Rs1,00 apiece to be ferried across the overtopped road in the current. Soon, the ferrying fees were jacked up two-fold. This reporter witnessed over two dozen such ferries to and fro, carrying bikes, passengers and goods. Bhibuti Yadav, leading a team of eight cart-pullers, played down speculations of making a big packet. “We’ll be fortunate if each one of us earns Rs1000 by evening,” he said. A couple of tractors, too, were pressed into service. The sturdy machines cut through the current even as the water level steadily began rising. “By nightfall, the level will rise to chest high,” Raj Kumar, anxious to get to the other side from Chanpatia to tend to the mango crop he has purchased, said. “There is no help from the administration. People are desperate to cross over. We hope there is no disaster,” Suman Kumar Chauhan, another passerby, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/west-champaran-bears-brunt-of-heavy-rain-link-road-caves-in/articleshow/84076635.cms||Abhay Mohan Jha

PI Sunil Ambulkar told TOI that it could be a big racket and more arrests are on the cards. “A food factory where the labourers and workers were taking benefit of these fake reports is also under scrutiny. The company has 700 staffers and 162 of them have tested positive since the onset of the pandemic. We are now investigating how many of these were genuinely Covid-19 positive and how many got fake reports to gain monitory benefits and paid leave,” said Ambulkar. Police have already started investigations into the company. Ambulkar said those who got fake Covid-19 positive reports have not only duped the company but also the government, and all of them will be booked under relevant charges. As per the company’s policy, a staffer testing positive used to get Rs1 lakh monitory assistance and two weeks of paid leave. With the help of a racket, many of them used to collect swabs of already positive patients and later submit the same as their own. A ward boy was arrested on July 1 in this regard who is now connecting the links of the racket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/1-held-more-arrests-on-cards-in-khamgaon-fake-covid-report-scam/articleshow/84077030.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Pune||Pune: Vaccination demand rises at most private hospitals again||PUNE: The long waiting time at government centres with a chunk of 45+ population being due for second dose has once again caused a surge in vaccination numbers at private hospitals. At least 82 private sites were undertaking vaccination in Pune district on Friday, with several hospitals reporting daily vaccination numbers normalising to an extent in the last two to three days. For a few days since June 21, footfall for vaccination at private centres had dropped drastically, primarily due to the government’s free vaccination for people above 18 years starting from June 21. Government data showed that the number of doses administered in government and private sites were over 50,000 each on June 26, and nearly 30,000 each on June 29 and over 25,000 each on June 30. Some bigger private hospitals said if numbers continued to be at the current levels, they were likely to go on with the drive on “humanitarian grounds” and not drop out. Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, told TOI, “Vaccinations at our centres have bounced back to an average of 3,000-4000 per day in the last few days. We are getting a mix of youngsters and senior citizens. We still have almost 40,000 doses with us and would not think about placing more orders on CoWIN till this figure falls below 20,000 doses.” Dr Kelkar, however, said one or more vaccine orders from the hospital were definite. Dr Sidram K Raut, director at Noble Hospitals, said, “Initially, we did see a drop in daily footfall for vaccination, but the numbers have picked up in the last three days, perhaps due to intermittent shortage of doses at government sites. We are also seeing huge demand from corporates.” Talking about the situation in the Symbiosis University Hospital and Research Centre, Lavale, Vidya Yeravdekar, principal director of Symbiosis Society, said, “Vaccination numbers have picked up again at our sites. One of the reasons could be the high waiting period for vaccine at government sites. We have also started two more vaccination centres, one at SB Road and another at Vimannagar.” Yeravdekar said the hospital was earlier vaccinating around 2,000 people per day, which dropped to 600 after June 21, but has now risen to an average of 1,000 per day. Dr Amita Phadnis, director of Oyster N Pearl (ONP) Hospitals, said footfall for vaccination at private sites has increased slightly over the past few days. Daily doses administered at some private hospitals, however, continue to remain low. Dr Purvez Grant, managing trustee and chief cardiologist of Ruby Hall Clinic, said, “As against the 2,000 vaccinations conducted at our sites before June 21, the average daily number is 600 now. We would continue with the drive on humanitarian grounds at the rates that government has permitted. As of now, we have enough doses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vaccination-demand-rises-at-most-private-hospitals-again/articleshow/84077023.cms||Neha Madaan

The government agency rescued the children, but officials claimed that due to interference by an NGO, the minors were brought to Jaipur by a train instead of being handed over to the child welfare committee (CWC) at Sawai Madhopur. The child panel has asked for a factual report and in case of anomalies, a probe will be launched into the matter. The district CWC has asked the GRP police to give further details about the case. The children are currently at a shelter in Jaipur and are being processed for details. Elaborating on the case, Sangeeta Beniwal, chairperson, Rajasthan state commission for protection of child rights, told TOI, “Apparently the said NGO suspected that the children who had boarded the train from Patna were being brought to Jaipur to be forced into labour and they were keeping tabs on them. Before the train reached Sawai Madhopur, the local CWC was informed regarding the children and a team of officials reached the station as well, but the minors were not deboarded and instead brought to Jaipur.” On being asked the reason for the same as the children could have been handed over to the CWC at Sawai Madhopur itself, the NGO told the government officials that since the train stopped there for a short time, it was not possible to deboard the children there. However, the child panel officials claimed that there was no requirement to bring the children to Jaipur as the FIR could have been registered at Sawai Madhopur itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/40-bihar-children-rescued-panel-seeks-factual-report/articleshow/84079089.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Armoury to store weapons at MLA Hostel, a no-go zone for leaders’ security staff||Kolkata: The security of MLA Hostel at Kyd Street has undergone changes from time to time, and a sea change had come after the unfortunate death of a CPM legislator exactly a decade back. But it is perhaps for the first time that it will house an entire armoury. An order passed by the Speaker of the state legislative Assembly, Biman Banerjee, to not allow security personnel — the PSOs, security guards and personnel of central forces — of state ministers and MLAs to enter the hostel has prompted Kolkata Police to set up a full-scale armoury at the pedestrian entry gate of the historic building. It is here that PSOs and security personnel have to deposit their arms before entering the main building. The rules become applicable from this new session. The change, claimed top sources, became a necessity after it was found that many MLAs — both from the ruling party and the opposition — are presently enjoying state- or Centre-sponsored security. In BJP circles, it is being perceived as an extension of the Speaker’s decision not to allow armed central force personnel — attached with several BJP legislators like Suvendu Adhikari — into the assembly. This temporary armoury, though, will handle only “short arms” like revolvers and pistols and will cover only the X and Y category of the protected. Those security personnel who move along with MLA getting Y+ and Z category security will have to walk down for more than 2kms to the Park Street police station where another armoury for sophisticated weapons (read modern-day rifles like Insas and AK-47) has been prepared. A room has been emptied and almirahs set up to house the weapons here in a record 48 hours. For a police station with a century-old tradition, even this is new. The decision, said sources, was taken on Thursday after multiple rounds of meetings between the Speaker and the Kolkata Police brass. The hostel presently has 201 rooms and many MLAs — outside the 40km range from city — who attend the Assembly proceedings or come to Kolkata on work prefer to stay here for the night. The order, though, will be applicable only when the Assembly is in session. “The temporary armoury will be guarded 24 hours of the day. It will come fitted with CCTV cameras and other monitoring devices. However, we do not have the space to accommodate so many weapons at the makeshift centre. Thus, the sophisticated weapons need to be deposited at Park Street police station,” said DC (South) Akash Magharia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/armoury-to-store-weapons-at-mla-hostel-a-no-go-zone-for-leaders-security-staff/articleshow/84077024.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Police found her near the Katna river on Friday after a local heard incessant cries of a child from the forest and alerted them. The baby girl could have been easily picked up by wild animals, police said, adding that she seems to be "a day old". They admitted her to the Pilibhit district hospital's special newborn care unit. Ramkishore Mahatiya, the Devipura resident who had informed the cops, said, “I was passing through the forest when I heard a baby crying. I couldn’t find anyone though. So, I rushed to the nearest police outpost. I am happy that the baby has been saved.” Mahatiya approached Rithora outpost on the forest outskirts at 7.30am. Sub-inspector Dharmendra Singh and his team - Krishna Kumar, Satish Kumar and Kiran Verma - then rescued the baby. The incident was reported near Pilibhit-Madhotanda road under Gajroula police limits. Pilibhit SP Kirit Kumar Rathod told TOI, “The baby girl was rescued from Mala range of Pilibhit forest. The exact time when she was dumped couldn’t be ascertained yet. It could be early in the morning or at night. The baby survived against all odds in an area full of wild animals." "I have asked the mahila thana in-charge to look into the case and try to trace the mother. Several people have expressed their desire to adopt the child. We have advised them to contact the Child Welfare Committee,” the Pilibhit SP said. The girl's condition is stable and under observation, doctors said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/baby-girl-left-in-forest-miraculously-survives-wild-animals-insect-bites/articleshow/84074983.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

For instance, water level at the Nagarjunasagar dam has risen by atleast 4 feet. This water reaches Akkampally, a tapping point, through which the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) provides potable water under Krishna Drinking Water Supply Project (KDWSP) phase I, II and III with a quantity of 270 million gallons a day. Another major drinking water source is Godavari. The water levels recorded on June 20 was 468 metres. A six-feet rise in water level was observed on Friday. Currently, the water board is supplying a total of 164 million gallons of water per day to its consumers. “Rainfall, which is reported in the upstream areas, flows through other water bodies while filling all the small tanks enroute to the drinking water sources. For this, it takes a couple of weeks,” said a water board official. However, no rise in water levels in the twin reservoirs of Osmansagar and Himayathsagar reservoirs has been noticed. Also, two other drinking water sources, including Singur and Manjeera, have not received any inflows. “The water board had overcome the water shortage during summer this year, and we hope all drinking water sources will get enough water this monsoon. If India Meteorological Department (IMD) predictions are true, the water board can easily supply potable water during the next summer,” officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/drinking-water-sources-receive-fresh-inflows/articleshow/84077017.cms||Sunil Mungara

The judge was dealing with a petition filed by senior IAS officer Y Sri Lakshmi, an accused in the case. She sought a stay on trial at CBI court on the ground that the conclusion of trial without determining the border dispute between AP and Karnataka may not be correct. CBI counsel K Surender said the case was registered against the accused nine years ago. “They are dodging the trial for one reason or the other. We will separately investigate border disputes and a separate chargesheet will be filed in that,” he said. Justice Akther asked him to file a memo informing this aspect to the trial court. The judge adjourned the case to July 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-refuses-to-stay-trial-in-illegal-mining-case/articleshow/84077051.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Quash CBI case: Hetero Drugs to Telangana HC||HYDERABAD: Stating that it was unfair to harass ‘genuine industrialists’ with criminal cases, Hetero Drugs and its director M Srinivas Reddy on Friday urged the Telangana high court to quash the case filed against them by the CBI in the quid pro quo case. They were named as accused in one of the 11 chargesheets the CBI had filed in the case. Justice Shameem Akther was hearing the quash petition filed by the Hetero group and its director. Appearing for the Hetero group, senior counsel T Niranjan Reddy said the quid pro quo case was more of a political case. “If the son of a chief minister is launching a business, then people tend to invest in them. That is a natural tendency. What is unnatural in this case is the attitude of the CBI that made all those who invested even Rs 100 as accused,” he alleged. “Whether the liability of a political heir-cum-businessman can be extended to all the investors is a question that has to be examined by the courts,” he said. “They want to prosecute Jagan Mohan Reddy and hence filed several chargesheets and started making everyone an accused in the process,” Niranjan Reddy said. CBI counsel K Surender said the CBI will not go by the political overtones attached to a case. “It looks like a decision of the company, but what one should observe is it is the intent of the MD that comes across as a decision of the company in almost all cases,” he said. The modus operandi applied in all the 11 chargesheets in the quid pro quo case was the same, he said. At this, Justice Akther said that he would start resolving all the cases filed in the quid pro quo case and adjourned the hearing to three weeks. Hetero group said: “The only allegation against us is that we got 75 acres of land from the state at Jadcherla pharma SEZ. This was not a sale. We were given this land on a lease and we developed the land on our own. It cost us more than Rs 20 lakh per acre. It is absurd to link this allotment with our Rs 20 crore investment made in Jagan’s firms — Jagathi Publications and Janani Infra.” “If deriving more benefit from our investment is the logic behind the quid pro quo case, then we invested far more than what we have derived from our investment,” the group and the director said, asserting that the CBI’s case defied logic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/quash-cbi-case-hetero-drugs-to-hc/articleshow/84077043.cms||---

Nirosha, he said, was also residing in a rental house along with her husband and two children. “She was working as a tailor in Prem’s vest unit. The two fell in love and developed an illicit affair. When both the family members came to know about the relationship, they advised the two against continuing the same.” Meanwhile, the duo consumed poison at the vest manufacturing unit on Thursday night. “Nirosha had told her husband that she was having night shift.

These setups have placed their individual orders of the vaccines collectively amounting to over 1.30 lakh doses through CoWIN in the last 48 hours alone. These hospitals were struggling to procure the vaccine doses from the manufacturers and even tried ingenious methods like placing a collective order as unlike big corporate hospitals their independent orders were too small to get the attention or priority. “Thirty small hospitals have placed their order through Co-WIN in the last 48 hours so far. More are likely to do the same in the days to come. Those who have placed the orders are waiting for the approval and payment gateway to open. It is learned that they (hospitals) need to pay within the three days of placing the orders,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India (HBI), Pune branch — an association of small hospitals. A total of 142 small hospitals and nursing homes are set to begin Covid vaccination on their premises in the days to come. For smoother vaccination, PMC health officials started conducting zone-wise training of the hospitals’ staff from June 23. “The training is mainly about how to conduct the inoculation drive, which is primarily a technology-driven process. With this, the number of Covid Vaccination Centre (CVC)s in the PMC has gone up to 415. Of them, 200 are currently actively involved in vaccination,” said PMC’s Covid vaccination chief Vaishali Jadhav. Of 415, 188 are PMC-run CVCs and 10 are state-run CVCs. With the existing 75 CVCs at private hospitals and an additional 142 small nursing homes/hospitals that have been allowed to function as CVCs from July 1, the number of CVCs at private hospitals across the PMC limits has gone up to 217, Jadhav said. “The objective is to ensure that citizens have quite a few CVCs available both at private and public settings in their neighbourhood,” she said. These small setups have the permission to hold 100 to 200 vaccinations per day. “All of them intend to keep replenishing their stocks by furnishing the order intermittently,” Patil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/centres-move-kindles-hope-for-small-hosps-to-begin-inoculation/articleshow/84077052.cms||Umesh Isalkar

He filed an intervention application to say that she ought to have disclosed a defamation complaint which he filed against her as a magistrate had summoned her in that case before it. Akhtar, 75, said he was seeking to place on record certain facts for consideration of the court. He said that during hearing of her plea for permission to renew her passport that expires in September, her counsel Rizwan Siddiquee in response to a query had, on instructions, submitted that “no criminal cases are pending” against her in any court arising out of two FIR which she had challenged. The HC had accepted the statement. She had moved the HC as she said the regional passport office had raised queries over two FIRs against her, one allegedly for sedition offence at Bandra police station, filed by Munawar Ali over her social media posts and the other at Khar police station filed by Ashish Kaul, author of the book Didda: The Warrior Queen of Kashmir, over alleged copyright infringement. Akhtar said the HC order records that the Centre’s counsel had said if Kangana’s counsel “is ready to make a statement that no criminal case is pending against the petitioner…the Passport Authority is ready to consider the application for renewal of passport, in accordance with Passport Act, rules, procedure, expeditiously.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-akhtar-says-kanganas-no-fir-claim-to-renew-passport-false/articleshow/84082667.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Only 30% cremations done with eco-friendly options in 14 months: Nagpur||NAGPUR: A majority of families in the city still opt for traditional firewood cremations over eco-friendly last rites. Of the 16 crematoriums in the city, six have LPG, diesel and briquette facility for performing the last rites. Data procured from Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) revealed that the city used 73.85 lakh kg firewood for cremations from April 1, 2020 to May 31, 2021. The data also points towards lack of awareness about the eco-friendly cremation as only 30% opted for it. In the last 14 months, 35,568 bodies were cremated at 15 ghats. Firewood was used to cremate 24,615 bodies while briquettes were preferred for 7,377 last rites. The response to LPG and diesel cremation was very poor. Only 3,576 bodies were cremated by using these eco-friendly facilities. Data also showed that from April this year, the NMC had started providing firewood too free of cost. Earlier, the civic body used to charge Rs2,500 for providing 300kg firewood. Till the time the civic body charged for firewood, people preferred briquettes or LPG and diesel for cremation. This can be gauged from the fact that 6,375 last rites were performed in April using firewood while eco-friendly options were used for 2,327 cremations. In May, 3,218 bodies were cremated using firewood and 1,282 through eco-friendly methods. Expressed their concern, environmental activists stated that Nagpur being a developing city, it is fast losing its green cover. “Hence, cremation by agro briquettes or electric or CNG will definitely help in preserving greenery,” said green crusder and team lead Green Vigil Foundation, Surbhi Jaiswal. Though agro briquettes contribute to air pollution, they have less carbon as well as ash content. “Moreover, it is a waste which is getting utilized. Otherwise, it would have caused other environmental issues,” she said. “However, one need to address the religious faith which is highly in favour of cremation by firewood. NMC is spending on procuring wood as well as briquettes, hence either both should be available free of cost at crematoriums or both should be charged,” said Jaiswal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/only-30-cremations-done-with-eco-friendly-options-in-14-months/articleshow/84077056.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Kochi||Kerala has highest dowry inflation in country, says World Bank blog||NEW DELHI: Christians and Sikhs have shown a sharp increase in dowry leading to higher average dowries than Hindus and Muslims while average net dowry in Muslim marriages is only slightly lower than among Hindus and has remained stable, a study of about 40,000 marriages that took place in rural India between 1960 and 2008 has shown. The analysis is based on data from 2006 REDS—the most recent source of dowry data for India—covering 17 states that contain about 96% of India’s population, according to a blog on the World Bank site. The blog focuses on rural India, where it says dowry remains a widespread phenomenon despite being illegal since 1961. According to the 2006 Rural Economic and Demographic Survey (REDS), dowry was paid in 95% of marriages during 1960-2008, it said. “Dowry is positively correlated with higher caste status and the caste hierarchy of dowry payments has not changed over time. Upper caste marriages have the highest dowries, followed by Other Backward Classes (OBCs), Scheduled Castes (SCs), and Scheduled Tribes (STs),” according to the blog titled Evolution of Dowry in rural India: 1960-2008 written by S. Anukriti, Nishith Prakash and Sungoh Kwon. It said that although the trend in average dowry is flat at the national level, there were substantial differences across states over time. The authors said that Kerala displayed stark and persistent dowry inflation since the 1970s and has the highest average dowry in recent years. Other states with inflationary trends are Haryana, Punjab, and Gujarat. “Given Kerala’s religious composition—26% Muslims, 18% Christians, and 55% Hindus—this trend is compatible with the differential trends by religion described earlier. Similarly, the inflationary trend in Punjab—a majority Sikh state—is also consistent with the rise in Sikh dowries. On the other hand, average dowry decreased in Odisha, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra,” according to the blog. It said that average net dowry has been stable over time with some inflation before 1975 and after 2000. “The flow of payments in the opposite direction, that is, from the groom to the bride, is also positive throughout, but substantially smaller. While on average, a groom’s family spends about Rs. 5,000 (in real terms) on gifts to the bride’s family, gifts from the bride’s family cost seven times more, that is, about Rs. 32,000, implying an average real net dowry of Rs. 27,000,” according to the blog. It said that the proportion of marriages with a negative net dowry, that is, where the groom’s family paid more to the bride’s family than the other way around, is non-zero, but quite small. “Most marriages involved positive net dowry payments to the groom’s family. As per capita incomes have risen in India during our study period, these stable trends imply that, on average, dowry as a share of household income has gradually declined at the national level,” the blog added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-has-highest-dowry-inflation-in-country-says-world-bank-blog/articleshow/84077201.cms||---
---||Meerut||Meerut: Body of man who died of Covid forgotten in mortuary, cremated after 75 days||MEERUT: The body of Naresh, 29, who died due to Covid-19, lay unclaimed in a mortuary for 75 days. On Friday, his wife, who had allegedly been asked to pay up if she wanted his body, finally found closure as he was cremated by the Hapur administration over two and a half months after he died. Naresh had tested positive on April 10, been taken to a local hospital in Hapur and then, given the severity of his case, referred to the Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College (LLRMMC) in Meerut. When he didn’t make it, his wife Gudiya, 27, hurried the 700-odd km from Basti, where she lived with their two kids, to Meerut to take her husband’s body. “But the doctors there refused, asked for Rs 15,000 and said they would cremate the body themselves if I didn’t pay up. I didn’t have that kind of money. What could I do? I went back,” she said. The bribery allegation will now be investigated. Meerut DM K Balaji said, “I have set up an inquiry.” The hospital dismissed any part in this. “The patient was accompanied by his brother, Vijay. When the patient died on April 15, we called up the number Vijay had given us. It was switched off,” Dr Vidit Dikshit, who oversees the disposal of bodies at the hospital, said. “The allegation that money was demanded is false. Amid the high mortality rate of the second wave, how could we have kept the body here? We didn’t have enough space. We moved the body to Hapur when no one came forward to claim it.” In Hapur, Dr Dinesh Khatri, head of the primary health centre there, said they had been trying to “trace” the family since then. “The chief medical officer of Hapur was informed that no one had claimed the body. It was brought here and kept at the mortuary in GS College. After that, we tried to trace the family. Later, we sought help from police and the phone number that had been given was put under surveillance,” he added. Gudiya, meanwhile, assumed there was nothing more she could do. “I thought the body must have been cremated.” She tried to put the tragedy behind her and look after her children. All that while, for two and a half months, Naresh’s body was lying unclaimed in the mortuary. The Hapur district administration said the time was spent looking for his family. “When we could not access the family on the phone, we asked police to visit the mohalla where they stayed. Someone there got cops in touch with the wife. She was in Basti district,” Hapur DM Anuj Singh said. “She came to Hapur for his last rites.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/body-of-man-who-died-of-covid-forgotten-in-mortuary-cremated-after-75-days/articleshow/84075014.cms||Sandeep Rai

The incident happened between April 9, 2010, and April 21, this year. The FIR was registered after property owner Saurabh Balwadkar (25) approached city police commissioner Amitabh Gupta to take action against the suspects. The Balwadkar family had entered into an agreement to sell their property to one of the suspects for Rs 3 lakh per guntha, collectively valued at over Rs 2 crore. Balwadkar in his FIR said the suspect paid Rs 15 lakh by cheque and promised to pay the balance at the earliest but did not do so. Inspector Balaji Pandhare from the anti-extortion cell said, “The family made repeated appeals to the suspect to pay the balance amount.

According to the modified UAS Rules, it is prohibited from flying in strategic and sensitive location, including near airports, defence airports, border areas, military installations/facilities and areas earmarked as strategic locations/vital installations by the ministry of home affairs. “Operator of drones are required to take proper permission from regulatory authorities like DGCA/MHA/Defence/IAF/DoT/BCAS/AAI, local police administration before operation of drone. Flying of any kind of drone without permission shall be punishable offence under relevant IPC sections according to the severity of offence,” said the order by Jaipur Airport Director J S Balhara. Officials claimed that in the coming days, a meeting of airport officials along with the state government and police personnel will be held to discuss the flying of drones as well as necessary measures that need to be taken to ensure that there is no security breach. This order reissued on Friday was to sensitise the public about the rules regarding operations of drones after the Jammu episode. In Rajasthan, since 2019, drones were regularly spotted in the border districts around the International Border and sources claimed that in the same year, there were at least five instances when unmanned aerial vehicles were spotted by the security forces and in a few cases were shot down as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-flying-of-drones-within-50km-radius-of-city-airport/articleshow/84079155.cms||---

The ED is acting as per the HC directives pertaining to financial embezzlement. There’s no political motive or interest of BJP in this episode,” he told the media at Nagpur airport. Fadnavis also defended state BJP president Chandrakant Patil’s letter to home minister Amit Shah demanding a CBI probe into dismissed inspector Sachin Waze’s letter to Pawar and transport minister Anil Parab. “It’s the job of the opposition to demand an inquiry into such allegations. There’s nothing wrong with it. We’ve never labelled anyone a criminal or demanded that they should be sent behind bars.” The former CM was responding to Pawar’s statement on the ED attaching assets of over Rs65 crore linked to a firm controlled by him in connection with the MSCB scam. He had said that “many such inquiries were conducted in the past and nothing substantial was found”. Speaking on the news of the government issuing notification for gathering empirical data of OBCs in state, the LOP said it was a welcome move as the Supreme Court order of December 13, 2019, had very categorically stated that for granting quota it needed empirical data to be supplied by the State Backward Classes Commission from all 36 districts. “The MVA constituents, however, continued to point fingers towards the Centre while shying away from its own responsibility of collecting the data. The SC needs empirical data and not the census. Had the government acted earlier, we could have got the reservation back.” Box MVA govt is killing democracy Flaying CM Uddhav Thackeray’s government for limiting the Maharashtra assembly’s monsoon session to just two days, Fadnavis charged it with murdering democracy by not allowing the opposition to raise issues. “As we had boycotted the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) meeting after a two-day session was proposed, we came to know that the government isn’t allowing legislators to use the unstarred questions, calling attention motions and discussions to raise issues pertaining to the people. It has never happened in the legislature’s history. Even if those weren’t discussed in the houses, their starred answers were provided.” He added the MVA government didn’t want the opposition to talk, and they knew that in supplementary demands the opposition wouldn’t be getting much time to raise the issues. “We will take help from the media to raise the issues, if we’re not allowed to talk inside the legislature.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ed-probe-into-ajit-pawar-by-hc-orders-bjp-has-no-role-fadnavis/articleshow/84077062.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

An airport official said barring five days in June, vaccines were transported on all days of the month from the facility. The numbers were expected to swell as the cargo hold would shift to a plot owned by the Indian Air Force this month, the official added. “The number of vaccines transported from the airport in June is 39% higher than those in May, when 2.95 crore doses were transported,” an official said. “On June 30, SpiceJet-operated freighter transported 19.75 lakh doses to Patna, Vijaywada and Guwahati. We are hoping the cargo hold area gets shifted to the new spot soon so the airport can facilitate better transportation of the doses,” another airport official said.

Following a review meeting by chief minister Ashok Gehlot, the food and civil supplies department had directed all the district supplies officers (DSOs) to complete the process of clearing 3.87 lakh pending applications — received before closing of the process of registration on May 18, 2020 — for adding new names of beneficiaries to the National Food Security Act. It also directed the officials to clear the pendency of 882 complaints received on the Sampark portal. Of the 3.87 pending applications, 3.05 lakh have been received through E-mitra and 82,000 applications were received by the SDMs (sub-divisional magistrates). “Since we don’t have the capacity to add more names, we are not opening the registration on the portal now,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/50l-applications-likely-if-food-portal-reopens/articleshow/84079168.cms||---

National Green Tribunal had earlier ordered for developing DEPs across the country for seven thematic areas—waste management, water quality management, ambient air quality, domestic sewage, industrial wastewater, mining activity and noise pollution. For waste management, the plan should be for separate kinds of waste—solid waste, biomedical waste, construction and demolition (C&D) waste, hazardous waste, electronic waste (e-waste) and plastic waste. DEP should also identify agencies responsible, requirement of infrastructure facilities for sewage treatment, waste management, monitoring environmental quality, etc. CPCB in a report submitted to the green tribunal stated that out of 11 districts in the capital, nine districts—Central, East, New Delhi, North, Shahdara, South Delhi, South-East, South-West and West—have prepared the DEP. In Delhi, South-West district has been selected as a model district for DEP while other districts will have to implement the same model. For the implementation of DEP, two monitoring committees have been constituted in the capital. The green tribunal had earlier ordered every state government to prepare State Environment Plan based on District Environment Plan.

OPD services at government hospitals remained suspended. State president of Rural Medical Officers’ Association Dr Depinder Singh of Khanna said, “The Joint Punjab Government Doctors’ Coordination Committee (JPDCC), led by Punjab Civil Medical Services Association (PCMSA), had observed a strike on Thursday in its struggle to save public healthcare system by defending non-practicing allowance (NPA). Dr Gurmail Ankhi, president of PCMSA, Bathinda, was transferred in the process. To oppose the victimisation, PCMSA along with JPDCC had decided to continue the strike on Friday, too. A delegation will meet the health minister regarding the issue.” On Friday, he added, the services that were disrupted included OPDs, online consultation like e-Sanjeevani, elective surgeries, videoconferences, webinars, UDID camps, Ayushman, medico-legal examination of accused and routine medico-legal work. “Covid services, IPDs (in patient door), emergency surgeries, among others, were not affected,” he said. Meanwhile, doctors held a protest at civil hospital in support of their demands. President of Punjab Civil Medical Service for civil hospital Dr Kulwant Singh said, “We also carried posters of ‘I am Dr Gurmail Singh’ to protest his transfer.” Patients suffered due to the unavailability of doctors at OPD services. “I didn’t know that doctors are on strike. I came from Haibowal for a consultation and now I am returning home,” said Buta Singh, an elderly man. Pregnant women who went to government hospitals for a check-up also bore the brunt of the stir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/doctors-strike-on-day-2-hassles-patients/articleshow/84075000.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Sugar unit was bought legally, says Ajit Pawar||MUMBAI: A day after the Enforcement Directorate attached the properties of a Satara-based sugar factory which has been linked to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, the latter said the auction process for the purchase of the unit was legal and as per directives of the Bombay High Court. “We have not received any communication from the ED…the (company’s) board of directors have no role in the transactions. I am told they will approach the competent authority against the ED decision,’’ Pawar told mediapersons in Pune. According to ED, a company named Sparkling Soil Pvt Ltd controls Guru Commodity Services which bought the sugar mill and leased it to Jarandeshwar Sugar Mills which runs the unit. Sparkling Soil is a “related company” to Ajit Pawar and his wife Sunetra Pawar, the agency said. Following a Bombay high court order, Pawar said the unit was bought in an auction and when it failed to revive it, it was purchased by his relative Rajendra Ghadge in compliance with the rules. “In fact, he took a loan of Rs 300-400 crore to operate the loss-making unit…in the past, it was probed by CID and ACB, they drew a blank,” Pawar said. Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat reacted sarcastically to the ED action: “We are not surprised, ED is now part of our life,’’ he said. NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said the party was not surprised by the action. “In our opinion, ED is defaming NCP and its leaders, we are prepared for a long legal battle. We will continue to attack the NDA government for its anti-democratic and anti-people policies,’’ Malik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sugar-unit-was-bought-legally-says-ajit-pawar/articleshow/84082672.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Besides night bazaars, adventure and water sports tourism will be a key part of the strategy to attract tourists and revive the sector, said Nishant Jain, director tourism in the meeting. Last year, the district administration and the tourism department worked in collaboration to create paragliding activities in Rajasamand lake. Now, in a week’s time, water sports activities are going to kick off there. “Our focus is now on creating experiences, and activity-tourism plays a big part in that. Rajasamand is one example. We want to have night bazaars as well in cities that attract large number of tourists. We have told our officials at district levels to identify such themes so that along with the district administration, we can undertake the initiatives,” said Jain. Jain said tourists don’t mind visiting the same place multiple times if there are activities. “With experiential tourism, we will not only reach out to a bigger base of travelers but also attract repeat tourists,” added Jain. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-tourism-to-add-more-activity-based-experiences/articleshow/84079183.cms||---

These tankers, which will be paid Rs 360 per trip, would be deployed to supply potable water in non-network areas of the city. Currently, the NMC is supplying water through 194 tankers. Prakash Bhoyar-headed NMC’s standing committee approved the civic administration’s proposal to this effect on Friday. Bhoyar said until recently, the NMC has paid Rs386 per trip per tanker. “But now due to competition among tanker providers, the rate has come down to Rs360 even after diesel price hikes,” he pointed out. NMC will pay Rs360 per tanker for one year and Rs386 per trip for the second year, said Bhoyar. The standing panel also gave its green signal to entrust the Rs31.54 crore work of strengthening, improvement and beautification of Gandhisagar to a private firm. Other proposals including extension to IT Craft company for two years, extension of two months for 40 drivers too were cleared. However, the panel rejected the request of estate and project consultative committee chairman for providing a four-wheeler for official work in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-to-hire-265-tankers-for-water-supply/articleshow/84077068.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Link section, subway and rotary added to longest flyover plan||NAGPUR: Proposed four years ago, city’s longest flyover that will connect Indora Chowk in North Nagpur with Shitlamata Chowk in South Nagpur after passing through Mahal in Central Nagpur is likely to be become a reality. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has completed its design, detailed project report (DPR) and taken NOCs from Indian Railways and MahaMetro. The NHAI has added a link flyover, rotary at Ashok Chowk and subway at Indora Chowk in the project besides from few more minor changes. TOI was the first to report about the project on April 26, 2017. City MP and Union minister Nitin Gadkari had approved the project which will cost Rs526 crore. It will be a three-lane flyover with width of 12 metre. A team of NHAI gave presentation to guardian minister Nitin Raut, also MLA from North Nagpur, on Friday. Raut directed the NHAI officials to construct new building for proposed demolition of eye OPD at Daga Maternity Hospital. The NHAI has proposed to acquire 1,700 sq mt area of Daga Hospital. Raut also gave directives to accommodate compensation and rehabilitation of vendors and shops at Indora Chowk and between Chamar Nullah and Kamal Chowk. NHAI deputy general manager Samay Nikose told TOI, “Subway will be constructed at Indora Chowk for easy access to flyover from Jaripatka side and vice-versa. Subway will of low height of 3.5 metre. Double-decker flyover of Metro Rail and the proposed flyover are passing through Indora Chowk, so subway was added,” he said. Total length of the flyover will be 7.3km which will be longest in the city. In earlier design, the new flyover was to end at Sakkardara flyover on Umred Road. There was no extension beyond the Sakkardara flyover. Nikose said, “Now, there will be another flyover between Bhande Plot Chowk and Shitlamata Mandir Chowk.” Nikose said entry and exit ramps will be at six locations — Kamal Chowk, Pachpaoli ROB, Daga Hospital, Ashok Chowk, Sakkardara Chowk and Shitlamata Mandir Chowk. “Existing railway overbridge (ROB) at Pachpaoli will be replaced with new one. Near Kamal Chowk, the flyover section coming from Pachpaoli side will extend for 300 metre and end before Chamar nullah,” he said. The deputy GM further said that Ashok Chowk on Bhandara road is a five-way junction, so there will be a rotary. “Existing flyover at Sakkardara will be incorporated in the project,” he said. It will be the first rotary of the city if the project is completed before the Pardi flyover project. The proposed flyover will be at first level and Metro Rail at second level at Agrasen Chowk on Central Avenue. ---------------------------------- ABOUT THE PROJECT * Cost | Rs 526 crore * Three-lane flyover with width of 12 metre * Low height subway of 3.5 metre at Indora chowk * Road below flyover and junction will be improved * Existing Pachpaoli RoB to be replaced with new * Flyover at first level and Metro Rail at 2nd level at Agrasen Chowk on Central Avenue * Rotary with pilon, up and down ramps at Ashok Chowk *1,700 sq mt area of Daga Hospital to be acquired * Up and down ramps at Kamal Chowk, Pachpaoli, Daga Hospital, Ashok chowk, Sakkardara Chowk and Shitlamata Mandir Chowk||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/link-section-subway-and-rotary-added-to-longest-flyover-plan/articleshow/84077094.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Pawar had on Thursday suggested that there should be dialogue between the Centre and farmers’ unions and the central government should take a lead to end the deadlock. Reacting to his remarks, Tomar said he would like to tell him that the Centre agreed to what he said and had, in fact, held 11 rounds of talks with farmers with “this mindset only”. “I welcome his stand,” Tomar told ANI. He added, “The central government hopes this matter will be resolved through discussions and the agitation ends and all farmers return to their homes. The government is willing to reconsider with an open mind the issues that seem problematic.” The government has maintained this view ever since it offered to put implementation of laws on hold for 18 months and resolve the issue through talks in January.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/welcome-pawar-stand-on-farm-laws-narendra-singh-tomar/articleshow/84083699.cms||---

He said there would be no need for power cuts or for the CM to change office timings if “we act in the right direction”. Sidhu’s thread of nine tweets comes at a time when opposition parties are gunning for the Congress government over long power outages in the state on Wednesday and Thursday. His suggestions came even as he himself has a pending electricity bill of Rs 8.6 lakh to pay to the Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd for his residence in Amritsar. According to PSPCL’s website, the cash and cheque payment due date is July 2. Meanwhile, Sidhu, who has stopped criticising Amarinder after he met a Congress panel last month, tweeted on Friday morning about the “truth of power costs, cuts, power purchase agreements and how to give free and 24-hour power to the people of Punjab.” While Sidhu gave the CM more advice on power costs, BSP functionary Gurbax Singh Shergill, a former SDO of PSPCL, said Sidhu should have cleared his electricity bill as a priority before offering advice on how to resolve the electricity crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-need-for-cuts-now-sidhu-advises-cm-on-power-woes/articleshow/84083681.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Kanhargaon is only on paper as no staff to man sanctuary||NAGPUR: Even after three months it was notified, the 270sqkm Kanhargaon wildlife sanctuary in Central Chanda forest division remains only on paper. The sanctuary was notified on April 5, 2021, after several hassles, evidently to create more space for tigers and curb man-animal conflict. The decision was taken by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray at the state wildlife board meeting held on December 4, 2020 to give leeway to the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) to continue logging operations. The final notification was issued on April 5. Of the 270sqkm, nearly 252sqkm area that was included in the sanctuary belonged to FDCM while 18sqkm was part of the Central Chanda forest division. The sanctuary is still under the administrative control of FDCM. Though felling operations have stopped and the commercial corporation has transported felled timber, lack of staff and non-compensation of forest area lost for the carving out the sanctuary seem to be the bone of contention. Chandrapur chief conservator of forest (CCF) NR Praveen said, “Though reorganization of staff is an issue, things are being sorted out. We have no option but to keep possession of the sanctuary with FDCM as of now otherwise there will be a vacuum. We don’t have excess staff as earlier we have already diverted the surplus 18 forest guards from Chandrapur to Tadoba and Bamboo Research Training Centre (BRTC).” Kanhargaon needs at least 3 RFOs, 6 foresters, and 30 forest guards. “The reorganization proposal is pending with the state government. We have also signed an MoU with Pune-based NGO Sevak, an association of retired forest officers, to prepare the management plan of Kanhargaon. The preparation of the plan is in progress,” said Praveen. The NGO has been paid Rs 3.5 lakh to prepare the management plan. State wildlife board member Kishor Rithe, who played a key role in the formation of the sanctuary, said, “Not handing over the administrative control to the wildlife wing defeats the very purpose of declaring Kanhargaon a sanctuary, which is a stepping stone for tigers. It calls for immediate intervention of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who took a bold decision to declare it a sanctuary on December 4 last year.” Though FDCM acting regional manager Kushagra Pathak did not respond to calls by TOI, sources said the corporation wants 286 sqkm reserve forest area in lieu of the area lost for the sanctuary. Of this, 30sqkm is in Dhaba and Kothari ranges under Central Chanda. However, Central Chanda has refused to part with the area in question as 96% of its revenue through logging operations comes from here. On April 5, Thackeray held a review meeting with the FDCM in which he had asked the corporation to develop waste and barren lands into green zones. The FDCM has demanded over 250 sqkm (25,000 hectares) productive forest in Allapalli division in Gadchiroli in lieu of the area handed over for Kanhargaon. The FDCM also demanded absorbtion of van majoors from the area. No decision has been taken yet. A LONG WAY TO GO * In April 2013, original proposal consisted of 370 sqkm * Proposal included 58 sqkm area of Kothari range in Central Chanda and 312 sqkm area of FDCM * Amid oppositions, a curtailed proposal of 265 sqkm was sent to the government on June 21, 2014 * On December 5, 2018, ex-CM Devendra Fadnavis agreed in principle to declare it a sanctuary but it never materialized due to opposition within * Uddhav Thackeray finally cleared 269sqkm proposal in December 2020 * TATR key link to Kanhargaon, Chapralai, Kawal, and Tipeshwar * A compact block and dispersing population from Tadoba makes the area rich in tigers * A natural habitat for many wild animals * Apart from tigers, other wildlife includes leopard, jungle cat, jackal, fox, deer, sambar, barking deer, blue bull, wild boar, sloth bear, wild dogs & gaurs||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/kanhargaon-is-only-on-paper-as-no-staff-to-man-sanctuary/articleshow/84077154.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The FIR was registered after a court order because, the woman said, police “didn’t file” the case. Suresh Rathore, 59, represents the Jwalapur constituency in the assembly. “I wanted help for public works in my area, for which I had gone to see the MLA. I was waiting inside. He cast indecent glances at me. He raped me 2-3 times. When I tried to stop him, he threatened me … I want justice,” the woman said in a video. Over a month ago, Rathore had complained that the woman, her husband and three other men had been blackmailing him with an “obscene” video. “She was arrested on May 25,” Rathore told TOI. After getting bail a week later, the woman tried to file a complaint against Rathore. The police, she said, did not. She approached the local court, seeking an order to file a case. The order came through. “An FIR has been registered against MLA Suresh Rathore after a court order under sections 376 (rape), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the IPC,” Haridwar SSP Senthil Avoodai Krishna Raj S told TOI. Rathore dismissed it all as political warfare. “It is a conspiracy hatched by an opposition leader with help from a woman,” he said. “I respected the court order and was ready to face inquiry in the case.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/after-court-order-bjp-mla-from-haridwar-booked-for-raping-party-worker/articleshow/84075084.cms||MS Nawaz

Police claimed that Ravindra Sangadiya died due to unknown reasons. Sangadiya and his friend Nikhil Prajapati, who were allegedly drunk, had a fight over getting a free drinking water bottle for purchase of Rs 500 worth petrol, police said. An offence of murder was lodged against unidentified persons and attempts are being made to identify those involved in attacking Sangadiya. The incident was captured in CCTV cameras at the petrol pump. The complaint was lodged by the victim’s Hitendra. “The deceased has no injury marks on the body. Only postmortem will ascertain the exact cause,” said an official in Khatodara police station. Sangadiya and his colleague Nikhil Prajapati, both employees in an FMCG delivery van, went to Shree Sarvodaya Petroleum at around 9.42 pm. “The duo entered into an argument with the petrol pump staff over a free water bottle and Sangadiya started using abusive language and slapped one of the staffers. One of the pump attendants pushed and slapped him,” said police. Meanwhile, a police control room van on patrol spotted the tussle and arrived to inquire. Police found both Sangadiya and Prajapati were drunk and took them to the police station. Cops were completing formalities to arrest the duo and called family members of both.  “I was in the police station campus when someone informed me that Ravindra collapsed. I too went to check and found him unconscious.

BSL’s chief of communication Manikant Dhan said, “BSL had supplied 7,375 MT of liquid medical oxygen to 11 states when the second wave of the pandemic was at its peak in May. But now the demand has gone down and last month, BSL had to supply only 601MT of oxygen to three states -- Bihar (105 MT), Uttar Pradesh (210 MT) and Madhya Pradesh (80 MT).” Upon directives of the Union ministry of steel, all the five units of Steel Authority of India Limited had diverted their liquid oxygen for medical use. BSL had to supply oxygen to Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Of the 11 states, the most amount of oxygen was supplied to UP (5,381 MT) through special trains. Bihar received 4,092 MT, Madhya Pradesh required 2,203 MT, Punjab 1,400 MT and West Bengal got 1,099 MT. Oxygen from the BSL plant was dispatched daily through rail and road. Several cryogenic tankers were airlifted by Indian Air Force’s cargo planes from Ranchi’s Birsa Munda International Airport.

Zoo director Y K Das welcomed the first batch of visitors with bouquets. For many, the newly introduced double riding bicycles were an added attraction. “The visitors have been mandated to wear masks and use hand sanitizers at all times. Social distancing has to be maintained as well,” Das told TOI. Even though the state government has allowed the assembly of 50 people at a given time in a public place, the park management mandated that not more than 25 people will be allowed in at once. The zoo was shut for the most of last year as Jharkhand emerged from the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. It opened on March 1 this year but was closed in mid-April as Covid-19 cases began to rise in the state. Das said nearly 60% of the zoo’s workforce, which consists of cage-keepers, gardeners, cook and others, have already been vaccinated. “Anti-viral drugs are being sprayed at the animal and bird enclosures every day. The Schedule-1 animals, which are ageing, are being made to go through health check-ups once a month,” Das said. Last month, following the death of a 10-year-old tiger named Shiva from Covid-like symptoms, the park management had collected nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples of 11 more big cats, which included six tigers, three lions, one leopard and one black panther and sent them to IVRI in Bareilly for Covid-19 RT-PCR tests. All of the 11 big cats tested negative for Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ranchi-zoo-reopens-for-visitors-after-85-days/articleshow/84076609.cms||Dhritiman Ray

A division bench of Chief Justice Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad said the state government, being aware that the high court took up the suo motu PIL in the case and closely monitoring it, should have informed the court about the matter. The bench then summoned former CID ADGP Anil Palta and the investigating officer of the case to appear online in the case on the next date of hearing. The bench has also ordered the investigating officer of the case to furnish the records and documents of the case for the court’s perusal. Meanwhile, advocate general Rajiv Ranjan pleaded before the bench saying that all steps have been taken in compliance with the directions passed by the court from time to time. Notably, the high court had taken cognizance of news reports highlighting the illegal sale and black marketing of Remdevisir and other drugs during the peak of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and took up the PIL. The court was not happy with the tardy pace of investigation by the police and had ordered the investigation to be done by the CID which was headed by Palta. Subsequently, Palta was transferred by the state government and is now ADGP (railways).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/high-court-pulls-up-state-govt-in-remdesivir-black-marketing-case/articleshow/84076645.cms||---

Siddharth Tripathi, who has worked in the state bureaucracy for several years now, was perturbed by a survey which revealed that 53 wards under the Ranchi Municipal Corporation’s limits have lost around 95% greenery in the last 15 years, which prompted him to take up the initiative. Tripathi said, “When I saw the satellite map of Ranchi a year ago I was shocked to see the depletion of greeneries. As the Forest Survey of India does not conduct a survey for municipal limits, I, along with a few experts, decided to do one on my own to calculate the loss. We took the help of Geographic Information System and analysed the data between 2004 and the ongoing year and we were shocked to find that in most of the wards the greenery has shrunk between 50% and 95%.” He added, “Today, when you travel from Albert Ekka Chowk to the over-bridge on Main road you cannot even find a single tree. But in the 2000s, Ranchi used to be covered with trees, as per the data we studied. Now, a few wards are left with a mere 10% of greenery. For instance, the satellite maps of areas like Lalpur, Albert Ekka Chowk and Sadar Hospital showed that these areas used to be lush green during 2004 but now they don’t have trees.” When asked about the probable reasons behind the depletion of greenery, Tripathi said: “We came across several factors which include the rapid urbanization without proper planning for open spaces and commercialization of private lands, among others. To put it in a nutshell, we can say that greenery was sacrificed in the last-one- and-a-half decade at the behest urbanisation.” In a bid to encourage more and more people to participate in his campaign, Tripathi has held several rounds of discussions with vice-chancellors, principals of both schools and colleges, trade bodies, doctors’ associations and NGOs like Rotary and Lions International and according to him, everyone has decided to take part in it. “We have constituted a core committee for all the 53 wards consisting of ward members. From July 4, we will conduct meetings every Sunday and in the first phase, we will plant saplings at places like schools, colleges, residential buildings and parks,” Tripathi said, adding, “Citizens’ participation is one of the key elements of this campaign and the core committee has decided to run it for the next five years.” “We aren’t asking for any support from the government as people are ready to make their city green by themselves. I have been told during my earlier meetings that everyone wants their city to be green it’s just that they do not know how to do it. I hope with everyone’s participation, we will be able to make Ranchi green again,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ifs-officer-in-city-dons-environmentalists-hat-starts-green-campaign/articleshow/84076456.cms||---

BSL’s chief of communication Manikant Dhan said, “BSL had supplied 7,375 MT of liquid medical oxygen to 11 states when the second wave of the pandemic was at its peak in May. But now the demand has gone down and last month, BSL had to supply only 601MT of oxygen to three states -- Bihar (105 MT), Uttar Pradesh (210 MT) and Madhya Pradesh (80 MT).” Upon directives of the Union ministry of steel, all the five units of Steel Authority of India Limited had diverted their liquid oxygen for medical use. BSL had to supply oxygen to Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Of the 11 states, the most amount of oxygen was supplied to UP (5,381 MT) through special trains. Bihar received 4,092 MT, Madhya Pradesh required 2,203 MT, Punjab 1,400 MT and West Bengal got 1,099 MT. Oxygen from the BSL plant was dispatched daily through rail and road. Several cryogenic tankers were airlifted by Indian Air Force’s cargo planes from Ranchi’s Birsa Munda International Airport. The PSU was also providing free oxygen to government and private hospitals in Bokaro.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/as-demand-drops-bsl-curtails-o2-supply-to-11-states/articleshow/84087778.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

IndiGo and SpiceJet had suspended operation in April and May, a month after they had started operating from the airport for want of passengers. Only state-run Air India was operating from Rajkot airport amid the pandemic, that too, only for four days in a week to Mumbai and Delhi. The highest air traffic from Rajkot airport is for Mumbai followed by Delhi. According to airport authority sources, IndiGo has announced that it’s scheduled to start operation for Mumbai and Delhi from July 12. The airline will operate four flights in a week to Mumbai and three to Delhi. According to sources, SpiceJet is also set to start its operation from Rajkot airport gradually from July 15. Though the airline is yet to announce its schedule, the airline is likely to resume its operation for Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Delhi and Goa. According to sources, in one month’s operation the operator had got good traffic for Bengaluru and Hyderabad and because of which they are interested in resuming operation. Confirming this move, Rajkot airport director Diganta Borah said, “Both private operators are resuming operation from Rajkot airport and hopefully, by the end of July all the schedules will be set.” Rajkot airport recently got permission for cargo handling. However, because of the Covid situation, this service didn’t pick up. It’s expected that cargo movement will also pick up once airlines resume operation. This cargo handling service was started to provide extra income to airlines specially when there are less passengers. Rajkot being the commercial capital of Saurashtra, business and industry people of Morbi and Jamnagar are also dependent upon Rajkot for air connectivity to the other parts of the country. The airport sees around four lakh flyers every year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rajkot-air-connectivity-to-resume-from-july-midweek/articleshow/84080060.cms||---

---||India||Covid-19: 'Wrong injection technique could also be leading to clots'||A new study shows that wrong injection technique could be one of the reasons behind clotting following inoculation by adeno virus-based Covid vaccines, which include AstraZeneca, J&J and Sputnik jabs. The incorrect technique could lead to the injection accidentally being given into a blood vessel rather than the muscle. A study done on mice by clinician scientists in Munich University in Germany and a research institute in Italy found this very rare complication of the adenovirus vaccine could be happening due to the vaccine being injected into the blood stream. The preprint posted on bioRxiv.org earlier this week stated that the study highlighted accidental intravenous injection as a potential mechanism for post-vaccination thrombotic thrombocytopenic syndrome (TTS) also called vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). “If the tip of the needle doesn’t reach deep enough in the muscle or if it hits a blood vessel, the vaccine can be directly injected into the bloodstream. This can happen when the skin is pinched up by an inadequately trained health worker. Intra muscular injections are meant to be given without pinching up skin, so that the needle tip reaches the muscle. When the skin is pinched up, the needle tip reaches only the subcutaneous tissue. When that happens, not only is the vaccine not absorbed properly, but rarely it can hit one of the blood vessels that travel through the layer located between skin and muscle which contains a network of blood vessels,” explained Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, a member of IMA’s National Task force for Coronavirus. Following a study in Denmark, Jayadevan had warned in early April of the possibility of faulty injection technique being responsible for some of the rare clotting seen after Covid vaccination. He said people have stopped aspirating or pulling back the plunger of the syringe to check if they hit a blood vessel while giving intra muscular injections. “Aspiration was standard practice during my training days,” he added. The study showed what effects the shot can have in the bloodstream. It cannot be tried out on humans and so was done on mice. When given intra muscularly, it stays localised. When injected into the bloodstream it gets transported to different parts of the body and clots can form anywhere. Clot-formation has been acknowledged as clearly associated, though not commonly associated, with the jab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/wrong-injection-technique-could-also-be-leading-to-clots/articleshow/84083753.cms||---

---||Ludhiana||Punjab: Compulsory weekly off day imposed on more industries||PATIALA: Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd (PSPCL) has decided to enhance the compulsory weekly off day imposed on the Industry in the central, north and west zone also. The restriction would be imposed on industry of the south and border zones will also be imposed from next week. A meeting was held here on Friday under the chairmanship of PSPCL CMD A Venu Prasad and distribution director DPS Grewal, generation director Parmjeet Singh and PSTCL technical director Yogesh Tandon participated. The situation arising out of unprecedented high power demand due to prolonged dry spell even in the first week of July was discussed in detailed. Prasad said various regulatory measures imposed on the industrial consumers had allowed PSPCL to improve power supply to agriculture sector and reduction in power cuts on the domestic sector. However, with each passing day (without rains) the demand was surpassing the relief obtained by these regulatory measures. PSPCL had already taken up the matter with the northern regional dispatch centre in Delhi for the enhancement of transmission capacity allowing more import of power from outside the state immediately. It was also decided to appeal to general and commercial consumers like shopping malls, for judicious use of electricity. All chief engineers and SEs of distribution zones discussed distribution arrangements and clearing the pendency of supply complaints. The officers claimed the power availability and supply situation was quite normal with no further need of imposing power cuts. The CMD highlighted that maximum complaints were pending in Zirakpur, Mohali and Aggarnagar (Ludhiana) area. He appealed to the officers to ensure that all offices under their control keep their ACs switched off. He assured the consumers of sufficient flow of power during paddy/summer season. Prasad said situation may improve as rains were expected this week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/compulsory-weekly-off-day-imposed-on-more-industries/articleshow/84082160.cms||---

Witnessing a considerable growth in its subscription model, primarily in the tier-II cities, the US-based company is planning to introduce more India-focussed content in Prime Video and Amazon Music, its live music streaming app. Speaking at a virtual meet, Amazon India director (Prime) Subbu Palaniappan said that a “huge growth” in prime subscription from tier-II and tier-III markets over the last 18 months has encouraged the e-commerce major to go for more Indian “originals”, many of which have been delayed owing to Covid-induced lockdowns and restrictions. “We are trying to serve different states where language and content-based requirements and preferences are very different from one another. Our goal, even before the pandemic, was to offer regional content. A lot of production work had slowed down during the second wave. We have a good pipeline of originals. We will feature more private music album launches by independent artists and podcasts to rev up the catalogue of Amazon Music,” he said. For the big regional push, the company will also unveil listings and voice-enabled search options in local languages. “Nearly 50,000 local stores and 75,000 SMEs will be active on our platform in local languages,” Palaniappan said. The company claims to have covered 97% of India’s pincodes with its services. According to Amazon India director (Prime), around 65% of customer orders and 85% of new subscribers are coming from tier-II and tier-III towns. Tier-II towns in states like West Bengal (Durgapur, Kharagpur, Howrah, Siliguri) Tamil Nadu (Madurai, Kodaikanal); Karnataka (Mysuru), among others, are the major growth drivers, the company said. In tier-II markets, Amazon will focus on boosting the ecosystem by taking more sellers on board. Besides free and faster deliveries on purchases through its app, Amazon India’s Prime membership offers complimentary access to the Prime Video app, which shows web series, videos, movies and games and Amazon Music. However, in the US, Prime subscriptions are mostly for faster deliveries and early access to deals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/amazon-eyes-local-languages-originals-for-prime-boost/articleshow/84077875.cms||---

The health ministry said on Friday that the decision based on recommendations of National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) empowers pregnant women to make an informed choice on taking the shots. Pregnant women, who opt for vaccination, can take the vaccine at any time during their pregnancy after registration on CoWIN or by walk-in registration. The Centre said studies have shown that Covid-19 infection during pregnancy may result in rapid deterioration of health of women and they were at an increased risk of severe diseases and it could affect the fetus too. “The matter has been examined by domain knowledge experts based on the evidence that indicate that pregnant women are at an increased risk for severe illness from Covid-19 compared to non-pregnant women in case they get infected,” the health ministry’s statement said. Pregnant women with Covid infection are at increased risk of preterm birth and other adverse outcomes, including higher chances of neonatal morbidity. Additionally, the experts have also highlighted preexisting comorbidities, advanced maternal age, and high BMI as factors that could cause severe infection in pregnancy. NTAGI chairperson Dr N K Arora said in a TV interview that compared to the first wave, the chances of pregnant women dying of Covid increased by two to three times during the second wave. Against this backdrop, and based on studies, it was felt that vaccination for this section of the population is critical. He said it has been decided that pregnant women who take the vaccine would be tracked and followup on fetal outcomes would also be done. Arora said the risk of severe side effects like bleeding or blood clots is a probability in 1 out of 10 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-higher-risk-pregnant-women-can-get-vax-now/articleshow/84083782.cms||---

Activists say eligible beneficiaries are being asked to return later in Raichur, Belagavi and Bidar districts. In Raichur, some health workers, without any recorded data of post-vaccination complications, told women that the shot might lead to heavier bleeding and fatigue and they should wait for the periods to end, according to activist Vidhya Patil. “There are no such directions from the government, and women are being administered vaccines,” said Raichur deputy commissioner R Venkatesh Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/menstruating-women-denied-jabs-in-karnataka/articleshow/84083783.cms||Shreyas HS

The state reported 97 deaths and discharged 4,952 people from the Covid-19 registry. At the end of the day, there were 36,707 people under treatment for the viral infection. New cases in erstwhile hotspots of the western region, Coimbatore, Erode, Salem and Tirupur continued to see a decline on Friday. With 486 new cases however, Coimbatore reported the highest number of cases followed by Erode (395), Salem(268) and Tirupur (243). Cases in Madurai dropped from 94 cases on Thursday to 85. But there was a marginal increase in cases in Mayiladuthurai, Ariyalur, Karur, Theni, Tiruvallur and Ramanathapuram compared to Thursday. “Some districts are erratic. They don’t see a steady decline and we don’t know why. Over the next two days, I will visit Cuddalore and Tiruvannamalai districts to review Covid-19 management,” said health minister Ma Subramananian. “There is an overall fall in cases. At least 25 districts in the state have reported cases in double digit. But the fall rate has slowed down. This is why we are asking district authorities not to reduce testing. With more relaxation, people must be careful too,” he said. The state continues to test at least 1.6 lakh samples every day and the positivity has inched close to 3%. While the positivity rate in Madurai is below 1%, it is a little above 1% Chennai. In Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur and Vellore, positivity rate varies from 1.4% to 1.6%. Of the 97 deaths reported, 30 were from Thanjavur. The sudden spike is because the district had reconciled and added deaths from the second week of June to the list on Friday, officials said. While Coimbatore and Pudukkottai reported seven deaths each, Chennai logged five deaths. At least 13 districts reported zero deaths. Meanwhile, the state vaccinated 3.3 lakh people on Friday. The state had around 8 lakh doses at around 8am today when the vaccinations began. “The stock will be exhausted in a day or two. Vaccination is the only tool we have against the anticipated third wave,” Subramanian said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/drop-in-fresh-cases-erratic-in-some-districts-says-tamil-nadu-health-minister/articleshow/84083802.cms||---

The directorate of transport is launching an e-service for learners licence on the websites https://parivahan.gov.in or https://goatransport.gov.in. The service will become functional from July 5. Applicants will have to answer an online test after watching a video about road safety provided on the websites. The test assessment result will be communicated to the applicant instantly. If the applicant achieves the desired passing of 60% marks, a learner license will be issued, which the applicant can then download and print. The service is automated end to end with auto approval eliminating the need for an interface with the RTO office. “The department has launched services related to goods permits in fully auto approval mode. There is no need to visit the RTO office to avail these services. The governance is taken to citizens instead of citizens visiting offices to avail of services. The department has carried out business process re-engineering in order to simplify the existing procedures and has simplified and delivered various services in a quick manner with minimum hassles,” a statement issued by the department read. The statement further stated that citizens need not visit RTO office for obtaining learners license and that document validation will be done through the Aadhar authentication. The department has also extended the validity of documents such as fitness certificates, permits, driving licence, registration or any other concerned documents whose extension of validity could not or was not likely be granted due to the lockdown and which have expired since February 1, 2020, or will expire by September 30. These will now be valid till September 30.

The meeting, chaired by zonal DCP Vinita S, was attended by cops from police stations, crime branch, different specialized units and other back offices. In the backdrop of the sexual harassment case registered against senior inspector Ashok Meshram at Yashodhara Nagar police station last week, city police under CP Amitesh Kumar have started a sensitization campaign among the cops regarding such issues. In Meshram’s case, the victim home guard and one of her colleagues had to suffer the alleged humiliation over a long period before the matter could come to fore. Following the latest meeting, the sub-committees at police stations, too, were revived with the personnel given instructions to extend support to the victims and help nail the perpetrators. “I have given my personal mobile numbers to the policewomen, asking them to feel free to call, inform and share any information. We have also categorically assured the cops that there would be no adverse reaction for bringing such matters to the fore,” she said. The DCP also said women cops have shared some issues regarding the rest rooms, changing rooms and so on, which would be sorted out with the intervention of the CP, who is paying heed to these infrastructural issues. CP Kumar said the district planning and development council (DPDC) funds had been used earlier to create rest rooms and changing rooms for policewomen, which would be taken up in the future too. “We have already ensured that women cops have separate facilities of changing and rest rooms but some stations are left, which would be completed soon,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/policewomen-urged-to-report-sexual-misconduct-sans-fear/articleshow/84094227.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Goa||Goa: Expert panel concurs with govt, says vax certificate enough for entry||PANAJI: At the fourth meeting of the expert panel, members supported the view of the government that those who have received both vaccine doses should be allowed into the state without a Covid negative certificate. The committee suggested that if people from Goa travelling to other states are allowed entry on production of a certificate that they are fully vaccinated, a similar facility should also be extended to travellers coming to Goa. Dr Jagadish Kakodkar, member secretary of the expert committee, told TOI, “The members recommended that people coming to Goa from other states and Union territories with full vaccination certificates should be allowed in. They are less likely to contract the infection, and if at all they do, it will be mild.” The measure, he said, will reduce an unwarranted burden on the laboratories, and reduce the cost incurred on the mammoth exercise of testing. “This will also serve as a stimulus to people to undertake travel,” he said. Travellers not fully vaccinated, he said, or in case the last dose was taken less than 14 days before travel, could be made to undergo any test approved by the Indian Council of Indian Research (ICMR). But those coming from foreign countries cannot be extended the relief —a certificate of full vaccination will be needed from them — because of different strains prevailing there. They will be required to produce a negative Covid-19 certificate of a test done 72 hours before arrival, and be in home isolation for 14 days after their arrival, as mandated under existing guidelines. Also, to encourage more people to take the jab, the expert committee recommended to the task force that all foreign nationals above 18, including Goans holding Portuguese passports, OCI cardholders, and citizens of Nepal, be vaccinated. However, the government has already put a plan in place and organized two such drives on Saturday at Panaji and Assagao.  “The expert committee felt that vaccination is the fundamental right of every human being. All people above 18 years of age must be vaccinated, including Goan seafarers, who may be holding foreign passports, and foreigners, including Nepalis,” Kakodkar said. The expert committee felt that it is not right to deny vaccination to anyone, as it is the most cost-effective and safe method to prevent the disease, Kakodkar said. “Vaccination is an example of perfect medical technology, which is safe, cost-effective and saves lives,” he said. Another suggestion by the expert committee was that people who are physically-disabled and unable to step out of their house, or bed-ridden and not able to visit a vaccination centre, be identified in each block. A mechanism can then be devised to vaccinate them, provided all safety norms are followed. Health officers and block officers can receive names of such people in their respective areas. “The number of such people — who are constrained either because of their bed-ridden status or due to their disability to visit a vaccination site — is not large. The Central guidelines do not permit house visits to vaccinate them, but the expert committee felt that such people, where it is possible, be vaccinated by having a separate mechanism but by adhering to safety norms,” he said. Kakodkar added that though the government of India still does not permit the vaccination of pregnant women, the expert committee is of the opinion that the Goa government should suggest to the Union government that those who are in their second and third trimester be counselled to get vaccinated. However, he said the choice must be left to them. The expert committee has studied recommendations of the ICMR, gynaecology association of India, other national associations and bodies, as well as examined international guidelines. It observed that there is no evidence of teratogenicity due to the vaccine in women who took it (unknowingly) during their pregnancy, he said. “The risk-benefit ratio is heavily in favour of vaccination of pregnant women, but it is not to be made compulsory,” he said. The recommendations will be submitted before the state task force committee, which is likely to meet next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/expert-panel-concurs-with-govt-says-vax-certificate-enough-for-entry/articleshow/84080536.cms||---

Thereafter, I will visit each and every village of Haryana,” said Chautala Senior during his interaction with party workers and leaders who had gathered at his Gurgaon residence on Friday. The former CM was formally released from Tihar jail on Friday after completing all the documentation. Cong leaders falsely implicated my father: AbhaySharing his plans, Chautala, who recently fractured his hand, said that immediately after removal of his plaster, he would meet farmers and afterward would visit the entire state in a customised vehicle. He said he will try to meet each and every person in the state and will stay and sleep in the vehicle till he covers the entire state. Chautala Senior, who had been living in restrictive conditions on account of being a convict during his parole and temporary release from jails since January 2013, appeared confident and ecstatic after the completion of his jail term. His younger son and INLD leader Abhay Chautala accused the Congress of falsely implicating his father in the JBT teachers’ recruitment scam. He categorically claimed the involvement of Randeep Singh Surjewala, Karan Singh Dalal and Bhupinder Singh Hooda in the conspiracy, He claimed the three Congress leaders connived with former Haryana bureaucrat Sanjeev Kumar, who is also a convict in the recruitment scam, to implicate O P Chautala. Interacting to media persons in Chandigarh on Friday, the former Ellenabad MLA Abhay Singh said the Congress is responsible for sending his father behind the bars and Delhi's Aam Adami Party (AAP) tried to ensure that Chautala Senior does not leave jail. Claiming that his father would have come out of jail around two-and-a-half years ago, Abhay said AAP had obstructed his release. He claimed that Congress MLA Karan Singh Dalal instigated former IAS officer Sanjeev Kumar to accuse OP Chautala in the recruitment scam. According to Abhay, Sanjeev Kumar, who claimed to be a whistle-blower in this case, was suspended from the post of director of the education department by the then O P Chautala government over irregularities in the purchase of desks for students. Abhay said the names of O P Chautala, his brother Ajay Chautala and their party leader Sher Singh Badshami were not mentioned in the CBI charge sheet and said senior IAS Rajni Shekhri Sibbal, who was one of the key CBI witnesses against the Chautalas, had not named his father in her statement recorded by CBI under Section 161 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). “However, a supplementary charge sheet was submitted against them after Bhupinder Singh Hooda met the CBI director twice.

---||Goa||South Goa: CZMP hearing to have 500 extra seats for spot entries||MARGAO: Amid demand from various quarters, including environment activists, NGOs and panchayat members, to postpone the public hearing on the Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) scheduled to be held at the South Goa PDA ground, Margao for South Goa district on July 8, member secretary of the state Coastal Zone Management Authority, Dasharath Redkar inspected the venue on Friday and took stock of the preparations. Following the inspection, Redkar said it was decided that a “holding area” with a seating capacity of 500 be erected to accommodate persons who are likely to do spot registrations for the hearing. “The pandal will have a seating capacity of 1,000 which is more than sufficient to accommodate the 500 people who have already registered for the public hearing. However, as we expect sizeable number of people to attend the hearing by doing spot registrations, we have decided to expand the pandal and create a holding area that would have a seating capacity of 500. All Covid-appropriate behaviour will be strictly observed at the hearing,” Redkar said. While the pandal will be constructed to have sufficient number of display screens and speakers, Redkar on Friday instructed the pandal contractor to install screens and speakers in the holding area too. “The idea is that the 500 participants who have done prior registrations will be allowed to speak first. Only after their submissions are over, those who have done spot registrations will be given the opportunity to speak. Until then, they will be accommodated in the holding area,” Redkar said, adding that every participant will be given 15 minutes to make their submissions. Two experts from the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), as well as a team of experts from State Coastal Zone Management Authority (CZMA) will be present for the hearing. South Goa district collector Ruchika Katyal also held a meeting with CZMA officials, police and officials from other agencies concerned on Friday and reviewed the preparations. Redkar said the CZMA will move the collector for relaxation of curfew restrictions to facilitate maximum participation of the people for the hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/czmp-hearing-to-have-500-extra-seats-for-spot-entries/articleshow/84080608.cms||---

Stoked by rumours, superstition and fear, vaccine hesitancy is keeping a large swathe of the working population out of inoculation drives. But vaccinations, said industry experts, are crucial to help sustain the economic recovery which is under way. “We are on an overdrive to get all our service professionals vaccinated. But there is always that 20% that suffer from vaccine hesitancy,” Abhiraj Singh Bhal, co-founder and CEO at gig marketplace Urban Company, told TOI. Several store and factory staff at Titan’s jewellery division in Tamil Nadu displayed similar behaviour. “We have done two rounds of communications saying that they cannot put others at risk, and we cannot permit them to serve in stores,” said Ajoy Chawla, CEO, jewellery division at Titan. Companies such as Hinduja Global Solutions (HGS) are also grappling with the same challenge. Out of its 8,000 employees in Bengaluru, only 2,500 were found to be in favour of vaccinations, showed an internal survey by the company. “While we have rolled out vaccination drives, vaccine hesitancy took me by surprise,” Partha De Sarkar, CEO at HGS, told TOI. Companies, however, have adopted a carrot-and-stick approach to tackle the problem. While Hinduja Global Solutions has made vaccinations mandatory for employees to return to office, Hitachi ABB Power Grids is conducting training sessions and workshops to get employees to opt for the jab. "Through sensitization efforts, supported by our in-house and partner doctors and consultants, we have been proactively conducting training sessions and workshop and have opened a two-way channel for our employees and their families to ask questions and clear their vaccine-related doubts," said N Venu, CEO and MD, Hitachi ABB Power Grids, India. “The pandemic has led to significant increase in demand of e-commerce and, to ensure that this opportunity is not missed out, it is critical for players like Zomato and Flipkart to get the supply chain staff vaccinated asap,” said Himanshu Bajaj, partner, Asia-Pacific lead, consumer and retail at Kearney. “Similarly, one key impact for consumer-packaged goods players was around supply chain disruption, including in manufacturing and distribution, and here again vaccination is key.” A Zomato spokesperson said it has vaccinated around 63% of its 1.5-lakh delivery force and the company is covering the cost. Flipkart, too, is doling out free vaccines along with free ‘doctor on call’ services for its frontline workers, while Swiss food and beverage company Nestle has partnered with local health authorities to set up camps across manufacturing locations and offices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-inc-grapples-with-vax-hesitancy/articleshow/84083830.cms||John Sarkar
---||Goa||Goa: Ola, Uber fail to submit evidence against taxi owners’ association||PANAJI: The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has dismissed a case against taxi owners’ associations in Goa for preventing the entry of app-based taxi operators after it did not find any evidence that restricted the entry of taxi aggregators like Ola and Uber in the state. The commission held that the Goa government eventually notified the policy allowing entry of app-based aggregators. The case was taken up suo motu by the Commission against taxi unions operating in Goa based on newspaper reports regarding alleged concerted action to prevent entry of app-based companies. The three taxi owners’ associations in the state were facing the case of entering into anti- competitive agreements. During the investigation by CCI official (DG), Ola representatives had claimed that they received threats from taxi owners association and their members vandalised assets and did gherao their office. Thereafter, in 2013 Ola had exited the Goa market. Ola representatives had assured DG to submit evidence regarding the incident. “However, from the records, it is clear that such details were not shared by the representatives of Ola to the DG. Hence it cannot be conclusively inferred that the reason behind non-entry of app-based taxi aggregators such as Ola and Uber in the Goan market was due to the pressure and undue threat of Ops (taxi associations),” the commission held. The commission found that Uber hadn’t even applied for any licence for starting app-based taxi services in Goa. “In this connection we have not made any formal submissions to govt of Goa for starting operations in Goa,” the authorised representative of Uber, Prabhjeet Singh stated The commission noted that the taxi unions’ joint representations to the government or meeting with head of political executive, raising grievances “cannot be said to violate the provision of Competition Act”. It also noted that the Goa government took a policy decision and issued guidelines for app-based taxi operators dated March 6, 2019 permitting them to operate and allowed to have a range bound dynamic pricing which is on the lines of the business model of Ola and Uber.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ola-uber-fail-to-submit-evidence-against-taxi-owners-association/articleshow/84080753.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Van Bhavan, the state forest department’s headquarters in Nagpur, has over 300 Class III and IV employees working on the same desk for years together, violating the provisions of the Transfer Act of 2005, which allows any employee at a particular post only for three years. However, these employees have not been transferred out of this office since the beginning. PCCF G Saiprakash did not respond to calls from TOI. According to forest department sources, the separate cadre of Class III and IV of the office of PCCF is not having the approval of the government. Therefore, the employees are aware that they cannot be transferred out of Nagpur. “Many of these employees have been working on the same desk for more than six years and some for 10, violating provisions of Transfer Act 2005. This has led to indiscipline and dominance by employees and they are not afraid of their controlling and supervisory officers at the headquarters,” said a section of officials. “Besides working on the same table, many employees don’t have any experience of other subjects of the forest department. Most of the Class III and IV employees are interested in the establishment desk. They have developed a good relationship with field officials, who are interested in better postings — which they manage through this cadre working in establishment desk,” officials told TOI. These employees never work in field offices of the forest department and therefore, don’t have any experience of working in field offices and subjects. There is a demand for merging of the cadre in the PCCF office with CCF (territorial), who manages at least 18 forest offices under the Nagpur circle including social forestry, wildlife, working plan, research, land record etc. Nagpur circle includes four divisions — Nagpur, Wardha, Bhandara, and Gondia. Therefore, the cadre of PCCF can easily be merged with Nagpur circle so that Class III and IV employees get an opportunity to have field experience, resulting in an increase in efficiency of various forest offices. “Due to separate cadre of PCCF office, Class III and IV employees of Nagpur circle are getting delayed promotions, while junior employees of the PCCF office are getting early promotions in a short period. Therefore, there is discontent among employees in Nagpur circle,” said a section of forest union leaders. Earlier, senior forest officials have recommended to PCCF (HoFF) for the merger, which is pending for years. Meanwhile, the Maharashtra State Forest & Social Forestry Office Employees Sanghatana, whose members have been posted at Van Bhavan for years together, has opposed the merger move. A resolution was passed in this regard in a meeting on June 22, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pccf-office-violates-transfer-act-merger-proposal-held-up/articleshow/84094302.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: As power helplines stay ‘busy’, shock treatment at midnight||CHANDIGARH: Can anything be worse than enduring frequent power cuts? Ask residents who keep dialling complaint centre numbers but get no response in return. As a similar story played out on Thursday night following a power outage, many people landed up at the power department office in Sector 43 at midnight. They found two workers in a room. Demanding answers, the residents registered their protest and went back only after assurances of staff answering calls and power returning. “They told us that there was some fault in Mohali that had caused the power outage. They had no proper explanation for nobody picking up phones or them remaining busy. They, however, said they would bring the matter to the notice of the higher authorities,” said a resident of Sector 43. Sector 36 too suffered a twohour power cut. “No beforehand announcement of power cut along with no response from the electricity enquiry office made it problematic. It was nearly a two-hour power cut in our locality but nobody knew why,” said Aastha Thakur, a resident of Sector 36. Nandita Sisodia, a resident of Sector 35, said the power department helpline and sub-division complaint numbers were busy from11pm to1.30am. “The authorities are imposing unscheduled power cuts, making our lives miserable,” she said. Rekha, a resident of Sector 44, said not only during night but during daytime too there were unscheduled power cuts in their locality. “The frustrating part is that nobody picks up calls on the helpline numbers,” she said. Vijay Kumar, a resident of Dhanas, said it seems officials were busy providing uninterrupted supply to VIP sectors. “Nobody is bothered about people residing in colonies and villages,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-as-power-helplines-stay-busy-shock-treatment-at-midnight/articleshow/84083869.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Nagpur||‘Centre’s order on pulses stock against reforms through farm laws’||Nagpur: The central government issued an order on July 2 to impose stock ceiling on pulses, putting a limit on the stock held by wholesalers, millers and retailers. Traders and activists say that the move directly contradicts government’s own policy of reforms through the three new farm laws. Farmers’ had staged protests in Delhi to oppose the laws. One of the laws — Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act of 2020 — removes restriction on stocking unless there is an extraordinary situation like famine. The restrictions can only be imposed when there is a 50% increase in the retail price of non-perishable farm goods as compared to preceding 12 months or five years’ average. Non-perishable items include most of the grains and pulses. As TOI inquired in the local markets, tur dal which is a major pulses crop was in the range of Rs100 to Rs120 a kg in last five years. There has been no change in prices of other pulses too. Prices of tur whole sold by farmers are barely Rs100 to Rs200 above the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs6,000 a quintal in the farm produce markets of Vidarbha. Chana, which is the second most important pulses crop in the region, is ruling below MSP at Rs4,500 to Rs4,600. Its MSP is Rs5,100 a quintal. According to Pratap Motwani, secretary of The Wholesale Grain and Seeds Merchants Association, the sudden order will not only hit the traders but also farmers. “This is going to have a direct impact on the prices of farm produce rates,” he said. Motwani said the order restricts the stocks to 200 metric tonne for a wholesaler and 5 metric tonne for a retailer. “This will lead to selling pressure by traders, thus reducing the price. “This is applicable only to induvial traders at whose cost the corporates having stakes in grain business will benefit,” he said. Anil Ghanavat, president of Shetkari Sanghatana and also member of Supreme Court appointed committee on the three farm laws, said the order defeats the very philosophy behind the new laws. “Even if the implementation of laws has been stayed by court, its basic objective was to free the trade. The stock limits could be imposed only if prices go beyond 50%. There has been no apparent jump in the prices of pulses. Tur is barely above MSP. The order has already brought down rates in farm produce markets,” he said. Rakesh Tikait, the spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Union and one of the leaders of the Delhi Farm protest, said this clearly shows that the government wants to help the corporate lobby at the cost of farmers and small traders. “This proves our stance about the government’s policies not being for farmers’ benefit,” he said. Sudhir Kothari, director of an agriculture produce marketing committee at Hinganghat in Wardha district, feels the prices will fall as the markets open on Monday. “Traders will start selling the stock to bring it down to the permissible levels. Though less as compared to harvest time, farmers are continuing to bring pulses to the markets,” he said. Kishore Tiwari, chairman of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM), said the order is also likely to reduce sowing of pulses in the current season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/centres-order-on-pulses-stock-against-reforms-through-farm-laws/articleshow/84099525.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Goa||Goa govt decision on revised tourism fees still pending||PANAJI: The state government is yet to decide on keeping the new fee and license structure for tourist trades in abeyance. The new fee regime had come into force earlier this year. On more than one occasion, stakeholders have requested the government not to implement it since their businesses are in the doldrums owing to the pandemic. A senior tourism official, however, said that no decision has been taken on the industry’s request. The ministry may give them relief for a few months if it is found that a majority of them have not paid the increased fees, the official said . “For starred hotels, in terms of their revenue, the increased fees should be a pittance. We haven’t decided yet if the increased fee regime should be kept on hold. We will have to check how many trades have paid fees in accordance with the fresh fee structure,” the officer said. The new rules that came into force a few months ago not only made registration of tourist trades, including online aggregators, compulsory, but registration and licence fees for tourism trade were also hiked manifold. Even when the draft rules were introduced in November last year, the tourism trades had expressed their displeasure as the said fees were increased at a time when the industry was not in the best of health owing to the pandemic. Trade body, Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG), then had requested the government to defer the implementation of the new rates by a few months or until the situation improved. While the rationalisation in fee structure was introduced after many years, and trades that were left out earlier were covered, the industry felt that the hike was ill-timed. With the introduction of new rules, the process of registration was also improvised. Last season, the tourism department had given a 50 % reduction in renewal fees for beach shacks. A shack operator said most of them concluded their activities in February-March, at least two to three months before the season could conclude. The last two seasons have been really bad. “We will want similar relief for the forthcoming season as well,” businessman Shawn Fernandes said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-decision-on-revised-tourism-fees-still-pending/articleshow/84081270.cms||---

The IMD forecast said, “The sky condition is likely to be partly cloudy. Thunderstorms with light to moderate rain are likely to occur in some areas.” On Friday, southern suburbs received heavy rain almost early in the day as West Tambaram got 14mm and Kancheepuram received 52mm. Nungambakkam received 4mm rain, Ennore 2mm, Madhavaram 5mm and Meenambakkam 1mm. Northern suburbs received rain in the evening. A Met department official said convective action due to a high daytime temperature and upper air circulation were the reasons. “If the temperature is high there will be convective action as the land gets heated up fast. This may lead to rain in the coming days too,” he added. The maximum temperature on Friday was 37°C at Nungambakkam and Meenmbakkam. The forecast says the city and suburbs are likely to experience around the same temperature on Saturday. Live weather tracking sites showed dense clouds over most parts of the city and its north, west and southern suburbs on Friday. A private weather blogger said the city did not get rain for the past three days though areas surrounding it received a good spell. The dense presence of clouds over the city on Friday led to rain in many areas, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-weekend-could-be-wet-cloudy-says-met-forecast/articleshow/84083895.cms||---

Sources in the government said KCR was likely to meet Modi and Union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat after July 5 to discuss the row over sharing of Krishna water between AP and Telangana and irrigation projects, especially Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Project (RLIP), being ‘illegally’ constructed by the AP government. Official sources said the CMO is trying to get an appointment with the PM after July 5. “If KCR does not get Modi’s appointment due to the latter’s busy schedule, the CM may send a delegation of ministers to represent the matter to the Centre,” the sources said. The decision to meet the PM was taken by KCR in the wake of Jagan’s complaint to the Centre. During the recent cabinet meeting, KCR had said his government would not remain quiet and would raise the issues of AP’s ‘illegal’ lift projects in the upcoming Parliament session. ‘State believes in permanent solution’He also said the issues would be taken to the notice of people of the state. A senior official of water resources department said the Telangana government believes in a permanent solution to the water disputes between the two states. “To find a lasting solution to the problem, the state government has already withdrawn the case in the Supreme Court following an advice of the jal shakti ministry. The ministry and Krishna River Management Board (KRMB), however, have not been acting swiftly on the water sharing issues and have failed to stop AP’s illegal projects,” the official told TOI. Officials also demanded constitution of a water tribunal as per the Inter-state Water Disputes Act,1956. The TRS government claims that Telangana is eligible for 565 tmcft of 833 tmcft water from Krishna river as against the present allocation of 299 tmcft. The CM is visiting Sircilla on July 4 to take part in various programmes. Meanwhile, Telangana irrigation department is gearing up to counter the allegations made by AP. A CMO official said the KRMB has not intimated about any meeting with irrigation officials of both states. “If there is any such meeting, we will raise every issue pertaining to the Krishna waters and lift irrigation projects and illegal water diversion to some parts of AP,” he said. While both the states deployed police in large numbers at irrigation projects like Jurala, Srisailam, Nagarjunasagar and Pulichintala where hydel power is generated, Telangana generated 1,400 MW on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/water-row-after-jagan-missive-telangana-cm-k-chandrasekhar-rao-plans-to-meet-pm-narendra-modi/articleshow/84083897.cms||Koride Mahesh

The party said that many patients and their relatives depend on the stalls and kiosks for food, fruits and other supplies, which are either unavailable or expensive within the hospital complex. AAP functionaries Valmiki Naik, Cecille Rodrigues, Vighnesh Apte, Dr Vibhas Prabhudesai and Ritesh Shenai had rushed to the site outside GMC on Thursday after hearing that the kiosks outside the complex had been razed. “There had been assurances given by the local MLAs just two days ago that nothing would be demolished until there was a rehabilitation plan. So who decided to remove the stalls in the dead of the night,” Naik said. Rodrigues slammed chief minister Pramod Sawant for destroying the livelihoods of the locals who had already suffered huge economic distress due to the pandemic. Apte said that all the facilities within the GMC complex, from the pharmacy and the canteen to oxygen and other supplies, have been given to vendors favoured by health minister Vishwajit Rane without any process. “This act of demolishing the kiosks will hurt not only the vendors, but also the patients and relatives who depended on these cheap sources of food and snacks,” Apte said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-bjp-govt-is-anti-common-man/articleshow/84081421.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Bad air quality fans Covid-19 spread, finds study in 300 districts including Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: A research study involving 300 districts across India, including Hyderabad, Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam, reveals that air quality plays a crucial role in the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The study suggests that improving air quality with proper strict regulations whenever Covid-19 cases peak could help reduce infection and mortality rates. The study, spanning over one year (April 2020 to March 2021) covering summer, monsoon and winter seasons, reveals that among the air pollutants, atmospheric ozone was better correlated with infection counts followed by aerosol thickness, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, black carbon and sulphur dioxide. The researchers observed that among the weather parameters, air temperature, incoming short-wave radiation, wind speed are positively and significantly associated with outbreak pattern, and precipitation (rainfall) and humidity are negatively correlated with confirmed cases. Coastal dists had more strife during pandemicOnly cloud cover has no significant relation. Coastal districts and areas located in the plain and low-lying areas experienced a bitter situation during this pandemic", according to the study published in online preprint portal MedRxiv on July1. The spatial distribution of cases also depicted that the coastal districts were more anguished by misfortune than the districts located in the interior part of the country whereas the districts from the Himalayan Mountains and its foothills had lesser strife during this pandemic. The study found that among other areas, Andhra Pradesh had inhaled quite bad air. This also explains why AP, being primarily a coastal state, has reported more Covid-19 infections than Telangana, which is far away from the coast. The research team comprising Amitesh Gupta and Laboni Saha from Savitribai Phule Pune University, and RBased Services Private Limited, New Delhi, investigated the role of regional meteorology and air quality parameters in the outbreak pattern of Covid-19 pandemic. They used the remote sensing-based dataset of 12 environmental variables to correlate infective case counts at the district level. “Our conscientious study suggests that the summer tropical environment may spare a more affirmative condition for novel coronavirus transmission. Instead of squashing the Covid-19 curve, higher air temperature may significantly assist in augmenting the pandemic predicament in India. Comparatively higher wind in drier areas could indulge the virus to unfurl more,” the researchers said. Districts located near and along the coast reported maximum cases during May to July 2020 which is the onset duration of monsoon over Indian subcontinent, thus experiencing higher wind from the sea-side towards the land. The rapid weather variability might result in an increase in respiratory infections in warming climatic conditions. Higher ambient temperature could restrain the adaptive immune response to a virus infection, the study said. The study showed that 35.03% districts had registered cases within the range of 10,000 to 1,00,000 while only 3.05% districts reported more than one lakh cases during the period. Most of the districts registered counts of infective cases within the range of 2,500-5,000 following the range of 10,000-25,000. It has also found 21 states registered more than one lakh infected cases. “Intriguingly, the temporal trends of pollutants showed comparatively higher concentration during winter and post-monsoon seasons, while the infections were relatively lesser in both those seasons. Therefore, it suggests that the shoddy air quality could not be discretely blameworthy for coronavirus dissemination in India, rather bad air,” the researchers said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bad-air-quality-fans-covid-19-spread-finds-study-in-300-districts/articleshow/84083932.cms||Syed Akbar

Sayed also said that with the poor and lower middle class losing wages and employment, they are unable to afford multiple digital devices for their children to study and attend online classes. “Many children living in the villages have to walk a long distance to search for internet connectivity. The government needs to pay attention to this. Children face a huge problem regarding connectivity,” said Sayed. “The government needs to have a team of professionals to see how to improve the connectivity.” She said that GFP’s demands should not be construed as criticism of the online medium of education. GFP said that the Goa Broad Band Network which links each and every village in the state through fibre optic cables needs to be improved so that even rural areas can access the internet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-improve-connectivity-give-poor-kids-devices/articleshow/84081518.cms||---

Many people from neighbouring villages of Maharashtra’s Sindhudurg district come to Goa in search of work or for businesses. When anybody enters Goa border via Bicholim taluka, it is mandatory to have either a Covid negative certificate or undergo a rapid antigen test at the border. However, locals from Maulinguem and surrounding areas said that since most of the people from neighbouring villages of Sindhudurg are aware of the Maulinguem route, they take this route to avoid the police and the testing. It is estimated that around 300 people enter Goa via Maulinguem. Locals said that there are many other ‘hidden routes’ by which to enter Goa from Maharashtra and that people enter through villages like Matne, Ambadgao, Vazri, Aai and Talekhol. The only checkpost encountered on this route is the one in Maulinguem. People also use a track adjacent to the Tillari canal via Kharpal.

---||Kolkata||Register all post-poll plaints with court, NHRC: HC to West Bengal govt||KOLKATA: The Calcutta High Court on Friday asked the state government to “register” and “record with magistrates” all post-poll violence complaints lodged with it or the NHRC, adding that the NHRC report had “established prima facie” the “stand taken by the petitioners... that there had been post-poll violence”. “A number of persons were killed,” the HC said after a “perusal” of the interim NHRC report, adding: “Many suffered sexual violence and grievous injuries. Even minor girls were not spared. They have been brutally assaulted sexually. Properties were damaged and a number of them were forced to leave their homes and migrate to neighbouring states.” “We may make it clear here that we are not making the interim report public as the matter is still being investigated,” the HC said, repeating that “only an interim report” had been filed. “Before passing any final order, due opportunity shall be granted to all parties to place their cases,” the HC added. The court also asked for a second autopsy on Bharatiya Mazdoor Trade Union Council office-bearer Abhijit Sarkar’s body at the Command Hospital and asked South Suburban Division deputy commissioner of police Rashid Munir Khan why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against him for the June 29 incident in which an NHRC member claimed he was heckled and threatened in Jadavpur. “The state has not been able to create an atmosphere” to give “confidence to sufferers” to return home, the HC said. “Most complaints were not recorded by police or cross-cases were forced against them. Complaints were registered only after this court took cognisance of the matter in some cases of heinous crimes. Investigation was (done) in slip-shod manner and hardly any arrest was made. Some cases have not been registered and, in most cases, the accused have been bailed out,” the court observed, adding: “The state was found on a wrong foot throughout... in denial mode.” The five-judge bench, comprising acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justices IP Mukerji, Harish Tandon, Soumen Sen and Subrata Talukdar, also told the state government to provide free ration to the victims if they had lost their ration cards. The bench will hear the matter again on July 13. The court said the NHRC’s interim report mentioned a “surprising fact”: “The state claimed there was no complaint” but there was a “flood of complaints when an opportunity was given” to victims. “People are afraid to even disclose their identity. It shows there is more to conceal than to reveal,” the bench said. “Whatever information has been asked for by the (NHRC) committee be supplied immediately,” the court ordered. “Any delay” may result in an “adverse inference”, it added, asking all central agencies and service providers to assist the committee and provide requisite information. “Early action in the matter is expected as the delay may result in destruction of evidence,” the court told the NHRC committee. The HC also asked the state chief secretary to ensure that police correspondence and “control-room logs” be preserved. “The entire material from May 2 till date be kept in a sealed cover,” it directed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/register-all-post-poll-plaints-with-court-nhrc-hc-to-state/articleshow/84081771.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Kolkata||West Bengal governor reads out 1st, last paras of speech prepared by state||KOLKATA: Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar read out only the first and last paragraphs of the 18-page speech prepared for him by the state government for his first address to the new assembly after this year’s state election, leaving out portions about which he had “raised questions” with CM Mamata Banerjee on June 28. The governor’s address came in the backdrop of a barrage of allegations and questions — from his “involvement” in a 1990s’ “hawala case” to “land deals in Punjab struck down by courts” — from the Trinamool Congress. There has been intense speculation about how he would handle the address — prepared by the Trinamool government, with which he has had several run-ins — after his “questions” and the Trinamool’s allegations. Dhankhar finished his address in four minutes, with the din created by BJP MLAs against the “deliberate suppression of post-poll violence” coming in handy, and left the assembly. The governor did not read out a paragraph on “post-poll violence”, and another on a “particular section” spreading fake news and trying to “divide people”. Assembly speaker Biman Banerjee said the governor had told him that had not changed anything in the speech. “It is, therefore, the governor’s speech and nothing else will be put up for discussion,” he said. Trinamool seniors called the governor’s selective reading “unprecedented” but former opposition leader and Congress MLA Abdul Mannan cited similar instances in the past. “There have been several such instances. Governor Bhairab Dutt Pande had to leave the assembly via the rear exit door meant for the speaker without reading his address. There was a repeat with governor Viren J Shah as well,” Congress MLA Abdul Mannan said. The governor did not read out a paragraph on “post-poll violence”. “The incidents occurred during the election period when the law-and-order machinery in the state was under the control, direction and superintendence of the Election Commission of India. After the new democratically elected government took over, immediate action was taken with the sharpest agility and strict impartiality and normalcy was restored soon,” the paragraph said. Another paragraph that was in the address but which Dhankhar did not read out stated: “A particular section of politically biased people for their own vested interests has been spreading fake news, fake videos, half-truths, distorted versions of facts and blatant lies through their own social media network to defame the government. It is a political plan to tarnish the image of West Bengal when Bengal is the safest state and Kolkata is the safest city in the country.” Another paragraph that Dhankhar did not read out was against a “section” trying to divide “people” staying in the state. “My government is also alarmed at the recent dangerous orchestrated and well-planned campaign being launched by certain vested interests belonging to a particular section of politically biased people to sow seeds of dividing the people of the state who have lived and coexisted peacefully over the years,” this paragraph stated. “We respect the governor,” assembly opposition leader Suvendu Adhikari said after the governor’s speech, adding that the state government did not mention the post-poll “genocide”. “He protested against post-poll violence but the speech he delivered was prepared by the state government,” he added. Trinamool leaders mocked Adhikari’s use of the word “genocide”. “Adhikari’s comments are devoid of any substance. His priority should be to work with the state to get more vaccines for Bengal,” state parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee said. Trinamool MLAs, however, played it cool in the assembly, with the tone set by CM Banerjee. She and the assembly speaker came out of their chambers to receive Dhankhar as he reached the Vidhan Sabha at 1.48 p.m. The CM and the governor spoke to each other while paying tributes at Ambedkar’s statue and posed for photographers along with the speaker before entering the assembly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/guv-reads-out-1st-last-paras-of-speech-prepared-by-state/articleshow/84081547.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||HC: Suvendu state security to continue||Kolkata: The Calcutta High Court on Friday asked the state to continue with security measures provided to opposition leader Suvendu Adhikari, observing that ‘Z’ category cover is already provided to him. The state told the HC that adequate security support is given to Adhikari, but under norms, a person cannot get personal security cover both from the Centre and state at the same time. The Centre provides Adhikari ‘Z’ security cover with 28 CRPF personnel and a bulletproof vehicle. Justice Shivakant Prasad, while disposing of the petition, said: “As per the report, state would continue to keep security cover and vigilance on the movement of the petitioner so that the petitioner is provided full security in the hour of need.” Advocate general Kishore Datta told the court to supplement Adhikari’s central security, a security liaison officer (in the rank of SI) has been detailed for better coordination. He is also provided additional personnel, vehicle and intelligence support, the AG said. The state said Adhikari’s state security was not withdrawn suddenly and was done after CRPF took charge after a Joint Security Review (JSR) meeting held with the officers of CRPF, officers of East Midnapur, Subsidiary Intelligence Bureau and Directorate of Security, West Bengal at Adhikari’s residence on December 20. The state told HC that 19 state ministers get security less than Adhikari and the two former opposition leaders had lesser security than Adhikari’s.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hc-suvendu-state-security-to-continue/articleshow/84079329.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
