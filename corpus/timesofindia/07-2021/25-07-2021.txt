Drawing attention to the ease with which children could create an account and asserting on the need to ensure their safety to prevent harassment and abuse, the study commissioned by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights also brings into focus a bigger concern that a large proportion of 10 years olds have social media accounts. It comes through that 37.8% and 24.3% of 10-year- old children surveyed have Facebook and Instagram accounts respectively. In the study this is cited to be "seemingly in contravention" to the guidelines laid down by various social networking platforms. It is shared that as far as Facebook and Instagram are concerned, the age barrier for creating an account happens to be 13 years. “Social media platforms contain and disperse such a variety of content, a lot of which is neither appropriate nor conducive for children. They can be anything from violent or vulgar content to instances of online abuse and bullying of children. Hence, in this regard, proper oversight and stricter enforcement is required,” it is stated in the study which comes in the backdrop of the pandemic. Among all those children who have accounts on the major social networking apps/sites which they use, Facebook (used by 36.8 percent) – Instagram (used by 45.50 percent) are the most popular. When asked about the features/facilities that children like to use or enjoy using on smartphones/internet devices, 52.9 percent answered as 'Chatting (using instant messaging apps like WhatsApp/Facebook/Instagram/Snapchat)'. With the pandemic making smartphones and internet access a critical link to education and the outside world for children, the study shows that 30.2% of the children 8 to 18 years surveyed already possessed their own smartphones and the usage shows a steep rise from the age of 13 years and onwards. A significantly high 94.8% of the children said they use smartphones/internet devices these days for online learning and classes. Other major purposes of use include; messaging applications, referring to study materials, music and games. The data showed that the most prominent means to access the smartphone and the internet for the children is through their parents' phones with 62.6% saying so. Also more than 48% of the children agreed and 45.30% strongly agreed that the world that they live in today is addicted to cell phones. The study also highlights that while 29.7% children feel that the pandemic has 'very much' had a negative impact, 43.7% think it has had a 'partial' negative impact on their education. The report further states that it is clear that students across age groups think that their education has suffered due to the pandemic and somehow online learning has not been good enough. NCPCR chief Priyank Kanoongo said that with growing internet accessibility by children, more so in the backdrop of the pandemic, this study focuses on the impact of using mobile phones and other devices on the child's physical, behavioural, and psycho-social wellbeing. The study was conducted by the research team of Mumbai based NGO Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini for NCPCR between July to December last year and has been now compiled into an analysis. The study covered 5,811 participants - 3,491 school going children, 1,534 parents and 786 teachers from 60 schools, across six states in the country selected from across regions. Among student respondents 50.9% are boys and 49.1% girls. The age group that is represented most in the survey is of children between 12-17 years. The study draws upon responses from participants from across regions East, West, North, South, and North-East regions) picking one metropolitan city and adjoining urban and rural areas were selected. The cities include Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bhubaneswar/Ranchi and Guwahati. Based on the findings the NCPCR also makes a number of recommendations. It is suggested that more internet de-addiction centres need to be established in the country, like AIIMS Behavioural Addiction clinic is working with the schools and universities to create awareness on the subject. Since children access the internet, apps and social media platforms through internet service connections in the name of their parents there is no data on how many children are accessing the internet privately. It is therefore recommended in the report that mobile internet service connections should be given in the name of children by way of proxy accountability as in the case of bank account of minor, or else when parents purchase connection in their name for children, they should give a declaration that the connection will be used by the child, to ensure that the data can be maintained and children can be protected from abuse. It is stated that this can also help in providing filters and restrictions by service providers/intermediary platforms. "Also, a report may be generated on a daily basis and forwarded automatically to the linked number/connection or email of the parent/guardian," it is suggested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ncpcr-survey-42-9-school-going-children-have-a-social-networking-account-over-30-have-their-own-smartphone/articleshow/84715910.cms||Ambika Pandit

Frustrated, a group of like-minded people have formed Dakshina Kannada Zilla CNG Balekadarara Sangha (CNG users’ association) to urge the authorities to solve the CNG crisis. Haikadi Shrinath Rao, a pharma industry professional and the association’s founder, said they are convening their maiden meeting at a school in Honakkate on Sunday. He told STOI that there is a huge gap between the demand and supply of CNG in Mangaluru, that is currently routed through Bengaluru. The Kochi-Mangaluru Natural Gas Pipeline of GAIL (India) Ltd was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in January this year. “With a rise in petrol prices, there is a huge demand for CNG, which costs Rs 55 per kg. Out of five bunks dispensing CNG, only two are functioning regularly, catering to about 700 CNG-run vehicles,” he said. Further, Shrinath added that the aim of their association is to urge the government to ensure that CNG users tank up without delays, much like those with vehicles running on petrol and diesel. “We are in touch with GAIL officials, and they have assured us that a mother station will be set up at the earliest. More vehicles will be used to transport CNG from Bengaluru,” he said. Poornima R K Bhat, founder-director Arivu-Early Intervention Centre and also a member of the association, said CNG users have networked via WhatsApp. “Most of them rue over waiting in long queues for refuelling. There have been instances of drivers reaching the station as early as 5am and late in the night. A delegation will soon meet the MP and the MLAs, seeking their intervention to solve the problem. With unlock, we are noticing a huge demand for CNG vehicles, and the consequent rush at bunks dispensing it,” she said. Bharath Prabhu, proprietor of Mangalore Service Station (Kavoor), said consumers are worried over the widening gap between demand and supply. “Being aware of the problem, the company is working towards solving the same,” he said. A source from Gail Gas Ltd said 600-700kg CNG is available in Mangaluru daily, and the quantity is expected to increase to over 1,000kg in August, with the commissioning of the fourth vehicle for transportation from Bengaluru. “Also, the work on setting up a mother station at Panambur will be completed in mid-September. Once it is commissioned, CNG supply will be seamless,” the source explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/refuelling-woes-leave-cng-users-worried/articleshow/84716172.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

A resident of Kadankoppa village in Kalghagi taluk in Dharwad, Devappa, a two-and-a-half foot dwarf, said that he did not have money to undertake cultivation of any crop on his four-acre farm. At the 2019 Dwarf World Games in 2019, Devappa participated in various team and individual events, adding to India’s haul of medals each time he stepped out to compete.  In addition to the Dwarf World Games, Devappa has participated in various international events, travelling across the globe, earning laurels for himself and India in countries such as United States of America, United Arab Emirates, among others. Among others, he has participated in 100m, 200m running events and long jump. Unfortunately for Devappa, his accomplishments on the racing track have brought in very little by way of materialistic benefits, and prosperity remains a distant dream. That this international athlete was unable to afford a smartphone for his daughter to enable her to attend online classes during the lockdown is perhaps the most telling illustration of his plight. “During the first wave of Covid-19, I managed to sow my crop, despite many difficulties, but was unable to reap any harvest owing to the heavy rain, which washed away my crop. I decided to sow maize this year, despite my problems, and I am expecting it will help me tide over this crisis,” he said. Recalling a visit he made to Hubballi soon after online classes commenced for his daughter, a class VI student, Devappa said, “We went to Hubballi to buy a smartphone or tablet, but we found nothing for less than Rs 10,000, and had to return home empty-handed. She had to rely on Doordarshan classes for her lessons. But I approached my coach, to whom I explained my problems, and he donated his son’s smartphone to my daughter.” Official coach and manager of the dwarfs’ athletic team and coach Shivanand Gunjal said that Devappa was an extraordinarily talented athlete who had, in addition to his medals, won the hearts of hundreds of spectators at the World Dwarf Games in Canada..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/dwarf-athlete-struggles-to-make-ends-meet/articleshow/84716192.cms||J Abbas Mulla

The facelift, given by Bengaluru Smart City Limited, was the talking point for shoppers and traders with many questioning the quality of work, given the fact that crores of rupees were being spent. “The project was delayed by six months and it was a relief when the CM and his cabinet colleagues visited the city’s shopping hub and gave it a thumbs-up. But the street couldn’t withstand rain 24 hours later,” the owner of a business establishment said. The makeover project started in March 2020 and was supposed to be completed in December, but it continued till last week. Asked about the waterlogging and interlocking pavements getting displaced, contractor Anand Pramod said: “It has been a very tedious project and a little premature to judge it as 50 per cent of work (10 per cent of civil work and 40 per cent of aesthetics, including lighting) is still pending.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/24-hrs-after-cms-inspection-commercial-st-waterlogged/articleshow/84716366.cms||Mrinalini Bhat
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: 999 head constables transferred||BENGALURU: In a major reshuffle on Saturday, police commissioner Kamal Pant transferred 999 head constables working in different stations of the city. The main reason behind the move was that the officials were working in the same station for more than five years and some of them allegedly indulged in non-policing activities. Also, the commissioner was unhappy about the recent daylight murders involving rowdies. “As of now, we have transferred 999 head constables. Next week, we’ll compile a list of constables working in one police station for more than five years,” deputy commissioner of police (administration) Nisha James said. Hoysalas to be stationed for 10 minsFrom now on, Hoysalas, the patrolling vehicles, will not stay in one place for more than 10 minutes, except during emergencies. Continued patrolling will ensure visible policing and keep miscreants at bay, a senior officer said. At present, the city has 272 Hoysalas, including 108 vehicles dedicated to women-related issues and fitted with GPRS. “Any officer working for a long time in one police station could become close to locals of that area. Since he/she has to deal with all kinds of people, chances of them getting more acquainted with anti-social elements are bright. In the recent murder cases, there has been a failure on the part of local police in gathering information about the attacks. There are higher chances of corruption when officials stay for a long period,” an officer said. An officer said Hoysalas are meant for continuous, round-the-clock patrolling. “When such is the case, why should they waste time stopping in one place? Now, they have fixed points that keep changing every 30 minutes or so. When the 10-minute scheme gets introduced, one will see more visible policing,” he said. All the Hoysalas are controlled by the command centre located at the commissioner’s office on Infantry Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/999-head-constables-transferred/articleshow/84716382.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

The encounter raged on till the time of filing this report. Based on intelligence inputs about the presence of terrorists in the forest area of Shokbaba in Sumlar-Aragam, a joint team of the Army’s 13RR and 14RR, Para (SF), MARCOS, CRPF and Bandipora Police launched a cordon-and-search operation in the area, said police in a statement. On seeing the security forces approach, holed-in terrorists opened fire at the search party, triggering an encounter. In the initial fire exchange, a jawan of 14RR sustained bullet injuries and was evacuated to a hospital for treatment. Three terrorists, who are yet to be identified, have so far been killed in the gunfight, police said, adding that the encounter was still underway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/three-terrorists-killed-in-jk-encounter/articleshow/84717600.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Around 8.25pm, the flying object with a blinking white light, was seen hovering in Kaluchak area under the jurisdiction of Gangyal police station. “The suspected drone was flying about 150-200m above ground level and was spotted for a minute before it appeared to move towards Ratnuchak village. An alert was sounded and the area was cordoned off,” said a source. Earlier on Friday, Jammu Police had shot down a drone fitted with 5kg ready-to-use IED in Akhnoor. At a press conference later, Jammu ADGP Mukesh Singh had revealed that the threads found on the hexacopter matched with those on the flying objects used to carry out the twin explosion at Jammu Air Force Station on June 27, which left two IAF personnel injured. He added that in the past one-and-a-half years, J&K Police have so far recovered 16 AK-47 rifles, numerous magazines, 15 grenades and 18 IEDs air-dropped from Pakistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/another-drone-spotted-near-army-area-in-jammu/articleshow/84717712.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||Kolkata||West Bengal ICSE success rate 99.98%, girls outshine boys||KOLKATA: The ICSE results in the state could not reach a 100% pass figure that the Delhi NCR region was able to exhibit as the results were declared by the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations on Saturday. The pass percentage of the state in ICSE is 99.98%. It is higher than that of ISC in the state (99.63), though, the scores of the ICSE school toppers in Kolkata have been a shade lower than that of ISC where almost every school topper has impressed with a 99-plus score. On an average, the ICSE toppers in the city have scored in the 96%-98% range. The 100% pass results of ICSE from the Delhi NCR region reminds one of the recently declared Madhyamik results where nearly 11 lakh candidates were all declared passed. This had led educationists to debate whether such a system is a result of inflation of marks caused due to applying a formula to calculate marks on the basis of certain hypothesis, since the written exam did not happen. Some academics, however, felt that these scores are not of supreme importance for ICSE students because they will not go beyond the portals of school education immediately and will still have two years to study and prove themselves. A total of 39,520 students appeared for ICSE in the state from 391 schools. Girls with a pass percentage of 99.99 have scored better than boys (99.97%). Seven boys and two girls have been unsuccessful in the ICSE exams. Arjun Jhunjhunwala, Arjoe Basak and Arihant Satpati from Don Bosco Park Circus have scored 99.4%, 99.2% 99%, respectively. Pranjal Sengupta of Rammohan Mission has scored 99.2%. “My dream is to pursue physics and go for research,” he said. Most other toppers scored 98-plus. Adya Agarwal of La Martiniere for Girls has scored 98.8% along with three toppers of St Xavier’s Collegiate School, Shobhit Bandhu, Sugata Sen and Aryan Ghosh, and the topper of Heritage School, Naina Agarwal. “It’s too early to say what I wish to become but as of now I will be pursuing science and I hope to study engineering after my Plus II,” Arjun said. The ICSE topper from St Augustine’s Shyamnagar, Rishav Sarma Sarkar, has scored 98.4% and Anwesha Ghoshal of MP Birla Foundation has scored 98.2%. Some school principals felt that while 99-plus was the equalised score of most ISC toppers, in case of ICSE, a large number of toppers exhibited the 98.8 score. The variation of marks that a pen and paper exam makes possible goes missing in case of marks calculated on the basis of a statistical formula where there is enough scope for generalisations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-icse-success-rate-99-98-girls-outshine-boys/articleshow/84716317.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

It was the first sector commander-level meeting between the two border guarding forces after the declaration of a ceasefire agreement earlier this year. During the meeting, it was also decided to re-energise instant communication between field commanders, whenever required, to resolve operational matters. "The meeting was held in a cordial, positive and constructive atmosphere. Both sides agreed on expeditious implementation of decisions taken in the earlier DG-level talks and also committed to maintain peace and harmony along the international border," a BSF spokesperson said. "During the meeting, the commanders of the two border guarding forces discussed various issues, with the main emphasis by the BSF delegation being on Pakistani drone activity and digging of tunnels by Pakistan, besides other issues related to border management," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-lodges-protest-with-pak-over-drone-activity-in-jammu-area/articleshow/84718049.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||Pak cabinet slams Sharif for meeting Afghan national security adviser||ISLAMABAD: Several members of the Imran Khan cabinet on Saturday slammed Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) chief and former PM Nawaz Sharif as "shameless" for meeting Afghan national security adviser Hamdullah Mohib, saying it "proved his connections with enemies of Pakistan, including (Indian PM Narendra) Modi". The official Twitter handle of Afghanistan’s National Security Council had shared a picture of Mohib and minister for peace Sayed Sadat Naderi meeting Sharif in London last Thursday, triggering instant outrage in Pakistan. The meeting with the ex-Pakistan PM, who has been based in London since 2019, was to "discuss matters of mutual interest", it said. A screenshot of the meeting with the hashtags #NawazSharif and #AfghanNSA was trending on Twitter shortly after, with comments in favour and against Sharif and the Afghan leaders. Pakistan’s information minister Fawad Chaudhry said, "This is why sending Nawaz Sharif abroad was dangerous...because such people become a part of international ploys." Sharif's meeting with "RAW’s biggest ally in Afghanistan is an example of this", he said. "Modi, Mohib or Amrullah Saleh (the Afghan vice-president) — every enemy of Pakistan is a close friend of Nawaz Sharif," Chaudhry tweeted. Human rights minister Shireen Mazari demanded to know what "matters of mutual interest" were discussed at the meeting. "After Mohib referred to Pakistan — not PTI government but (our) country — as a "brothel", common RAW interest can only be to attack Pak," she said. "Such shameless self-interest of Sharif to preserve looted wealth, country be damned." Science and technology minister Shibli Faraz termed the meeting "nothing new", saying Sharif had "always kept company with enemies of Pakistan, be it (steel tycoon Sajjan) Jindal or Modi". Responding to the criticism, Sharif’s daughter Maryam Nawaz said the foundation of her father’s ideology was the peaceful co-existence of Pakistan with its neighbours and he had always "worked tirelessly" for it. "It is the very essence of diplomacy to talk to everyone, listen to their point of view and convey one’s own message across: something this government doesn’t comprehend and hence is a complete failure on the international front," she said. The Afghan national security adviser routinely accuses Pakistan and ISI of supporting and directing the Taliban’s insurgency in Afghanistan, which are always denied by Islamabad. In a public speech in May in Afghanistan’s eastern Nangarhar province, next to the Pakistani border, Mohib controversially referred to Pakistan as Heera Mandi, the red light area of Lahore. PM Imran's Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf led the counter onslaught.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pak-cabinet-slams-sharif-for-meeting-afghan-national-security-adviser/articleshow/84718135.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||India||India brings new narrative ahead of COP26, asks rich nations to reduce per capita emission by 2030||NEW DELHI: At a time when rich nations, backed by the UN climate body, have pitched for brining all emitters on board to commit for ‘net-zero’ emission goal or carbon neutrality by around mid-century, India has come out with a counter proposal asking them to bring down their own per capita emission to global average by 2030. The country brought this narrative on table while making its points on the concluding day of the G20 ministerial meeting on climate change and energy and even forced the participants to add this point in the Presidency statement in Naples, Italy on late Friday evening. India's per capita greenhouse gas (GHG) emission was around 1.96 tCO2e (tonne carbon dioxide equivalent) in 2016 which is less than one-third of the world’s per capita annual GHG emissions (6.55 tCO2e). On the other hand, the US has 17.6 tCO2e, Canada has 15.7 tCO2e, Australia has 14.9 tCO2e, Germany has 10.4 tCO2e, UK has 8.1 tCO2e, France has 6.6 tCO2e and China has 6.4 tCO2e of per capita annual emission. Citing how rich nations have already consumed most of the ‘carbon space’ available for developmental needs due to their huge emission in the past, Indian delegation intervened with a formal country statement on the issue. Noting “the pledges made by some countries to achieve net-zero GHG emissions or carbon neutrality by or around mid-century”, India said this may not be adequate in view of fast depleting available 'carbon space'. “Therefore, and keeping in view the legitimate need of developing countries to grow, we urge G20 countries to commit to bringing down per capita emissions to global average by 2030,” said the statement of Indian delegation, led by environment minister Bhupender Yadav, while finalising the G20 ministerial communique. The ministers of G20 countries then jointly agreed to include India’s remarks in the Presidency statement while noting that all the nations would together look forward to cooperating in identifying and addressing “related challenges and opportunities for all G20 members to pursue this effort (net-zero emission or carbon neutrality goal) effort”. India's power and renewable energy minister, R K Singh, too earlier brought the per-capita point on table while virtually addressing the G20 meet. He, while noting that the per capita emission of many developed countries was 2-3 times above the world average, underlined the need to bring it down to the global average as soon as possible. There have been a lot of diplomatic efforts to bring India on board to commit to a net-zero (reducing emission of greenhouse gases to zero) goal even as India has been among very few countries who have been well on track to meet their climate action targets under the Paris Agreement. India’s remarks assume significance at this juncture when the UN climate body has been pushing nations to commit higher emission targets to reach the Paris Agreement goal of keeping the global average temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century and make efforts to keep it at around 1.5 degree Celsius over the pre-industrial level (1850-1900). India’s narrative is, however, expected to dominate all diplomatic parleys and multilateral meetings ahead of the 26th session of the UN climate conference (COP26) in Glasgow, UK in November when the stakeholders would try to push for new and higher ambition to reach the intended goal of the Paris deal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-brings-new-narrative-ahead-of-cop26-asks-rich-nations-to-reduce-per-capita-emission-by-2030/articleshow/84718413.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||World||Govt officials world over among 1.4k WhatsApp users targeted: CEO||WASHINGTON: Senior government officials from across the world, including individuals in high national security positions who are “allies of the US”, were targeted by governments using the NSO Group spyware in a 2019 attack against 1,400 WhatsApp users, according to the messaging app’s chief executive officer, The Guardian reported. WhatsApp CEO Will Cathcart disclosed the new details about individuals who were targeted in the attack after revelations this week by the Pegasus Project, a collaboration of 17 media organisations which investigated NSO, the Israeli company that sells its powerful surveillance software to government clients around the world. Cathcart said that he saw parallels between the attack against WhatsApp users in 2019, which is now the subject of a lawsuit brought by WhatsApp against NSO, and reports about a massive data leak which are at the centre of the Pegasus Project. “The reporting matches what we saw in the attack we defeated two years ago, it is very consistent with what we were loud about then,” Cathcart said in an interview with The Guardian. In addition to the “senior government officials", WhatsApp found that journalists and human rights activists were targeted in the 2019 attack against its users. Many of the targets in the WhatsApp case, he said, had “no business being under surveillance in any way, shape or form”, the report said. “This should be a wake-up call for security on the internet, mobile phones are either safe for everyone or they are not safe for everyone,” he said. As per the report, Cathcart questioned NSO’s claim that the figure was in itself “exaggerated”, saying that WhatsApp had recorded an attack against 1,400 users over a two-week period in 2019. “That tells us that over a longer period of time, over a multi-year period of time, the numbers of people being attacked are very high,” he said, adding: “That's why we felt it was so important to raise the concern around this.” When WhatsApp says it believes its users were “”targeted”, it means the company has evidence that an NSO server attempted to install malware on a user's device, The Guardian said. When WhatsApp announced two years ago that its users had been targeted by the NSO malware, it said 100 of the 1,400 targets were journalists, human rights defenders and activists. The users were targeted through a WhatsApp vulnerability that was later fixed. As per the report, Cathcart said he had discussed the 2019 attack against WhatsApp users with governments around the world. He also praised the recent moves by Microsoft and others in the technology industry who are speaking out about the dangers of malware, and called on Apple — whose phones are vulnerable to malware infections — to adopt their approach, according to the report. “I hope that Apple will start taking that approach too. Be loud, join in. It’s not enough to say, most of our users don't need to worry about this. It's not enough to say 'oh this is only thousands or tens of thousands of victims'," Cathcart was quoted as saying. “If this is affecting journalists all around the world, this is affecting human rights defenders all around the world, that affects us all. And if anyone's phone is not secured that means everyone's phone is not secure,” he added. He also called on governments to help create accountability for spyware makers, the report said. The Guardian reported that WhatsApp had launched its lawsuit against NSO in late 2019, claiming that the Israeli company was responsible for sending malware to WhatsApp users' phones. A judge in the case pointed out that the underlying facts in the case — that malicious code owned by NSO was sent through WhatsApp's service — did not appear to be disputed. Instead, the lawsuit revolved around whether NSO's “sovereign customers” were to blame, or the company itself, the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/govt-officials-world-over-among-1-4k-whatsapp-users-targeted-in-2019-whatsapp-ceo/articleshow/84719062.cms||---
---||India||Use of spyware tech to snoop on critics, journos concerning: US||WASHINGTON: The Biden administration on Saturday said the US was concerned about misuse of spyware technology, while adding that it didn't have any special insights into the India situation. Asked specifically about alleged use by the Indian government of the Pegasus spyware, acting assistant secretary for South and Central Asian affairs Dean Thompson said, "The whole notion of using this type of technology against civil society, or regime critics, or journalists, or anybody like that through extrajudicial means is always concerning." "We don’t have any particular special insights into the India case. I know this is a broader issue, but I will say that we’ve been quite vocal about trying to find ways for companies to be able to ensure that their technology is not used in these types of ways. And we will certainly continue to press those issues," he told reporters during a conference call on Friday. Thompson also confirmed that US secretary of state Antony Blinken would raise the issues of human rights and civil liberties, though in a constructive way, at talks with his Indian counterpart scheduled for Tuesday. "I will tell you that we will raise it, and we will continue that conversation, because we firmly believe that we have more values in common on those fronts than we don’t," he said. Washington had toned down its lectures on human rights issues during the Trump dispensation given its own dodgy record at home, but reinstallation of a Democratic administration marks a return to the issue dear to liberal and progressive constituencies. Many critics contend that such sermons are typically directed at democratic countries such as India while totalitarian regimes get a free pass. The Biden administration's sermon on spyware comes amid a domestic flap involving allegations by Fox News host Tucker Carlson that the US National Security Agency agency was spying on him and reading his emails in an effort to take him off the air. The NSA has denied the allegation. The wrinkles surrounding human rights and civil liberties issues aside, US officials talked up the strategic heft of ties between the two countries, affirming that bilateral discussions will focus on expanding security, defence, cyber, and counterterrorism cooperation "to ensure a safer and more secure world." The officials also dismissed notions of "jitters" in the administration about the Biden White House cooling off ties with India, saying "we see the relationship continuing at a very high level, and India will of course remain an incredibly important partner." They also confirmed that Blinken and defence secretary Austin would host their Indian counterparts for the annual US-India 2+2 ministerial dialogue later this year, and Blinken would discuss prospects of an in-person quad summit involving leaders of US, India, Japan, and Australia. The officials danced around the issue of US bailing out of Afghanistan and throwing New Delhi's equities there under the bus, saying, all of Afghanistan’s neighbours and countries in the region have an interest in a peaceful, secure, and stable Afghanistan, which can only be accomplished through a negotiated political settlement that brings an end to 40 years of conflict. "India, of course, is a critical partner in the region, and we welcome India’s shared commitment to peace and supporting economic development in Afghanistan," Thomson said.

While 10th graders logged 100%, 12th graders recorded 99.95%. Last year, the pass percentage for 10th graders was 99.91% and their seniors, 99.06%. All 21,386 students in the state who took the ICSE (class 10) exam passed, while of the 2,040 students who appeared for the ISC (class 12), only one student could not clear it. The marks for both classes were calculated on the basis of earlier exams and assessments. The southern region outperformed the rest of the country in Class 10, while for Class 12, it was joined by the western region (99.91%). No merit list of toppers this yrAcross India and abroad, 2,19,499 students appeared for the Class 10 exams, while 94,011 students appeared for the Class 12 exams. The national pass percentage was 99.98% and 99.76% respectively. The council did not announce toppers for the second year now. Last year, many papers were cancelled, while this year, the examination was scrapped altogether in view of the pandemic. The council devised a method to compile marks and tabulate results. For Class 10 students, results were tabulated with average marks scored in various tests/ examinations in Class 9 and Class 10 and internal assessment marks for projects and practical work were also considered. For students in Class12, the average marks of Class 11 and Class 12 were taken into account, with the average of Class 10 Marks (English + best four subjects), and marks for project work or practical examination. “Data submitted by schools were analysed by reputed statisticians from premier institutions in the country along with senior CISCE officials. While devising the methodology for computing marks, the endeavour was to ensure fairness to all candidates to the best possible extent,” the council said. Many schools in Bengaluru recorded a pass percentage of 100% and had students scoring above 90%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-logs-100-icse-results-99-95-in-isc/articleshow/84720227.cms||---

Fresh infections, in fact, have remained under 2,000 consistently since July 11. As of July 23, the state had 24,127 active cases. The last time active cases hovered around this mark was on March 30 (25,541), before the second wave struck and Karnataka grappled with the highest caseload in the country. In mid-May, the state had 6 lakh active cases. After that difficult phase, during which Karnataka overtook Maharashtra, the situation eased significantly in the first week of July and the state’s position on the Covid-19 chart improved from first to third. Currently, Karnataka is fourth on the chart, which is topped by Kerala. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu are placed second and third, respectively, while Andhra Pradesh is in the fifth spot. The five states account for nearly 75 per cent of all active cases in the country, while they are home to just a little over half the total infections. In terms of total infections, Maharashtra (62.5 lakh) continues to top the table, followed by Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. India’s active caseload fell below 5 lakh in the first week of July and it has remained that way. As of July 23, more than 4 lakh patients were under treatment across the country compared to 4.7 lakh as of July 3. In Karnataka, Bengaluru Urban continues to be the worst-affected district, accounting for 34 per cent (8,364) of the active cases. Dakshina Kannada (2,079 cases) and Hassan (1,947) occupied the second and third positions, respectively, according to the July 23 data. Mysuru (1,760) and Tumakuru (1,362) have also reported a high number of active cases. Udupi is the only other district with more than 1,000 active cases, while five other districts recorded more than 500. As of July 23, Karnataka had reported over 28.3 lakh discharges, while the total cases stood at more than 28.9 lakh. Nearly 98 per cent of the patients as of that day had recovered, while 1.2 per cent — 36,328 — had died.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktakas-active-tally-lowest-in-4-months/articleshow/84720232.cms||Chethan Kumar
---||India||Must watch Chinese inroads into Myanmar: Bipin Rawat||NEW DELHI: India needs to closely monitor the emerging situation in Myanmar, where China is making further inroads after international sanctions were imposed on the country following the military coup in February, Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat said on Saturday. “The BRI (Belt and Road Initiative) of China is bound to get further impetus with the sanctions on Myanmar,” said Gen Rawat, speaking at a webinar on the “Opportunities and Challenges in North East India”, organised by the Indian Military Review here.  The country’s senior-most military officer said “return of normalcy” in Myanmar would augur well for the region, especially India, because of “our historical and cultural linkages” with the country. The northeast region of India, which is connected to the rest of the country by the narrow and vulnerable Siliguri Corridor or the “Chicken’s Neck”, is of “immense geostrategic significance”, especially in the backdrop of China having “mischievously set eyes on the region”, he said. The presence of Rohingya refugees is another “emerging areas of concern” for the region. “This could be exploited by radical Islamic groups to foment trouble and undermine peace and security in the region,” he said. Apart from China, there are several other security concerns for India like insurgent activity, illegal migration and drug-trafficking due to the “porous” borders in the northeast region. Noting that the internal security challenges in the northeast have “serious international dimensions”, Gen Rawat said, “Vigilant and alert central and state security forces, augmented by regional and international diplomaticmilitary cooperation, will be crucial in keeping up with these security challenges.” There has been a major reduction in violence due to “sustained counter-insurgency operations” in the northeast region and “loss of safe havens” for extremist outfits in neighbouring countries like Bangladesh, Bhutan and Myanmar in recent years. “We need to ensure these positive developments are consolidated further through peace talks,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/must-watch-chinese-inroads-into-myanmar-bipin-rawat/articleshow/84720256.cms||---

The All India Seafarer & General Workers’ Union said it has written a letter to Minister of Ports, Shipping & Waterways Sarbananda Sonowal, the directorate general of shipping and the ministry of external affairs on the unofficial “ban” on Indian seafarers from entering Chinese waters as a result of which “21,000 Indian sailors are facing job losses, directly or indirectly”. Talking to TOI, Abhijeet Sangle, working president of the Union, alleged, “It’s China’s tactics to isolate our seafarers so as to provide better prospects to its sailors. We have written a letter to Union minister Sarbananda Sonowal, DG shipping a and MEA to seriously look into the issue. In fact, I have sent a letter to foreign minister S Jaishankar separately, requesting him to take immediate action. Earlier, this year, our Indian sailors faced a similar problem when China did not allow two foreign ships with Indian crew to berth at its port as a result of which our crew of over 40 members were stranded off China for several weeks.” When TOI enquired about the union’s letter, DG (Shipping) Amitabh Kumar said, “We have not received any official communication from either the Chinese government or the ministry of external affairs about any such ban. Our data doesn’t suggest anything of that sort (that over 21,000 sailors are facing any job problem). These are personal views of some people. We can't keep reacting to everyone's views.” MEA sources also said they had no knowledge of the letter.

Communist Soviet Union collapsed. The Cold War ended. And India embarked on a bold new path of economic reforms. Thirty years later, the global order is changingCaptain Sanjay Parashar, member of the National Shipping Board, told TOI that China is now dictating terms. “It has asked foreign shipping companies that they can lift or unload the cargo from China only if they agree to its terms, which is not to employ Indian crew on board their vessels if they want to enter the Chinese waters. There is a commercial cost to it. Either you have to divert your ship which means adding to your fuel cost or replace the Indian crew, which too costs the company a lot— replacing a crew of five members costs around $300,000 to $500,000. This is basically China’s ‘goondagardi’ as it wants to flex its muscles,” he said, adding that the “issue can be resolved only through diplomacy”.

Though China is not giving any official explanation for such a boycott, some consider Indians in the high-risk category due to the Delta variant. But this is a hollow explanation as Delta cases are now found in so many countries." Our sailors are among the best in the industry. But because of China’s move, shipping companies especially based in the US, UK and western Europe whose vessels are China-bound have stopped employing the Indian crew. In fact, such companies are now taking more Filipinos, Vietnamese and Chinese nationals.” He said India should reciprocate China’s move by banning its sailors. Indian sailors constitute a dominant force in the shipping industry. Till last year, India sent around 2.4 lakh sea-farers annually. Of them, 2.1 lakh sea-farers worked on foreign ships and 30,000 on Indian ships.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/china-ban-on-entry-of-indian-sailors-says-seafarers-body/articleshow/84720445.cms||Surendra Singh
---||India||2 years after CBFC nod to film, UIDAI seeks ‘28 cuts'||Filmmaker Suman Ghosh — who had to contend with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) in 2017 before it freed the “cow” and four other words that were asked to be beeped out from his documentary on Nobel laureate Amartya Sen — has run into trouble again. This time it’s with his feature film ‘Aadhaar’, a Hindi comic drama. Only it’s not a tussle between Ghosh and the certifying body, but a “super censor” in the form of Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) that issues Aadhaar card. The UIDAI has proposed “28 cuts” to the film — already cleared by CBFC in 2019 — stalling its release without the legal authority to do so. “The film was meant to release on February 5 this year. Just after the trailer launch in January, my producer got a call from UIDAI officials asking for a screening,” says Ghosh, who teaches economics at Miami and makes films in India. “I wasn’t in India then. The film was screened for officials in Delhi in February after which they suggested 28 cuts for clearance.” The film, written and directed by Ghosh and co-produced by Jio Studios and Drishyam Films, is set in 2010 and tells the story of Pharsua (a fictional villager from Jharkhand) who falls into an abyss when the village numerologist makes ominous predictions based on his Aadhaar number. “It then follows Pharsua’s journey where the significance of having an Aadhaar card gets superseded by superstitious elements that often create obstacles in rolling out national initiatives,” explains Ghosh, stressing that the film, in fact, “bolsters the case of the Aadhaar initiative”. The film’s release is currently hinged on objections that range from the use of a dialogue ‘Main Aadhaar Hoon’— a play on the title of an Amitabh Bachchan film ‘Main Azaad Hoon’ — “which officials claim is demeaning the Aadhaar programme”; a scene where a villager, trying to understand the privacy issue, asks: ‘Sarkar kya hamare ghusal khane mein ghus jayenge?’ (Will the government come into our bathrooms?); and a sequence where a man wants to get his cataract removed for Aadhaar’s biometrics. “They felt it was an improper representation of their biometric recognition system,” says Ghosh. TOI reached out to a UIDAI official in Delhi who confirmed the department had “watched the film and asked for edits” but refused to comment further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2-years-after-cbfc-nod-to-film-uidai-seeks-28-cuts/articleshow/84720534.cms||Mohua Das

State health officials said despite having given two dates for arrival of the Bharat Biotech-manufactured vaccine in Kolkata this week, the consignments failed to turn up. Now, with the Covaxin crisis hitting KMC vaccination centres, the government hospital CVCs, too, have been forced to ration doses. According Swathya Bhawan sources, the state currently needs about 2.5 lakh Covaxin doses just for the second jab. “Around 2.5 lakh who had taken the first dose of Covaxin are due for the second one. We need to administer them at the earliest,” said an official. The state has received around 34 lakh doses of Covaxin since the beginning of the inoculation drive. “We were supposed to get Covaxin consignments on June 21 and on June 23, but they did not arrive. We have been given July 26 as the next schedule. If the delivery does not fail this time, we should be able to overcome the crisis to a certain degree,” said Ashim Das Malakar, state family welfare officer. The state on Saturday had only about 1 lakh Covaxin doses, leading to many CVCs not getting any dose or getting a limited number. “We are managing to offer Covaxin to about 50 people a day out of 1,500 doses,” said a source at SSKM Hospital. Bengal was supposed to get 75 lakh vaccine doses in July. So far, the state has received 54 lakh, including 12 lakh Covishield doses, on Friday. “We have the capacity for more than one-and-a-half crore doses a month. The only constraint is an inadequate supply,” said director health services Ajay Chakraborty. “For Covaxin, most people are coming for the second dose while the number of those asking it for the first dose is low. So we can offer the jab to both categories easily,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/supply-crisis-prompts-govt-hosp-vax-units-to-restrict-covaxin-jabs/articleshow/84715832.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

After complaints from some people that they had neither received a message nor a certificate after they were vaccinated, cops posed as recipients at the vaccination camp held by Mondal and caught him red handed. Mondal, who lives in a rented house in Rupnagar, reportedly held four such camps and charged recipients Rs 500 per jab. “We are compiling a list of recipients and checking the health status,” said a health department official. The health department will also check their antibody status to ascertain whether genuine vaccines were administered. Initial probe revealed Mondal stole one vial against 100 and vaccinated people in his locality. Cops got in touch with the health department to run a medico-legal probe into it. The panel led by chief medical officer (health) Diamond Harbour Debasis Roy seized vaccine logs from the health centre. Baruipur SP Vaibav Tiwari said, “We recovered two vials and a few syringes and needles from the accused.

He also asked them to create awareness about the NRCs in the state among the people. In a press statement, Pandey said nearly 22.09% of the children in Bihar were malnourished of whom 8.8% were extremely serious and needed immediate medical aid. “Raise awareness about NRCs so that parents can take their malnourished children there for proper treatment. Provide diet charts with proper meal plans based on the age and height of the kids,” the minister told the officials and added that healthy food was important for the mental and physical development of children. The NRCs also provide accommodation facilities to mothers along with their children. “Sanitation and nutrition committees have been formed in rural areas where mothers are told about the importance of a healthy diet and nutritious food,” Pandey said. The minister pointed out that health experts, accredited social health activists, and auxiliary nurse midwives had been roped in to look after the malnourished kids at the NRCs. He also accepted that the health department was finding it difficult to identify such children amid the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent closure of schools.

University sources said nearly 175-180 fresh guest faculties are to be appointed as per the statutory guidelines on reservation roster, requisite qualifications, past-teaching experiences, research, degrees and publications besides other criteria for appointing the teachers. “We are aware about the shortage of regular teachers in the colleges and postgraduate departments of the university. The matter of appointments is related to revenue expenditure and other procedural perquisites. Therefore, steps as per statutory norms, have to be taken before appointments. We have already taken initiatives in this direction,” TMBU vice-chancellor Prof Neelima Gupta told this newspaper. TMBU registrar Niranjan Prasad Yadav said preliminary assessment of the requirements of guest faculties and steps for permission from the state education department and the chancellor of universities will be taken. “Roster for reservation and other procedures besides advertisement for appointment has to be made after getting the permission from the authorities concerned,” he said. Incidentally, the process for appointment of guest lecturers is being initiated amid demand for the same by Sangharshil Atithi Sikshak Sangh (SASS). Yadav admitted that a section of claimant guest teachers had met him. “The applicants should have patience and have faith in the system. Appointments will be made as per statutory norms and not under any pressure. As per their preliminary assessment, nearly 175-180 fresh guest faculties will be needed. All the appointments will be under transparent rules and regulations,” he said. SASS president Amlendu Kumar said they have been waiting for several months but nothing has been made so far. “We will be forced to launch agitation if steps for appointments are not taken immediately,” he added.

AP water resources department engineer-in-chief C Narayana Reddy said the government intends to draw water from Pothireddypadu head regulator at Srisailam through the Handri Niva Sujala Sravanti for drinking and irrigation needs of Rayalaseema region and drinking water supply to Chennai city. Stating that Telangana has utilised 43.25 tmcft of water at Srisailam, 27.23 tmcft at Nagarjuna Sagar and 11.92 tmcft at Pulichintala reservoir for power generation without any indent or intimation to KRMB, he said the neighbouring state has utilised a total of 82.40 tmcft of water for power generation and urged the KRMB to account the same against its agreed share of 299 tmcft. “Considering the ad-hoc arrangement to share water in 66:34 ratio between AP and Telangana respectively, and utilisation of 82.40 tmcft by Telangana, will give right for AP to use 160 tmcft of water for its drinking and irrigation needs,” Narayana Reddy said in his letter. He further informed the KRMB about the present water levels at all three projects. The water level in Srisailam is 853.70 ft with storage of 88.47 tmc, Nagarjuna Sagar is 536.50 ft with 181.11 tmc storage, and Pulichintala is now at 173.71 ft with storage of 43.79 tmc. “The Jurala project in Telangana and Prakasam barrage in Andhra Pradesh are receiving surplus water,” he wrote, adding that as over 4 lakh cusecs of flood inflows are expected into Srisailam reservoir, the KRMB should clear the indent to draw water for Rayalaseema and Chennai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-writes-to-krmb-seeks-nod-to-draw-water-for-rayalaseema-tn/articleshow/84714739.cms||Gopi Dara

She reportedly took the step after a tiff with her husband, who lives abroad, and was arrested from her native village, Laxmipur Babu in Kushinagar district of Uttar Pradesh, on Saturday. The SHO of Kateya police station, Suman Kumar Mishra, told TOI on Saturday that Noorjahan’s fourth daughter, Afrina Khatoon (5), managed to survive as she was spotted by some villagers and rescued. She was immediately rushed to a hospital where her health was stated to be stable. “The deceased have been identified as Gulabsa Khatoon (8), Nusaba Khatoon (3), and Saheba Khatoon (2.5),” he added. According to police sources, Noorjahan, who lived with her in-laws and daughters in Kotwa Khas village under the Kateya police station area, had a fight with her husband, Aslam Alam, over the phone on Friday night. “In a fit of rage, she packed all her belongings and left for Laxmipur Babu in Kushinagar with her four daughters. She, however, threw the girls in a nearby pond and fled the scene. Luckily, the villagers heard their screams and rescued one of them,” Mishra said, adding that police received information about the incident at 9pm on Friday.

As cases began to drop, they opened their shops and factories, and the sign of recovery is evident in the increase in professional tax collected this year. It has risen by 33% against tax collected in 2020 and is almost at par with pre-pandemic levels. AMC officials said that professional tax collected between April 1 and July 19 in 2019 was Rs 54.63 crore, which dropped by Rs 13.46 crore to Rs 41.17 crore in the same period in 2020. However, this year, tax collected between April 1 and July 15 has crossed the Rs 54-crore mark and stood at Rs 54.54 crore — merely Rs 9 lakh less than 2019 pre-pandemic collection. The increase in tax collection was highest in the western parts of the city mainly because trade resumed faster there. However, when it comes to the rise in percentage, the most growth was noticed in industrial areas in the eastern part of the city. “After coronavirus shut down the city, industries closed and labourers working in industrial areas left. This resulted in job loss,” said officials. An analysis of data from individual zones reveals that North Zone witnessed a 31% drop in 2020 in professional tax revenue. But this year, the same zone registered a 45% increase as compared to 2020. This zone largely comprises areas like Naroda Road, Sardarnagar, Noblenagar, Kubernagar, Meghaninagar, Asarwa, Krishnanagar, Thakkarnagar, and Saraspur which are populated by small establishments, garages, wholesalers, plastic product sellers and units indulging in metal works. Officials said that South Zone, which includes Nikol, Vastral, and Odhav industrial belt, witnessed a 29% drop in professional tax revenue in 2020. However, it registered more than 60% increase this year compared to the laast. Figures from April to July 19 this year reflect the second wave where the industry and even offices functioned with limited staff, said an AMC official. “Analysis reveals that small traders and offices which were closed are now back on track and have even recalled employees that were relieved in 2020,” said an official. Gujarat levies Rs 200 professional tax on those earning monthly salaries of Rs 12,000 and above. “An increase in the number of those paying Rs 200 tax indicates that the salary of employees for whom tax was paid is over Rs 12,000. Also, the increase in numbers was substantial due to restarting of firms and individual offices,” said officials. Traders have demanded a waiver in professional tax from the government for 2020 but the decision is still pending, said AMC officials. However, so far no one has come forward and paid their arrears for 2020. Tax professionals and industry experts state that the compliance for professional tax payment has improved due to which collection has shown a surge. Explaining this, Pathik Patwari, secretary of Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry said, “Due to the pandemic, compliance was impacted. A lot of people were unable to pay their professional tax dues. Many firms and establishments, whose pending dues were high, have been served notices due to which compliance has increased. This has led to improved tax collection.” He added, “Post-pandemic, many shops and offices moved to smaller premises to cut costs. Whenever one registers a new property, all professional tax dues must be cleared. This could also be a reason for increase in compliance.” Some tax professionals alleged that a fixed ceiling charge is being levied by the civic authorities instead of going by slabs when it comes to professional tax collection, due to which, the tax collection could have shown a dip. Last year, professional tax compliance remained largely unmet due to the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/jobs-back-professional-tax-haul-in-abad-close-to-pre-covid-level/articleshow/84717060.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The devotee, who works in Singapore, penned his first book ‘Daivam Tho Na Anubhavalu’, which is a compilation of 35 short stories on divine experiences, during the Covid-19 lockdown last year. The book was released in October 2020. Vinod Parimi later got the book translated into English with the help of Mary Varghese and his niece Sai Latha. Copies of ‘Divine Experiences’, launched on July 20, were handed over to TTD’s Jeeyar Swamis, priests and senior officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/proceeds-of-spiritual-book-donated-to-ttd/articleshow/84715657.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar: Suresh Kumar removed as Muzaffarpur mayor after losing no-confidence motion||PATNA: Muzaffarpur mayor Suresh Kumar was removed from his post on Saturday after he lost a no-confidence motion that some ward councillors moved against him. They levelled charges of corruption, incompetence and slackness on his part in carrying out development works. Muzaffarpur town commissioner Vivek Ranjan Maitrey said, “Only 39 of the 48 ward councillors took part in voting. The no-confidence motion received the support of 31 councillors while eight votes were cast against it.” Although two councillors — Geeta Devi (ward number 32) and Javed Ansari (ward number 6) — were present, they did not take part in voting and left the venue. The mayor was not present on the occasion. The proceedings of the no-confidence motion were conducted under the chairmanship of deputy mayor Manmardan Shukla. Town commissioner Vivek Ranjan Maitrey monitored the proceedings, which started at around 11am at Amrapali Auditorium on Club Road in the town. Maitrey later told the media that he would send a report to the state election commission on the day’s development. “A fresh date of election of the new mayor will be announced by the commission,” he told this newspaper. Authoritative sources said a new mayor would have to be elected within 30 days of the position falling vacant. A day earlier, deputy mayor Shukla somehow managed to retain his chair. “According to the provisions, the deputy mayor will operate as the mayor till the appointment of a new mayor,” a senior official of the district administration said. Among 40 ward councillors taking up the no-confidence motion against the deputy mayor, 11 took part in voting. While eight votes were against the no-confidence motion, two were in its support. One vote was counted invalid. Altogether 29 ward councillors, however, abstained from the proceedings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/suresh-removed-as-muzaffarpur-mayor-after-losing-no-confidence-motion/articleshow/84716630.cms||Ramashankar
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Ancient temple goes under Krishna waters||TIRUPATI: Since 2003, around this time of the year, the ancient Sangameshwara temple located at the confluence of seven tributaries near Muchumarri in Kurnool district gets submerged in the floodwaters. It has happened again this year too, thanks to heavy rains in the upstream areas. The temple might be submerged, but the rituals never stop. On Saturday, braving rains and swirling waters, priests rode a boat to perform special rituals near the submerged temple. With several projects in the upstream areas in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Kurnool district brimming to their full capacity owing to heavy rains in the last one week, the respective states have been releasing waters downstream from the projects. As water levels continued to rise at Srisailam project, flood waters entered Sangameshwara temple on July 20. With waters continuing to rise over the last four days, the temple, barring its pinnacles, got almost submerged. Priests, who reached the temple on boats, performed special rituals to the pinnacles moments before the pinnacles too went under the water. The temple first got submerged when the Srisailam dam was constructed in 1981. After remaining under water for two decades, the structure resurfaced in 2003, following which idol and pilgrim worship were revived. Since then, the temple gets submerged every year whenever the upstream areas receive copious amounts of rainfall, and resurfaces when the water level drops at the Srisailam project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ancient-temple-goes-under-krishna-waters/articleshow/84715502.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

By joining the PRME community, IIM Visakhapatnam commits to aligning institutional strategies and operations with PRME principles, such as advancing values such as sustainability, responsibility, and ethics in teaching, research, and thought leadership. While adhering to these principles, the institute would work to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. IIM-V celebrated its fourth and fifth annual convocation on Saturday. NITI Aayog vice-chairman Dr Rajiv Kumar, who attended as the chief guest, said the Covid-19 pandemic struck India as it was bouncing back from the bottoming out of its economic cycle in the last quarter of 2019-20. “But thankfully, we are beginning to get out of it. All the economic indicators—be it high-frequency indicators, investment indicators, capacity expansion in some critical industries like steel and others—are beginning to look up,” said Dr Kumar. “Of course, it will depend entirely on the nature and shape of the pandemic as we move forward. Even if we have a third wave, we are far better prepared than earlier. So its impact on economic activity would not be as big as it was during the first and second waves,” he said. “India has the third largest startup system in the world today. India is currently home to 21 unicorns valued at $73.2 billion dollars and this is expected to grow to 50 unicorns by 2022. But India is still in the 48th place in the global innovation index. We should set an aspirational target to break through into the top 10. Unless we successfully innovate, we will be left behind,” said Dr Kumar. The vice-chairman reminisced attending an economic conference at Andhra University in Visakhapatnam in 1975. Chairperson, board of governors, IIM-V, Hari S Bhartia, said that the hybrid or digital mode of teaching and learning is here to stay. “It would provide a great opportunity for the institutions to offer a judicious combination of online and offline content for the young as well as experienced professionals,” said Bhartia. He suggested the graduating students be humble and agile. Speaking about social media, Bhartia said the vibrancy of an organisation is today measured by its scale and reach on social media. “It has become a building block for brand and image building of an organisation. It helps the organisations to maintain a constant context-relevant, customised and personalised connection with its stakeholders,” said Bhartia. IIM-V director Prof M Chandrasekhar presented the director’s annual report. The institute awarded various awards and gold medals to meritorious students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/iim-v-becomes-signatory-of-un-global-network/articleshow/84715675.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Varanasi||River expert seeks PM Narendra Modi’s help in keeping crescent shape of Ganga in Kashi intact||VARANASI: Noted river engineer and former professor at the Indian Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University (IIT-BHU) Prof UK Choudhary has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting him to “help maintain the crescent shape of river Ganga in Varanasi”. He explained that the ornamental crescent shape of the Ganga is the unique morphology of the river, and this is the path of least resistance of friction, form and pressure drag forces of the soil of Varanasi. “This is the anatomy which defines the development of centrifugal and centripetal forces in upper and bottom layers of flows responsible for generations of secondary current and transportation of fine clay and pollutant particles towards the concave bank (city side bank) and that of sand on the convex bank (sand bedside bank), respectively,” he added. He urged the PM to help “keep Maa Ganga in crescent shape in Varanasi”. He further explained that the Ganga/river water longitudinally runs circulating and vibrating on the cross section. Thus, the sustainability in the crescent shape of the Ganga at Varanasi is only due to the Assi and Varuna, the tributaries of the Ganga. As the Assi has been shifted, the Ganga left the Assi ghat forever. The Varuna (responsible for filling the erosion pockets) and Assi (responsible for keeping the sediment load in suspension) are needed for the protection and conservation of boundary conditions for the crescent shape. This, conceptually, must be realized. Reminding the PM of his statement ‘Maa Ganga ne humein bulaya hai’ (Mother Ganga called me), Choudhary urged him to help the Ganga to retain her original crescent shape morphology. The Assi river needs to be returned to her original position at Assi ghat in the form of a river not of a nullah. Regarding the construction of the spur at Lalita Ghat and development of the channel in sand bed to facilitate the cargo/ship, he said that the massive work of the spur at Lalita ghat is with different solid materials arranged in different forms not able to create the resonance with Ganga. As such, the anatomy and morphology of the Ganga has been permanently changed. The dynamics of the region in turbulence, responsible for carrying the sediment will be damped out. This will cause more sedimentation. Thus, the Ganga will leave the ghat in the upstream and sedimentation and pollutants logging are bound to take place in the downstream of Lalita ghat, he argued. In this way, the crescent shape of the Ganga will slowly change. And the pollutants logging will be very acute. The wall created along the ghats will restrict the ground water movement and the water logging problem in the city will increase. Thus, the work of the spur and the channel on the sand bed (constructed against the centripetal force, secondary current) are fundamentally wrong. Choudhary also questioned the efficiency of the sewage treatment plants (STPs), saying that an STP is capable of removing the organic pollutant load maximum up to 50% only at the cost of several fold enhancement of microbiological load. And it is causing the pollution of all five constituents of Nature. “Thus, it has been wrongly considered as the master tool for Ganga pollution management. The recent algal growth in the Ganga water is due to discharge of pollutants from the STP,” he said, adding that the STP system is fully useful only when it is properly situated on the sand bed and partially useful when it is properly linked with the sand bed. He said that the design discharges of STPs, possibly, are based on the monsoon period discharges of drains. They need to be based on the maximum discharge of drain in lean period and the BOD load of that period. The quantum of pollutant treatment and the running period of the STPs should function at R-level (reduced level) of Ganga water. This is because the dilution, diffusion and dispersion potentials of the Ganga go on increasing with level. The STP, thus needs to run nearly for 8-9 months only. “Investment of several crores of rupees under Namami Gange programme is just like a face-washing work of the diseased Ganga. This investment should have been made for the treatment of the base level diseases of the Ganga,” said Choudhary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/river-expert-seeks-pms-help-in-keeping-crescent-shape-of-ganga-in-kashi-intact/articleshow/84714972.cms||---

These people had drowned in the river after a boat capsized on Friday night. The toll may increase as two people are still missing. The incident took place near the flooded Namapur village under Chak Mehsi police station area in Samastipur district around 9pm on Friday. SHO of Chak Mehsi police station Chandrakishore Tuddu said the bodies of seven people – Vijay Ram (33), his wife Rina Devi (27), their son Ravi Kumar (7), Aman Kumar (14) and his brother Rohit Kumar (13), Sushil Kumar Sah (35) and his brother Arjun Kumar (32) – were fished out till Saturda evening. The SHO said Vijay and others of his family were residents of Sakhura village under the Piyar police station area in Muzaffarpur district and the rest of the four victims were from Namapur village. Samastipur SP Manavjit Singh Dhillon said Rina’s parental home is in Namapur. “She had come to meet her ailing mother with her husband and son,” he added. Dhillon said a storm was passing from the area when the boat capsized. The SP said except the couple, the rest were returning home after regular buying essential items from a local market. “All bodies were fished out on Saturday as nothing could be done on Friday due to darkness. Search operation started on Saturday morning and continued till evening. It will resume again on Sunday morning,” the SP added. Meanwhile Kalyanpur BDO Dharmavir Kumar Prabhakar said an ex gratia of Rs 4 lakh and Rs 20,000 under other financial schemes have been provided to next of the kin of each victim from Kalyanpur block. “Documents for the dead couple have been readied and would be sent to Muzaffarpur district administration for disbursal of ex gratia amount,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/7-drown-as-boat-capsizes-in-bagmati/articleshow/84716123.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||War of words between two factions of Lok Janshakti Party continues||PATNA: The verbal duel between two factions of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) led by Jamui MP Chirag Paswan and his uncle and Union food processing industries minister Pashupati Kumar Paras, respectively, refuses to die down. On Saturday, functionaries of both the groups attacked each other and reiterated their support base. While Chirag-led faction alleged that Paras was busy meeting senior BJP leaders in Delhi, the rival group described Chirag’s ‘ashirvad yatra’ as an eyewash. Chirag-led faction’s spokesperson Rajesh Bhatt said the Jamui MP received massive support of the people from all sections of the society during his yatra, which was launched from a Dalit hamlet near Hajipur in Vaishali district on July 5. “People have posed faith in the leadership of Chirag. It is evident from the overwhelming response that he received from the people during his yatra. It has proved his popularity among masses,” Bhatt said. Chirag reached Jamui on Saturday where he was accorded a warm welcome by the supporters of the party at different places, such as Sikandara, Pirhinda, Mahadev Simaria Bazar and Kuchhari Chowk. Welcome arches were erected at different locations. On the other hand, Paras faction’s spokesperson Shravan Agrawal reiterated that the Union minister was the national president of the LJP, which got acceptance from none other than the Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla. Agrawal said before the split in LJP, Chirag used to spend his time in New Delhi and seldom visited Bihar. “He is now spending more time in Bihar and seldom visits Delhi,” he added. Agrawal described ‘ashirvad yatra’ as an eyewash. “Bhaade par ke log yatra mein shameel kiye ja rahen hain,” he alleged. On Friday, Paras along with party’s state chief Prince Raj called on vice-president M Venkaiah Naidu at the latter’s residence in New Delhi. Earlier, Prince had met Union ministers Amit Sah and J P Nadda. Agrawal, however, described their meeting as a courtesy visit after Paras’s induction into PM Narendra Modi’s cabinet. “That Paras led LJP is a part of the NDA government at the Centre sums it all,” Agrawal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/war-of-words-between-two-factions-of-ljp-continues/articleshow/84716323.cms||Ramashankar
---||Kolkata||Cannes Film Festival 2021: Tracing Golden Eye winner’s Kolkata connect||KOLKATA: Payal Kapadia’s ‘A Night of Knowing Nothing’, which won the Oeil d’or (Golden Eye) award for best documentary at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, has a strong Kolkata connection. Ranabir Das, a former student of Don Bosco Park Circus and the documentary’s cinematographer and editor, has walked the Cannes red carpet alongside the director. Moinak Bose, a former student of Scottish Church College and St Xavier's Collegiate School, is the film’s sound designer while Gobardanga’s theatre actor Bhumisuta Das has done its voice over.  Kapadia, Ranabir and Bose are alumni of the Film and Television Institute of India while Bhumisuta graduated from the National School of Drama in 2019. Bhumisuta DasAmong the cinematographers from Bengal who inspired Das are Subrata Mitra and Soumendu Roy. Besides, he is also inspired by the photography in all Ritwik Ghatak films, Ranjan Palit and Avik Mukhopadhyay.  “I have observed Avik da work, and there so much to learn even beyond creating beautiful images. That includes the way he collaborates with the directors and conducts himself on set, quietly and efficiently going about his work,” he said. Described by the director as a “found footage film”, the documentary was screened as part of the Directors’ Fortnight section, which runs alongside the main festival. In the documentary, L, a university student in India, writes letters to her estranged lover while he is away.  Through these letters, we get a glimpse into the drastic changes taking place around her. Merging reality with fiction, dreams, memories, fantasies and anxieties, an amorphous narrative unfolds. "While I did shoot a lot of the film, we also received a lot of footage from friends and other archives. So, in a way it became a found footage film. We even treated the footage shot by Payal and me as found footage. We shot our friends and our daily lives. So, it was perhaps easier for us to be more intimate than in other situations. We spent most of the pandemic editing the film in our apartment. As we had a lot of footage, it took a long time," Das said. With the material they had, it became very important for them to choose the form they wanted to give to the documentary. "We had in mind what we wanted to express, which was what many of us who had the privilege of going to public university were feeling. We decided it was best to use the unsent letters throughout the film, which would lend a personal touch to the very complicated situations we found ourselves in," he added. Describing his Cannes experience, Ranabir said, “More than the red carpet, just being at the festival was such a great experience, more so after months of restricted movement. It is great to get to watch the films of the masters I have idolized and so many exciting new filmmakers. What is more special is to present your film to an audience that is so appreciative and hungry for cinema.” Ranabir’s parents still live in Kolkata. Director Anik Dutta took to Facebook to share how Ranabir was his “favourite model” after he bought his first SLR and was the youngest crew member of ‘Bhooter Bhobishyot’. “Ray could not go to receive the Palme d’or personally in 1956 but he would’ve been happy to see a boy from his city walking the red carpet at Cannes,” Dutta wrote on Facebook. Touched by this comment, Ranabir said he learnt a lot while working on ‘Bhooter Bhobishyot’. “It was the first feature-length film I worked on. I learnt most of the basics of cinema, both in terms of form and practice, from Dutta and cinematographer Avik Mukhopadhyay,” he said from Marseilles where the documentary is being screened at FID. Growing up in Kolkata has, of course, inspired/influenced him. According to Das, Kolkata is the most “culturally forward” city in the country. “One is encouraged to participate in the arts from a very young age. So that will always be with me. We have a history of protest and fighting for what is right. Having said that, even in a relatively more progressive city like Kolkata, I feel we have a long way to go. Privileged people tend to romanticize the city to an extent that they don't see its problems. The resolve to fight must not disappear until we can achieve a more equal society for all strata of people in our city,” Das added. Incidentally, L’s character is Bengali, but she lives in Pune. Bhumisuta, who has done the voice over for L, could not make it to Cannes. She is extremely happy with the news of the award. Primarily associated with Gobardanga Naksha, she has acted in productions like ‘Binodini’ and ‘Shubha’ and also worked in Anuradha Kapur’s ‘Daughters Opera’ and Devashis Makhija’s short film. “This is not like a regular documentary. I went to Mumbai for 10 days of work. My voice over was partly in Hindi and partly in Bengali. Instead of a professional voice over artist, they wanted someone who could relate to their experience. It was a nice experience for me to work on this documentary. I am happy that it won this award at Cannes,” she said. Talking about the number of contemporary Indian films being officially selected at important international film festivals, Das said, "A lot of Indian films have been selected at important festivals in recent years. What we also have to consider is that here is the opportunity to make cinema in a country that is not part of the ‘industry’. Industrial filmmaking depends on formulas and that doesn't always interest an international audience. If a market can be created for non-formula films, both in terms of production funds and distribution, then we will see more such films being made and more representation in international film festivals,” he pointed out.  While it would be fantastic to have greater representation in big film festivals, Das highlights the importance of being able to “create a market for good films with local content for local people”. That would mean films made by and for the people. “Right now, cinema is controlled by money and profits in the hands of a few people,” he pointed out. On being asked about the biggest takeaway from Cannes, he said, “Although it is nice to be at film festivals in Cannes, we have to realise that the most important thing for filmmakers is the opportunities to make films, regardless of which festival will pick them up,” he said, adding that he has noticed that countries that have a lot of public funding in films and art are able to produce the films of directors who work fearlessly without the commercial success of the film in mind. “Producers also support this. I hope that in India too, we can have funding to support cinema made by creative people who may not have the access or means to do so. Then our cinema will truly thrive,” he signed off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tracing-golden-eye-winners-kol-connect/articleshow/84715877.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

She got a perfect 100 in mathematics, social studies and computer science, 99 each in English and Hindi and 96 in science. Aafreen, who wishes to become a doctor, told this reporter that she had not expected to perform so well even if “I have always been good at studies”. “The school allotted us marks on the basis of our performance in classes IX and X,” she said. Another SXHS student, Shivam Raj, who scored 99.6%, has started preparing for the Joint Entrance Examination and aspires to become an engineer. He said, “I am happy with my marks, but would have been more satisfied if I had written the exam. I think it is a little unfair to allot marks to students without making them write an exam.” With 99% marks, Don Bosco Academy’s Shashank Kumar dreams of becoming a doctor and serving the society. He said, “I have joined a coaching centre and am working hard to crack the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET).” Thanking the CISCE for not conducting the Class X exams amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Shashank recalled, “During the second wave, Covid claimed numerous lives and infected a large number of people.” Meanwhile, Nishidha Nidhi, a Class XII (ISC) student of St Joseph’s Convent High School-Bankipore, scored 100 each in mathematics, physics and biology, 99 in English and 97 in chemistry. She, however, pointed out that exams should have been conducted despite the pandemic. “I will always keep thinking that I secured these marks on the basis of what I had done in my previous classes and not on the basis of what I could have done in Class XII,” she added. Talking about the pandemic, Nishidha said, “It has taken a toll on the mental health of thousands of kids who were confined within the four walls of their houses and kept staring at computer screens for hours. They witnessed no development at all.” Nishidha, who is also preparing for the NEET, has decided to study BSc in Delhi University “if I fail to crack the exam”. Carmel High School’s Shina Noor Ahmad, an Arts student who got 99.5% in her ISC exam, wants to explore the field of journalism or become a civil servant. “Although there are numerous options to choose from, I am sure I will explore different fields and take a decision accordingly,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cisce-results-school-toppers-on-cloud-nine/articleshow/84717095.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Bihar: Concern as collegians flout Covid norms on campuses||PATNA: Even as the state government has allowed colleges and senior secondary schools to hold offline classes with 50% attendance from July 12 amid the pandemic, most educational institutions are finding it difficult to make their students observe the Covid protocols. Quite often, boys and girls can be seen moving inside the campuses without wearing their face masks properly and without maintaining the mandatory social distance, thereby enhancing the risk of getting infected with coronavirus. Principal of Magadh Mahila College, Shashi Sharma, said even as most classes are still running in online mode, girls are coming to the college to do their practical classes. “Staff rooms and laboratories are fully sanitised and students are not allowed to enter the campus without face mask. Still, some girls are found roaming on college grounds with their masks tied around their necks. When they see their teachers coming, they cover their mouth and nose with the mask. In fact, teachers have to remain on their toes to make them follow Covid- appropriate behaviour,” she said. B N College principal Raj Kishore Prasad said the college authorities are taking all the precautions for safeguarding the health of students by getting the entire campus sanitised and ensuring social distance between two students sitting in the classroom,. “We, however, become helpless when students ignore Covid-appropriate behaviour and move freely on roads outside the college. Most teachers are engaging classes in online mode, but there are many students who do not have proper electronic devices and internet connectivity to take full advantage of these online classes,” he said. J D Women’s College principal Shyama Roy said despite her best efforts, girls invariably make a crowd while filling up examination forms or depositing documents at the college counters. “The college has installed a mask vending machine from which a girl can easily fetch a mask at Rs 5 per piece. Unfortunately, some girls are still found without masks,” she said. Patna Science College principal Sri Ram Padmadeo said it is indeed very difficult for the authorities to ensure complete implementation of Covid norms by students inside or outside the campus. Health experts have, however, warned of serious consequences if the students continue to ignore Covid norms. “Covid has not gone as yet and there is every possibility of the emergence of the third wave soon. The authorities must take all these factors into consideration while allowing colleges and schools to reopen with full student attendance,” said state secretary of Indian Medical Association Dr Ajay Kumar. Aryabhatta Knowledge University’s medicine faculty dean Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said neglect of Covid-appropriate behaviour by the younger generation would prove colossal and invite the third wave of pandemic. Nalanda Medical College and Hospital’s deputy superintendent Dr Satish Kumar said even though the number of people getting infected with Covid-19 has gone down recently, it may increase significantly if the people do not follow Covid norms. “Students must be trained properly to adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour on the campus,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/concern-as-collegians-flout-covid-norms-on-campuses/articleshow/84716394.cms||B K Mishra

---||Visakhapatnam||Drowning claims over 1,500 lives a year in Andhra Pradesh||VISAKHAPATNAM: On average, over 1,500 people a year die due to drowning in Andhra Pradesh. The majority of victims in drowning incidents are youngsters. Unsafe beaches and lack of knowledge of swimming among youth are the prime reasons behind drowning deaths in the state. However, concrete steps to prevent drowning deaths are yet to be taken by authorities. According to the first World Health Organisation (WHO) regional assessment on drowning prevention, over 1,44,000 persons drowned in the Asia Pacific region in 2019, accounting for as much as 61% of global drowning deaths. The report was released ahead of World Drowning Prevention Day on July 25, and stated that drowning claimed the lives of an estimated 70,000 and 74,000 people in South-East Asia and the Western Pacific. A National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB-2019) report reveals that 1,554 people died by drowning in Andhra Pradesh. While 44% of the deaths were accidents, the rest were suicides and other causes. While Andhra Pradesh has several beaches, many are unsafe for visitors. The strong rip current, which is the main cause for drowning deaths in the state, is not constant and is normally generated during high tide and operates within a radius of 50 to 150 feet. The speed or power of suction can range between five to eight kilometres per hour, often turning beaches into death traps. Speaking to STOI, founder of Livein Adventures and AP state president for Royal Life Saving Society India, Balaram Naidu said the lack of safety infrastructure at beaches and on riverbanks leads to incidents of drowning every year. “Most of those who drown are youngsters without adequate swimming skills or non-swimmers. There is an urgent need to implement the best practices, such as train children in swimming and awareness to mitigate the drowning deaths,” he added. Apart from drowning deaths along the coastline, rivers in Krishna, East and West Godavari districts that receive massive inflows during the monsoon also contribute to cases of drowning. Yet the threat of drowning remains a largely unrecognised one despite the lives lost each year. Sometimes, retrieving bodies from the waters is a difficult task and search operations can go on for days, said a senior police officer. The WHO has come up with a number of recommendations on interventions to prevent drowning and policies, including daycare for children, use of barriers for controlling access to water, public awareness campaigns focused on behavioural change, and policies and legislation on water safety, including regulation of recreational boating and maritime transport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/drowning-claims-over-1500-lives-a-year-in-ap/articleshow/84714824.cms||Nalla.Babu

Reiterating his demand for a caste-based census in the country, Nitish said Bihar assembly had unanimously passed a resolution on February 18, 2019 and again on February 27, 2020, seeking caste-wise enumeration of population. He said both the resolutions were sent to the Centre with a request to hold caste-wise enumeration. “I will once again request the Centre to hold a caste-wise census. The caste-wise census must be done at least once. If we know the exact number of different castes, we can work towards their betterment,” Nitish told mediapersons on the sidelines of a transport department function here. Nitish also pointed out that the socio-economic caste census (SECC) was conducted in the country after 2010. “As the SECC was not conducted properly, no meaningful result came out of it. The SECC’s report was prepared in 2013, but it was never published or put in public domain. The caste-based census must be conducted once so that people could be aware of the population of poor families (except SC/ ST). Once a caste-based census is conducted, people and planners would know the accurate population of any specific caste,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hold-caste-based-census-nitish-urges-centre-again/articleshow/84716841.cms||Madan Kumar

Inoculation is likely to remain affected for some more days in the week as the district has received very few doses. A statement issued by NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said that the civic body did not get sufficient quantity of doses of Covishield from the government, therefore, there will be no vaccination in NMC and government centres on Sunday. The NMC had around 6,000 doses of Covaxin left after vaccination on Saturday. It received 8,800 doses on Saturday. Still, five centres of Covaxin will remain closed on Sunday. The district got 45,000 doses of Covishield on Saturday. Of them, 27,000 were supplied to the NMC and remaining 18,000 to Zilla Parishad (ZP). Still, the civic body will not carry out vaccination in 148 centres of Covishield on Sunday. But the stock of Covishield is likely to be exhausted in a day if vaccination is resumed on Monday. There is no communication from the government about the next stock. On Saturday, the NMC continued vaccination only for 45-plus, that too in limited manner at Covishield centres. The stock was over and centres closed by 1pm. Covaxin doses continued for 18-plus at five centres. On Saturday, 9,938 people took the jab in NMC’s centres while 986 were administered vaccine at 14 private centres. Thus, 10,924 people benefited in the city on Saturday. ZP continued vaccination in rural areas on Saturday and covered 3,139 people. Thus, 14,063 people took the jab in the district on Saturday. The demand has increased manifold from resumption of vaccination of 18-44 age group on June 23. But the district has continued to receive insufficient quantity of doses. Therefore, vaccination could not happen on 19 of last 32 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-vax-in-city-today-drive-to-be-hit-for-few-more-days/articleshow/84714534.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Addressing devotees at the Gorakhnath temple, he said that the tradition of ‘guru-shishya’ (teacher-taught) in the country is 5,000 years old which is unparalleled in the world. “We are celebrating the importance of ‘guru’ (teacher) for the past 5,000 years. Maharshi Ved Vyas gave a new direction to India. Our history is much older than 5,000 years. Any other culture or civilization does not have such an old written history.” On Covid-19 pandemic, the CM said, “For the last 1.5 years, the entire world as well as India are facing its challenge. Places like America and Europe have very strong health infrastructure but were defeated by the pandemic. However, life should be lived with liveliness. We are celebrating the festival while following corona guidelines and with a limited number of people.” The programme of Guru Purnima started at 5am and along with Gorakshjpeethadhishwar Yogi Adityanath, ‘sadhus’ and ‘sants’ performed ‘aarti’ from 6.30am to 7am.

---||Allahabad||City temples turning floral and puja waste into compost||Prayagraj: The city-based temples generate tonnes of flower waste, and the problem gets bigger during the pious month of Shrawan and the Navratri festival. However, the management of the city’s famous Mankameshwar temple has devised a plan to address the flower waste problem by setting up an in-house composting unit for the disposal of waste. The chief priest of Mankameshwar temple, Brahmachari Sridharanand told TOI, “we have devised a novel plan of tackling temple floral and puja waste and turning it into compost with the help of natural substances”. He added, “Initially, a Kanpur based Agro unit was handling the disposal of floral waste, leaves and garlands but the employees of the unit stopped working during the corona pandemic and following which, the temple staff devised a plan to convert floral and puja waste into compost." “With Shrawan month fast approaching and the strength of devotees offering flowers, garland and leaves of various species of plants to Lord Shiva during the pious month will be increasing manifolds, producing several tonnes of flower waste, we would be taking the flower waste, leaves and garlands to our gaushala and making our effort to turn it into natural compost," said Sridharanand. "We would be offering natural compost to devotees including farmers free of cost to grow fruits and flowers," he added. The process is simple. The volume of leaves, flowers and garlands from the temple waste is collected into bins. The garbage goes either to the landfills or big drums which has the system of soaking water and adding natural substances, turning the waste into organic after a certain period and produce clean manure,” informed the chief priest of Mankameshwar temple. "Many people arrive at temple premises to seek natural compost to grow plants,” he added. Moreover, the management committee of the bade Hanuman temple is also turning flower waste into natural fertilizer. Swami Anand Giri of lord Hanuman temple said, "we are using the simplest form of composting at our fields and getting the natural fertilizers to grow plants and vegetables”. Experts claimed that the flower waste, leaves and garlands were placed in bins at the fields and gaushalas. After a few months, the lowest layer decomposes and turns into black powder. This compost and can be used as manure, they explained. "This is a completely zero maintenance process and everything is on nature here," they added. The fact is, most of the city’s prominent temples, to tackle the floral waste issue, have now started turning floral and kitchen waste generated in their premises into compost. Temple authorities also claimed that they have ideas about composters, that were being installed at many temples in southern states but we have opted for the natural process to decompose the flower waste. The chief priest of Maa Kalyani Devi temple, Shyam Pathak says, "the volume of flower waste increases manifolds during the festive season and we then make suitable arrangements for its natural disposal."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/city-temples-turning-floral-and-puja-waste-into-compost/articleshow/84715025.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Spousal murders rose during second wave in Andhra Pradesh||VIJAYAWADA: As many as 16 instances of spousal murders have been reported across the state during the last three months. Out of these, four were of wives killing their husbands while the rest were of husbands murdering wives. Apart from cases of spousal murders, at least three children were killed to exact revenge against the spouse in Guntur and West Godavari districts. A quick analysis of the reasons behind murders point to infidelity, followed by marital discord, alcoholism and dowry. Just four days ago, police arrested a man, along with his uncle, for allegedly murdering his wife by strangulation under Gudur police limits in Nellore. Cops ascertained that refusal to provide additional dowry and inability to conceive a child were the primary reason behind the crime. Taking advantage of the prevailing Covid-19 situation, cops pointed out that murder by asphyxiation appears to be a common modus operandi, as the culprits attempt to hide the death as arising out of Covid-19. However, a simple postmortem reveals the cause of death. Cops pointed out that it comes as no surprise that the Covid-19 lockdown has led to an increase in incidents of domestic violence in the state. Out of 1,300 SOS calls received in the Disha application in the past 16 months, domestic violence accounts for close to 70%. As far as murders against women are concerned, 12 of them were committed by husbands, three by jilted lovers and one by the minor victim’s neighbour after rape. Out of these incidents, in one case the husband committed suicide after killing his wife in Holagunda in Kurnool district on July 12. Cops pointed out that he took the extreme step impulsively after his wife refused him money for alcohol. “In almost all the cases, the dispute happened over a long-pending issue but reached a tipping point during the curfew period as they were forced to remain indoors,” cops said. “However, we have attended to several SOS calls and prevented murders thanks to the Disha app,” a senior Disha police official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/spousal-murders-domestic-abuse-rise-in-second-wave/articleshow/84714651.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

The chief public relations officer (CPRO) of the ECR, Rajesh Kumar, told this reporter on Saturday that the general manager, Anjali Goel, was personally supervising the preparations being made at the hospitals in Patna, Danapur, Mughalsarai, Dhanbad, Sonepur and Samastipur. “The six railway hospitals have been upgraded and refurbished. As many as 206 beds have been set up in the Covid wards and 30 in the intensive care units (ICU). Besides, 27 invasive and 83 non-invasive ventilators have been procured to cater to the needs of serious patients,” the CPRO said, adding that the railways had decided to hire more doctors and paramedical staff depending on the requirements during the third wave. The railway hospitals have also started stocking up on essential medicines, oxygen concentrators, PPE kits, N-95 masks and other equipment that may be required to fight the third wave. “Oxygen plants are being installed at all the hospitals to avoid any shortage in future,” Rajesh said. While the superspecialty hospital in Karbigahiya is likely to complete the process of installation of an oxygen plant by August 4, a new plant has been made functional at the Danapur railway hospital on a trial basis. Oxygen plants at the Sonepur hospital will be made functional on July 31 and the process of installation of another plant at the Samastipur hospital will be completed after finalising its tender. An oxygen plant at the Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya railway hospital will be commissioned on July 31 whereas a letter of intent has been issued for a plant at the Dhanbad hospital. Considering the fact that the third wave may hit children the most, the railway hospital in Karbigahiya has set up 10 separate beds in the paediatric ward and six in the ICU. The hospital’s medical director, Dr R K Verma, pointed out that specially-designed ventilators and other necessary equipment would be procured for children. 92% ECR staff receive first dose of vaccines: Nearly 92% of the ECR employees have received the first dose of the Covid vaccines and 23% have got the second dose. “We have decided to administer the first dose of the vaccines to all the employees by July 31 and the second dose by October 31,” the CPRO said, adding that 6,000 ECR employees had tested positive for Covid during the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/railway-hospitals-buckle-up-to-tackle-possible-third-wave-of-corona/articleshow/84716462.cms||Kumod Verma

The CM, in a symbolic way, also handed over a small replica of an ambulance to five of the MGPY beneficiaries. Speaking on the occasion, the CM said the 50 CNG buses would go a long way in reducing air pollution in the state capital and helping daily commuters. On the ambulance scheme, Nitish said a subsidy of maximum Rs 2 lakh per beneficiary was being provided to two beneficiaries in each block for purchasing ambulances under the MGPY. “In the first phase, 350 ambulances have been handed over to the beneficiaries. At least 800 ambulances would be purchased by October this year. There is a target to provide at least two ambulances in each block of the state by the end of this year,” Nitish told reporters after handing over ambulances to the beneficiaries. He said residents of rural areas used to face difficulties in reaching hospitals in urban areas. “Now, as minimum two ambulances are being provided in each block, people may find convenience in reaching hospitals in their nearby towns,” he said. A transport department official said the 50 CNG buses would operate on different routes in Patna. The CM also said strict action would be taken against the officials involved illegal sand mining in the state. Nitish said the state police and departments concerned have already initiated inquiry against the suspected government officials. “All DMs and SPs have been given strict instructions to keep a proper vigil in their respective districts,” he said. Around 20 government officials, including some SPs, were recently transferred for their alleged nexus with sand mafias in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-gets-50-cng-buses-finally/articleshow/84716686.cms||Madan Kumar

---||Ahmedabad||Curriculum overhaul: Guj seeks to tie up with Cambridge Board||Gandhinagar: Gujarat’s department of education is considering a tie-up with the UK-based Cambridge Board. The department also wants to change the state board’s curriculum to give the international touch to schooling in Gujarat. The state government is looking for tie-ups with other international boards too. A key source aware of the developments said, “The state is considering a dedicated international board or a dedicated curriculum for the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board which can match international curricula.” The move to adopt an international curriculum may mean not adhering to the model of the NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training). But sources said that all states have been permitted under the new national education policy (NEP) to form their own curricula. “The objective is to benchmark school curriculum with 21st century international education,” the source said. “Through a bilingual medium, this curriculum will build English and 21st century skills in all students.” The source said internationally benchmarked assessment systems will be followed. The aim is to prepare students thoroughly for the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2024. PISA measures 15-year-old students’ reading, mathematics, and science competencies. Sources further said that consultations have begun with multiple boards, including the Cambridge Board and the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE). Best practices from these boards as well as from the International Baccalaureate are being studied, sources said. “Recently, the country representative of Cambridge met the top officials of the state government,” the source said. “The modalities of long-term ties were deliberated upon. Also discussed were the upgrade of curricula in line with the Cambridge Board’s standards and teacher training.” The government is also in talks with the CISCE to build international curriculum in partnership with globally acclaimed educational boards. In the past also, the state government claimed to have ties with international boards, but such projects were gradually given up. State education secretary Vinod Rao said: “To help our students qualify for international exams, the government is considering the adoption of international curricula for our proposed schools of excellence chain.” He added: “That will help the state in preparing a large number of our students for international studies.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/curriculum-overhaul-guj-seeks-to-tie-up-with-cambridge-board/articleshow/84717000.cms||Kapil Dave

The CM’s remark came while inspecting the Maharshi Devraha Baba Medical College in Deoria, days before the possible inauguration of the academic session of nine medical colleges, including medical college in Deoria, on July 30 by the PM. “We are thankful to the PM for the help rendered in strengthening health infrastructure in the state. No one thought five-seven years ago that there will be a medical college in Deoria. If the National Medical Commission (NMC) approves it, the academic session of the medical college will be inaugurated by the PM. I am satisfied with the work in the medical college as sufficient faculty and other staff are already here and hostels for female and male students are ready,” the CM said. He added, “Some faculty members have already started living in the hostels. I have inspected and seen that work here is up to the standards of the NMC.” The CM said that from 1947 to 2016, there were only 12 medical colleges in the state and only the BRD Medical College of Gorakhpur was serving the needs of people in many districts of the region. “We have already started academic session at eight medical colleges in the state. Academic session in nine medical colleges will be started after approval from the NMC. Besides, we have approved 14 more medical colleges and work has already started. For 16 other districts, we are making a policy to set up medical colleges on PPP model with the help of the Centre and state government.” The CM said, “With the improved infrastructure, the Covid-19 pandemic is under control in Uttar Pradesh, the country’s biggest state as per population.

Rider count on the north-south corridor jumped from 1.2 lakh to 1.7 lakh in just seven days last week. The 50,000 spike in footfall since last Friday, when Metro resumed operations after a 61-day hiatus, and clocking 1,70,058 footfall this Friday, July 23, prompted the authorities to make the changes. On Saturdays, Metro Railway has been offering the 104 staff specials — for those who had to attend work — that it was running when services were suspended during the second wave. Last Friday, July 16, the carrier restarted operations with 192 trains and the massive morning rush prompted Metro Railway to announce 208 services and reduce the 7-minute peak-hour frequency to 6 minutes from July 19. But there was no ease in passenger load. “We can only increase trains to maintain distancing. The state has capped it to 50% commuters now. Metro currently ferries much lower than its pre-pandemic daily passenger load of 6.5 lakh, so we can add more trains,” a Metro official said. Metro’s pre-pandemic fleet was 288. “Metro will run 220 daily services from Monday to Friday so passengers can travel comfortably,” a Metro statement said on Saturday. Of these, 150 will ply between Kavi Subhash and Dakshineswar. Peak-hour frequency will be 6 minutes and the first trains will leave the terminal stations at 7.30am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/metro-to-add-12-trains-as-footfall-jumps-by-50000/articleshow/84716001.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

The accused, who always pretended to be deaf and dumb, took the villagers by surprise when he started talking and answering to their queries after he was given a sound thrashing. The accused has identified himself as Dharmendra Kumar, a native of Rasoolabad area of Kanpur Dehat district. The police said that the accused has been taken into custody and his interrogation is underway. Reports said Dharmendra was living at the house of one Santosh Kumar, 43, in Bhuda village of Gursahaiganj Kotwali police area of Kannauj for the past three years. He never spoke to anyone and pretended to be deaf and mute. He always communicated with the help of gestures. On Friday at around 11:30 pm, he suddenly started hitting Santosh with a wooden washing paddle. When Santosh’s relative Pratap Singh woke up after hearing his cries for help and tried to rescue Santosh, Dharmendra attacked him as well. Hearing their screams, house inmates, neighbours and villagers rushed to the spot and admitted both the injured to a nearby private hospital. Doctors referred Santosh to Agra for treatment but he succumbed on the way at around 2 am. Pratap was referred to a Kanpur Nagar hospital. Sarai Prayag outpost in-charge Pankaj Yadav said, “The accused Dharmendra Kumar has been taken into custody and is being investigated.” On Saturday morning, Kotwali in-charge TP Verma along with forensic experts reached the village and launched an investigation. Villagers told the police that the accused had visited Santosh Yadav’s place about three years ago. Santosh employed him to take care of the cattle and in return gave him food and clothes. “The young man, however, never spoke and also pretended to be deaf. He used to communicate with them with the help of gestures,” they claimed. Police said after thrashing by the villagers, he also gave them his name and the name of his native village. However, the reason for the murder is yet to be ascertained as he had not yet disclosed the cause to us,” police said. SP Kannauj Prashant Verma said, “A case under relevant sections of IPC has been registered against the servant Dharmendra on the complaint of Santosh’s wife Gomti Devi. At present, the investigators are interrogating the accused to ascertain the probable motive behind the crime.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/deaf-dumb-youth-beats-employer-to-death/articleshow/84718453.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

A special leave petition challenging a Bombay high court order (March 1, 2021), wherein a writ petition was filed by schools against state government, challenging the GR (May 8, 2020) seeking cut in fees. The HC judgment allowed schools to hike fees during Covid-19 and the relief to parents was of non- expulsion of children if they had not paid hiked fees. HC refused to consider prohibition of hiking fees and prayer of reduction of fees for non-utilized fee heads by schools during the pandemic. In the SC order to Rajasthan schools, fees for 2020-21 had to be 15% less than that of 2019-20. SC directed the petitioner to approach state government. It said if the state decision was not satisfactory, the petitioner can seek further remedy under law. The school education department will recommend a cut of 15% fees in private schools, based on SC’s directive from May 2021. The state will have to pass a resolution for implementation of 15% cut and decide the petitioner’s application within three weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sc-tells-state-govt-to-consider-a-15-cut-in-school-fees-due-to-pandemic/articleshow/84719771.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Over 1,000 motorists caught flouting night curbs in 3 hours||KOLKATA: The Kolkata traffic police prosecuted as many as 1,045 motorists across the city between 9pm and midnight on Friday for allegedly violating the night restrictions that allow only emergency travel between 9pm and 5am. The drive, said sources, had become essential after the top brass at Lalbazar — especially commissioner Soumen Mitra — came across “large crowds on the streets after 9pm”. “Please ensure very strict checking in connection with restrictions between 9pm and 11pm. Lalbazar is annoyed with the crowd presence on the streets after 9pm,” said a message to police stations and traffic guards on Friday. The cops also carried out checks on three bridges and four key crossings. DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha said, “We carry out special checks on weekends. We chose the spots to check going by our collective experience — the same areas where we believed violators might converge.” The night violations were perhaps an indication of the indiscipline seen through the day, said officers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/over-1k-motorists-caught-flouting-night-curbs-in-3-hrs/articleshow/84716044.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Many stay on in schools for ISC, high scorers upset over CET||Mumbai: For many, Class X ICSE results were a brief pause to look back and celebrate a year of online learning, but work for the years ahead had long begun. Like Priyanshi Desai, ICSE high scorer who bagged 99.8%, was already taking her online viva-voce on Saturday evening to prepare for the NEET medical extrance two years hence. Of the 24,358 students across 234 schools in Maharashtra who have been declared as passed, many have opted for Class XI in their respective schools. But then there are some such as Palash Jain who are “upset” that his high ICSE score of 99.6% would not matter as they would be required to take the CET for admission to a junior college. “We have over 150 of our own students who have joined us in Grade XI,” said Bombay Scottish principal Sunita George. “In fact, we had more applications, but we do not have as many seats.” This year due to the uncertainty over Class XI admissions in state-board affiliated junior colleges, followed by the Common Entrance Test (CET), many ICSE students have chosen to continue in their own schools. The city’s high schools affiliated to the national and international boards have seen robust admissions to Grade XI this year. Riya Sharma of Euro School, Thane, who secured 93%, said, “I want to pursue Chartered Accountancy. I would rather do Class XII in my school.” Adeetya Uppal, with a score of 98%, has enrolled for an integrated programme with a coaching institute and is not worried about FYJC admissions. Will that mean fewer applications for junior colleges? Only time will tell. In Jai Hind College, for instance, 39% students who took admission in arts last year were from ICSE. In case of St Xaviers college too, both ICSE and CBSE students occupied 48% of the class XI arts seats. The SSC syllabus (for CET) for other boards has been challenged in the Bombay high court. HC has asked the state to explain if other boards can have a separate CET, which is to be held on August 21. Meanwhile, the link for registering for CET is down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-many-stay-on-in-schools-for-isc-high-scorers-upset-over-cet/articleshow/84719795.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Hyderabad||Telangana reaching for the Sun to power homes||Power consumers across Telangana are increasingly ‘going green’. And the proof of that lies in the rising number of rooftop solar panels making their way into the homes of people. From just 250 consumers who had solar panels six years ago,, the count has grown to over 10,000 now, show records. And these include government buildings, educational institutions, gated communities, apart from the homes of individuals. Some civic bodies such as the Karimnagar Municipal Corporation have also mandated rooftop solar on new buildings for procuring Occupancy Certificate (OC). The result: Lesser power outages and lower energy bills. "At the time of state formation, rooftop solar power capacity was only 0.45 MW. Now, it has increased to 171 MW. Many institutions, societies and individuals are shifting to environment-friendly power," G Raghuma Reddy, chairman and MD of Telangana Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (TSSPDCL) told TOI. Rooftop solar can be used for domestic,, commercial and industrial purposes by simply installing solar panels and getting them connected to the grid. Also, once consumers use the required power, the balance power goes back to the grid and consumers are paid that amount from discoms. TSGenco officials said 30% of its total power demand is met through solar and other renewable energy sources. When it comes to consumers, the switch to solar has helped them cut monthly power bills by up to to 50%. Raghuma Reddy said rooftop solar scheme has been a huge hit in GHMC with number of applicants increasing by the day. Of about 10,000 applications in the southern and northern discoms, about 7,300 are from Greater Hyderabad. Institutions and property owners in Cyber City, Banjara Hills and Medchal-Malkajgiri have opted for the eco-friendly option, he said. To encourage more people to go the ‘green’ way, the Centre has been extending subsidies through the Telangana State Renewable Energy Development Corporation (TSREDCO). Domestic consumers can avail 40% subsidy to install up to three KW power and 20% for installing solar panels with a capacity between 3 and 5 KW. "The advantage of rooftop solar is, if an owner is using 200 units a month and generating 300 units through solar, instead of paying the bill, he/she can get about Rs 4 per unit from the discom for the additional 100 units if it is connected to the grid. Secondly, if a person is using 500 units a month and generation is just 300 units, he/she will have to pay a power bill to the discom for the extra 200 units. Even then he/she can save money as the power unit cost varies for various unit slabs," said N Janaiah, TSREDCO vice-chairman and MD of Tsredco. In some cases, if a consumer travels abroad, he/she will not only be spared from paying any bill but will also get paid for unused power, Janaiah added. Another USP: The limited space this requires. For instance, for generating one KW power a consumer needs only 100 sft of space to install solar panels -- every KW generates five units a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-reaching-for-the-sun-to-power-homes/articleshow/84717826.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Stunt on railway track, man ‘promotes suicide’ in video||MUMBAI: A school dropout from Vile Parle (west) was arrested on Saturday for posting a video in which he is seen sitting on the railway track and, using video effects, is shown being hit by a train. The ‘accident’ is a creative stunt. The accused, Irfan Khan (20), shot the video to increase his followers on his social media account, railway police officials said, adding that it had been done to influence people, showing how to end one’s life if one is jilted by one’s lover. Khan, who is an influencer and event planner, created the video in which he performed the act of promoting suicide. TimesViewSuicides are one of the biggest public health problems in India, with over 300 Indians dying by suicide every day. Youth make up for the majority of deaths by suicides. The need of the hour is sensitive anti-suicide messages and not content that could incite emotionally vulnerable youth to take their own lives. Perpetrators of the latter should be punished to prevent any such recurrence.The railway police arrested Khan late on Saturday. He he will be produced in Bandra holiday court on Sunday. His home was located within hours after the video went viral on social media on Saturday in no time. “After the video was posted on the railway police’s Twitter page, a team found out the accused’s home in Bandra. The team reached his house but he was not present. The action was initiated so that no one provokes anyone with such a dangerous act,” Mumbai railway police commissioner Quaiser Khalid told TOI. The video was shot between Bandra and Khar railway stations. “He was found seated on the railway track and performed the act of a ‘depressed’ lover and video effects was seen in which he is shown as ending his life under a speeding train. He has been booked under the Indian Penal Code section336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others), 505 (1) (publishes or circulates any statement with intent to incite) and under the Indian Railways Act sections 145 (nuisance) and 147 (trespass),” said DCP Pradeep Chavan. Assistant inspector Devidas Aranye said Khan has claimed that he created the video to increase followers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-stunt-on-rly-track-man-promotes-suicide-in-video/articleshow/84719819.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Hyderabad||Telangana now ready for Solar 2.0: Experts||HYDERABAD: When united AP was bifurcated, Telangana was reeling under a severe power crisis. It then bet big on solar to not only charge up its power sector but also join the bandwagon of states that saw renewable energy as the next big thing. The initial policy push by Telangana government helped reap benefits and by end of 2020, the total installed capacity of solar energy in the state stood at 3,936 MW, fourth in terms production in India. However, in 2021, amid falling solar power tariffs, soaring raw material prices due to a rise in commodity prices since last year, and increased awareness among consumers, industry players feel the state now needs to take a fresh look at this sector. Mahesh Makhija, director – business development & commercial (renewables), CLP India, said while Telangana’s single window clearance system has benefitted industries, the state can look at supporting project developers by providing visibility of barren land parcels available for development of solar projects and policy programmes for off-take of power generated from such projects. Makhija cautioned that developing large scale projects may be a challenge not just for Telangana but for many other states given solar project developments of late have been centered around low cost of generation. "Few states such as Rajasthan have an advantage due to higher solar irradiance and abundant availability of land at low cost," he said. PT Devaraj, head – business development (south zone), Fourth Partner Energy, pointed out that potential for solar energy penetration is immense in the state but there are policy hurdles to be addressed. "If policymakers were to address issues related to net-metering, allowing for distributed solar projects above 1MW and opening up market for open access solar then developers can truly accelerate de-carbonisation," he added. On open access, P Ashok Chowdary, founder and CEO of Arka11 Renewable Solutions, said it is no longer a lucrative option for developers as PPAs (power purchase agreements) signed around 10 years ago are getting a hefty price per unit (around Rs 12/unit) but ones going for open access now are no longer finding it lucrative as the tariff is hovering around Rs 1.8-2.5 per unit. On the manufacturing front, he said, the state is far from realising its potential as there are hardly any players. "There are policies but they are not translating into investments," he said. Chowdary also added that solar power subsidies that customers are entitled to take a long time to be credited, thus dampening the spirits of customers as well as upsetting plans of businesses. He, however, noted that on the positive side, customers are realising the benefits of solar and subsidies are not the sole driver for solar adoption anymore. Meanwhile, Saurabh Marda, founder and MD of Freyr Energy said the rise in commodity prices has also impacted prices of solar systems. "Despite these factors, annual return on investments on solar systems continues to remain high, fuelling demand from the residential as well as commercial customers," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/experts-telangana-now-ready-for-solar-2-0/articleshow/84718225.cms||Swati Rathor
---||Goa||Angulo turns down Odisha as Mumbai City come calling||Panaji: Igor Angulo has told Odisha FC that he will not be able to accept the club’s offer to be their leading man and best-paid player for this season. The former FC Goa striker who won the Golden Boot in Indian Super League last season has been in touch with Odisha coach Kiko Ramirez for almost a month. He was convinced about the new project, spearheaded by Spanish World Cup winner David Villa and his DV7 company. But delays in sorting out tax issues and potential interest from Mumbai City FC has made Angulo do a rethink. According to sources, Angulo communicated his decision to Odisha on Saturday and the club has now started the search for a new striker. “Odisha were convinced they had done enough to bring Angulo on board. A draft contract was also sent, but since there were delays in confirmation, doubts emerged. He has told the club he has other offers as well,” said one source who has been tracking the development. Sources said the Spanish sharpshooter has been contacted by Mumbai City. Mumbai won the League Winners’ Shield and ISL Trophy last season, but allowed both strikers – Adam Le Fondre and Bartholomew Ogbeche – to join other clubs. Angulo is a tried and tested option to deliver the goods upfront. Angulo, 37, was a major draw for Goa last season after joining the club from Polish side Gornik Zabrze. The Goan side were rebuilding after the departure of several foreign names, including star striker Ferran Corominas. Angulo impressed in his first season with 14 goals and took the team to the ISL playoffs where they lost against Mumbai on penalties. Angulo, however, was upset when he was not included among the four foreign players for the AFC Champions League as coach Juan Ferrando opted for captain Edu Bedia, Ivan Gonzalez, Jorge Ortiz and Australian defender James Donachie. Before arriving in Goa, Angulo was included in the Best XI of Ekstraklasa, the premier league in Poland, for three successive seasons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/angulo-turns-down-odisha-as-mumbai-city-come-calling/articleshow/84742901.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

It took more than five hours to rescue the youths. Heavy rainfall in upstream areas on Friday morning caused flooding of nullahs and streams passing through the Jamdari village. Residents said that two 18-year-olds — Arjun Tamalwad and Sanjay Kasbe — had gone to graze cattle in a nearby low-lying area on Friday morning. However, later the teens got stranded. The water current was strong and the level kept rising. Tamalwad said, “We had a cellphone and were able to raise an alert. The place was about 2km from the village.” Their families reached the spot and alerted the police as well as SDM Rajendra Khandare, who rushed to the village along with his team. Khandare said, “There has been incessant rain in Bhokar for the past three days. Not just the rivers, even smaller streams are overflowing. On receiving a call from the villagers, my team and I went to the spot and with the help of four villagers, managed to rescue the youths. I had taken a life jacket, rope, torch and cutter from our office. I tied the rope to our jeep and a tree and wore the life jacket before plunging into the water.” Khandare also tied the rope around himself that was held by the villagers and jumped in from the Mhaisa Road end. He had to abort this attempt due to strong currents. Along with Pradip Pote, Atmaram Anpalwad, Sachin Kasbe, and Bhimrao Hatagle, he then tried from the Daur road and reached the other side of the streams and finally managed to rescue the youths by 12.30 am. Kasbe thanked the SDM for saving his and Tamalwad’s lives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/nanded-sub-divisional-officer-jumps-in-water-to-save-2-youths/articleshow/84714640.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The board fetched revenue of approximately Rs 55 crore after selling 315 apartments in a week. An official said, “These flats are in the RHB existing schemes and are being sold at discounted rates. The maximum number of flats, 245 was sold in Jaipur division.” Buoyed by the response, the board is deciding to put a list of more apartments under e-auction. “In Dwarka scheme, total 22 flats were sold in one day. For the scheme more than 326 applicants participated in the e-auction. Similarly, 87 people bid to purchase a single apartment in Neelkanth apartment.” The RHB is targeting the lower income group (LIG) and (MIG) as their demand for houses increased after the pandemic. “The recent study showed, minimum per capita built-up area should be of 9.5 square metres, but it ranges from 2sqm to 8sqm per built-up area in many families. This is the reason people are moving out and looking for affordable housing. We are providing houses at good locations and decent rates,” added an official Officials claimed discounted rates, houses on instalments and location of flats attracted buyers to participate in auctions. In the past, RHB had made several attempts to sell its flats. However, all efforts turned futile as not many buyers showed interest to purchase the properties. In 2017, the RHB shortlisted properties (flats of different sizes) in Pratap Nagar for selling over the counter. Unlike the earlier system of allotting houses through a draw of lots where buyers had to wait for months, people in this scheme could purchase RHB houses and take possession in a single day after depositing the house cost at the counter. “The RHB witnessed reverse trend since last year as many people came forward to buy these flats after being offered at discounted rates,” said the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rhb-defies-real-estate-trend-by-earning-huge-revenue/articleshow/84717868.cms||---

Following approval from the state government as many as 11 flyovers of the city would be installed with ‘view cutter’, the fibre-wall which is installed on both sides of the flyover. The state government has sanctioned an amount of 20 crores for installing view-cutters on the flyovers of Prayagraj as well as the neighbouring district of Kaushambi. Because of these view-cutters, the commuters would have a Six feet wall beside them which would be protecting them as they cross the flyovers. It is worth mentioning that in the past several years, many cases have been reported in the city wherein the commuters have run into the Chinese thread used to fly kites. The district police have been taking strict action against those who have been into the business of selling this Chinese manufactured thread and even raided several of the shops, especially in the old city area. However, despite all the efforts, the sale of this ‘dangerous thread’ goes on unabated in the city. It so happens that locals residing in the localities, situated besides all the major flyovers of the city, indulge in flying kites using this Chinese thread which is quite strong and could be fatal when someone runs into the thread, causing serious injury to the affected part that comes into contact with the thread. Now, with the view-cutter being installed on both sides of the flyovers of the city, the commuters will not run into this thread thereby eliminating the chances of any such incidents occurring in future. According to chief engineer of bridge corporation, RK Singh, “The view cutters would be installed at several of the flyovers of the city including Rambagh flyover (which is one of the major spots where such incidents have occurred in the past), the flyover at Pani Ki Tanki, flyover at chaufatka, the one at Alopibagh, MNNIT railway overbridge, Phulpur overbridge, Karchana overbridge, Naini overbridge, Saiyaara overbridge of Kaushambi, Sirathu overbridge (Kaushambi) and the one at Manauri will be installed with the view cutter."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/city-flyovers-to-get-view-cutters/articleshow/84715086.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Experts worry over 100% seating nod in Metro, buses||NEW DELHI: Delhi Metro and buses can run with 100% seating capacity from Monday as per an order issued by Delhi Disaster Management Authority on Saturday. However, standing passengers are still not allowed in both bus and Metro trains. The order, which will come into effect from 5 am on July 26, allows transportation by Delhi Metro and buses of Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and Cluster Scheme with 100% seating capacity and no standing passengers. Boarding in buses will only be allowed from the rear door and deboarding from the front door. An eight-coach Metro train, which can easily accommodate more than 2,400 passengers, is ferrying 200 passengers at present. From Monday, the carrying capacity will increase to 400 passengers. The non-AC buses of DTC will be able to seat 41 passengers each instead of 20 at present and AC buses will be able to seat 35 passengers. With the latest relaxations, there would be some respite for passengers who now have to wait for long to enter busy Metro stations or to catch a bus. Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, said that the revised guidelines issued on Saturday would be further examined by DMRC and if needed, detailed guidelines from the operational point of view would be worked out and communicated. “As standing travel is still not permitted by the authorities, entry at stations will continue to be regulated through identified gates,” he stated. Transport experts, however, say that allowing 100% seating defeats the purpose of imposing Covid restrictions and it would be better to allow 50% seating and limited standing passengers with social distancing. Amit Bhatt, executive director at WRI India, said that the guideline appeared to be made with ease of implementation in mind. “But with people sitting next to each other, there would be no physical distance, which defeats the purpose,” he said. Bhatt said implementation could have been done by marking standing spaces and prosecuting those not standing at the space. “Safe commuting can also be incentivised by providing additional discounts to fully vaccinated people,” he suggested. “People sitting next to each other is the same as people standing next to each other and this doesn’t have any rationale. Instead, 50% seating should be allowed, along with standing passengers with adequate distancing,” said PK Sarkar, former head of transport planning at School of Planning Architecture. “DMRC should add extra coaches if possible and increase the frequency of trains to cater to the rush.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/experts-worry-over-100-seating-nod/articleshow/84717897.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Ajmer||Rajasthan government plans optional board exams like CBSE||AJMER: Education minister Govind Singh Dotasra said the state government will also plan to conduct board exams for those students who are not satisfied with their result. He said that like CBSE, the Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education will also plan to provide option to the students who wanted to appear in the examination. Dotasra on Saturday was talking to reporters after declaring the Class XII result in RBSE main office in Ajmer on Saturday evening. He added that during pandemic the state government faced a double challenge to safeguard the students and to provide them result on time so that they can apply for their higher studies in different institutes. “If things went right then the RBSE will conduct REET on September 26,” the education minister added. On the question of opening schools in Rajasthan, Dotasra said that his department consulted the experts and decided to re-open schools in the state from August 2. But the chief minister has formed a committee under cabinet minister Raghu Sharma who will submit a report to the CM in the coming days. Looking at the pandemic situation, the education department is also planning to have monthly assessment of students and the direction in this matter will soon be issued so that the result of students can be prepared according to their performance. He said that in the last academic session the syllabus in class X and XII was reduced so that students can prepare accordingly. But in the next academic session, the decision of reducing the syllabus in class X and XII has not yet been taken and therefore schools have to complete the whole syllabus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/state-govt-plans-optional-board-exams-like-cbse/articleshow/84717893.cms||---

Many have contended that they have to recruit both teaching and non-teaching staff before can resume classes with full strength. Also, many infrastructure changes have to be made in order to fulfil the Covid guidelines/protocols. “Due to Covid, majority of the schools have adopted severe cost-cutting measures including retrenchment of staff, closure of contract-based services and transport staff. Until these basic facilities are restored, schools cannot call the entire strength,” said Puneet Sharma, an educationist based in Jaipur. A school said they had disbanded the contract with the housekeeping, catering and transport service last September. “The contract has to be renewed to ensure cleanliness and sanitisation of all possible areas. Also, getting students on time in schools involves a complex transport system which has to be revived again,” said a principal of a private school based in Jaipur. Several schools are already planning extra exit and entry points along with additional water dispensers and urinals to ensure proper social distancing. Tabassum Khan, principal of Army Public School, said even after the possible third wave, nobody is sure about the departure of Covid. “The state has to adopt a long-term policy for schools which includes orientation session for students and parents. An average of 40-50 students in each classroom represents different socio-economic backgrounds with different levels of understanding of Covid. The experts should come up with an orientation programme which brings all students to a common understanding,” said Khan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/few-pvt-schools-say-they-need-2-months-to-reopen/articleshow/84717875.cms||---

A video showing the ambulance staff expressing their displeasure went viral. When the home minister was moving from Road No.1, Banjara Hills, to Chandrayangutta, traffic was halted at Masab Tank for motorists from NMDC side. Meanwhile, an ambulance came in the same route and got stuck in the traffic. Despite the blaring siren, there was no way the ambulance could get through the congestion. A little later, the ambulance staff disembarked from the vehicle, walked up to a home guard and expressed their displeasure for not getting traffic clearance. Later, the traffic police cleared the way to allow the ambulance. On Saturday night, Hyderabad traffic police, in a statement, said: “Two ambulances came from Mahaveer Hospital side towards Masab Tank, 1/12 Junction ( via under flyover Masab Tank). One ambulance was empty and another was with a patient. On seeing heavy traffic, the ambulance medical technician, Kishor, came towards traffic constable Ali Khan of Asifnagar police station and told him about the waiting ambulance. At that time, ACP central zone was also there on duty. Immediately, the traffic police facilitated the movement of the ambulance.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ambulance-stuck-in-traffic-as-cops-make-way-for-minister-video-viral/articleshow/84716193.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||2nd marriage for both Sweety and killer cop||Ahmedabad: Their story started in 2016 when Ajay Desai, then a sub-inspector, met Sweety Patel, about four years older, near Ahmedabad. Sweety was freshly out of her marriage, whereas Desai had got divorced in 2013. “It was an instant attraction. Sweety’s first husband had told her that he was in love with someone else, and then got relocated to Australia with their two kids. She got married again in 2016 to man in the US, but the marriage lasted barely for a month as she came back,” said an investigator with city crime branch. “It was then that the romance was rekindled and she moved in with Desai.” Desai, belonging to a conservative family, never told his family about Sweety. As talks of his marriage began in 2018, he consulted Sweety. She reportedly told him to go ahead, as she intended to unite with her kids in Australia. Desai thus married Pooja from his community. The couple started living in Vadodara city and also has a two-year old child. “Sweety meanwhile told Desai that she wanted to live with him. The duo had got married secretly in a temple in Rupal village in Gandhinagar district and also had a two-year-old son. For them, Desai got a bungalow on rent in Karjan. While Sweety’s family knew about Desai, none in Desai’s family knew about Sweety,” said an investigator. The turning point in their lives came when Sweety told Desai that she was five-month pregnant. It was last straw for Desai, who had started getting weary between managing two families. Investigators said that the pressure was mounting on Desai to accept Sweety legally, which was difficult for him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/2nd-marriage-for-both-sweety-and-killer-cop/articleshow/84718040.cms||---

---||Amritsar||Kisan Sansad drags stir out of bog Republic Day march got it into||BATHINDA: After a long lull in these eight months of protesting against the central agri-marketing laws, the farmers are back into limelight with their own parliament called Kisan Sansad. Six months ago, the unsavoury incidents of the tractor parade had even branded them anti-national. After January 26, even though the protests continued on the Delhi borders, the impact was lost, except when the farmers campaigned in the West Bengal assembly elections and were able to damage the Bharatiya Janata Party. Then on July 17, they took the bold step of issuing ‘voters’ whip’ to the opposition MPs, asking them to be their voice for MSP’s legal guarantee and the repeal of farm laws, and the movement was back alive. On July 22, they even got permission from Delhi Police to hold Kisan Sansad at Jantar Mantar parallel to the official Parliament session. Opposition MPs from both houses listened to their call and disrupted Parliament for three days. The farmers will do it all monsoon session until August 13. Independence Day is not far, and to avoid what happened on Republic Day, Delhi’s security is tighter than before. But even police escort is no mean achievement, claim the farmers. On November 26 last year, that batches left Punjab and Haryana for Delhi, for just two days of protest inside the national capital. They were stopped on the Singhu and Tikri borders and the protest turned "indefinite". The talks with the government are stalled since January 22. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar has called farmers back to the negotiating table, if they are not stuck on repeal. The farmers say nothing less is acceptable. Farmer unionists such as Joginder Singh Ugrahan of the BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) claimed: "Staying eight months against a formidable opposition was not easy, after January 26 especially, when the protest had reached its weakest point, but the BJP defeat in three states, including West Bengal, gave us a boost and now Kisan Sansad is preparing us to hurt the BJP in the Uttar Pradesh elections." Farm unionist Balbir Singh Rajewal said: "The BJP understands only the voice of votes. We got the saffron in Bengal and now we’ll get them in UP and Uttarakhand." Protests are on at 100 places in Punjab, at toll plazas, private company’s petrol pumps, FCI silos run by a private firm, railway tracks, and outside the BJP houses. It’s happening in Haryana as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/kisan-sansad-drags-stir-out-of-bog-r-day-march-got-it-into/articleshow/84717945.cms||Neel Kamal

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Many ISC students say ‘more difficult’Class XI exams pulled down marks||Mumbai: The performance of Class XII students of the Council of the Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE), both in the state and all India, rose for the second year during the pandemic with a success rate of 99.94% and 99.76%, respectively. In Maharashtra, of the 3,427 registered students in 53 schools, only two were placed in the unsuccessful category. In 2019, before the pandemic struck, two students had scored a perfect 100% in the country. This year’s assessment was based on performances in Class X, XI and XII after cancellation of exams due to the pandemic. Of the 94,011 registered students from 1,166 schools, 93,718 were declared successful. Class XII students were anxiously awaiting results as they want to pursue higher studies, both abroad and in India. A number of students said their scores suffered due to their Class XI marks. “The Class XI tests were far more difficult than Class XII internal exams,” said a student of a Kandivli school, who secured 86%. Two girls from North Point School, Koparkhairane, scored identical marks to top the city. While Ivy Thomas topped humanities with 99.6%, her commerce counterpart Riya Chandra secured 99.6% in commerce, said principal Sudha Menon. Certain subjects such as EVS saw a dip in scores and pulled down overall results. “There also seems to be some moderation by the council for some subjects that were introduced only in this year and do not have a historical reference,” said a principal.  “In ISC, those declared unsuccessful are the ones who remained absent, said a principal. This year, 230 ISC students in the country were declared unsuccessful and placed in the Pass Certificate Not Applicable (PCNA) category. “No student is tagged as ‘failed’,” said a principal. Last year, 2,798 students were placed under PCNA in India, of whom 46 were from the state. N L Dalmia School principal Seema Saini said while results were are in line with previous years’ performance, students said they would have scored more in boards.

Two rivers in Sanguem town, which flows from the hilly areas, were overflowing and many residents had been evacuated to safer locations on Friday. Sanguem deputy collector Sagar Gaude, mamlatdar Manoj Korgaonkar and the agriculture secretary carried out an inspection of all 45 damaged houses. “We inspected the houses with our team and assessed the damage, but there is a possibility of more people reporting damage. The assessment report will be submitted to higher authorities immediately,” Korgaonkar said. According to the report, all the 45 damaged houses are in Kalem and Uguem panchayat but majority are in the jurisdiction of Sanguem Municipal Council. In Quepem, only three houses are damaged.

---||Delhi||May need vax booster to beat Covid variants: Dr Randeep Guleria||NEW DELHI: With more mutations of the Covid-19 coronavirus likely in the near future, there might be a need for India to adopt a booster dose with second-generation Covid vaccines, said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS. In an interview to a news agency Dr Guleria said, “It seems that we probably need the booster dose because with passage of time, immunity tends to wane. We would like to have the booster dose that will also protect against the emerging variants.” The AIIMS director said, “Second-generation vaccines will be better in terms of the immunity they give against the emerging variants and better overall efficacy. The trials of booster vaccine shots are already going on. Once the entire population is vaccinated, then the next step will be to administer a booster dose.” Dr Guleria also expected Bharat Biotech's Covaxin trials for children, currently under way with results expected to be released by September, to pave the way for vaccines for children. He pointed out that Zydus Cadila too had included data for children in its vaccine data when applying for emergency use authorization. He said that in the coming weeks or by September, children’s vaccines should be available. “We should then start schools in a graded manner after vaccinating the students as we have been doing for the 18-45-year population," he said. As for the delay in procuring vaccines despite the Indian government holding talks with vaccine manufacturers Moderna and Pfizer, the AIIMS chief said, “There can be multiple reasons for the delay. I think two or three things need to be kept in mind. One is collaboration and the understanding with the government on the doses. The companies also must have extra doses to give us because we know they have pre-booked orders from many countries and are obliged to provide vaccines to those countries. Unless these obligations are met, they cannot spare doses for countries like India.” India has been in discussions with the two firms on issues like indemnity waiver. Dr V K Paul, member (health), NITI Aayog, had earlier said India was trying to resolve the contractual and commitments issues with the two companies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/may-need-vax-booster-to-beat-variants-guleria/articleshow/84717966.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Bus operators threaten stir from August over no tax relief||JAIPUR: The private bus operators after surrendering their keys and parking the vehicles at the regional transport offices across the state on Thursday have stated that if their issues are not resolved by the month end then they would go on an indefinite strike from August. The operators claimed that while they have been given assurances by officials, nothing concrete has been done to provide them relief despite repeated talks about the private bus owners facing financial difficulties. The operators had asked for tax relief but as yet there has been no order for exemption. Anil Jain, president, bus operator association, Rajasthan said,”for one day we parked our state carriages at the RTOs and officials told us that they would resolve our issues soon but this was told to us even earlier and now we have reached a point where we can longer afford to run the buses anymore. We are getting step-motherly treatment as compared to roadways. If nothing is done within a week’s time then we will be forced to go on a strike.” The operators had asked that the tax on state carriages which run within state be exempted for a period of one year while the same be done for sleeper coaches which run on long routes for a period of six months. There are over 10,000 private operators in the state and around 22,000 buses comprising of state carriages, contract carriages and sleeper coaches. The operators had previously met the state transport minister as well as the officials of the department but got no relief. When the lockdown was eased and buses were allowed to other states, the private bus services started for inter-state movement but they were negligible within the state as the bus owners claimed that they got no passengers for these routes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bus-operators-threaten-stir-from-aug-over-no-tax-relief/articleshow/84717928.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Rise in mental illness cases a worry but Telangana lacks doctors||HYDERABAD: State health authorities have said that the increasing cases of mental health issues amid the pandemic are a ticking time bomb as the state has only a small pool of mental health professionals to deal with the situation. Telangana has an estimated 200 to 250 trained mental health professionals and just 20 hospitals in 10 districts outside Hyderabad. “Most of these hospitals are run by individual psychiatrists and have a capacity of 5 to 10 beds. Within Hyderabad, there are around 10 hospitals, at least a few of which are bigger centres including the Institute of Mental Health, Erragadda. Also, some of the hospitals are primarily de-addiction centres,” said Dr V Rakesh, president, Telangana Aarogyasri Network Hospitals Association (TANHA). The problem is expected to grow over the next two years and despite efforts, state authorities admit that it is a cause for concern. “The most serious problem now is mental health issue. It has surpassed all other post Covid-19 complications. It is a cause for serious concern as symptoms start within three months of getting infected and might last up to two years. We are trying to put certain systems in place. Healthcare workers will try to asses both physical and mental health status whenever they visit households. Even people who are coming to hospitals are being assessed and special psychiatric clinics have been established in districts for the purpose,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director, public health, Telangana. The state health department had previously identified nearly 90 psychiatrists (doctors and resident doctors) in government hospitals to deal with the problem. Meanwhile, doctors seeing Covid-19 patients say that the impact on mental health is being seen in 80% of the patients although many patients continue to resist treatment due to the stigma attached to seeking help for mental health issues. “Patients in ICU are the worst affected as every death around them leaves an imprint on them. Many cry endlessly and slip into depression within a day of being admitted. Even when they are cured and return for assessment, they continue to exhibit symptoms of severe depression,” said a resident doctor at Gandhi Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rise-in-mental-illness-cases-a-worry-but-state-lacks-docs/articleshow/84716239.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Consumer court orders insurance payout||AHMEDABAD: A consumer court has ordered the Life Insurance Corporation to pay Rs 14.60 lakh for 19 different policies with accidental death benefits by considering the insured person’s murder an accidental death. In this case, a resident of Vastrapur, Narendrasinh Parmar, was shot dead at point-blank range by unidentified assailants on March 3, 2009 at Sheel Complex in Mithakhali. Navrangpura police filed an FIR but later closed the case as the crime remained undetected on who killed Parmar and why the contractor was shot. The case was controversial with the police suspecting business rivalry behind the murder. However, the murder remained a mystery with the cops filing A-summary report. Parmar’s widow, Chetna, claimed the insurance payout for 19 different life insurance policies with accidental benefits that Parmar had. The claim was rejected on the ground that Parmar was murdered and died from a bullet wound and not in an accident. In 2012, Chetna approached the Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, Ahmedabad (Additional) but the forum rejected her complaint saying that this was murder simpliciter and cannot be considered an accidental death. The dispute reached the Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, which ordered the insurer to pay the claims holding that Parmar was not a party to the murder and was not instrumental in provocation and the immediate cause of action was not a result of a deliberate act by the insured. The consumer commission also said that there is the possibility that the unknown assailants did not want to murder Parmar because the firing had taken place from behind and the unknown assailant could not have identified him. Moreover, there is no evidence on record to show that the assailant intended to murder Parmar only. The commission also said that the victim had not played an active role in the incident and nor did his activities lead to the crime. It further said that the victim had no idea or expectation of such an unwarranted event. The commission concluded that no evidence was brought on record to establish that it was a murder, and therefore it should be treated as an accidental death so far as life insurance is concerned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/consumer-court-orders-insurance-payout/articleshow/84718028.cms||---

They said they were watching the MPs who had skipped Parliament despite the "voters’ whip" to attend the swearing-in of Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu. Kirti Kisan Union president Nirbhai Singh Dhudike accused the Congress of taking the farmers lightly, while KKU vice-president Rajinder Singh Deep Singh Wala threatened to give the Congress "the treatment being given to the BJP MPs and MLAs", whose convoys, houses, and events are under attack. Gathered at Chamkaur Sahib on Saturday, the farmers also opposed Sidhu, whom the Aam Aadmi Party also asked to apologise for using "arrogant words to call farmers". Apparently, he said while assuming office that "the thirsty must walk to the well". AAP’s Punjab Kisan wing chief and MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan said: "His words for the helpless farmers were a pity. When the country was short of food, former PMs Jawaharlal Nehru and Lal Bahadur Shastri walked to farmers of Punjab."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/unions-see-khattar-in-capt-arrogance-in-sidhu/articleshow/84717981.cms||---

They argued that lockdown resulted in massive economic instability resulting in poor immunity of people. “Lockdown led to large-scale joblessness, especially in the unorganised sector. When people are jobless, they cannot afford two square meals that can enhance their immunity. Poor immunity makes them susceptible to any kind of diseases, including mental health issues,” said Saraswati Kavula, member of the Hyderabad team. People came out holding posters seeking ‘freedom from lockdown’ as they demanded the government to look for alternatives that not only save lives but also livelihoods effectively. “The solution lies elsewhere – to improve people’s immunity by improved nutrition, chemical-free food and pollution-free air and exposure to sun and most importantly to have access to income in order to buy good food,” read a press release issued by Awaken Indian Movement, Telangana unit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ngo-holds-protest-against-lockdown/articleshow/84716266.cms||---

---||Jaipur||37 women from Rajasthan to appear for Army test||JAIPUR: A total of 37 women from Rajasthan will appear for the Common Entrance Examination (CEE) for Women Military Police to get recruited as soldier in general duty which is to be held in Ambala on July 25. This examination is being conducted for candidates of five northern states and apart from Rajasthan, women aspirants from Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Delhi along with those from three union territories of J&K, Ladakh as well as Chandigarh will appear for the same. There are a total of 100 vacancies available for the women candidates. “In August last year, online registration was done following which the rally took place in January this year, but the written exam could not be held in March-April as was planned due to the Covid situation because of which it is being conducted now,” said an Army official. Earlier this year, Army had inducted the first batch of women in the military police though sources claimed that not many from the desert state made it to that list. A woman candidate who is between 17.5 and 21 years, has to be at least 152cm in height and should have cleared class 10 with an aggregate 45% as well as 33% in individual subjects. To be deemed fit, a candidate must be in good physical and mental health and free from any disability likely to interfere with the efficient performance of military duty in all weather and across all terrains. The selected candidates will have to appear for medical examination during the recruitment rally as per laid down medical standards. Moreover, any candidate if found to have predominantly masculine characteristics evidenced on external physical examination, will be rejected as unfit. Any candidate having undergone gender reassignment surgery will also be declared unfit. Apart from this, if any aspirant is found to be pregnant, then she shall be disqualified and her candidature rejected. A candidate should not have conceived at the time of reporting or till conclusion of training at CMP Centre and School. “These 37 women from Rajasthan are the ones who have been declared fit to appear for the written exam. Rajasthan has always had a lot of men who have either joined the forces or are keen to join it so we are hopeful that same will be the case with women in the coming years,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/only-37-women-from-raj-to-appear-for-military-police-recruitment-test/articleshow/84717973.cms||---

We are submitting a list of ID cards already issued to the SDM office. In some cases, market associations have attached a copy of Aadhaar card as identity proof. We have asked the employees to wear them or at least carry them while coming to the market,” said Ashok Kalra, general secretary, Sarojini Nagar Market Association (big shops). A senior government official said, as soon as the market associations complete the process and revert, Delhi Police would deploy staff at the entries of the market to check the identity cards. “In case anyone manages to enter posing as a customer and later displays a stall, our civil defence volunteers can question them and Delhi Police can file an FIR immediately,” said the official. “We have a decent number of civil defence volunteers engaged at the market to challan violators. Their numbers will increase after the plan is implemented,” the official added. TOI visited the market on Friday and found some shopkeepers wearing the ID cards, while the crowd was comparatively less in the evening. The district administration has also asked the shopkeepers to restrict the number of staff at each shop, depending on the availability of space. “For small shops, such as those at the mini market, two staff and a shopkeeper, while in bigger ones, such as the main market, four staff and shopkeepers will be allowed. Those with extra staff have been asked to call them on alternate days,” said Ashok Randhawa, president, mini market traders’ association. Earlier, taking note of increasing congestion at the market and violation of Covid-appropriate behaviour, the district administration had issued an order for closing of the export market (200 shops behind the main market) from July 18-20. Unhappy with the decision and failing to get relief despite rounds of meeting with the officials for two days, traders of the entire Sarojini Nagar even kept their shops closed for a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sarojini-market-staff-get-id-cards-to-check-crowd/articleshow/84718021.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama smells fish, revokes 52 teachers’ transfer order in Patan||AHMEDABAD: In a rare instance, the state education department revoked the transfer orders of 52 teachers in Patan district on Friday as they did not confirm to existing transfer norms. These government schoolteachers taught in primary sections. When asked, what had led to the order, a senior education department official revealed that an enquiry committee consisting of eight members has been constituted by the state education minister to investigate the issue. Meanwhile, the 52 teachers were asked to report back to their initial positions till further orders. Senior education officials said that the district primary education officer (DPEO) during the last year of tenure in 2020 had transferred 52 teachers. “The DPEO had issued transfer orders to 20 teachers just three days prior to his retirement after which a few teachers lodged complaints alleging department that it was being done with monetary benefits. This had raised suspicions and the department instituted an enquiry,” said a senior education department official. They further stated that normally ahead of any transfer, aspects like how many training camps the teachers have attended, whether there were personal health or family issues, are considered. But no such aspects were observed in any of the applications submitted to the DPEO office. State education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama confirmed the development, “It is true. We have revoked the transfer orders of the 52 teachers and have instituted an inquiry. We are seeing whether these transfer orders were undertaken following unlawful methods.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/minister-smells-fish-revokes-52-teachers-transfer-order/articleshow/84718022.cms||---

The complaint has been registered at Ranip police station by Rakesh Chaudhary, 35, who is working as a motor vehicle inspector at Ahmedabad RTO. In his complaint, Chaudhary stated that on Friday he was on duty when the road transport officer, Ahmedabad, R S Desai was on a surprise visit and he found Anil Modi with documents including original licences, and vehicle registration cards for cancellation of hypothecation among others. Modi was found with an applicant in the RTO. Later, he was taken to the assistant road transport officer, Vinita Yadav, who checked the papers and even questioned Modi. Modi informed Yadav that he was operating a driving school. On checking the documents, Yadav found the documents for loan cancellation for two cars, a transfer document for the change of ownership of a car and original driving licence. The complaint states that Modi had illegally entered the RTO office, and that apart from an applicant no other person is permitted to enter the RTO office. But in this case, he was found moving around with original documents of multiple applicants. Chaudhary said that he filed a police complaint against Modi after RTO officials told him. In another recent case, Hardik Goswami, a motor vehicle inspector in Ahmedabad RTO had registered a complaint with Vastrapur police under IPC Sections 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) against two persons. The accused in that case were Kunal Patel, resident of Thaltej and one Kalpesh. They were accused of selling forged licences shown as issued by Gandhinagar RTO but carrying the digital signature of Ahmedabad RTO. Kalpesh too apparently used to work as an agent in RTO Ahmedabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/agent-caught-trespassing-at-rto-office-with-documents/articleshow/84718024.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||About 24% in Hyderabad have got at least 1 jab, shows data||HYDERABAD: Amid indications of a third wave of Covid-19, a quick scan of vaccination data reveals that about 24% of Hyderabad’s population has taken at least one shot. Among them only 6% have, however, completed both the doses. These facts came to light following an analysis of vaccination data sourced from 10 major cities in India. According to this data, Visakhapatnam (with 66%), Bhopal (58%) and Bengaluru (50%) are the only state capitals where 50% or more of the population have got at least one jab of the Covid-19 vaccine (numbers taken into consideration till Thursday). Other metros — Mumbai (26%), Chennai (24%), Delhi (24%) and Kolkata (20%) — all stand under the 30%-mark. Cities like Thiruvananthapuram and Lucknow, though, have stayed ahead with 49% and 36% first dose coverage respectively. Interestingly, the capital of Kerala and Visakhapatnam were also found to have the highest per cent of people — at 21% and 19% respectively — who have taken both doses. But despite the disparity in numbers, Dr Subodh Kandmuthan, professor and director, centre for health care management, Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI) maintained that all states have progressed well in vaccine coverage, despite a large eligible population. “Also, this coverage percentage will be at least 10% to 15% higher in every city as the vaccine coverage data calculated here is on the total population whereas only those above 18 years are getting the jab,” he said. Experts also said that there are no prescribed guidelines to determine what percentage of the population should be covered within what time. According to professor Shashank Tripathi of the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, the vaccine coverage should be improved to save more lives. “The idea of herd immunity is highly theoretical and is calculated on parameters like when the virus is static and everyone has equal immunity levels. But that is not possible in reality,” he said, adding, “There are sufficient studies and examples to establish that two doses of the vaccine give better protection against mortality in Covid- 19 cases. It is, therefore, better to cover as much population as possible.”. While the vaccination drives have been largely focused on cities — as there is better acceptability to the vaccine — Dr Subodh said that this momentum should continue and the focus should simultaneously shift to the rural areas. This, he said, will help India achieve 60% to 70% vaccination in the months to come to avoid the severity of the third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/about-24-in-hyd-have-got-at-least-1-jab-shows-data/articleshow/84716253.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

As many as 4,685 ICSE and 922 ISC students passed the exam on criterion chalked out by Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations. As the exams were cancelled due to the second wave of Covid-19, CICSE had set an assessment criteria to evaluate students. For ICSE, average marks of subjects scored by students in classes 9 and 10 were taken into consideration whereas for ISC, average marks scored by candidates in various exams in class 11 and 12 were taken into consideration, including marks scored in project work and practicals. This year too CICSE did not issue any merit list. However, at many city schools, all students secured distinction and above. “CISCE has taken into account various factors before coming up with this formula for calculating the result. We have worked very diligently with our students last year though classes were online to ensure there were no learning gaps,” said Madhavi Chandra, principal of Gitanjali Devshala. At Niraj Public School, 22 ICSE students secured 90% and above, 56 students secured 80-89% and two students secured 70-79%. In many other schools several students recorded above 90% marks. CICSE said that students who are unsatisfied with their result can make a written complaint to their respective schools. Schools have to go through complaints and submit them to CICSE by August 1. “Truly a sigh of relief as declaration of results finally marks an end to this very challenging academic year. We are glad the council came up with a fair alternative marking scheme to ensure the career of students is not hampered,” said T Anil Israel, principal, Johnson Grammar School, Mallapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-records-100-pass-percentage-in-icse-isc-exams/articleshow/84716287.cms||---

Covid cure diagnostic tests will be made available up to the primary healthcare centres by roping in private laboratories. Among Covid patients, it has been found that it may cause thromboembolism, cytokine storm, septicemia, myocarditis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome and inflammation, which deteriorates the condition of patients and which may lead to death. For diagnosing them, doctors are using tests such as D-dimer, interleukin 6 (IL6), procalcitonin, troponin I and troponin T, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LD or LDH) and c-reactive protein (CRP). People wait in a long queue for theor turn at a vaccination centre in Sikar’s Fatehpur on Saturday.“We have taken a decision to ensure availability of eight tests, which are helpful in diagnosis of various conditions of Covid patients, up to the primary health centres and community health centres. The tests will also be made available at district, sub-district and satellite hospitals too. For the purpose, we are roping in private laboratories, which collect samples from PHCs, CHCs and government hospitals that do not have testing facilities and send them to private laboratories,” said a senior health department official. The eight diagnostic tests will be made available at 54 district, sub-district and satellite hospitals, 655 community health centres and 2,147 primary health centres for a year. Since LDH, ferritin and CRP tests are already available in district, sub-district and satellite hospitals, the tie-up for these tests will not be made with rivate laboratories. All the tests will be made available at 655 CHCs and 2,147 PHCs. The health department calculated the need of the tests on the basis of first and second wave. The officials said1.2 lakh patients may need these tests during the third wave. The tie-up with private laboratories will be in effect for a year and for the purpose the health department has invited short-term request for proposal. For the interested firms, the last date for submission of the bid is July 28. The rates of the tests have also been proposed by the health department, which is Rs 582 for D-dimer, Rs 1,300 for IL6, Rs 924 for procalcitonin, Rs 100 for troponin I, Rs 510 for troponin T, Rs200 for ferritin, Rs 100 for LDL and Rs 160 for CRP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-to-make-all-kinds-of-covid-tests-available-in-rural-areas/articleshow/84717994.cms||Syed Intishab Ali
---||Thane||Maharashtra: Immunity in 50% population in six districts, indicates sero-survey||PUNE/MUMBAI: From 51% to 60% of the samples sent from six districts of the state for the fourth national sero-survey had Covid-19 antibodies in them, revealed data even as the state continued to report a decline in new coronavirus infections on Saturday. Though there was a decline in new case detections to 6,269, there was also a sudden rise in fatalities to 224, the highest in 23 days. The sero-survey was conducted with samples taken from the general public and healthcare workers from Beed, Parbhani, Nanded, Sangli, Ahmednagar and Jalgaon. The samples were sent to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), where experts said that the results indicated that at least half of the population in most of these districts might now possess immunity against SARS-CoV-2. The rest remain vulnerable to the virus. The seropositivity rates from the six districts are still lower than the national serosurvey results announced recently, which showed that 67.7% of India’s general population had antibodies against the coronavirus. Compared to the general population, the data from the six districts indicated higher antibody presence among the healthcare workers at 73%-91%. Dr Samiran Panda, senior scientist and head of the ICMR’s epidemiology and communicable diseases division, said: “These were the only districts from Maharashtra from where samples were taken for India’s fourth serosurvey. The districts cannot be used to represent the trend for all of Maharashtra, but they help provide a national trend.” Over 400 serum samples from the general population of each of these districts were sent to the ICMR for testing. Beed had the lowest seropositivity (42.2%) among citizens. Parbhani and Nanded had the highest (60%). As for healthcare workers, each district had sent over 100 samples for analysis. Healthcare workers in Beed, again, showed the lowest seropositivity (73.1%). Highest antibody presence was among health staff in Ahmednagar (91.1%). Maharashtra’s caseload rose to 62.58 lakh and the death toll to 1,31,429. So far this month, the state has reported more than 200 deaths only thrice. As per the Covid-19 bulletin, Raigad district reported 53 deaths, the highest in the state. After two days of reporting under 400 cases, Mumbai added 410 cases on Saturday and fatalities continued to be in single digits. Active cases dropped to under 10,000 at 8,313. The caseload was 7.3 lakh and toll 15,827.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-immunity-in-50-population-in-six-dists-indicates-sero-survey/articleshow/84721433.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Navi-mumbai||Maharashtra: Immunity in 50% population in six districts, indicates sero-survey||PUNE/MUMBAI: From 51% to 60% of the samples sent from six districts of the state for the fourth national sero-survey had Covid-19 antibodies in them, revealed data even as the state continued to report a decline in new coronavirus infections on Saturday. Though there was a decline in new case detections to 6,269, there was also a sudden rise in fatalities to 224, the highest in 23 days. The sero-survey was conducted with samples taken from the general public and healthcare workers from Beed, Parbhani, Nanded, Sangli, Ahmednagar and Jalgaon. The samples were sent to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), where experts said that the results indicated that at least half of the population in most of these districts might now possess immunity against SARS-CoV-2. The rest remain vulnerable to the virus. The seropositivity rates from the six districts are still lower than the national serosurvey results announced recently, which showed that 67.7% of India’s general population had antibodies against the coronavirus. Compared to the general population, the data from the six districts indicated higher antibody presence among the healthcare workers at 73%-91%. Dr Samiran Panda, senior scientist and head of the ICMR’s epidemiology and communicable diseases division, said: “These were the only districts from Maharashtra from where samples were taken for India’s fourth serosurvey. The districts cannot be used to represent the trend for all of Maharashtra, but they help provide a national trend.” Over 400 serum samples from the general population of each of these districts were sent to the ICMR for testing. Beed had the lowest seropositivity (42.2%) among citizens. Parbhani and Nanded had the highest (60%). As for healthcare workers, each district had sent over 100 samples for analysis. Healthcare workers in Beed, again, showed the lowest seropositivity (73.1%). Highest antibody presence was among health staff in Ahmednagar (91.1%). Maharashtra’s caseload rose to 62.58 lakh and the death toll to 1,31,429. So far this month, the state has reported more than 200 deaths only thrice. As per the Covid-19 bulletin, Raigad district reported 53 deaths, the highest in the state. After two days of reporting under 400 cases, Mumbai added 410 cases on Saturday and fatalities continued to be in single digits. Active cases dropped to under 10,000 at 8,313. The caseload was 7.3 lakh and toll 15,827.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-immunity-in-50-population-in-six-dists-indicates-sero-survey/articleshow/84721434.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Ludhiana||Punjab: Navjot Singh Sidhu says SKM’s win his priority, still faces protest||PATIALA: A day after he took charge as the new president of Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee, Navjot Singh Sidhu on Saturday faced a protest by farm activists at Chamkaur Sahib and Morinda in Ropar district, where he had come to meet party leaders and workers, including cabinet minister Charanjit Singh Channi. The new Punjab Congress chief even after he had earlier stated that the ongoing farm protest’s victory was his top priority. Activists raised slogans against Sidhu and showed him black flags for a statement he made at the Congress party’s ceremony where he took charge. He had stated: “Thirsty comes to the well and well does not go to the thirsty.” He had made the statement in connection with farmers protest on the borders of Delhi. However, police managed to escort Sidhu to safety from the parking lot of Gurudwara Chamkaur Sahib, where he had gone to to pay obeisance. Protesters claimed that Sidhu changed his route after he came to know that a large number of farmers were standing on a road near the bus stand to protest against him. Earlier, Sidhu had gone to meet Channi in Morinda, where he briefly interacted with media. “The victory of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) is my top priority and I have been calling this ‘Kisan Morcha’ as pure because it is strengthening the heart of Indian Constitution. Our Congress party has given a pro-people, 18-point agenda for Punjab model and each MP, MLA and worker of the party, including me, is going to work for it. No other models, including Gujarat or Delhi, can compete with our agenda for Punjab,” he said. He added low productivity and low income in agriculture had been forcing farmers to go for such an agitation. “It is my wish that this societal movement turns into an economic power and farmers earn their bread respectfully. Whenever farmers would call me, I would go to them barefoor and will ask them to give suggestions on how the strength of our state may turn into the strength of farmers’ agitation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/sidhu-says-skms-win-his-priority-still-faces-protest/articleshow/84718075.cms||---

The Maharashtra girls’ feat assumes significance in a year when all central boards cancelled their board examinations and decided to evaluate the students based on an internal assessment formula. India’s success rate in ICSE (Class X) rose to 99.98% compared to 99.3% in 2020. Similarly, in ISC (Standard XII), the pass percentage went up from 96.8% in 2020 to 99.76%. No merit list was released this year. Maharashtra result statistics mirrored the good performance of the all India data as both ICSE and ISC success rates improved to 100% and 99.94% from the last year’s 99.9% and 98.5%, respectively. Only one boy in Class X and two boys in Standard XII were termed unsuccessful this year. Schools in Pune registered 100% pass percentage with a large number of students scoring over 90%. In Wisdom World School, Wakad, 120 students out of 129 scored above 90%. A total of 22 students scored 98% and above, said Principal J Simoes. Out of the 115 students who registered their names in Magarpatta City Public School, as many as 107 scored above 90% marks. Out of a total of 173 students of Pawar Public School, Hadapsar, as many as 127 scored above 90% marks. The high scores are likely to impact admission to undergraduate courses wherever the admissions are based on Class XII marks and not on entrance examinations. Payam Shoghi, the principal of Riverdale International Residential School, said, “The children have done very well in their board examinations under very difficult circumstances. Attending online classes is never as productive as in-person classes, yet the students did their best to derive maximum benefit from them. Also, the uncertainty around the exams was very stressful for the students. All in all, this year’s school results have been excellent, and the students have really performed well in challenging circumstances.” R I Katawati, the principal of Hutchings High School and Junior College, opined that while the marks obtained by the students were good, there would be a greater sense of achievement had they appeared for the board exam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-girls-record-100-pass-percentage-in-icse-isc-exams/articleshow/84718061.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Ahmedabad||Cannot allot water body land even if it is dry: HC||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court has said that it would not allow allotment of land of a notified water body for public projects, even if there is no accumulation of water and there is dry patch of land idle. The case involves Pragsar Lake at Bhuj town in Kutch, part of which is being used as a parade ground by the police department and a portion has been allotted for construction of a fish and mutton market. The Bhuj municipality has also planned construction of a ren-basera (night shelter for the urban homeless) on a part of the plot, which bears revenue survey number 736. The Bhuj municipality claims there is no lake in existence on the land and just a channel of water passes through the area. The petitioner, Shriraj Gohil, an architect from Bhuj, claimed that the government record shows that the entire survey number has been marked as Pragsar Lake, and therefore the notified water body needs to be protected from being encroached on. Photographs of the area were supplied to the court. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati on Friday asked the state government to inform the court in two weeks whether the land is notified a water body or not and whether at any point of time, it was notified as a water body. The court also inquired whether the government has de-notified the water body. If it is a notified water body, how did the government allow the civic body to use it for construction projects. The bench said, “We will not come in the way of the state government, if it intends to allot any parcel of its land for any public purpose or project. However, this would be subject to the fact that such allotment of land should not be a part of any notified water body. In other words, what we want to convey is if the revenue survey is otherwise a notified water body then whether water accumulates there or not, it will still remain a water body. If that be so, the state government owes an explanation as to in what circumstances it allotted the land to the municipality and police department.” The HC also insisted that the government needs to protect the land by developing it. “This is Kutch, where rain is very scarce, very scanty. You need to come out with dredging so that water accumulates on the land,” Justice Pardiwala said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cannot-allot-water-body-land-even-if-it-is-dry-hc/articleshow/84718095.cms||---

Kangale, whose sister-in-law too is in police department, ran out of luck after cops started searching for him following theft of a bike at police headquarters. Gittikhadan police team, under senior inspector Gajanan Kalyankar, is learnt to have recovered eight stolen bikes from Kangale which he had abandoned after they ran out of fuel. Police said Kangale barely disposed of any bikes after stealing them. Though Kangale has got previous records of bike thefts, there was no record of any crime by him after 2014. Police said Kangale had stolen half dozen vehicles between July 18 and 19 before getting trapped on July 20. He had got frustrated staying alone and wanted to marry but none of his relatives, including his elder brother, took any interest in it. According to cops, Kangale has revealed during his interrogation that not getting married tormented him so much that he became vengeful. It’s learnt Kangale, who earned his livelihood through small works, had been left jobless due to lockdown. Loneliness and joblessness drove him to commit thefts of bikes. “He (Kangale) basically targeted bikes whose handle locks would be left unlocked. He used some master keys to start the ignition of the bikes and fled with them. After the joy-ride, Kangale would abandon it and steal another bike,” said sub-inspector Datta Pendhkar of Gittikhadan police station. It’s learnt that Kangale had stolen a bike from Hingna and came to police headquarters where he used to stay earlier when his father was in the police department. Kangale got trapped following an information of constable Baljeet Thakur. After his arrest, police recovered the stolen bikes by Kangale from different places where he had left them parked. He had stolen bikes from Sadar, MIDC, Hingna, Mankapur, Sadar and Gittikhadan, sources said. Police said several arrested persons like Kangale have stated during their custodial interrogation that they were forced to steal after being rendered jobless due to lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/unable-to-marry-during-lockdown-man-starts-stealing-bikes-nabbed/articleshow/84714864.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Housing society, office-bearers fined for not fixing external leak||MUMBAI: Observing that when a leakage is external, it is the responsibility of the co-operative housing society to fix it, a magistrate’s court convicted a society in Chembur and its chairman and secretary, directing them to pay a fine of Rs 10,000 each for ignoring a shop owner’s request to repair the damage for almost a decade. The fine imposed was the maximum under the law and the court said the leakage would have to be fixed within two months, failing which they would face action, reports Rebecca Samervel. Atul Cooperative Housing Society, its chairman Arun Baghchi and secretary Alok Sarkar were booked under the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act on a complaint from Purnachandra Dasgupta, a resident who owned 3 shops that faced the problem of heavy leakage. The court refuted the defence contention that since the accused were not the owners of the housing society, they were not liable to abate the leakages. Court: Citizen can’t be made to run around just to fix leakA magistrate’s court has convicted and fined a housing society and its office-bearers for not fixing a n extgernal leakage despite a complaint. When the defence contended that the office-bearers were not the owners of the society, the court held that the building is owned by the society. “[A]fter formation of the cooperative housing society, the office-bearers become responsible to take care of every issue relating to the premises of its members. It is well-known that if the leakages are from internal side, then it has to be taken care by the members themselves. However, if the leakages are from external side, then those have to be taken care by the society, that is, office-bearers of the society,” the magistrate’s court said. While the defence claimed that the court could only pronounce the sentence and only the cooperative court had the jurisdiction to give directions to fix the leakage, the magistrate’s court held it was not deciding any civil rights of the parties. “The object of any law is to protect the rights of citizens and administration of justice. It is unjustifiable that a citizen should run from forum to forum just to get basic reliefs, which often pertain to necessities. Therefore, I do not find any impediment to give directions regarding abatement of leakages,” the court said. The minimum fine amount prescribed by the act was Rs 2,000 and the maximum, Rs 10,000. Imposing the maximum fine, the court reasoned: “The evidence on record reveals that the shop owner is facing this issue of leakages since 2013-14.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/court-citizen-cant-be-made-to-run-around-just-to-fix-leak/articleshow/84719973.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The FIR has been lodged against Amit Balwani and Kuldeep Karavedra who promised to sell the flat and took the money. Umesh Sharma, an assistant director in the central government’s micro, small & medium enterprises ministry, filed the complaint on Friday. Sharma was a tenant of a flat at Poddar Heights in Chandkheda. He decided to buy a flat in the same society. Balwani, a property dealer, informed Sharma about a flat that was up for sale. Balwani showed Sharma the flat. Sharma told police that he liked the property and on May 5, 2016, he met Balwani again. Karavedra was present in the meeting. The price was fixed at Rs 29 lakh. Sharma was asked to pay Rs 80,000 as token money and the two told him to fill a form. Balwani and Karavedra then gave Sharma the details of a Bank of Maharashtra account and asked him to deposit Rs 6 lakh, which he did on May 9, 2016. The two promised to get the documentation done in 15 days. However, they kept delaying that process and later asked Sharma to pay Rs 2 lakh extra. Sharma said he refused to do so and asked the two to return his money. The two kept stonewalling Sharma. Later, he was told that Balwani had closed his office and had shifted to Anjar in Kutch. Sharma said that he did not know Karavedra’s address.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-employee-duped-of-rs-6-lakh/articleshow/84718099.cms||---

Police said the suspects created the website and claimed to be the official distributors of a Covid-19 testing kit manufactured by the company. The company stumbled upon the webpage on July 19. A company employee lodged a complaint with the police on Friday. Police said the suspects asked people interesting buying the kit to transfer money to their bank accounts. “The website mentioned four different bank account numbers, so we registered a complaint against four people. The suspects promised to deliver the kits to the buyers on receipt of payment,” senior inspector D S Hake of the cybercrime cell said. “As of now, we have written letters to the banks concerned, asking them to freeze the accounts,” Hake added. Hake said they were also looking into whether the suspects sent fake kits to any buyers. “We are trying to trace the suspects using the bank account details and the IP address of the computers used to create this website,” he said. Police have registered a case under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (fraudulently or dishonestly using forged documents).

---||Delhi||Delhi: Stroke cases on rise, doctors advise caution||NEW DELHI: The fear of contracting Covid-19 forced many people, including those suffering from diabetes and hypertension, to stay away from hospitals at the peak of the pandemic. Now, many of them have developed complications and are in need of emergency treatment. Stroke is one of the complications. According to Dr Asha Bakshi, senior consultant neurosurgeon at Moolchand Medcity hospital, 10-15 patients were admitted to their hospital for stroke in the last one month. “We do not know the exact reason behind the increase in cases. Some of them could be related to post-Covid complications. But it is also possible that many people, who were known to be at risk for stroke, developed complications due to discontinuation of periodic health check-ups during the pandemic,” she said. Stroke is a leading cause of death and severe, long-term disability. It happens when blood supply to a part of the brain is cut off, either due to blockage in blood supply to the brain (ischaemic stroke) or leakage of blood from a burst vessel in the brain (haemorrhagic stroke). Dr Bakshi said high blood pressure could be the trigger in both types of stroke. “Anyone with a history of hypertension or high blood pressure should check the blood pressure levels regularly. If the levels are high, it is important to consult the treating physician to recalibrate the drug dosage for better management of the condition,” she added. Diabetics are also at high risk to suffer from stroke. Dr Anoop Misra, chairman of Fortis C-Doc, said that there was acceleration and exacerbation of all risk factors for brain vascular events, including hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol. “This must be tackled urgently with a good diet, exercise and decrease in salt intake,” he added. “Smoking and alcohol intake have also increased because of the loneliness and boredom arising out of lack of social interaction. This can lead to increased risk of stroke. I have a 35-year-old patient who landed in our hospital recently with alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy, which leads to heart failure and ischaemic stroke both. He had a drinking and smoking habit that became worse during the pandemic,” Dr Shamsher Dwivedee, chairman, neurosciences division at VIMHANS, said. He added that parameters associated with stroke and cardiac disorders are easy to monitor even at a domiciliary level. Fairly accurate and easy-to-use instruments are available for both blood pressure and blood sugar. People can either buy them or the local RWA can provide them at the common community areas, which will be of great help in reducing the incidence of stroke and heart attack. “In a worst-case scenario, the fear of Covid-19 should not deter a person from rushing to a hospital. Warning signs could be: sudden blindness, facial asymmetry, weakness in arms and alteration in speech,” Dr Dwivedee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/stroke-cases-on-rise-docs-advise-caution/articleshow/84718127.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

The administration said they are carrying out the health check-ups of the evacuees and ensuring their well-being. However, most people at the shelters were seen ignoring the Covid safety norms. Social distancing and mask-wearing have gone for a toss. Sudhakar Challawad, the KMC labour officer, said, “As many as 2,542 people have been evacuated from the flooded areas in Kolhapur city and have been shifted to 37 KMC-run shelters. The administration is providing food, water and medication to these people. We are also organising health check-ups to ensure Covid safety. Rapid-antigen testing (RAT) of every evacuee will be carried out along with normal health check-ups for cold, cough and fever. We have deployed our medical officers at these shelters.” Shankar Morbale, who was evacuated from Sutarwada and is currently staying at Chitradurg Math shelter, said: “Our rapid-antigen test was conducted on Saturday morning by the KMC. The food and medication requirements are taken care of. However, we are 10 families, with around 40 members, residing in one open hall. Hence, social distancing can’t be followed.” Alka Patil, another evacuee at the shelter, said, “Electricity cut-offs are a major problem we are facing. But the situation is the same across the city, so we can’t complain. It is true that we should use masks, but most of our clothes have got wet during evacuation. We do not have the masks with us.

But he did not do anything for more than 40 years,’’ said a bench of Justices K K Tated and P K Chavan on July 16.The HC held that the state and Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) “have meticulously followed due process of law for acquiring’’ the property.The petition had challenged a July 2019 notification under Maharashtra Slums Act to acquire land in Dadar (W), called Calcuttawala Chawl, and a March 2021 letter issued by SRA to determine compensation for the acquisition.The litigation had a “chequered history’’, the HC observed. The petitioner, through his counsel G A Gobole, said his father had purchased the land in March 1955 in a public auction under Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act. In 1963, part of the plot was acquired by BMC for road-widening and 11 tenants and a factory remained on the plot. He said in 1979 his father authorized him to develop, vacate the property for Rs6,000 yearly till his father’s lifetime.But in 2012 he said he learnt of trespassers on the property. In 2014, a public notice was issued under Slum Act proposing acquisition of the plot for redevelopment and rehabilitation of the slum dwellers. He objected and said he would develop it as the owner.In 2019, the state said it has decided to acquire the plot for the slum scheme.Godbole argued that merely since the owner failed to submit a redevelopment proposal in reasonable time it did not mean the petitioner’s “preferential right’’ as owner to implement the SRA scheme on it. He said “no reasonable time was given’’ to the owner to submit a redevelopment plan.Advocate Cherag Balsara for a slum society of around 50 members, which had appointed a builder to carry out redevelopment, sought dismissal of the petition, alleging a two-year delay in challenging the acquisition. The judge found no “satisfactory explanation’’ for the delay. Balsara said the land had been acquired by the state. He said the property was declared a ‘slum’ in 1987 as its occupants were residing in a “very unhygienic conditions’’ without basic civic amenities.The HC said the Slums Act makes it “amply clear that once a land has been acquired by the state, by publishing a notification in the official gazette after calling for objections, if any owners or others, the land absolutely vests in the state free from all encumbrances’’. The HC said the petitioner, as “owner’’, did not tender authentic legal evidence of his ‘heirship’ and finding no substance, dismissed his petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-upholds-acquisition-of-prime-plot-for-slum-scheme/articleshow/84719989.cms||---

Also, police arrested Jadhav’s brother Aniruddha and five other men for carrying a country-made pistol and two live cartridges, totally worth Rs51,000, later on Friday.

Jadhav’s supporters put up banners and posters to observe his birthday, police said. Police swung into action after spotting the posters and banners at night. Jadhav, who has a criminal record, used to lead the “Raavan” gang in the Pimpri Chinchwad and Dehu Road areas. Jadhav was murdered by rival gang members in November 2017 on Dehu Road, police said. Police said the posters and banners were spotted by personnel on night patrol duty. They immediately conducted a search in the area.

It would not have been possible for many shortlisted candidates from districts like Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur to reach Pune for the examinations due to submerged roads. “Many areas in the ZRO’s limits, particularly in Maharashtra, are affected by floods. Holding exams in this scenario, where numerous candidates belong to the flood-affected regions, would not have been possible. Thus, we have postponed the examination and the new date will be announced once the situation gets better,” a senior army officer from the ZRO said on the condition of anonymity. The CEE of WMP was to be held at Milkha Singh sports complex, Pune Cantonment. The venue for the men’s exam was Bombay Engineering Group, Khadki.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mums must view CCTV footage at day school, says Pocso court||MUMBAI: Cautioning mothers who are forced to leave their children in day schools due to their work, a special Pocso court has suggested that they should call those in charge once every day and talk to their children and view CCTV footage at least once every fortnight. The special Pocso court made the suggestions in a judgement convicting and sentencing a 33-year-old staff member at a day school in Oshiwara to five years’ rigorous imprisonment for sexually assaulting a four-year-old girl who would spend six hours at the centre every day after attending kindergarten. While two staff members from the centre deposed in favour of the accused, the special court relied on the testimony of the child, who it noted began to shiver and turned cold when identifying him in court. “Her body language was enough to show she was still under trauma and after identifying the accused once before the court, she being a small kid reacted naturally. The body reaction of the victim was natural and out of fear. It may be outcome of remembering the incident. I am of the view that the person may lie but the body reacts naturally,” special judge H C Shende said. The accused has been in jail since September 2017. The court prefaced the 70-page judgment by noting that the current case will give a message to all young parents about keeping their child safe by looking into the security of the day school or baby care centres. Giving suggestions on monitoring the children closely, the court said: “If anything is found suspicious around the day school or baby care (centre), they shall make the police and the people working in such institution aware of it. These are very few steps to assure the safety of the child but these may relax the parents to small extent … .” The mother, too, deposed and said that on September 28, 2017, she found that the child was being sexually assaulted by the accused. The mother said that the child confided in her at night when she was asked about her unwillingness to go to the day school. The mother also submitted that when the child had complained to the teacher, the accused was asked not to touch her. The mother went to the police the following day. While the defence witnesses claimed that no male staff member was allowed to be in the area where the children were being cared for, the court pointed to the CCTV footage where the accused could be seen in the vicinity of the child’s room. The court observed that the defence witnesses gave an untrue story to protect the accused and their institution, and possibly because they were directed to do so by the officer-bearers. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mums-must-view-cctv-footage-at-day-school-says-pocso-court/articleshow/84718178.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Dr Sancheti said he learnt the biggest lesson of his life from his father, who was a trader. He had told him to treat customer as God. “When I became a doctor, I decided to treat my patients as God and vowed to never to give any wrong advice to them,” Dr Sancheti said. He started practising in Pune from December 12, 1965 a few months after appearing for his MS (ortho) exam. “I decided to focus on patients and concentrate on operation,” said Dr Sancheti, who has performed around 55,000 operations in a career spanning 56 years. “When I started my practice, polio was rampant. I used to conduct camps across Mahrashtra, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh free of charge. I was interested in earning goodwill and developing relationships with patients rather than earning money,” he said. He was awarded the Padma Shri, the Padma Bhushan, the Padma Vibushan and the Dr BC Roy National Award. He set up the Sancheti Institute of Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation in 1996. He also invented India’s first indigenous knee-implant. He was a part of the three-member team that performed the knee-replacement surgery of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/kh-sancheti-performs-last-surgery-on-his-85th-birthday/articleshow/84718181.cms||Avijit Chatterjee
---||Chandigarh||‘Not our demand’: Bail turns Sirsa farmers against stir’s spearheads||Hisar: On the boil after five of them secured bail in the sedition case, Sirsa farmers gathered at Shaheed Bhagat Singh Stadium on Saturday and claimed they had asked for unconditional release, not bail. They alleged that Prahlad Singh Bharukhera and Lakhvinder Singh Aulakh, who led the Sirsa agitation during the indefinite fast of Baldev Singh Sirsa of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), had become government agents. Sirsa bar association chief G P S Kingra was present along with farmers unionists Bhupender Vedwala, Harvinder Singh, Sikander Singh, Jyoti Barar, and Khushdeep Sra. The front said: “If the demand was bail, why would Baldev Singh Sirsa go on fast unto death? Farmers were let off on bail but a false announcement was made that the administration had released them without any precondition. Why were the Thursday evening bails kept from SKM’s Daljeet Singh Dallewal till the morning he reached Sirsa from Delhi, by when the released farmers had reached Sirsa? Also, when the Sirsa bar association had offered to represent for free, why was an advocate from Rohtak hired for their bail?" Bharukehra and Aulakh denied they got farmers any lawyer, surety, or guarantor for bail. Sirsa bar association president Kingra accused both of "lying that the administration had withdrawn the case". He said: "Not a single section of the Indian Penal Code was removed from the FIR (first-information report), not even the 124-A they claimed." Kingra said: “This is why I say that Bharukehra and Aulakh were planted among the farmers to plot violence to trap the protesters. A lawyer from Rohtak comes for farmers’ bail and the Sirsa bar has no knowledge of it! The farmers who got bail never knew their advocate and guarantor. Why this secrecy?” Told about Bharukhera and Aulakh’s denial, Kingra said: “If they were not part of the plan, why did they remove the dharna without checking and why Baldev Singh Sirsa broke his fast?” Confronted,“Kingra did not attend our dharna, so he knows nothing,” Bharukehra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/not-our-demand-bail-turns-sirsa-farmers-against-stirs-spearheads/articleshow/84718191.cms||---

---||Kolhapur||Krishna level rises to 52.1 ft; 1L evacuated in Sangli so far||Kolhapur: The Krishna river water level continued to rise on Saturday despite the discharge from the Koyna dam decreasing and there being no significant rainfall in the catchment areas. At 7 pm on Saturday, the Krishna water level was 52.1 feet at Sangli city’s Irwin bridge — a nearly three feet-increase since 7 am. The river has been flowing above the 45feet danger mark for more than 36 hours. District collector Abhijeet Chaudhary said: “The rise in the river water level — despite no rain and decreased discharge —is mainly due to water from canals, nullahs, and farms flowing back into the river. The Krishna water level will start receding soon.” Chaudhary said that in the past two days, as many as one lakh residents of Walva, Palus, Sangli, and Miraj tehsils have been evacuated. At some places, the local authorities had given assurance to the residents that the water level will remain constant at 48 feet. As a result, some residents had a casual approach to moving out of their homes on time, and when the water level rose suddenly, they got stranded. Chaudhary said the water from small streams and fields had flown back into the river and had caused the river level to rise suddenly. Meanwhile, discharge from downstream Almatti dam was increased from 3 lakh cusec to 3.5 lakh cusec. The discharge from upstream Koyna dam, however, was reduced from 52,000 cusec to 30,000 cusec. The rainfall in the Koyna dam’s catchment has also reduced. On Saturday, Koyna reported 33mm rainfall, Navaja 18mm and Mahabaleshwar 51mm rainfall. Army rescue team at Shirol On request of the local representatives, the Indian Army has sent its rescue team to the flood-hit Shirol tehsil in Kolhapur district. So far, around 60,000 residents from the affected areas have been evacuated. The Panchaganga river was flowing at 66.1 feet at the Shirol barrage. At Narsinhawadi, the Panchaganga meets the Krishna river. Most of the army troops are deployed in the villages downstream of the confluence. The water level at the confluence was 67.1 feet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/krishna-level-rises-to-52-1-ft-1l-evacuated-in-sangli-so-far/articleshow/84714889.cms||---
---||Mumbai||‘Fishy deal’ to raze BMC’s SoBo market? Contractor raises a stink||MUMBAI: A demolition contractor registered with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has alleged that a contract to demolish the municipal fish market at CSMT has been “fixed”. Contractor Mohammad Husaain, and five other contractors, alleged that neither the invitation to demolish nor the quotation notice was uploaded on BMC’s website. Demolition work at the old fish market located at the southern-end of JJ flyover has already begun. TimesViewRegrettably, BMC tenders and contracts have always been embroiled in controversies with allegations of lack of transparency and nepotism. The BMCmay claim these demolition contractors have an axe to grind as they lost out on the contract. Nevertheless, their allegations are serious and must be probed, especially when they claim they were ready to pay BMC Rs 25 lakh for demolition work. Otherwise, why should the A ward office award the contract on a ‘no profit-no loss’ basis?Typically, a demolition deal would involve the contractor having to clear rubble from the demolition site and only then can he cart away all iron fittings and aluminium from the rubble which he can sell as scrap. In the current case, the BMC has given out the demolition task on a ‘no-profit, no-loss’ basis. The BMC, on its part, has refuted the ‘fixing’ allegation, saying that its computer server was down due to which it could not follow the usual process of tendering works. Hussain and the others have written to the BMC chief that they are “willing to pay Rs 25 lakh for demolition as there are valuable iron and aluminium fittings” in the old market. “We believe there has been some mischief in allotment of work. An inquiry must be held,” said Hussain.  The assistant commissioner of ‘A’ ward put up a notice on July 12, inviting spot quotations, he said, adding that the deadline to was the next day (July 13). He further said that it was put up on the notice board of the ‘A’ ward office and no one was aware that such a notice had been put up. “Due to the pandemic restrictions, one cannot be expect to visit the ward office to check the notice board,” said Hussain. “Also, the deadline to submit tenders is usually anywhere between three and seven days. In this case, just a day’s notice was given” Assistant municipal commissioner of A ward, Chanda Jadhav, said, “This is a court matter. The court had directed the market department to demolish the market immediately. Therefore, short tender notice inviting quotation from registered demolition contractor was displayed on the office notice board as the [computer] system, including portal, were down for upgrade.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fishy-deal-to-raze-bmcs-sobo-market-contractor-raises-a-stink/articleshow/84720020.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Delhi||IndiGo, SpeiJet staff among seven held for gold smuggling at Delhi airport||NEW DELHI: Seven people were arrested at Indira Gandhi International Airport by the customs department after a gold smuggling racket was busted in a 24-hour-long operation. While three of them were passengers, four airline staffers belonging to IndiGo and SpiceJet were also allegedly involved in helping smuggle the gold, officials said. The department says the incident occurred on July 20, when based on suspicion and a prior tip-off, three passengers arriving at the Delhi airport’s Terminal-3 (T3) from Jeddah via flight number QR570 were intercepted after they crossed the green channel. A detailed personal and baggage search was initiated and that resulted in the recovery of two gold bar pieces and a gold biscuit from the baggage of two passengers. “The three items, weighing around 517 grams and with a value of about Rs 22.9 lakh, were recovered from the bag of two out of the three passengers,” said a senior customs official. Interrogation later revealed that the third passenger had allegedly handed over the gold to an IndiGo staffer. “On the basis of interrogation, it has transpired that three members of a syndicate of IndiGo and one member of SpiceJet were also involved in smuggling of gold and they have admitted their involvement in smuggling of 960 grams of gold previously,” said the customs in a statement on Saturday. In the past, several airline staffers have been caught assisting smugglers, often carrying gold. In some cases, the airline staff is handed over gold just before the green channel to dodge officials. Customs says the group has so far smuggled gold worth about Rs 72.5 lakh. All seven have been taken into custody and placed under arrest under Section 104 of the Customs Act. “Further investigation is in progress to determine if more gold had been smuggled in the past in a similar manner and if more members were involved,” said an official. IndiGo in a statement on Saturday said,” A customs investigation has highlighted the involvement of an employee in a case relating to illegal movement of gold. We are fully cooperating and assisting the concerned authorities in this investigation.” SpiceJet did not comment on the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/seven-arrested-at-igi-for-gold-smuggling/articleshow/84718371.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Notably, farmers had threatened the Haryana government before January 26 as well that BJP leaders would not be allowed to enter in district following eight deputy commissioners (DC) and commissioners in Haryana had unfurled the flag at district headquarters, which include Jind, Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Sonipat Karnal, Hisar and Charkhi Dadri where farmers’ agitation has had a major impact. Talking to media persons, Satbir Pahalwan, khera khap president and convener at Khatkar toll plaza, said “BJP leaders never adopted the Constitution made by Bheem Rao Ambedkar with their inner soul, which is well known to everyone. The saffron party leaders’ even don’t like tricolor therefore farmers will not allow touching them it on August 15. Neither BJP or nor RSS don’t believe in the Constitution or Tricolour and the country never saw such government and its ruler Narendra Modi, who has destroyed the nation. Farmers will hold programs on August 15 in which thousands of farmers will take part,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/farmers-tractor-parade-in-haryana-on-aug-15/articleshow/84718253.cms||VIJENDER KUMAR

Besides CSMT station director G S Joshi, the other arrest was of an official named Babu. The CBI said that a case was registered against the accused following allegations of demanding a bribe of Rs 10,000 from a toilet contractor. The contractor said he was asked to pay the sum in exchange for the authorities allowing him to operate his contract without any problems. The CBI laid a trap and caught Babu, whose full name was not immediately available, while accepting a bribe of Rs 10,000 from the complainant on the alleged directions of station director Joshi. Searches were conducted at the premises of the accused. The arrested accused will be produced before the competent court. Sources said that the complainant used to operate a pay-and-use toilet at CSMT. The complainant alleged that the station officials were demanding bribes even though there was hardly any footfall, and so hardly any earning, at the station because of the suspension of train services during the Covid-19 pandemic. Sources said that there were several complaints in the past too against Joshi. “One of the allegations that he faced in the past was of inaction against unauthorised vendors,” an official said, requesting anonymity. It is the duty of the station director to ensure passenger amenities are in good shape, from booking windows to the punctuality and general hygiene of the trains. The directors are also in-charge of passenger grievances and are responsible for their prompt redressal. Catering and vending stalls at the station are also under the director’s jurisdiction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-station-director-at-csmt-arrested-in-rs-10000-bribe-case/articleshow/84718291.cms||---

The government laboratories were told to test more samples now because its demand was currently less and be prepared for the next wave. The advisory came following the state’s struggle to increase the average RT-PCR testing. Senior officials from the health department claimed that the government laboratories were still not testing enough despite having adequate facilities. “We have a capacity to carry out nearly two lakh tests daily, but we are not seeing that number. We need to ensure that the government laboratories increase their capacity by roping in more staffers and mobile vans to collect samples from interior regions,” said a public health official. Officials from the medical education department also stated that they had directed the officials to increase the RT-PCR testing in all districts keeping in mind the third wave. The public health department officials stressed that most districts would lag on the RT-PCR testing front unless the government laboratories increased testing. “Currently, Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) is being significantly used in the interiors. District collectors have to ensure that government laboratories operate at their maximum capacity to collect RT-PCR test samples from far-flung areas,” said another official. The government laboratories’ authorities claimed that they were slowly ramping up the RT-PCR test facilities by increasing the shifts. They claimed that they had achieved 50% RT-PCR testing in the state. The state-run laboratories would slowly increase mobile sample collection vans for the interiors, a representative of a state government laboratory said.

---||Ahmedabad||THE SIGNIFICANCE OF GURU PURNIMA||By- Atul ParikhAHMEDABAD: Guru is a Sanskrit word formed from the roots ‘Gu’ meaning darkness and ‘Ru’ meaning the one who dispels the darkness or ignorance from the disciple. The guru is one who is enlightened and self-realized master. According to the Hindu Sanatana Dharma, the guru is an intellectually, emotionally and spiritually evolved master who leads a virtuous life and has attained a higher level of consciousness. The ancient Vedic knowledge has been passed down generations through oral traditions, and the guru-shishya parampara has existed for ages. The guru is equated with Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh, and the disciple seeks the unconditional refuge at the holy feet of the enlightened master for spiritual knowledge. The glory of the guru is sung in several names and attributes applauding his sacred transforming power. Guru Purnima falls on the full moon day in the month of Ashadh. It is one of most sacred festivals of Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. The seekers of the absolute truth and the supreme consciousness commence the study of holy scriptures on this auspicious day. Swami Adhyatmanandaji of Sivananda Ashram, on his 75th year, vividly expressed the role of his guru H H Brahmalin Sri Swami Chidanandaji in his life and how his Guru had been the integral part of his existence, in his every thought, word and action.

The miniature kitchen utensils, chairs and tables, known locally as “choppu saman”, which generations of children used to play house are safe to use as they are made from seasoned wood and painted with natural dyes and not toxic compounds. “Wooden toys are highly durable and can last for generations and safe to play with and do not break into small pieces which a child could swallow, said Sanjai Gandhi, IPR attorney and GI agent, who has filed the GI application on behalf of Ambasamudram Bharani Mara Varna Kadasal Artisans’ Welfare Association in Tirunelveli district. Earlier, the toys were made from well-seasoned Manjal Kadamba (Neolamarckia cadamba), teak and rosewood. But now the toy makers have shifted to cheaper rubber and eucalyptus wood. The wood is air-seasoned in the traditional way, which takes six to nine months, said Gandhi, adding that it was then cut into foot-long pieces before hand-carved using simple lathe tools. Leaves of the screw pine (Pandanus odoratissimus, ‘Thalampoo’ in Tamil) are used for polishing after lacquering on wood. The selection of the leaf is important to get the desired finish. The best toys are polished only with yet-to-bloom screw pine leaves, plucked from the banks of the river Thamirabharani, he said. “Since only natural colours are used, even if a child chews on the toys, no harm is done,” said Gandhi. And in tune with the times, the artisans have gone beyond miniature kitchen sets and spinning tops, to crafting aeroplanes, train engines, jewellery boxes, pen stands and various other items that find a ready market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ambasamudram-wooden-toys-in-line-for-gi-tag/articleshow/84718293.cms||A Subramani
---||Goa||Goa: Water supply to Tiswadi resumes||PONDA: With the floods receding, Opa Water Works managed to get three of its five defunct treatment plants repaired by Saturday afternoon. Water supply to the Tiswadi taluka, including the GMC and defence establishments at Bambolim, was restored soon after. Supply to the Ponda taluka, however, remained pending as the motors that run the pumps of the 55MLD plant could not be repaired. Water division officials said they were working on an alternative plan to resume water supply to the taluka. The entire water treatment complex was shut on Friday evening after the level of the river Khandepar rose above the pumping station, inundating all pumps and the 33kVA power sub-station that electrifies the plants. Nivruti Parsekar, an executive engineer of the water division responsible for supply of potable water to Tiswadi and Ponda, said they were trying to provide water by two low-capacity plants at least to the urban areas of the Ponda taluka. “We have taken out the inundated pump motors and successfully made two pumps of the low-capacity older plants usable by heating them up at the plant itself. Four major pumps of the 55MLD plant have been sent to Vasco for heating. After submersion, the pumps become defunct and needs to be heated at a particular temperature for a particular period. They are expected to reach back by Sunday afternoon. After that, supply will normalise”, Parsekar said. Opa water works has five water treatment plants that collectively supply 165 MLD water to Tiswadi and Ponda talukas. While the 40 MLD plant is meant especially for Tiswadi and the water of this plant cannot be diverted to Ponda. This plant could be operational easily as it has low risk vertical turbine pumps. Ponda gets water from remaining three plants – 55, 12 and 8 MLD. Since the 55 MLD plant would be operational only after Sunday, attempts to supply water from 12 and 8 MLD plants are on, Parsekar explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/water-supply-to-tiswadi-resumes/articleshow/84720191.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

The total is among the highest daily counts so far this month, but still short of the 1 lakh daily vaccination target authorities had set for the region. Fresh vaccine supplies this week allowed civic bodies to carry out drives from many centres. In Pune Municipal Corporation limits, civic officials had as many as 196 vaccination centres operational. Authorities said the vaccine drives were carried out without disruptions. Coverage in July has been troubled due to irregular vaccine supply. Officials said they are expecting supply to improve in August with private hospitals in the district expected to receive nearly 15 lakh doses of both Covishield and Covaxin. Civic-run sites are expected to get nearly 10 lakh doses. Small hospitals, where vaccine requirement is less than 6,000 doses per month, will be supplied by the health services, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/one-of-julys-best-vax-days-records-over-73000-jabs/articleshow/84718276.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Shiromani Akali Dal slams Centre for not counting farm stir deaths||CHANDIGARH: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Saturday condemned the NDA government’s refusal to recognise deaths at the farm agitation on the borders of Delhi. SAD said a human tragedy was unfolding on the borders of Delhi and more than 550 people had died in the peaceful protest against the three agri-marketing laws passed last year. It also demanded an apology from Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on this issue. Expressing shock at Tomar’s statement that the Union government did not have any record of farmers who died in the ongoing farm struggle on the borders of Delhi, former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal said, “This anti-farmer attitude of the NDA government is responsible for the plight of farmers who have not only been stonewalled for eight months, but even their dead are not being recognised. SAD condemns this anti-human attitude and requests the agriculture minister to apologise to farmers for this statement and assure the country that the ‘annadaata’ will not be humiliated in this manner again in Parliament.” Badal said the NDA government had also made it clear in Parliament that it was functioning in a dictatorial manner and had not even cared to conduct any study to ascertain the apprehensions in the minds of farmers about the three laws. “Tomar’s assertion that no study has been conducted on this issue proves that this government is committed to fulfilling its pact with corporations and will not even take any feedback from farmers on the three farm laws,” Badal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-slams-centre-for-not-counting-farm-stir-deaths/articleshow/84718352.cms||---
---||Goa||J P Nadda kicks off poll preparations in Goa||PANAJI: BJP national president J P Nadda started his crucial two-day visit to the state on Saturday, his first trip to Goa after taking over the reins of the party, by setting the ball rolling for the assembly elections scheduled for early next year. With a little over six months left before the polls, BJP ministers and MLAs have raised serious concerns before Nadda about government jobs, resumption of mining activities and apprehensions among minorities about the party’s image. Nadda, who held marathon meetings with ministers, MLAs and office-bearers to understand the political situation in the state, was told about the rising unemployment in the state due to the pandemic. Though chief minister Pramod Sawant had promised to create 10,000 government jobs, not much progress has been made on it. Besides jobs, the other point that they needed Nadda to prioritise was resumption of mining operations in the state. Mining in Goa had come to a halt from March 2018 and since then the state government has been desperately trying to resume its operation without much success. Nadda told the gathering that the state government has already decided to form a mining corporation and that would allow mining operations to resume. Another issue that was raised with Nadda was the party’s image among the minority community. A senior minister told Nadda that BJP's image has taken a beating among the minority community as it is “perceived to be communal”. The BJP national president said BJP was a party that had interests of everybody in mind and the state functionaries should work towards removing the “communal” perception. Of the 27 MLAs, BJP has 15 members from the Catholic community. Nadda told the ministers, MLAs and office-bearers to start preparing for the elections and to reach out to people and explain to them the benefits of the state and Centre sponsored schemes. He said they should ensure that the schemes percolate to every eligible person, so that they can benefit from it. Later, he discussed the poll strategy with the senior state functionaries to ensure that BJP is re-elected to office with majority. In 2012, riding on a Manohar Parrikar wave, BJP for the first time got 21 seats in the 40-member House. Though in 2017, it failed to win a majority, Parrikar was quick to form a coalition government. Since Parrikar’s death, BJP has focussed on splitting the opposition parties and luring away their MLAs with plum posts to ensure they have a majority in the assembly. This will be the first time that BJP will go to polls in the state without Parrikar, whose charisma and political strategy ensured that the saffron party had an edge over its opponents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/nadda-kicks-off-poll-preps-in-goa/articleshow/84718294.cms||Murari Shetye

The minister said the department was open to accepting elephants as donations to the temples from the public. “Many temples without elephants have approached the state government.”He said the government was committed to reclaiming the encroached temple lands in accordance with the law of the land. “We are looking into the option of attaching small or sub temples to larger temples. We have identified 500 temples in the state with an annual income of more than Rs10 lakh. We will ensure that all the temples in the state are performing rituals at least once a day. Similarly, the temples where kumbabishekams are due will be allowed to conduct them soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/annual-rejuvenation-camp-for-temple-elephants-not-necessary-min/articleshow/84716519.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Synergising architectural & landscape tourism in the city||As the post-pandemic world opens up, the big city romance is cooling off. Mega cities of the world are undergoing major reconfigurations. During the pandemic, many living in astronomically expensive, tiny apartments of New York moved to large leafy suburbs offering better quality of life, working from home by virtual mode. With Covid in decline, many offices are now switching over to mixed models of physical-cum-virtual work modes. The day of the dense, expensive city as the great ‘engine of growth’ populated by a talent pool living in close proximity is clearly over. Many key European cities have decided to make their cities compact, green and walkable in the future. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo has plans to build 870 miles of cycling lanes this year.  What’s happening in Manhattan, London and Paris today, is bound to percolate to our own Gurugram, Pune, Bengaluru and Delhi too. Ironically, Chandigarh that was conceived as a city built to human scale with pedestrian and cycle paths, turned to marauding automobiles gobbling up maximum road space, elbowing out the lowly cycle wallah ! The city was planned by visionary Swiss-French planner and architect Le Corbusier. His Capitol Complex, recognised by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, is rated the world over as one of the greatest architectural ensembles of the 20th century. But has the city done enough to promote this globally famous marvel? Yes, tremendous restoration work of the Capitol Complex was undertaken during the run-up to the UNESCO nomination in 2015 and efforts are on to complete some unfinished monuments. Still, a lot needs to be done to make it more attractive and accessible to the visitor. Many of Corbusier’s visionary ideas, art, enigmas and symbolism need to be explained to the uninitiated and everyday users of these buildings through conducted tours and lectures. Only then will they value it in their hearts to become its future custodians. If we want to maximise the huge pool of architects, planners, art lovers and urbanists the world over to come and visit the city, we will have to create synergy between combined assets of architectural interest. The city not only has Corbusier’s Capitol Complex, but also the government museum, schools of art and architecture and the lake club buildings designed by him. Even the Sector 17 City Centre was planned by Corbusier. The marvellous government housing in Sectors 22 and 7 and numerous public, civic buildings designed by Corbusier’s associates Pierre Jeanneret, Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew along with Indian colleagues are also a huge draw. Come autumn and I would be swamped with requests for help from various architects the world over, planning visits to Chandigarh to study or as personal pilgrimages to the hallowed ‘Le Corbusier Land’ –his greatest realisation. Wary of the Indian bureaucracy, they would be most anxious about permissions to visit the Capitol Complex and other works by him! If we have to fully realise this great potential, then dedicated architectural tourism packages have to be created for guided tours. Besides iconic Corbusean buildings, three excellent architectural museums and a world famous art museum exist in the city, hardly known even to residents. Why such apathy? Do we not publicise them enough? Is there a lack of digital and published information material or are our websites dull, boring, static and uninviting? The city should promote walking/cycling heritage tours besides the usual hop-on hop-off bus tours. The small spread of the city’s geography makes it ideal for compact walking tours. Any curious mind living in any part of the country, when offered an assuring ‘hand-holding’ experience by dynamic tourism facilities will be drawn to the city with its other attractions like the Sukhna Lake, Rock Garden and unique gardens. If we can package Chandigarh as a living model of responsible urbanism -- combining modernism with sustainable green city values: promoting pedestrian/cycling as the preferred transport mode, safeguarding environment using renewable energy and endowed with clean air –it can become the envy of the world! There are a number of untapped areas of growth for tourism. The recently vacated Press Building—the first public building to come up in the city-- designed by Maxwell Fry, Corbusier’s associate can become a hub of numerous mini-museums showcasing Chandigarh’s heritage furniture and other artefacts like manhole covers, tapestries and concrete lights etc. These will draw people to look at Chandigarh beyond architecture as a design/innovation hub too. Chandigarh, with its unique heritage of planned tree plantation, can be showcased through a digital ‘Tree Interpretation Centre,’ also located in the building. Similarly, with concentration of institutions of higher learning in the city and its emergence as a knowledge hub, the scientific curiosity of its youth needs to be nurtured by adding a mini-planetarium. Often, during major astronomical events/occurrences or sighting in the night sky, city’s astronomy clubs set up telescopes on the lake embankment, offering free sightings and guidance to the celestial wonders for passers-by. The vast expanse of the sky vault over the lake with no city lights to disturb, offers an idyllic place for such observations. Similarly, a Museum of Design or Modern Art will be in keeping with the city’s ethos of modernity, innovation and experimental ethos. It is not enough to just build museums and then treat them like sarkari sanghralays dumping grounds for displays with poor maintenance. Unfortunately, a lot needs to be done for the city’s three pivotal architectural museums where invaluable original sketches, drawings of the original planners and documents of the founding fathers’ vision are displayed. The famous art museum, with its world famous collections of Pahari miniature paintings and Gandhara sculptures is bursting at its seams, needing more space to grow. Spotless state-of-the-art best practices of conservation and maintenance along with dynamic outreach programmes for citizens and visitors’ education need to be put in place. The museums need to become hubs of enlightened discourses, seminars and debate to create interest among citizens. Annual art and architecture festivals of world stature need to be envisioned. Regarding showcasing of the city’s marvellous Garden City concept –besides regular tree walks, public lectures and seminars, an annual ‘Tree Watching Festival’ in the month of March when most trees are in bloom—something on the lines of Cherry Blossom festivals held in Kyoto and Washington --need to be organised. There is even a list of notified ‘Heritage Trees’ that need to be showcased with proper signage explaining their characteristics etc. Signage of heritage objects/locations/art works etc. with brief explanatory notes should be widely used. Only then will people understand the intrinsic worth of these valued landmarks. In London, every little nook and corner of the city’s great history spills over to the streets with excellent signage. Of course no one can beat the Americans in turning history into profit ( quite literally ). While Chicago has a large number of excellent city tours on various facets of its history-- they even have a ‘Gangster Tour’ that takes you around the famous hideouts of Al Capone, the legendary gangster on whom a Hollywood film too was shot there. Chandigarh can create its own tourism model. Nowhere in the world do you have such a rich blend of utopian urbanism, iconic architecture, great art and Arcadian landscape –all nestling in a compact area of 114 sq km. A city whose lowly manhole cover sells for over thousands of dollars, surely needs to showcase its heritage better.

People had turned up at the government high school at Maniakaranpalayam for the vaccination drive as early as 6am. After collecting tokens, they demanded corporation officials to open the school gates for them to go out and have food. When officials refused, an argument broke out and eventually they allowed around 25 people to step out to eat before taking the jab.While the list of vaccination camps would be released only at 8am daily, a source said, people queuing up in front of their nearest corporation or government schools as early as 6am was a common sight, as they didn’t want to miss out on the chance.At the government high school at Maniakaranpalayam, corporation officials began distributing the tokens for the 250 allotted doses at 10am. There were, however, more than 250 people in the queue.A corporation official said, “We issued the tokens to the people after taking down their name and Aadhaar numbers. We closed the gates at 11.10am after issuing all the 250 tokens. We did so to prevent the people who secured the tokens from going out and handing over or selling them to others. Another intention was to prevent the people who didn’t get the tokens from coming inside and making a scene.”However, people who received the tokens asked the officials to open the gates, stating they were hungry and wanted to grab a bite before getting inoculated, as they were waiting in the queue for three to four hours. “When we refused, they argued with us. To end the commotion, we finally opened the gates, allowing them to go out and have food,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/hungry-people-fight-with-officials-to-have-food-before-vaccination/articleshow/84716547.cms||---

Meanwhile, following the release of water into the Amaravathi river on Saturday, In Karur, municipality staff issued a flood alert in the district.

---||Goa||Flooding now an annual affair at Sonal, Sawardem||Sattari: At Sawardem, Sattari, it is a strange sight everywhere, as stems of banana plants hang high from tree branches, by the banks of River Mhadei. For locals, it is a cruel reminder of the fury of Friday’s floods. Acres and acres of plantations by the river banks have been swept away, some of the plants landing on tree branches. For residents of Sawardem and Sonal, located on either side of the Mhadei, the floods did not come as much as a surprise as for the rest of Sattari. This is the third consecutive year that Ganesh Pariencar from Sawardem will have to seek compensation from the state for loss suffered to his horticultural crops due to flooding. This year, the electricity supply too has been cut off for almost 48 hours till Friday evening. “I have lost an agricultural shed and several coconut trees and banana plants, with the loss running into lakhs of rupees. Flooding has become a yearly event for the last three years. But this year the water rose to almost five to six feet,” said Pariencar. Most farmers said they are yet to receive compensation from the government for last year’s loss. Across the Mhadei, at Sonal too, normal life lays completely disrupted. The road connecting Sonal to Valpoi town goes under water annually now every monsoon. It leaves locals with two choices – either remain stranded at home till the water recedes or risk your life wading through it. “The height of the road constructed through Sawardem is too much, sending the water flushing down into the homes. Many locals have stopped growing their traditionally cultivated fields in the area, leading to siltation. A bandhara constructed nearby by the WRD has almost led to tree branches getting stuck in it, affecting the flow of water,” said a local. However, environmentalists said that it is not entirely the authorities, but villagers too are to be blamed for the increasing instances of flooding. All along the banks the Mhadei on this stretch, plantations line what are meant to the flood plains of the river. Needless to say the plantations have replaced tree cover. In Caranzol nearby, complaints of illegally clearing forest cover are being probed at present. The effects are gradually felt also in Sanvoshem, Ganjem, Guleli and Nanus. “Some say a retaining wall constructed by the river banks can save us from flooding. The fury of the Mhadei was such on Friday that if a retaining wall was constructed by its banks in Sonal, the water would have flown elsewhere. Ultimately, the destruction could not have been avoided,” said a local.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/flooding-now-an-annual-affair-at-sonal-sawardem/articleshow/84718322.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Pune||Elected members seek extra business hours in Pune from next week||PUNE: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Saturday said he would discuss the possibilities of further relaxations in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits — registering weekly positivity rate of 3.9% and 5%, respectively — with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday, after elected representatives sought extension of business hours till 7pm, besides allowing non-essential stores to operate on weekends. Stating that the death rate of the state was at 2.4% while that of Pune district was at 1.6%, Ajit Pawar said, “All MLAs and elected office-bearers who participated in the review meeting today (Saturday) unanimously demanded that these relaxations should come into effect from Monday. I assure you that we shall positively look into this demand.” He also said the weekly positivity rate in Pune rural had dropped to 5.4% from the last week’s 7%, but the surveillance activities would have to continue in the rural areas of the district. After the district’s weekly Covid review meeting, Ajit Pawar said the state was currently following Level 3 restrictions. Any further relaxations could be allowed in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) areas only after discussions with the chief minister and the state task force. “I shall conduct a meeting in Mantralaya and talk to the chief minister because a decision on relaxations would have to be taken after a full assessment of the situation,” he said. The deputy chief minister said the demand for relaxations for those fully vaccinated was also under consideration. The chief minister would take the final call on it as well because they would be for the entire state, he said. The chief minister was scheduled to participate in a meeting with the national task force on Saturday. Ajit Pawar said the state would have to incorporate the guidelines of the national task force also, and the chief minister would announce it. State health minister Rajesh Tope had said on Friday that districts having very low weekly positivity rate and plummeting Covid death count could get some more relief from curbs soon. He had said the health department would examine the positivity rate of each district minutely and the additional chief secretary (health), Dr Pradeep Vyas, would prepare a report. Districts with negligible positivity rate of 0.1% to 0.2% and low number of deaths might get some relaxations after considering the overall situation, he had said. Tope had said the districts having weekly positivity rate (WPR) around 5% would have to continue to follow the norms. He had also said the state was assessing several proposals from various sectors for allowing fully vaccinated people to operate in bio bubbles. The chief minister would take the final decision soon on it, he had said. The minister also did not rule out the possibility of reviewing the current Level 3 restriction for districts reporting hardly one or two cases. “We shall consider if we can give relaxations to such districts,” he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/elected-members-seek-extra-biz-hours-from-next-week/articleshow/84718366.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The discovery was made by a Tamil scholar and his team while inspecting the ongoing desilting work taken up by Thanjavur corporation.The historic area of Thanjavur city sprawling over 110 acres comprise North, East, South and West main streets and the adjoining neighbourhoods called North, East and West ramparts all of which is encompassed by a moat. The moat that served as the first line of defence for Thanjavur Peruvudaiyar temple and palace is still intact except for the southern portion where commercial and residential establishments have allegedly encroached on the historic fortification. In the past few weeks, Thanjavur corporation has been desilting the moat passing through Kodimarathu Moolai as part of the city beautification drive without altering the heritage. On Saturday, Dr Mani Maran, a Tamil scholar with Sarasvati Mahal library, visited the desilting worksite and found a hollow pipe-like structure on the vertical bank of the moat. He said the passage was meant to drain surplus rainwater from the low-lying localities near Thanjavur palace vicinity covering West, North and East ramparts. The passage was designed to drain the rainwater in the moat in Kodimarathu Moolai. “The length of the water passage should be at least 300 metres. We have to study whether the passage is still discharging the rainwater from the palace locality,” Dr Mani Maran, who is also a member of the board of studies of manuscriptology at Tamil university, told TOI. While the water passage was estimated to be around 400 years old, scholars said there are also chances of the Cholas having established the infrastructure which would have been fortified during the Nayak era. In that case, the actual age of the structure found could be close to 1,000 years. “We have to thoroughly study whether the passage was blocked or encroached upon. ASI Trichy circle that was constituted recently can take up a detailed study to throw light on the ancient water management practice of the erstwhile Thanjavur,” Dr Mani Maran added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/centuries-old-rainwater-passage-found-near-thanjavur-palace/articleshow/84718326.cms||Deepak Karthik

The state has four schools offering ICSE (Class X of the board), through which 302 students — 162 boys and 140 girls — registered. Only one school in Goa offers ISC (Class XII of the board) and 107 students — 44 boys and 63 girls — registered for the exam. “Both, girls and boys, have achieved a pass percentage of 100% at ICSE and ISC,” the board said, declaring the results for Goa on Saturday. For the academic year 2020-21, public examinations were cancelled due to the pandemic and students were assessed based on a formula provided by the board. “For ICSE, one scheduled tribe candidate took the examination, achieving a pass percentage of 100%. Three OBC candidates took the examination, achieving a pass percentage of 100%. For ISC, two OBC candidates took the examination, achieving a pass percentage of 100%,” said Gerry Arathoon, chief executive and secretary of the board. To calculate the results for the ICSE, the average marks in subjects scored by the student in various tests conducted by the school in Class IX and X were taken into consideration. Internal assessment marks scored by the students in the project and practical work for the ICSE year 2021 exam were taken into account. For ISC, marks scored by students in Class XI and XII at tests conducted by the school were taken into consideration. Marks of project work and/or practical work for the ISC year 2021 exam were taken into account.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-records-100-pass-at-icse-isc-exams/articleshow/84718330.cms||---

Out of 261 members on board, 71 lost their lives. The captain, Rakesh Ballav, too died. On July 2, Yellow Gate police arrested Nitin Singh, a director of PAPAA Shipping, Akhilesh Tiwari, technical superintendent, and Prasad Rane, office administrator. The three were booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Rejecting their bail pleas, the court pointed out that their submissions that the barge was provided with life-saving equipment was unacceptable as witnesses claimed that the life jackets were substandard and soon got punctured. The court held that when police searched their office, the CPU containing relevant data was missing. “This rather extends substantial credence to the prosecution case that the accused had every knowledge of the havoc and impact the cyclone was going to have and yet let the barge and its members were allowed to stay at sea,” the court said.Seeking bail, the accused submitted that it was the captain’s decision to stay at sea and they could not be blamed for it. They said they were in constant touch with the captain and did their best to take care of the barge and crew. They said the incident was “merely an accident”.The court said given their positions, expertise and experience, it would not have been difficult to realize the captain was making a wrong decision, and for them to correct it. “The informant was serving a chief engineer on the barge. His narration indicates it was more a matter of negligence than a genuine human error of judgment... the matter still requires a detailed probe,” the court said. The accused moved the sessions court as their pleas were rejected by a magistrate court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bail-pleas-rejected-as-barge-trio-didnt-exercise-caution/articleshow/84720124.cms||Rebecca Samervel

When the city police commissioner came to know about this, she had transferred Jaishankar to cybercrime police station.”A few months ago, the source said, the Tirupur central police had seized a vehicle with banned tobacco products. “The accused had managed to escape and move the Madras High Court, seeking conditional bail earlier in June. Jaishankar did not only object to the bail petition but also failed to inform his seniors about the bail details. Pandithurai had also failed to inform the same to senior officials.”Vanitha had subsequently ordered an internal inquiry against the two. “Based on the inquiry report, the city police commissioner placed the duo under suspension on Friday until further orders,” the source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/inspector-si-suspended-for-dereliction-of-duty/articleshow/84716550.cms||---

The new facility will have space for office buildings, physical training and firing range.Minister for municipal administration K N Nehru told Colonel C Elavarasan, group commander of Rockfort NCC Group, on Friday that he had issued a suitable direction to the district collector to allocate land.About 5-7 acres is expected to be allocated for the facility which will house permanent offices of NCC battalions. There are 5 NCC battalions in Trichy district - 2 TN battalion, 2 TN armed squadron, 2 TN Naval unit, 3 TN Air Squadron (Tech) and 4 TN girls battalion. These battalions are imparting NCC training to school and college students.NCC offices are now occupying hired accommodation paid by the state government. NCC group headquarters Trichy is handling 20,000 NCC cadets from across 13 districts, out of which 7,000 belong to Trichy district.“Non-availability of land for NCC has been preventing centralised training for cadets, annual training camps and future expansion of new projects,” said Colonel C Elavarasan, group commander of Rockfort NCC Group, Trichy. “We received firing and flight simulators from NCC recently, but we are facing issues in making effective use of the equipment for training cadets in the absence of a permanent facility,” he said.Without having a dedicated training area and obstacle course, cadets have to travel long distances for training. “Until a few months ago, we were making use of the firing range of the railway protection force. However, the facility has been closed leaving us with no option,” said Col Elavarasan.“NCC in many states like Maharashtra have progressed after the allotment of land by the state government. We expect the same in Trichy as it would benefit 20,000 cadets in the region,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/ncc-training-centre-to-come-up-in-trichy/articleshow/84718295.cms||Sampath Kumar

It was the lowest death count that the district has recorded in five days. Yet, the district, along with Nilgiris and Salem, topped the state in the number of Covid deaths on the day.In tandem with the drop in daily caseload, the test positivity rate has dipped to 2% in the district. However, the death rate in the past five days seems to be relatively high. The district has recorded 16 Covid-19 deaths since July 20. Given that the district has recorded 919 fresh cases during the period, the death rate stands at 1.74%. This is much higher than the state’s overall death rate of 0.9%.Health officers say the death rate usually falls only two weeks after the drop in fresh cases. Some patients, they say, have succumbed to the virus after a month-long hospitalization.“The death figures will fall only two weeks after the dip in the number of fresh cases. So, the death rate will hopefully come down in another two to three weeks. In fact, the latest 16 victims had contracted the virus in June-end and were hospitalized for 20-30 days,” a health department official said.He said the people’s attitude had also changed. “With the cases plummeting, even senior citizens and those with comorbidities don’t get hospitalized after testing positive for the virus. They must have been vaccinated but that’s not an excuse for taking the infection lightly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dist-logs-175-fresh-covid-19-cases/articleshow/84716539.cms||---

Apart from falling from the vehicles and chances of being run over by trailing vehicles, the presence of nails and other iron objects in the culvert sites recently opened for traffic are often puncturing the tyres.While the state highways had taken up the construction of a culvert on Thanjavur main road near Varaganeri bazaar, Trichy corporation had been working on widening the culvert on Thennur high road near Thennur RoB. After the relaxations, as the vehicular movement had intensified, the stakeholders expedited the work and commissioned the culverts. However, road users have criticised the lack of workmanship while commissioning the culverts for public use. As the culvert area was not properly cleaned and levelled by the authorities ahead of opening for the public, gravel and silt are spread along the roadside near the construction site. “While commissioning the culverts, authorities must take some sincere efforts in levelling the surface,” said H Ramachandran, a commuter from Tharanallur. Iron nails scattered in the worksite are making the tyres flat. Meanwhile, in Thennur high road culvert, the debris is yet to be removed. The poor workmanship is causing traffic bottlenecks. “We will clear the worksite at the earliest to ensure a smooth commute,” an official source with the state highways said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/shoddy-culvert-work-leaves-two-wheeler-riders-vulnerable/articleshow/84718329.cms||Deepak Karthik

Welcoming the move, activists and the public have sought similar measures to reclaim public spaces including roads and banks of canals encroached in various parts of the city.Trichy corporation officials said that they were informed that a land parcel measuring 11,120 square feet in Singaraya Nagar in Karumandapam in ward 45 was encroached by two people identified as P Samuel and R Natarajan. The residential colony with 33 housing plots was developed in 1985 after availing permission from the town planning authority. The layout as per the plan was supposed to have a public space but the area meant for the public park was encroached by the individuals. Although the Madras high court in March 2012 directed the corporation to retrieve the open space and convert it as a public park, Samuel went for an appeal with the chief judicial magistrate court in Trichy claiming the open space belongs to him and had sought Trichy corporation not to interfere in his property. The appeal in October 2018 was subsequently dismissed. A team headed by K Abishekapuram zone assistant commissioner R Vinoth reclaimed the park site and marked the boundaries on Saturday. Trichy corporation officials said that they are considering developing a public park on the land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/corpn-reclaims-land-for-park-in-trichy/articleshow/84718341.cms||---

But now it has been found to have infested the large intestine of a 70-year-old patient from city. Already having lost left eyeball a month ago, the man was admitted to Seven Star Hospital on July 19 after the flesh-eating fungus relapsed in his skull base portion, threatening the right eyeball too. A month ago, the Covid recovered man was admitted to another private hospital following the first attack of black fungus. The man had been complaining of pain in the abdomen while he was under treatment for mucormycosis relapse. Doctors decided to address both the skull bone and abdomen pain in single anaesthesia. However, in laproscopy, they couldn’t find anything unusual to correlate with the abdomen pain. Dr Prashant Rahate, endoscopist and laproscopic surgeon, said that colonscopy done a couple times at the previous private hospital had found nothing. “When the patient was shifted to our hospital, we performed laproscopy. As his blood pressure was low, we placed a tube and removed pus before closing the abdomen,” said Dr Rahate, who is also a director of the hospital. Post-surgery, the patient kept complaining of pain in abdomen and it began to swell. “After two days, we again performed laparotomy. The black fungus was found on 6 inch portion of sigmoid colon. Medical literature has recorded such incidence of mucormycosis,” he said adding that they are rare. Dr Rahate agreed that it was probably the first such case among post-Covid patients in the district. Dr Shailesh Kothalkar, head and neck surgeon, said that the patient’s infratemporal fossa and clivus (skull base) as well as right eye too was getting infected. “Timely intervention saved the right eye as we removed the infected part,” he said. Dr Rahate further that colostomy too was done to ensure smooth passing of feces. “Already, the patient was low on nutrition as he has been ailing for a long time. Healing power was low due to steroids. Colostomy would help the intestine to restore and heal early,” he said. According to him, in case of weak immunity , it is difficult to restore the intestine as there is risk of it again leaking. “Patient started eating from next day,” he said. Several relapse cases were reported in the Nagpur district, which has seen one of the highest number of mucormycosis cases beside Pune and Mumbai. One of the theories has attributed mucor infection to prevalence of Delta variant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/doctors-detect-mucor-in-mans-intestine-during-relapse-surgery/articleshow/84714989.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Ex-state info chief must stand trial in Maha Sadan case||Mumbai: Rejecting the discharge plea of former state information chief Deepak Deshpande in the Maharashtra Sadan scam case allegedly involving state cabinet minster Chaggan Bhujbal, a special court held that charges will be framed against him for offences relating to Prevention of Corruption Act and cheating and forgery under Indian Penal Code. The court said a prima facie case is made out against Deshpande to stand trial. The case concerns a contract the senior NCP leader allegedly gave a firm, K S Chamankar Enterprises, in 2005 without inviting tenders, when he was PWD minister. The builder got development rights of a slum on RTO land in Andheri, on condition that Maharashtra Sadan in Delhi, the RTO building in Andheri and a guest house on Malabar Hill be built in return. The firm is said to have entered into an agreement with another company for the work and afterwards sold development rights of the RTO land to a construction company.The discharge plea was opposed by special public prosecutor Ajay Misar. The prosecution submitted that Deshpande, while holding post of secretary in PWD, provided false and non-realistic information, prepared false balance-sheet showing a prospective profit of only 1.33% to the developer, which was indeed 365.36%. He is also accused of asking the committee of ministers (Infrastructure Development) to act on the status and got the proposal sanctioned. It was alleged that he caused wrongful loss to the state and wrongful gain to the developer.Deshpandedenied preparing any forged document. His defence said he acted in a bona fide manner and only observed instructions of his superiors.However, disallowing the application, the court said, “It is the plea of accused that he himself not prepared the IInd Status Report or Feasibility Report. It was prepared by his subordinate officers. But.. being the superior officer, it was for accused to verify and scrutinize the status report, particularly the arithmetic calculations and to take care of the interest of state government,” the trial court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ex-state-info-chief-must-stand-trial-in-maha-sadan-case/articleshow/84720161.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The village had remained underwater for nearly eight hours. Interacting with villagers, the CM assured them of all possible help from the government in piecing their lives together. While he assured them of providing immediate monetary compensation for houses which suffered damages, major or minor, Sawant issued directions to Dharbondara deputy collector Kedar Naik to make arrangements for rehabilitating families whose houses have been damaged or are vulnerable to damage, at nearby shelter homes. He also issued directions for early restoration of power supply and arrangements for water supply through tankers. When a woman pointed to the imminent threat to her mud walled-house, Sawant reassured her that if she was willing to be rehabilitated, arrangements would be made for her family to stay in a nearby shelter home until her house is repaired. He directed administration officials to identify such families immediately and make necessary arrangements for their temporary rehabilitation. PWD minister Deepak Pauskar accompanied the CM during his visit to the village. Several houses in neighbouring Kirlapal-Dabhal panchayat area also went underwater, leaving families affected. Several houses in Vodlem, Kalay, had remained submerged for several hours on Friday. Sanguem deputy collector Sagar Gaude said that 35 affected families were provided rice bags as immediate relief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-assures-of-govt-help-to-dhavkon-villagers/articleshow/84718423.cms||---

---||Goa||Patient injured as false ceiling at South Goa district hospital falls||MARGAO/PANAJI: A patient and a multi-task staff (MTS) member sustained injuries after a portion of the false ceiling of the Covid ward at the South Goa district hospital came crashing down late on Saturday evening. The patient, a 30-year-old woman who is undergoing treatment for Covid-19, had recently been taken off oxygen support and was stable, hospital sources said. The false ceiling hit the patient’s hand as it collapsed, owing to which she suffered a blunt impact. The nature of injuries sustained by the MTS worker couldn’t immediately be ascertained, though sources said she had a laceration on her elbow. The few other patients in the Covid ward had a providential escape, as sources said that the portion that gave way spanned across four beds of the ward. Following the incident, all the patients were shifted out from that cubicle. “Luckily, the ward wasn’t full. The entire panel of false ceiling spanning four beds fell off,” a relative of a patient told TOI. An elderly patient who was taken for a scan and was not on the bed at the time had a lucky escape, as she wouldn’t have been able to dodge the panel that crashed on the patient’s bed, the relative told TOI. All the patients of the Covid ward were later shifted to the female ward located on the lower floor. The South Goa district hospital was commissioned in May 2020 — nearly 12 years after its foundation stone was laid — with 26 OPDs becoming operational in the first phase. In September 2020, the hospital was converted into a Covid hospital, initially as a 250-bedded facility. The hospital saw its resources — men, material, beds and linen — stretched beyond limits, with the capacity enhanced to 500 beds during the peak of the second wave in April 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/patient-injured-as-false-ceiling-at-s-goa-district-hospital-falls/articleshow/84718407.cms||Govind Maad

The suspect, Tabrez Kumbharlikar from Shivnerinagar in Kondhwa, was sent to a temporary jail at Yerawada after the Pune cantonment court on Saturday sent him in magisterial custody remand for 14 days. Sub-inspector Sachin Khetmalis from the Kondhwa police said,“Police naik Sanjay Jadhav and his colleague Santosh Nikam were manning traffic at Kondhwa gaothan when Kumbharlikar came from the wrong side riding a bike and hit Jadhav. The policeman sought reasons from the suspect for driving on the wrong side and asked him to furnish his driving licence. Kumbharlikar told police that he had left behind his licence at home.” Khetmalis said, “Jadhav then affixed jammer on the suspect’s bike following which a dispute broke out between them. The suspect, in a fit of rage, started hurled abuses at Jadhav, charged and attacked him. He also abused Nikam for intervening in the dispute.” “After the dispute between the policemen and Kumbharlikar became heated, he was taken into custody and handed over to the Kondhwa police for taking action,” he said. Jadhav has registered an FIR under section 353 of the Indian Penal Code, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/youth-held-on-charge-of-abusing-attacking-traffic-cop/articleshow/84718419.cms||---

---||India||Maharashtra to pay banks Rs 3,000 crore as sugar mills default again||MUMBAI: Debt-ridden Maharashtra government has set up a high-level committee led by principal secretary (financial reforms) Rajgopal Deora to draft an action plan for the payment of nearly Rs 3,000 crore to the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSCB), Mumbai Bank and Nanded and Osmanabad district central cooperative banks. It was found that 57 cooperative sugar factories had taken loans from these banks and failed to repay the loans. Since the projects were not viable, the state government had stood guarantor for the loans. As a result, now it will have to repay the loans. In addition, outstanding loans against cooperative spinning mills stood at Rs 800 crore. Sooner or later, the government will have to pay that sum too to the cooperative banks. Sugar commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad, cooperation commissioner Anil Kawade, and MSCB chairman Vidyadhar Anaskar, MD A R Deshmukh and joint director Mangesh Titkare are the other members of the committee set up by the finance department on July 22. The committee has been asked to submit a report on repayment of the loan within three months. “The state will have to pay the loan amount with interest — Rs 2,500 crore to the MSCB, Rs 350 crore to the Mumbai Bank and Rs 150 crore for Nanded and Osmanabad district central cooperative banks,” an official said. It is not the first time such a situation has arisen. In 2011, too, the MSCB had knocked at the doors of the Supreme Court for recovery of Rs 2,029 crore when cooperative sugar factories failed to repay the loan. Then, too, the state had stood guarantor. The Supreme Court had on June 29, 2019, asked the state to pay Rs 1,049 crore tothe MSCB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/maharashtra-to-pay-banks-rs-3000-crore-as-sugar-mills-default-again/articleshow/84720871.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar

The vehicles were stranded between the Kini toll plaza and the Kognoli plaza, a stretch of nearly 40km of the highway, for over 30 hours and chances of an immediate resumption of traffic looked bleak. Vikram Salokhe, highway in charge of the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation Limited, said, “The Uchgaon stretch of the national highway is around 5 feet under water. The stretch at Sangli phata is still around 8-10 feet under water. The water is receding slowly. It does not look like traffic will resume on the national highway by Sunday evening.” Though the floodwaters began to recede on Saturday morning following a lull in rainfall activity in Kolhapur district, the river continued to flow over 53.10 feet at 9pm, well over its danger mark of 49 feet. The water levels have remained over the danger mark since Thursday night. The water level of the Panchaganga river touched 56 feet in the wee hours of Saturday. In the 2019 floods, the water level of the river had gone up to 55.8 feet. Many parts of Kolhapur city and its adjoining villages remained flooded and massive relief operations were on with the help of NDRF and Army personnel. The Pune-Bengaluru national highway stretches at Kini, Sangli Phata, Uchgaon and Kognoli continued to remain under water with more than 2,000 trucks remaining stranded in the areas for over 30 hours. A long queue of trucks and other private vehicles could be seen along the highway stretches. Ramesh Patel, a truck driver from Rajasthan, said, “I had gone to Belgavi to drop off an industrial machine and was returning to Mumbai. Police stopped the vehicles around 7pm on Friday. Since then I have been stuck at Uchgaon. The people of Kolhapur have been providing people like us with food, water, biscuits and fruits. I need to return to Mumbai at the earliest for work.” Vasanti Adhav, a banking professional travelling with her family towards Goa from Pune said, “We have been stuck at Sangli Phata since Friday night. Hotel rooms here are full and we spent the night in our car. Flights or trains are also not operational. There is no alternative route as well. We hope the floodwaters recede fast.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/pune-bengaluru-highway-still-shut-over-2000-trucks-stranded/articleshow/84715030.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

She said when she went to her husband’s home on Friday to retrieve her important documents and other belongings, he did not let her in. The woman informed police and later lodged a complaint. The woman stated that she was married in February this year and was staying with her in-laws. She said that her married life was happy for the first two months. She said then her husband began abusing her apparently fornot doing chores properly. The woman said she endured the torture to save her marriage. However, she said, she was forced to go to a psychiatrist recently. On July 17, her husband assaulted her and asked her to leave the house. She then went to her father’s home in Gomtipur. On Friday, she decided to fetch the documents because she needed them to get the vaccine and to appear for a a competitive exam. Her husband told her that he would never give her original documents back. Vejalpur police have registered a complaint under IPC sections 498A (husband or a relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty); 323 (voluntarily causing hurt); and 504 (intentional insult).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vejalpur-pharmacist-faces-dv-case/articleshow/84718454.cms||---
---||Goa||Floods wash away homes and hopes in Goa's Sattari district||SATTARI: At 5.30am on Friday, Vishnu Sawaikar, 89, was awakened from his sleep by the panicked voices of his family. After being escorted out by his sons, Sawaikar saw the house — constructed by his father close to 100 years ago — fall like a pack of cards at Advai, Sattari. Within hours, 21 persons from seven families of the Sawaikar clan were homeless. “First one wall collapsed, then another,” said Vishnu’s son Raghunath. “We continued moving further inside the house, till we realised all seven units of it were coming crashing down. We stopped gathering our documents and finally rushed out.” Around four houses belonging to the Sawaikar family collapsed owing to massive flooding at Advai in Sattari taluka.They were all saved. But Friday’s floods have not just destroyed their homes, but crushed hopes too. The horticultural fields belonging to the family are completely damaged. “If the pepper saplings are underwater for two days, they are gone. An ordinary horticulturist like me is finished. Can you imagine the disappointment after tending to the plants for so long? Worse, we cannot afford to construct a house here again. We cannot risk it,” he said. Raghunath’s family home was constructed in 1924. He’s homeless, without any ray of hope. And he is not alone. In Masordem, closer to Valpoi town, any dreams 41-year-old Francis Fernandes had of resuming his job onboard a cruise ship have been put on hold. Fernandes lost his job during the pandemic and was temporarily working in a restaurant at Baga. Early on Friday, he lost much more. “At 4am, my wife called to say that water levels are rising fast and our house is about to collapse. She abandoned everything, and with our four- and seven-year-old daughters in tow, began walking out on the road in the rain. She was brave,” said Fernandes. Fernandes’ important documents, including the passport, are either lost or damaged. “It is not going to be as easy to get them made again. I was about to leave on a cruise ship. With the house gone and job gone, all I can do is stay positive that my family was saved by my alert wife,” said Fernandes. Dairy farmer Jerome Mascarenhas has little to be positive about. He cannot help but choke up when speaking of the 10 cows he saw drown right before his eyes. Mascarenhas was at the shed monitoring the situation till 3am. The water from incessant rain was just ankle-deep, so without too much of a worry in his mind, he returned home. “When I returned to check at 5.30am, the water was touching the roof of the cowshed,” said Mascarenhas. “One calf managed to escape, another cow managed to free herself. We tried really hard, but could not help the rest. It is not about the monetary loss, the cows were so lovable,” said Mascarenhas, choking with emotion. The floods may have been a result of incessant rains, as per the authorities. Many see it as a man-made disaster. “This is a man-made disaster, not a natural calamity,” said Varun Sahakari from Advoi. “First, there was silt washing down from the mines. Now, a bandhara has been constructed unscientifically at Ganjem. The government only seems to care about quenching the thirst of those in the city. It cannot see the pain of the people in the village.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/floods-wash-away-homes-and-hopes-in-sattari/articleshow/84718458.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: A treasure of Olympic artefacts at Santacruz businessman’s home||MUMBAI: As the Tokyo Olympics got under way Friday, one sports fan in Mumbai brought out his prized collection of Olympic memorabilia that is the envy of fellow collectors. Through the year, the artefacts are kept in a special room with proper temperature control, and brought out periodically to be dusted and cleaned. Nikunj Shah, a businessman based in Santacruz, owns an assortment of eleven Olympic relay torches, a rare gold medal won by our Indian hockey team in Melbourne in 1956, its booklet, a bib and baton used by Usain Bolt and participant medals of most Olympic ceremonies. His most cherished possession is the gold medal India won under Balbir Singh’s hockey team in 1956. “I bought it at an auction. I cannot divulge who put it on the market because the player or his family may feel jeopardised,” Shah says. Shah became interested in badminton and table tennis during his student years in MMK College. “But it was only when I visited the Athens Olympic Games in 2004 that I developed an interest in memorabilia. Since then I have gone in 2008 and 2012 as well. I have sourced numerous artefacts by cultivating a network of professional and amateur collectors,” says Shah. The collector’s portfolio extends to a treasure trove of items commemorating man’s first landing on the moon, the Apollo mission. “I wish I could have attended the Olympic Games as a spectator this time too. But it is closed to the viewing gallery, and is a TV-only event. I am hoping to at least source some collector’s items. So far no announcements have been made,” he says. Shah has spent approximately Rs 1 crore in building this hoard which is sourced from his network of friends, relatives and other collectors. He says he plans to install the items in a gallery in his new home in Khar. “My wife is supportive of my hobby and it is our dream that sports lovers get to see our treasure,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-a-treasure-of-olympic-artefacts-at-santacruz-businessmans-home/articleshow/84720210.cms||Bella Jaisinghani
---||Bareilly||Man gets life sentence for raping, beheading minor girl in Bareilly||BAREILLY: In a rare case which dates back to 2016, a special Pocso court has awarded life imprisonment to a man who had raped and brutally murdered an eight-year-old school girl in Bithri Chainpur area of Uttar Pradesh's Bareilly district. The court in Bareilly also slapped a fine of Rs 3.55 lakh on him. It is a rare case and was expecting death penalty, the government counsel said on Saturday. Five years ago, the girl, who belonged to a family of marginal farmers, "disappeared" when she went out to play with her friends after school. The accused, who was aged 19 during the crime, had first repeatedly punched the girl on her mouth and face. He then raped and sodomised the minor while she remained in an unconscious and battered condition. Thereafter, he used a sharp knife and beheaded the little girl and buried her body in a cane field. Her body could be traced after a part of her foot could be partially seen from the soil in the shallow grave. Additional district government counsel (ADGC) Reetram Rajput told TOI, “The accused, Pravesh Kumar, was caught red-handed by police. The cops had found the murder weapon and bloodstained clothes from his house. Stains of spermatozoa were also found on the clothes which were verified during forensic tests. We had enough circumstantial evidence to prove that the minor was last seen with Pravesh and his self-confession of the crime was also considered by justice Ram Dayal." The ADGC added, "Fifteen witnesses were presented before the court. Pravesh was found guilty under sections 302 (murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence), 376 (rape), 377 (unnatural offences) of IPC along with the Pocso Act. The court has also slapped a fine of Rs 3.55 lakh on Pravesh. Half of the amount will be given to the girl’s family.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-gets-life-sentence-for-raping-beheading-minor-girl/articleshow/84710878.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Kanpur||Government to acquire land from 274 villages to construct ring road under dream project||KANPUR: Ring Road under the dream project will be constructed on 670 hectare of land to be acquired from 274 villages of Kanpur Nagar, Kanpur Dehat and Unnao districts. The villages had already been identified, and the officials have started a survey which is likely to be completed within 15 days. Thereafter, the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and the ministry of transport would appoint prescribed authorities, notify the project and then send the proposal to the state government for acquiring the land, said a source. As per the process, after getting the sanction of the state government, the NHAI and the ministry of transport will release land acquisition declaration. The prescribed authorities would be appointed in August, the source further said. After being asked by the divisional commissioner to conduct the survey of the villages to be acquired for the proposed ring road, the team has so far completed a survey of 48 km distance. Neeraj Srivastava, member of the survey committee, said as per the map of the ring road as many as 173 villages of Kanpur Nagar, 21 villages of Kanpur Dehat and 80 villages of Unnao districts would be acquired. According to the sources in the district administration, the survey would decide how much land should be acquired from the respective villages and how many farmers would be affected. A sum of around Rs. 3000 crore is expected to be given to farmers as compensation for acquiring their land which would be around 670 acres, the source added. Neeraj Srivastava said that the efforts were being made to prepare a detailed project report and send the same to the ministry of transport. According to the highway authorities, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya during his recent visit to the city had convened a virtual meeting with the officials to review the project and directed them that after the project report was completed other formalities should also be completed at the earliest. He had indicated that the foundation stone of the project would be laid in October. Neeraj Srivastava said, “The proposed ring road will be constructed in five phases. The first phase will be constructed between Mandhana and Sachendi , the second between Sachendi and Ramaipur village situated on Kanpur- Sagar highway, the third phase between Ramaipur and Rooma, situated on Prayagraj highway and the fourth phase between Rooma and Aata village in Unnao district. The fifth and the last phase will be constructed from Aata to Mandhana”. The KDA is planning to raise township and industrial areas on the bank of the ring road, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/government-to-acquire-land-from-274-villages-to-construct-ring-road-under-dream-project/articleshow/84718480.cms||---
---||Pune||Covid antibodies in over half of population in six Maharashtra districts||PUNE: Nearly 51 to 60% of citizens' samples that were sent from six state districts, for the fourth national serosurvey, had Covid-19 antibodies in them, data has revealed. The samples of citizens and healthcare workers - from Beed, Parbhani, Nanded, Sangli, Ahmednagar and Jalgaon - were sent to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Experts from the ICMR said the results indicate that at least half of the population in most of these districts may now have immunity against SARS-CoV-2. The rest remain vulnerable to the virus. The seropositivity rates from the six districts are still lower than the national serosurvey results (announced recently), which showed that 67.7% of India's general population has antibodies against the coronavirus. Compared to the general population, the data from the six districts indicated higher antibody presence among the healthcare workers - at 73-91%. Dr Samiran Panda, senior scientist and head of the ICMR’s epidemiology and communicable diseases division, said, "These were the only districts from Maharashtra from where samples were taken for India’s fourth serosurvey. The districts cannot be used to represent the trend for all of Maharashtra, but they help provide a national trend." He added, "We should recognise that the mere presence of antibodies do not serve as a strong and direct evidence of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection and at best, could serve as a surrogate indicator for protection. Knowing exact status of acquired immunity in an individual requires measuring neutralising antibody titres and cell-mediated immune status." Dr Panda said more district-wise serosurveys should be carried out to plan priority vaccination programmes in vulnerable regions. He said, "Serosurveys should thus be undertaken by states with representative sampling of districts, adequate to generate a state-specific estimate so that the state government can know about ground realities and plan to ramp up prevention drives as well as vaccination strategies in vulnerable districts," he said. Over 400 serum samples from the general population of each of these districts were sent to the ICMR for testing. Beed had the lowest seropositivity (42.2%) among citizens. Parbhani and Nanded had the highest (60%). The data indicates that nearly 40-60% of the population of these districts remains vulnerable to Covid-19, if those already infected and detected with antibodies during the national serological survey are considered to have developed protective immunity as well. As for healthcare workers, each district sent over 100 samples for analysis. Healthcare workers in Beed, again, showed the lowest seropositivity (73.1%). Highest antibody presence was among health staff in Ahmednagar (91.1%). Dr Panda said, “SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can form in the blood after exposure to Covid or after vaccination. As seen at the national level, higher seropositivity among healthcare workers indicates India’s vaccines are working because healthcare workers were the first ones to be inoculated and now have antibodies against the infection. But about 10% of India's healthcare workers are yet to be fully vaccinated, which could explain the relatively low seropositivity among this group in some districts.” Stressing on the need for serosurveys in all districts of a state, Dr Panda said, “Before the second wave, small-scale city-based serosurveys had indicated very high seroprevalence in some districts. But despite that, there was another surge in infections. So a few districts’ seropositivity rates - that too not based on appropriate sampling strategy - should not be used as an indicator for an entire state. Districts that so far had low rates of infection or vaccination in the second wave will be most vulnerable to a third wave. We should not lower our guard."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-antibodies-in-over-half-of-population-in-6-maha-districts/articleshow/84718487.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Goa||Losses due to floods could be over Rs 500 crore, says Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: CM Pramod Sawant said on Saturday that the unprecedented floods in Goa on Thursday and Friday may have cost the state over Rs 500 crore — more than three times the losses suffered by the state after the devastation wrought by Cyclone Tauktae in May. Stating that this is a preliminary estimate of the losses, Sawant said he would receive a detailed report on damage and losses by Tuesday. The CM said that around 5,000 houses have been damaged in the floods. Several fields and roads remain submerged in several parts of the state, including at Amona“Once the final report is compiled, the same will be forwarded to the Centre for financial assistance,” Sawant said. “Our government will provide compensation for the damage within 15 days.” He added that all senior bureaucrats have been roped in to visit flood-affected areas and assess damages. As reported by TOI on Saturday, Sawant said that four lives were lost on Friday due the floods — a woman, and three men who were electrocuted. The flooding affected mainly rural Goa, and was especially severe in the talukas of Sattari, Bicholim and Ponda, besides parts of Bardez, Pernem and Dharbandora. Houses were damaged, some collapsed, at least two minor bridges were washed away, and roads were submerged. The bridge over the Mhadei connecting Paikul and Dhada villages collapsed due to the rain and floodsThe CM has said that foodgrains have been supplied to those affected by the floods. “The bureaucrats have been asked to put things in place in the flood-affected areas. Though the main structure of some houses has not been affected, the internal damage is severe as water and slush have entered the houses. In most cases, the minimum loss could be more than Rs 1 lakh per house, as their electronics, clothes and other appliances have been damaged,” Sawant said. The CM added that he called Union home minister Amit Shah, who promised to provide all necessary help to the state. Meanwhile, the railway tracks along the South Western Railway route have been restored for trains. A temporary speed restriction of 10 kmph has been imposed. Sawant said that on Saturday morning, he visited the flood-affected village of Daukond in Dharbandora taluka, which was almost underwater for around 8 hours. “We have directed the deputy collector to provide primary help to the people in distress,” Sawant said. With the rain receding, life in the flood-affected areas has started returning to normalcy. Water levels in the rivers too have started coming down. The floods have nearly 832 hectares of agricultural area severely damaged, and the preliminary agricultural losses have been pegged at Rs 2.5 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/losses-due-to-floods-could-be-over-rs-500-crore-sawant/articleshow/84718489.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Goa||Goa: Emergency personnel rush to clear fallen trees, road blocks||PANAJI: Even though Saturday brought some respite from the adverse weather, the department of fire and emergency services continued to be kept on its toes with over 20 emergency calls being made by frantic locals on Saturday. The department rescued 424 individuals who were displaced due to flooding while also responding to 19 calls for assistance due to collapsed trees and blocked roads. The department responded to several calls after trees came crashing down on roads, compound walls and on homes. The incidents, said fire department officials, were minor in nature with the maximum loss estimated at Rs 20,000. At Parcem, an electrical transformer caught fire which the Pernem Fire Station helped put out. To keep track of the emergency operations, the department of fire and emergency services has launched a live monitor to track all emergency incidents in the state. The Live Call tracker, which has been developed in-house, categorises the type of call allowing officials and responders to monitor and prioritise the emergency response.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Lift crash at Worli under-construction bldg kills 5, injures 1||MUMBAI: A building construction lift collapsed at Worli’s Hanuman Galli on Saturday evening, killing five persons and injuring one.

BMC was informed about the incident at 6.25pm. “Construction work was on when the incident took place. The injured were taken to nearby hospitals,” said an official. Initially two injured were taken to KEM Hospital, out of which one was declared brought dead, while the other was critical.

---||Delhi||Fix tilted Alstonia tree in Def Col, SDMC told||New Delhi: The forest and wildlife department has issued a notice to South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), asking them to take immediate corrective measures to fix a tilted Alstonia tree in south Delhi’s Defence Colony and to deconcretise the area around it. The forest department said that as the land-owning agency, it was the south corporation’s responsibility to ensure the tree did not fall.It also allowed the complainant in the case to engage a professional agency to save the tree, if SDMC did not have the required expertise. Proceedings have also been initiated against the south corporation for concretisation.TOI had earlier this week reported about how the nearly 40-foot-long tree had tilted to around 45 degrees after two spells of rain. Locals from Defence Colony had been writing to the horticulture department under SDMC for over a month after which a team of horticulture officials visited the site and ‘pruned’ the top half of the tree. However, the tree was left tilted. Officials said support needed to be provided to the tree, but the department did not carry that out on its own.In a letter dated July 23, 2021, Amit Anand, deputy conservator of forests, South, says the tree needed immediate care and protection after it had been partially uprooted on one side and had been tilted. In an inspection carried out by the forest department on July 21, the south forest division said the tree was found to be heavily concretised — a violation of a 2007 Delhi High Court judgement and a 2013 National Green Tribunal order as well.“Further, even though the tree stands, it is highly unlikely for the tree to survive another storm, given the current damage, if no care/treatment is provided to it immediately. For concretisation, separate proceedings have been initiated under the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994,” said the letter.A senior forest official said a Defence Colony resident had written a letter on July 17, informing them about the matter. “All land-owning agencies have been asked to protect trees under their jurisdiction, ensure no concretisation takes place within 1-metre of the base and that trees are in healthy condition,” said the official.While New Delhi Municipal Council has a tree ambulance in place, Delhi’s three corporations neither have a tree ambulance, nor a tree disease or surgery unit, despite directions for the same from a 2007 High Court judgement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fix-tilted-alstonia-tree-in-def-col-sdmc-told/articleshow/84716682.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Delhi||Interference in daily work insult to Delhiites, says CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: The tussle between Delhi government and the lieutenant governor over the appointment of lawyers for the farm protest cases escalated on Saturday after the LG referred the file to the President of India, citing his difference of opinion with the elected government. Soon after, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal hit out at BJP for what he said was interference in Delhi’s running. Last week, the Kejriwal cabinet rejected LG Anil Baijal’s suggestion on going along with a panel of lawyers suggested by Delhi Police and decided that Delhi government’s own panel of special public prosecutors should appear in the cases. Protesting the LG’s decision, Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi on Saturday, “The people of Delhi defeated BJP and formed the AAP government with a historic majority. Let BJP run the country and let AAP run Delhi. Such interference in everyday work is an insult to the people of Delhi. BJP should respect democracy.” Deputy CM Manish Sisodia later convened a press conference in the evening and charged the LG with “rejecting” the cabinet decision. Sisodia questioned the cause for the rejection and said, “The Centre is afraid that the panel of lawyers appointed by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will expose in court the conspiracy of the central government against the farmers.” He said the cabinet had decided that the state government-appointed lawyers would appear in the cases, but the LG had reversed the cabinet decision and referred the file on the matter to the President, describing this move as “unconstitutional”. Sisodia said that the constitutional rights of the elected government of Delhi were being continuously violated by the central government through the LG and all the decisions of Delhi government were facing deliberate obstruction. He asked the LG to stop interfering in the affairs of the elected government. The deputy CM added that the Constitution granted the elected government the right to appoint lawyers. “If the LG appoints the lawyers, then what will happen to the rights of the government elected by the people?” Sisodia asked. Citing the Supreme Court order which says that either the LG could agree with the decision of the elected government and act accordingly or, if the LG disagreed, could make his disagreement known to the President, Sisodia pointed out, “The Supreme Court also said in its order that the LG can refer a matter to the President only in extraordinary circumstances and not in every case.” Saying this was an example of the unconstitutional and undemocratic attitude of the BJP-led Centre, Sisodia said, “The Union government needs to read the Constitution and reflect on how if the government elected by the people isn’t allowed to function, then where is there a need to hold elections and what need is there for the Constitution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/interference-in-daily-work-insult-to-delhiites-says-cm/articleshow/84716660.cms||AlokKNMishra

---||Pune||Pune: Air quality indicators not known to most, says report||PUNE: A report by the city-based thinktank Parisar about air quality awareness among people most exposed to issues such as air pollution has found that calibrated information about air quality is unknown to most, though most felt that the air had changed for the better during the April 2020 lockdown. Although the findings of the report, written by Sharmila Deo and Shweta Vernekar, varied slightly according to educational qualifications and/or literacy, it was found that most people from across professions and literacy levels do not regularly check air quality indexes or readings. For the ones who do, traffic police personnel and autorickshaw drivers seemed to be the most aware, largely due to outdoor digital displays by authorities, such as the SAFAR, project by the Indian Institute of Tropical Metrology, or the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB). A sizeable number of hawkers reported having read newspapers to check the status of air quality in Pune. As for the pollutants in the air that cause the most damage to the human body, the vast majority of people were not aware of pollutants such as PM (particulate matter) 2.5 and 10, generated from vehicular pollution and construction dust respectively, and which affects the lungs deeply. The majority were also not aware of air action plan for Pune. A large number of people surveyed, however, reported experiencing a change in the air quality for the better during the strict lockdown of April 2020, as vehicular movement and traffic congestion was minimal. “Pune has an approved air action plan mandated under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), which lists several actionable items supposed to mitigate air pollution in the city. It is recommended that the plan is widely publicised and inputs are sought from citizens across various categories to make the plan more robust and effective,” Deo and Vernekar wrote in their report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/air-quality-indicators-alien-to-most-finds-report/articleshow/84718531.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Nagpur||Citizens can’t pay power bills in coins of over Rs1k: Consumer court||Nagpur: Can you pay the entire electricity bill in coins? The Additional District Consumer Disputes Forum here, while deciding an interesting case, responded in the negative, if the amount is over Rs1,000. The complainants in this case were willing to pay pending power bills of Rs36,020 through coins of Re1, Rs2,5 and 10, but it was rejected by the judges, clarifying that no one could deposit coins worth over Rs1,000 per day, as per the Coinage Act, 2011. While defending the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL)’s move to sever power connection of complainant Sandeep Thakre — who runs a grocery shop — and his mother Lakshmi, a bench comprising president Sanjay Patil and member Avinash Prabhune dismissed their demand to pay arrears of Rs36,020 through coins of Rs 1,000/day, stating that there was no such provisions in the laws, neither of installments. The Kalmeshwar residents moved the forum after MSEDCL disconnected their power supply on March 12, as they failed to pay the bills for 13 months since February 2020. According to them, no written notice about pending arrears was issued regarding disconnecting the supply, but MSEDCL's move to serve notice through SMS and WhatsApp was upheld by the forum. “From all documents before us and after hearing the lawyers’ arguments, it’s clear that MSEDCL’s action is as per the rules and there is no error in its service. The complaint deserves to be dismissed," the bench said. Quoting various judgments of national commission and other state commissions in Mumbai and Raipur, the bench held that Thakre wasn’t eligible to lodge a complaint, as the electricity meter was in his mother’s name. “Only the person in whose name the connection is registered is eligible to lodge a complaint before the forum as a ‘consumer’. Section 2 (1) (d) of the Electricity Act, 1986, clearly states that other persons are not eligible to lodge a complaint as they do not fall under the definition of 'consumer'. Even though the first complainant is using electricity, the power connection isn't in his name. Therefore, the forum has a clear opinion that he's ineligible to file a complaint.” Flaying the complainants, the judges added that their willingness to pay the full amount made it clear that they had no financial difficulty in paying the arrears. “Considering 13 months default in clearing the bills, they seem to be trying to evade the payment. Although legal provisions of the Coinage Act, 2011 are clear, they appear to have presented unnecessary arguments by misinterpreting them. Ignorance of the law can’t be a defence.” Pointing out that Thakres sought permission to pay Rs1,000/day towards the arrears, the bench said if they could deposit amount through coins, they could have paid the bill regularly in the last one year by depositing it in the bank and later making payment to MSEDCL. “On the contrary, they misled the forum by presenting false information about arrears. It seems that the complaint was lodged to harass the MSEDCL, even though its move to cut off the power supply was appropriate. We’re of the view that the complaint is an abuse of the judicial process available to consumers,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/citizens-cant-pay-power-bills-in-coins-of-over-rs1k-consumer-court/articleshow/84715099.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

For the 8th consecutive day, there were no deaths in Nagpur district. The two who tested positive are a 4-year-old girl from Parvati Nagar and a 27-year-old woman from Mohan Nagar. As per Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) data, 5,647 were tested. The city’s test positivity rate (TPR) was 0.03%, probably the lowest-ever in the pandemic. The last occasion when only two tested positive was June 6 last year. Then, 55 were tested and the TPR was 3.64%. In Nagpur rural, six positives emerged from 1,153 tests (TPR 0.52%). This is more than what was being registered for the last one week — 1 or 2. One person from outside Nagpur district also tested positive in city. Among 27 municipal corporations in the state, the city was on No. 8 with the least cases on Saturday. While Parbhani had none, Chandrapur, Akola, Amravati, Malegaon and Nanded had 1 each, and Bhiwandi and Nizampur 2 each. Chief medical officer of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation Dr Sanjay Chilkar told TOI that cases going down doesn’t mean that “the pandemic is over”. “That will be when no cases are recorded for 28 consecutive days. NMC has continued contact tracing and maintaining tests over 5,000 per day which is playing a crucial role in keeping cases low,” he said. For the eighth consecutive day on Saturday there were no deaths in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/only-2-cases-in-city-tpr-0-03/articleshow/84715518.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Delhi||No proof yet, Chinese man gets bail||New Delhi: A Delhi court granted bail to a Chinese national in an Rs 1,000 crore money laundering case, after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) submitted that there was no material available yet to establish that the money came from any tainted source.Enforcement Directoratealleged that accused Luo Sang, in collusion with others, had generated Rs 1,000 crore of “proceeds of crime” by operating shell companies through entry operators and by preparing forged loan agreements.Additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana granted bail to Sang on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 1 lakh with two sureties of the same amount, and directed him not to leave the country without the court’s permission.The court said that “right of bail” is a statutory recognition of sacrosanct principle of presumption of innocence and there was no rule of law or prudence, which warranted that in economic offence cases, bail could not be granted at all.Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, appearing for Sang, argued that despite six months of probe, the source of funds being allegedly layered through shell companies was still unknown.He argued that for invocation of the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), proceeds of crime was a sine qua non (essential condition) and it was neither alleged nor proven that the money transaction was connected with any crime.ED’s special public prosecutor, Mohammad Faraz, opposed the plea saying Sang was allegedly a Chinese national who had come to India illegally via Nepal and started residing in Delhi from where he applied for an Indian passport on the basis of forged and fabricated documents but it was rejected.Faraz further submitted that Sang allegedly married an Indian girl to get an Indian passport and also set up companies based on false documents, for carrying out illegal business.The court said, “During the course of arguments, it is fairly conceded by the SPP that the source of money involved in the instant case is still under investigation. He also fairly conceded that as of now, there is no material available with ED to establish that the money involved in the present case came from any tainted source… In the case at hand, SPP himself has admitted that there is no connecting link between the money involved and any criminal activity to establish that the money has come from any tainted source, so as to stigmatise it as proceeds of crime.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-proof-yet-chinese-man-gets-bail/articleshow/84716689.cms||Usha Das

---||Delhi||Delhi: Dad kills stalker, says was saving daughter||NEW DELHI: Angry over a man harassing his daughter for the past three years, a 40-year-old security guard strangled him to death. He hid the body in the basement of a building where he lived and worked for two days but was caught when the rickshaw cart in which he was taking the body for disposal encountered a PCR van in southwest Delhi’s Mahipalpur at 4am on Saturday. According to police, head constable Vinod Kumar and constable Praveen were on mobile beat patrol duty (on van Zebra 56) and had reached a hotel in A Block, Mahipalpur. There they spotted a man pulling a rickshaw loaded with an article of unusual shape. The two cops signalled the rickshaw puller to stop, but the man, identified as Surmesh, tried to escape. After a brief chase, the police team apprehended him. They also found the body, believed to be of a man named Santosh, in the rickshaw. During the spot interrogation, Surmesh confessed to murdering Santosh to save his daughter. The PCR team handed over the apprehended man and the body to the local police of Vasant Kunj North police station. An FIR was registered under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code based on the statement given by head constable Kumar. Surmesh was sent to remand in judicial custody. Surmesh, a native of Bareilly, UP, lived with his family on Lane No 6 of Mahipalpur, while Santosh, originally of Muzaffarpur, Bihar, lived on Lane No 12. The former worked with NS Securities as a guard while the latter was a driver for a courier company. Apparently, Santosh had been harassing Surmesh's daughter since 2018 and followed her whenever she left home despite numerous warnings by the girl’s father. On July 22, he came to Surmesh’s house in an inebriated condition and started fighting with him. During the fight, Surmesh first stunned Santosh with a jab and then strangled him with his adversary’s own gamcha. After keeping the body for a couple of days in the basement, he left early on Saturday to dispose of it but ran into the cops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dad-kills-stalker-says-was-saving-daughter/articleshow/84716712.cms||---

The family of the octogenarian consented to donate his kidneys and liver which saved two lives. Their gesture facilitated the city’s 17th cadaver donation for the year, giving the dwindling programme a much-needed push. The pandemic has hit the organ donation programme hard for the second year in a row. Both donations as well as the numbers of the transplants have declined with hospitals deploying their resources to tackle Covid-19. Dr SK Mathur, president of Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC) that distributes cadaver organs between transplant centres, said that the numbers had started to pick up in February and March before the second wave started to become severe in April. “With Covid cases reducing now, we hope to see an uptick in organ donation work again,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-84-yr-old-is-citys-oldest-cadaver-organ-donor/articleshow/84718613.cms||---

The suspect, a factory worker, even allegedly tried to kill her by inserting an air pressure pipe under her clothes, close to her private parts, leading to grievous injuries to her internal organs and private parts. The woman’s stomach bloated up and she underwent surgery at Safdarjung Hospital on Saturday.The incident took place on Friday afternoon. Police have tracked down the suspect and arrested him under sections of attempted murder, rape, etc. The woman works as a daily wage labourer.“The accused, Rohit (20), was immediately arrested after the incident. The accused and the victim work at a plastic plates making factory, which falls under the jurisdiction of Mahindra Park police station,” said Usha Rangnani, deputy commissioner of police, North-West.Investigating officials stated that the incident occurred on Friday afternoon, however, police were only informed in the evening by a hospital where the woman was taken to. A team of police officials reached the hospital where the doctors informed them that there was a tear in her private part. “As per the accused, he used the air pressure pipe which they usually use to dry the plates or pressure clean them. When the woman bent down to pick up something, the accused allegedly lifted the women’s saree and put the pipe under it. Whether or not it was inserted would be clear after the doctors share their opinion. Doctors of a hospital earlier informed police about the crime, when they noticed injuries around her private part. The accused was arrested soon after the incident. He claimed that he was trying to joke around,” an investigating official said.Police suspect the high air pressure could have caused the injuries. The woman, who seems to have sustained injuries in her stomach and intestine, was not in a position to give a statement to the cops.Till June 15, 833 cases of rape have been reported in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/factory-worker-held-for-assaulting-34-year-old/articleshow/84716714.cms||---

Though the cops saved us and we later cleaned the blood in the house, the bullet marks remain unerased on our walls and in our heads,” said 47-year old Shahanbaj, whose family was held captive by two criminals fleeing from the cops in Brahmpuri in north-east Delhi on Friday. Police managed to nab the criminals after a brief exchange of fire. At around 11.30pm on Friday, Shahanbaj, his wife, his two daughters, aged 13 and 11 years, and the eight-year-old son had just started on their dinner when they heard a loud noise, followed a few minutes later by two men with guns barging into the house. “The door of my house was open like we usually keep it. I saw the two of them but before anything could be said or done, they were inside and had bolted the door shut,” said the shaken man. “I requested the intruders continuously to leave us alone, even pleaded that I had small children. The kids were crying and we were shivering with fright. The two men kept saying they would leave in a while and so we huddled in a corner of the room. A little while later, there were repeated knocks on the door.” The factory worker asked in a trembling voice who it was at the door and heard the reply, “Police.” Despite the dangerous situation he was in, he said he had only one thing on his mind when he realised the cops were outside: to open the door. “I didn’t even think for a moment and opened the door, telling the police team that the men were inside as was my family. It’s only now that I realise the criminals could have opened fire at me.” The moment the police entered, shots rang out and the two desperados ran into the room in the corner. “After a few minutes, the cops overpowered them and took them away,” said Shahanbaj. “The incident has constantly played out in the mind ever since. It has also affected the minds of my children, but we are trying to stay positive. We thank the cops and are also happy that we are safe and alive.” The two arrested men were identified as 25-year-old Shahwaj alias Shahbej Qureshi, a resident of Jafrabad, and the other as Arbaj, 25, who was recently released from jail on parole. Two loaded pistols and an extra loaded magazine were recovered from them. Police said the duo were recently involved in a firing incident in the area and had posted pictures on Instagram of themselves posing with pistols and guns.

The mastermind behind Nagrale’s murder, Shivam Gurudev, alias Shaktiman, also aged 19 years, was kidnapped on the pretext of settling the matter and assaulted with a sharp weapon and stones before leaving him to die before cops could arrest him for the murder. Nagrale’s murder and Shaktiman’s assault took place within 10 hours. Sources at the government medical college and hospital (GMCH) said that Shaktiman is extremely critical. It’s learnt that Nagrale was miffed with gambling activities encouraged by Shaktiman and had been telling him to stop. The police is yet to confirm the reason behind the murder. According to a source, Nagrale and Shaktiman had an altercation over some local residents playing cards a couple of days ago. Nagrale’s friends brought Shaktiman, having 11 offences of thefts, to the same locality to settle scores despite a police post just a stone’s throw away. The cops later Nagrale him to hospital. Sources said Shaktiman was abducted from his uncle’s house at Bhande layout by Nagrale’s friends and brought to Kaushalya Nagar where he was stoned and stabbed. His motionless body was later shifted to GMCH where he is on a ventilator. Cops from Ajni police station too had visited Shaktiman’s uncle’s place after Nagrale’s murder but he managed to hide on the terrace. On Saturday, Shaktiman is learnt to have received a call from Nagrale’s friends. During the course of the conversation, Shaktiman revealed his whereabouts to them. The police’s failure to reign in criminals had come to the fore at Kaushalya Nagar where residents claimed that several residents engage in gambling. Illegal sale of liquor is also rampant in the area, said a resident. CP Amitesh Kumar, who had visited the spot, said the culprits have been identified and most of them rounded up too. “We are taking stringent action against the culprits and corrective measures too at the affected locality,” he said. “There had been no complaints of any anti-social activities from Kaushalya Nagar and no incidents too had taken place in the years gone by,” the CP said. Ajni police have so far arrested Nishant Ghodeshwar, having an assault case against him, for his role behind the murder. Two minors have also been rounded up in the murder case. Police have also arrested Nagrale’s friends Birju Shinde and Abhishek Ghodeshwar for attacking Shaktiman. More arrests are likely.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gambling-leads-to-murder-revenge-attack-near-police-post/articleshow/84715152.cms||Soumitra Bose

The work of merging the two flyovers was supposed to be finished by April end but the second wave of Covid led to the shortage of construction workers, which delayed the work.Meanwhile, as the existing flyover above Dwarka junction was closed for vehicular traffic towards the K K Wagh to merge the two elevated structures, the vehicles were diverted to the highway beneath the flyover. However, this only led to vehicular chaos at the Dwarka junction and the twin service roads along the highway to K K Wagh College and Jatra restaurant. The police have not been able to come out with a proper solution to deal with the vehicular chaos.Senior officials of NHAI said traffic snarls were expected as the vehicles plying on the flyover were diverted on the already busy highway.A senior officer of NHAI said the work has almost been completed and certain tests are being conducted, which could be over in the next few days. The flyover is from Garware Point in the Ambad area to Adgaon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/merger-of-2-flyovers-to-be-completed-in-2-weeks/articleshow/84715187.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The arrested men include a cashier and a peon working for a cooperative bank. Police said the suspects stole Rs 15.42 lakh from the ATM, operated by the bank, off Pune-Nashik highway in Bhosari. The cashier Rohit Kate, Rohit Mahadev Gunjal the peon, and their accomplices Anand Chandrakant More and Sachin Shivaji Surve are residents of Pimpri, police said. “The suspects damaged two CCTV cameras inside the ATM kiosk, but a camera outside recorded one of the suspects. We were able to identify one of the men from his footwear,” Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said. “Initially, we registered a case of theft against unknown individuals after the bank officials lodged a complaint,” said senior inspector Shankar Awtade of the Bhosari police said. Deputy commissioner of police Manchak Ipper said the way the suspects opened the ATM using a duplicate key indicated the role of an insider. Awtade said they checked some of the bank’s employees while pursuing the insider angle. “When we visited the bank, we saw that Gunjal (the peon) was wearing the same footwear as seen in the CCTV footage,” he said. The detained Gunjal and questioned him. “He soon the revealed names of the other three men involved in the crime,” Awtade said. He said Gunjal hatched the plan and enrolled Kate, who demanded a majority share from the spoils. “When Gunjal agreed, Kate shared the PIN of the machine and gave him the original key. Gunjal prepared a duplicate of the key,” Awtade said. “Gunjal asked two of his friends to accompany him and help him steal the cash. The duo too sought a share, which Gunjal gave them after he stole the cash,” Awtade said. Police have recovered the stolen cash from the suspects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bank-cashier-among-4-held-for-stealing-cash-from-atm/articleshow/84718650.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Celebrating role of housing societies in times of crisis||PUNE: The pandemic brought neighbours closer. In many instances, the first call for help went next door. People came together to organise food for those isolated at home. Others checked on the elderly who were unable to step out during the strict lockdowns last year. And several citizens collaborated to find novel solutions that held on to some semblance of normalcy, while keeping the virus at bay. There are also scores of examples of how housing societies played a key role in helping Covid patients find beds on time. Many used WhatsApp groups to communicate with health centres. Others turned gymnasiums and amenity spaces into isolation rooms. Now, with the Covid vaccination programme in full force, housing societies are tying up with private hospital sites to ensure widespread coverage. Team efforts are inspiring and need to be celebrated. This is what #MySocietyPride, a TOI initiative, intends to do. Tell us about the welfare measures that your housing society has implemented during the Covid-19 restrictions and The Times of India will feature the best ideas. Scan the QR code or visit www.toi.in/mysocietypride to share the details. Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad have seen countless examples of unprecedented citizen collaboration during the pandemic. These grassroot efforts should be celebrated, and recorded, for future use because public participation is vital. Research shows that people “outside the traditional establishment help raise the intelligence quotient of planning because their imaginations are not necessarily constrained by legalistic, bureaucratic, scientific and other processes” during disasters or pandemics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/celebrating-role-of-housing-societies-in-times-of-crisis/articleshow/84720253.cms||---

She was then referred to us for gallbladder removal surgery,” he said.However, gallbladder stones usually lead to pain in the right side of the upper abdomen. “An MRI that suggested she had ACUM,” sadi Javed.ACUM, which translates to accessory and cavitated uterine masses, in lay terms means a baby uterus inside the normal uterus. There is a hollow mass inside the uterus which has blood and degraded blood from the menstrual cycle.“We had to remove the hollow mass laparoscopically. and we also had to be quite careful in order to not affect her tubes,” Dr Javed claimed.Dr Nivedita Kaul, senior consultant obstetrics and gynaecology was also involved in the case.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra scores 100% in ICSE, 99.94% in ISC||MUMBAI: ICSE (Class X) students secured a national success rate of 99.98% and ISC (Class XII) 99.76% in the first-ever results not based on exams that were announced on Saturday. While Maharashtra’s ICSE students clinched a perfect 100% success rate this year, high scores will not help in admissions to first-year junior colleges as the Common Entrance Test (CET) scores will be given priority in the first round, report Sandhya Nair & Hemali Chhapia. Meanwhile, state’s Class XII students notched 99.94% pass rate. Their Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) and CBSE Class XII counterparts are awaiting their results. They are likely to be announced next week. The Supreme Court, in June, had directed all the states to declare their Class XII results by July 31. A total of 2.2 lakh students had registered for the ICSE exams, which got cancelled due to the pandemic. They were assessed on the basis of their Class IX and X scores. In Maharashtra, all the 24,358 students across 234 schools passed the ICSE. Both boys and girls in the state performed equally well. For the second year in a row, no merit list was declared. For both ICSE and ISC, almost all Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) board schools in Mumbai and across India saw a jump in the 90% and above scorers. Gerry Arathoon, chief executive and secretary, CISCE, refused to comment on high scores. In most ICSE schools of the city, there were only two groups of students—the larger count with scorecards of 90% and above and a small share of those who had scored 80%-plus. At Fort’s Cathedral and John Connon School, director and principal Meera Issacs spoke of the “elaborate system put in place by the council to compute the final scores”. Her school has 193 students who secured more than or equal to 90% and seven who scored between 80% and 89%. Sunita George, head of Bombay Scottish School in Mahim, said, “In Grade X, out of 236 students, 200 have got more than 90%, and within that there is a subset of 37 students who bagged upwards of 98%. And barring one child who scored 79%, the remaining stand between 80% and 90%. Our results are fantastic.” Last year, too, 99.9% students passed in the state after a few papers were cancelled due to the country-wide lockdown. The high pass percentage had impacted admissions to FYJC. In 2019, before the pandemic, the ICSE pass percentage in Maharashtra was 99.85. While a state education officer said that CISCE has been consistently awarding very high scores to its students, Rohit Bhat, chairperson of Children’s Academy Group of Schools termed it as a well tabulated result when compared to other boards. “80% students from our three schools got 90% and above. But there were no black horses. Students who have been consistently performing have rightly scored,” said Bhatt. Supporting the high results, Alice Vaz, principal of Ryan International School, Kharghar said, “One of my boys lost his mother to Covid and yet managed a 96.4% which is commendable.” Jhalak Mehta, who lost her father Manoj (52) in the Andheri Gokhale bridge collapse was among the three students of her CNH school, Vile Parle, to score 98.8%. Dr Gayatri Sharma, principal, A P International School, Mira Road, said her student Ayesha Hadfa, who topped the school with 99% would have got the same score had she written a physical exam. The SSC results announced last week had over 1 lakh students in the 90% category. Across different regions in India, south recorded a 100% success rate, followed by the western region at 99.99%. Schools outside India registered a 100% pass percentage. In India, 13 states secured a success rate of 100% for both Class X and XII. Nine states, including UP, Bihar, Gujarat and West Bengal, had a success rate of over 99%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-scores-100-in-icse-99-94-in-isc/articleshow/84720257.cms||Sandhya Nair

The court said the vehicle owner alone has to pay the compensation.The incident happened in 2013 when Kannammal of Dindigul was travelling in a tractor attached to a harvester machine sitting on the mudguard. Due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver, she fell down and came under the tractor’s back wheel. She sustained severe injuries and died on the way to hospital. Her family members filed a petition seeking compensation before the motor accident claims tribunal at Vedasandur. After considering the evidence, the tribunal held the driver solely responsible for the accident and awarded a sum of Rs 10.94 lakh as compensation in 2018.The tribunal further held that since the vehicle owner permitted the victim to travel in the tractor meant for agricultural purpose in violation of the policy condition, the insurance company shall pay the award and recover the same from the vehicle owner. Aggrieved, the insurance company filed the present appeal before HC Madurai bench in 2019.Justice J Nisha Banu observed that a tractor is a single seater and except the driver, no one could be allowed to travel in it. The insurance policy stated that the tractor should be used only for agricultural and forestry purposes and not for carrying passengers for hire. The deceased along with three others travelled in it and she could not have travelled on the mudguard without the driver’s permission. Hence, the owner of the vehicle is vicariously liable to pay compensation for the driver’s negligence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-frees-insurance-firm-from-liability-of-paying-compensation/articleshow/84716875.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: New pandemic formula a boon for ISC, most school toppers bag 99%||KOLKATA: Though the age-old scene of board candidates flocking to schools to share their happiness of passing board exams with friends was missing on campuses this pandemic year, principals and teachers were overjoyed with their students’ performance in ISC. Anything from 45-plus to 200-plus students have been able to score 90% and above in both ISC and ICSE in city schools. In almost every school, toppers scored above 99% and there are several others, who are just a few decimal points away. Schools sounded elated with the results though pointed out that some of their students could have fared slightly better had they been able to appear for written exams. Schools said a remarkable feature of the ISC results this year was that toppers from all schools were all in the 99-plus category. Principals said this happened because of the lack of variation at the top, when a formula was applied to calculate marks. There has been a significant growth in the number of students scoring 90% and above. Take the case of Ram Mohan Mission School, where around 55% of their candidates would get 90% and above, while this year, nearly 70% students have been placed in this category. “I am extremely happy at this growth. My topper, Ashmit Sen, got 99.5% marks,” said school principal Sujoy Biswas. Virtual celebrations are on at The Heritage School, where topper Harshit Jain scored 99.8% to be informally called the country’s best. “It’s a bit difficult to react actually. I am headed to the US to study an undergraduate course in computer science,” he said. School principal Seema Sapru, while celebrating the success of 75 students who have scored above 95%, emotionally remembered chemistry teacher Suvajit Majumder, who died of a sudden heart attack recently, and called him the pillar behind this success.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Schools won’t reopen on August 2, panel rejects minister Govind Singh Dotasra’s decision||JAIPUR: The five-member ministerial committee formed by chief minister Ashok Gehlot has decided not to reopen schools from August 2. In its first meeting on Saturday, the committee members unanimously resolved to study the guidelines of the central government and other states before reopening schools. They also decided to consult expert institutions such as AIIMS and ICMR before taking any step. “We decided to study the impact of Covid in different states, projections for the third wave and guidelines for schools. No timeframe has been fixed and the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) will be announced later,” said state education minister Govind Singh Dotasra. The move comes a couple of days after Dotasra’s announcement to reopen schools from August 2 created an uproar within the Congress ranks with several ministers and party MLAs raising objections to the sudden move. Higher education minister Bhanwar Singh Bhati told TOI that they would write to the central education ministry to seek their guidance. “Central government schools such as Jawahar Navodayas have not reopened. We would like to know when they are planning to open. Our next meeting will be on July 28 and by then I am sure we will have some concrete information from other states and the central government,” Bhati said. The meeting was attended by all the five members — Dotasra, Bhati, health minister Raghu Sharma, agriculture minister Lalchand Kataria and minister of state for technical education Subhash Garg. Garg said the decision to reopen schools was hurriedly taken and ruled out any possibility of it for the next two months. “Since there’s strong speculation for the third wave, I believe that schools can wait till August and the situation can be reviewed in September. The matter should not be handled hurriedly since it concerns the health of children,” said Garg. Sources said the decision was also opposed by the panel of expert doctors called by Gehlot at a meeting held on Friday. “One of the doctors said it can put children at higher risk. Unless a bio bubble for senior students is created, schools should not be opened,” said a senior doctor who attended the meeting. It was also learnt that the health department was not kept in the loop before announcing the decision. Dotasra tweeted, “A committee has been formed which will discuss and deliberate on the reopening of the schools. Thereafter, Gehlot will decide.” A Congress MLA, who refused to be named said, “Thank god! The decision has been put on the backburner. I had received several calls from my constituency questioning the move.” Opposition BJP also came down heavily on the state government for taking a U-turn. “The statement of any cabinet minister is considered the statement of the entire cabinet. This is unfortunate that Dotasra, who considers himself a capable person, has in a haphazard manner made the announcement of reopening schools from August 2,” said senior BJP leader Rajendra Rathore, who advised Dotasra to hold a discussion with all stakeholders before making any announcement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/schools-wont-reopen-on-aug-2-panel-rejects-dotasras-decision/articleshow/84718727.cms||---

The average pass percentage for this year stood at 99.5. The results were declared virtually by state education minister Govind Singh Dotasra on Saturday. All students who took part in the assessment formula conducted by the schools passed the exam while those who did not were declared failed. This is for the first time in the history of RBSE that no exams were conducted. Even in 2020, exams were conducted by following strict Covid guidelines, which resulted in an average pass percentage of 91. Dotasra said they followed a formula that was in sync with other states and would eventually help students to get admissions in premier institutes. “Considering the pandemic, the education department has prepared a model for conducting monthly assessments in schools, which will help in exact assessment of students’ performance,” said the minister. He highlighted the importance of the state’s move in implementing the NCERT syllabus in RBSE, which will bring the quality of education on a par with the nation’s most preferred board. Humanities: Out of 5,92,218 students who registered for internal assessment, 5,92,051 appeared for it including 3,00,637 boys and 2,91,414 girls.

---||Mumbai||No ‘Aadhaar’: Film runs into UIDAI roadblock||Filmmaker Suman Ghosh—who had to contend with the Central Board of Film Certification in 2017 before it freed the “cow” and four other words that were asked to be beeped out from his documentary on Nobel laureate Amartya Sen—has run into trouble again. This time it’s with his feature film ‘Aadhaar’, a Hindi comic drama. Only it’s not a tussle between Ghosh and the certifying body, but a “super censor” in the form of Unique Identification Authority of India that issues Aadhaar card. The UIDAI has proposed “28 cuts” to the film—cleared by CBFC in 2019 —stalling its release without the legal authority to do so. TOI reached out to a UIDAI official in Delhi, who confirmed the department had “watched the film and asked for edits” but refused to comment any further. “The film was meant to release commercially on February 5 this year. Just after the trailer launch in January, my producer (Jio Studios) got a call from UIDAI officials asking for a screening,” says Ghosh, who teaches economics at Miami and makes films in India. “I wasn’t in India at the time. The film was screened for officials in Delhi in February following which they suggested 28 cuts for clearance.” The film, written and directed by Ghosh and co-produced by Jio Studios and Drishyam Films, is set in 2010 and tells the story of Pharsua (a fictional villager from Jharkhand) who falls into an abyss when the village numerologist makes ominous predictions based on his Aadhaar number. “It then follows Pharsua’s journey where the significance of having an Aadhaar card gets superseded by superstitious elements that often create obstacles in rolling out national initiatives,” explains Ghosh, stressing that the film, in fact, “bolsters the case of the Aadhaar initiative”. But with UIDAI as the final arbiter of Aadhaar’s destiny, the film’s release is currently hinged on objections that range from the use of a dialogue ‘Main Aadhaar Hoon’—a play on the title of a 1989 Amitabh Bachchan film ‘Main Azaad Hoon’— “which officials claim is demeaning the Aadhaar program”; a scene where a villager, trying to understand the privacy issue, asks: ‘Sarkar kya hamare ghusal khane mein ghus jayenge?’ (Will the government come into our bathrooms?); and a sequence where an old man wants to get his cataract removed for Aadhaar’s biometrics. “They felt it was an improper representation of their biometric recognition system that has now been upgraded,” says Ghosh. “These points are redundant because the film is set in the year that enrollments for Aadhaar cards began. A certification board exists for a sensible call on the creative process. How can government officials who have no understanding of metaphor, allegory or satire in a film, issue diktats on its content,” stresses Ghosh, who is currently in Mumbai and wrote to Saurabh Garg, CEO of UIDAI last week describing the intent of his film. “I teach development economics and understand the usefulness of a card like Aadhaar. As an economist, I have been a strong advocate of the initiative,” said Ghosh in his letter, adding that he had developed the film’s concept to bring awareness among masses about the potential benefit of a digital identity. When CBFC had pro,posed cuts to Ghosh’s documentary ‘The Argumentative Indian’, he could contest it and seek official redressal. “The board’s regional review committee in Mumbai watched it afresh and after an amicable discussion cleared it with one cut,” recounts Ghosh. “In this case, I don’t know how to proceed. The UIDAI verbally conveyed the changes to my producer but has stonewalled my requests for an official list of demands or a meeting,” Ghosh said. “Although legally they can’t stop the film’s release, my producer is treading on eggshells. Why should we have to go through this?” That, in sum, is what filmmakers across the country, too, have been trying to forewarn since the I&B ministry proposed the Indian Cinematograph (Amendment) Bill 2021 in June, which, if passed, would give the central government “revisionary powers” to “re-examine” films already cleared by CBFC. More than 1,500 actors and filmmakers, including Kamal Haasan, Vishal Bhardwaj, Anurag Kashyap, Hansal Mehta, Shabana Azmi, Farhan Akhtar and Mira Nair, wrote an open letter to the ministry earlier this month expressing concern that the move would render them “vulnerable to threats, vandalism and intimidation of mob censors.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-aadhaar-film-runs-into-uidai-roadblock/articleshow/84720261.cms||Mohua Das

However, they also get onto Deluxe and low-floor buses, which don’t offer free travel, and ask for free tickets, much to the discomfiture of bus conductors.The free travel facility was the first poll promise implemented by chief minister M K Stalin. At Mattuthavani bus stand, long queues can be witnessed for city buses, most of them being women.“Earlier, I used to take mini buses or share auto, but now I save more than Rs 50 a day, which helps me meet the cost of one month’s milk,” said A Regina, a salesperson at a shop. K Pankagam of Kamarajar Salai, said that the women in her colony were organising group trips for shopping and marketing as it gave them an opportunity to travel together and buy things and they did not have to worry about money to travel.As many as 404 buses among the total 724 buses plying in Madurai district are offering free rides for women, persons with disabilities and transgenders. Most of the city buses have the stickers saying the travel is free for ladies prominently displayed on them.“But people board the buses that don’t have the free service, and as for free tickets, causing a lot of stress,” said a conductor. Ticket fares range from Rs 5 to Rs 33 in the Deluxe buses, which is not free. Meanwhile, some women have been demanding free travel in the low-floor buses that ply in the city.The various tickets for the free travel are also giving them stress, said the conductors.

---||Hyderabad||In a first, TRS MP Maloth Kavitha convicted for bribing voters||HYDERABAD: In a rare instance, a sitting Member of Parliament (MP) has been convicted for bribing voters during the 2019 general election. TRS Lok Sabha MP Maloth Kavitha and her associate were on Saturday convicted by the special sessions court for MP & MLA cases at Nampally. The judge sentenced the two to undergo six-month imprisonment. The judge, however, granted them bail to file an appeal before a higher court. Kavitha represents Mahabubabad constituency in the Lok Sabha. This is the third case in recent times the special sessions court for MP & MLA cases handed out jail terms to public representatives. However, it is the first time a sitting Lok Sabha MP has been convicted and that too for bribing voters in the run up to the elections. During the general elections in 2019, revenue officials, who were part of an election flying squad, had nabbed the MP’s aide Shaukat Ali while he was distributing cash to people (500 per head), seeking their votes in favour for Kavitha in the Burgampahad police station limits. “The flying squad caught Ali red handed. During the trial, Ali admitted he had distributed money at her behest,’’ additional public prosecutor G Narayana said. In the case, Ali was named as first accused and Kavitha as second accused. Judge Ch VRR Varaprasad, who convicted the two under Section 171-E (punishment for bribery) of the IPC, directed both the convicts to undergo six-month simple imprisonment and slapped a fine of Rs 10,000 each. The two were present in the court when the verdict was pronounced by the judge. Police produced officials of the flying squad and their report as evidence during the trial. When the accused Ali was put on trial, he admitted that he had distributed the money given by Kavitha to influence voters. The special sessions court, which came into existence in March 2018 after the Supreme Court directed expeditious trial of criminal cases against MPs and MLAs, had in the recent past convicted BJP MLA Raja Singh and TRS MLA Danam Nagender and awarded them jail terms too. Raja Singh was booked for assaulting a police officer at the Bolarum police station, while Danam Nagender was convicted for egging on his aide to assault a government official at the Banjara Hills police station. Congress urges Election Commission to take action on poll violation plaintsCongress has welcomed the six-month imprisonment awarded to TRS MP Maloth Kavitha for distributing money to voters. AICC leaders Manickam Tagore and Dasoju Sravan have demanded that action be taken against those big-fish in the political parties sponsoring the election of contesting candidates. AICC in charge of Telangana Manickam Tagore in a tweet thanked the judge, poll and police officers for making it a first case. Stating that money distribution to buy votes affects the political eco system, he said: “TRS is a symbol of corruption, which has been exposed by the court verdict.” AICC spokesperson Dasoju Sravan said Congress lodged several complaints with the Chief Electoral Officer, Telangana during the 2018 assembly and the 2019 Parliament elections along with evidence.

The positivity rate of Nashik district was 0.54% on Friday, down from 2.07% on Wednesday. The positivity rate of the district was above 40 % during the peak of the second Covid wave in April when the district had more than 48,000 active cases. On Friday, 49 people tested positive in Nashik district, including 20 in Nashik city, 26 from the rural areas, one from Malegaon town and two others from outside the district. On Wednesday, 165 fresh cases were reported, including 108 from Nashik rural areas and 55 in Nashik city. The tests conducted on Friday were higher by about 1,200 when compared to the number of tests on Wednesday. “The number of cases has reduced despite the rise in testing. Besides the drop in the positivity rate shows the Covid spread is under control,” said Dr Ashok Thorat, the civil surgeon of Nashik. Meanwhile, the number of active cases in the rural areas has dropped from 706 to 664, while in the city, the cases have reduced from 672 to 640. “Though all these signs appear to be good, little carelessness on the part of the citizens by not adhering to Covid norms could be a disaster for the community,” said Thorat appealing to the people to stick to Covid protocol and get vaccinated at the earliest. He also said the utilization of oxygen beds was well below 2 % of the capacity. District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal on Friday reviewed the Covid situation in the district, where he said he was looking for more relaxations in Covid norms for Nashik district. The relaxations could be seen in the form of allowing non-essential shops and establishments to run for one more hour instead of closing at 4 pm during weekdays and allowing them to function on one of the weekdays as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-district-daily-positivity-rate-drops/articleshow/84715277.cms||Abhilash Botekar

While the Election Commission (EC) is yet to announce the poll schedule, campaigning for BJP candidate and former health minister Eatala Rajender is in full swing. The TRS too is not leaving anything to chance with ministers hitting the campaign trail in the constituency and extending welfare sops to beneficiaries in Huzurabad. However, its candidate for the contest remains a mystery. The ‘element of surprise’ in the last-minute announcements of TRS contesting candidates by KCR has worked successfully for the ruling party in two crucial polls previously. This, as opposition parties barely had any time to prepare a candidate-specific plan of attack. The element of surprise worked in favour of the ruling party when it wrested the Hyderabad-Ranga Reddy-Mahbubnagar Graduate MLC seat from BJP by fielding S Vani Devi, daughter of former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao. The strategy is said to have caught the opposition parites off-guard. Similarly, everyone was kept guessing over TRS’ candidate for the Nagarjunasagar assembly bypoll with KCR declaring Nomula Bhagat — son of Nomula Narsimhaiah whose death necessitated the by-poll — as the party’s contestant a day before the last date for filing of nominations. The “surprise element” talk has gained momentum for Huzurabad in the political circles as P Kaushik Reddy who was considered as most likely candidate from the TRS for the bypoll, neither got any assurance nor indication about it from KCR who welcomed him into the ruling party on Wednesday. Meanwhile, CM KCR is showering sops on Huzurabad assembly constituency. After announcing that the Telangana Dalitha Bandhu scheme for development of SCs would be launched from Huzurabad constituency, KCR on Friday appointed Banda Srinivas as chairman of Telangana State Scheduled Castes Development Corporation Limited. Banda Srinivas, a resident of Huzurabad, belongs to the SC (Madiga) community. There are over 45,000 voters from the SC community of whom over 35,000 are Madigas. On Friday, ministers Gangula Kamalakar and V Srinivas Goud among others distributed cheques to beneficiaries in Huzurabad segment towards Kalyana Lakshmi and other welfare schemes. Distribution of welfare benefits has picked up momentum in the poll-bound Huzurabad . Previously, the ruling party had announced S Vani Devi and Nomula Bhagat as its candidates for the Graduate MLC poll and Nagarjunasagar bypoll at the last minute.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Covid gloom spells sunny days for specialty chemicals||Amid the Covid pandemic, many industries took a major hit, and some units even closed down. But it wasn’t all gloom and doom for the corporate sector in Gujarat. While some sectors struggled to stay afloat, the specialty chemicals industry boomed over the last one and a half years despite all uncertainties. The companies manufacturing specialty chemicals didn’t just earn healthy profits, but they also began expansion plans. "The pandemic posed initial challenges. But we increased business and production efficiency after the lockdown was lifted last year. The demand for specialty chemicals was strong, so we kept up steady production and ensured regular supplies," said Ravi Kapoor, managing director, Heubach Colours Pvt Ltd that manufactures specialty pigments. Talking about the boom in the specialty chemical sector, Kapoor said one of the major reasons is the high demand for their products in the chemical, pharmaceutical and health industry. "The pharmaceutical and health sector did well amid the pandemic, and the demand for specialty chemicals and intermediates used by this sector went up. Also, there was a lot of pent-up demand that arrived after the lockdown was eased," Kapoor added.  Many companies also stocked up on specialty chemicals, and the closing of many factories in China increased demand for the products in domestic and global markets. "The Covid pandemic made industries in India and abroad realize that they cannot rely on China too much for specialty chemicals supply. Europe is an alternative, but it’s very expensive. So, India became a natural choice for those looking to buy specialty chemicals at reasonable rates," said Sameer Hiremath, managing director of Hikal Ltd, which has a manufacturing plant in Bharuch. Hikal Ltd supplies specialty biocides, additives for leather, paint coatings, paper water treatment, building materials and text industries. "Indian specialty chemical makers started getting orders globally and even domestic pharma firms chose the local companies over their Chinese counterparts," said Hiramath. He added, "Our chemical industry has a good track record and hence the special chemicals sector has picked up very well." Covid was a turning point for an industry that was already doing well, Hiramath added. According to a November 2020 FICCI report titled ‘Indian Specialty Chemical Industry – Biggest Beneficiary of Global Paradigm Shift’, Gujarat and Maharashtra have emerged as the most preferred manufacturing destinations for leading chemical manufacturers. Fifteen out of the 25 specialty chemical companies in India have their manufacturing units in Gujarat and Maharashtra. ‘These states are a favourite for the industry due to excellent international connectivity by ports, abundant availability of skilled manpower, business-friendly policies and adequate infrastructure facilities,’ the report says. Sumit Kothari, executive director of Alkyl Amines Chemicals Ltd, a listed company that has a manufacturing unit in Dahej, said, "Amid Covid pandemic, the pharmaceutical, oil and gas and agrochemical industry did relatively well as compared to the other industries. So, the firms including the specialty chemical sector that supplied products to these industries also performed well in the last one and half years." Kapoor pointed out that China’s Blue Skies policy has also given a boost to the specialty chemical makers in India. Under the Blue Skies policy, China has introduced a new environmental program to curb pollution in their country and it has resulted in the closure of many chemical plants. Production capacity in many plants has also been reduced. "The Indian specialty chemicals makers have benefited from it and become more competitive as we are replacing China in this sector. Our manufacturing capacities are now of global standards," Kapoor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-gloom-spells-sunny-days-for-specialty-chemicals/articleshow/84718839.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Congress stands by demand of teachers, says Kamal Nath||BHOPAL: PCC chief Kamal Nath on Saturday said that the Congress party “totally supports” the demands of candidates who were selected as teachers but were not given appointment by the state government.  Selected candidates on Saturday reached the BJP state headquarters and demanded that they be issued their appointment letters. Incidentally, the entire process of selection was completed during the erstwhile Congress regime. But the Nath-led government was toppled on March 20, 2020 and the appointment letters could not be issued. “It is unfortunate that even after the completion of all phases for selection of teachers, the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government has not issued an order for their appointments. While endlessly waiting for their appointments, these selected candidates today are facing a lot of hardships in life along with their families,” the former chief minister tweeted. “On the auspicious day of Guru Purnima, they are sacrificing their hair and holding demonstrations demanding their appointments. This is an embarrassment for all of us. The Congress party is with these selected candidates and fully supports their demand,” Nath said. The candidates demonstrating near the BJP headquarters said a verification was done by the government. But even after that the state government has kept postponing the date of their appointments. Nath said, “I demand from the government that appointments be issued to them as soon as possible”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/congress-stands-by-demand-of-teachers/articleshow/84718779.cms||---

The state will also provide Shiv Bhojan thali (subsidised meals) free of cost to all the people who have been displaced till orders for the same are cancelled. “The food can be cooked at some other place — if any centre is affected — and distributed with the help of government authorities,” Bhujbal added. Bhujbal told reporters in Nashik on Saturday that each flood-affected family would be given 10 kg rice, 10 kg wheat, 5 kg pulses and 5 litre kerosene with immediate effect in Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts. “The families have lost everything to the flood. After having a word with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, the department has decided to help people during their hard time. The ration would be provided immediately,” said Bhujbal. Bhujbal added that in the Konkan region, people would be given an additional 10kg rice if they do not want wheat. The supplies would be provided through the regular ration shops — the fair price shops. In case of tur dal, the local district collectors have been instructed to procure the same from the market from the funds under disaster management. An estimated 85,000 people have been displaced and hence foodgrain requirement is pegged at about 500 tonne. The grains would be lifted from the Food Corporation of India godowns in respective districts. The team of the gramsevak, Krishi sahayak and the talathi together for every village will identity the families affected, register their information and provide the help in the form of food grains. “The work of identification of such beneficiaries has just started and it would take two days to get the numbers,” said district supply officer of Kolhapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/state-to-give-free-ration-to-people-in-flood-hit-areas-of-6-districts/articleshow/84715296.cms||Abhilash Botekar

He was sent to Palayamkottai central prison in Tirunelveli under judicial custody for 15 days. Addressing a protest meeting at Arumanai on Sunday, George spoke ill of PM Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, DMK ministers and “mother India”. With the video going viral in social media, BJP and Hindu outfits lodged complaints with various police stations demanding his arrest and detention under the National Security Act. Kanyakumari superintendent of police V Badri Narayanan told TOI that they got a tip that he was escaping by a car and shared the vehicle details and possible location with the Madurai district police. “He was nabbed in a targeted vehicle check at Othakadai in Madurai district around 4am and handed over to the special team from Kanyakumari at Kalligudi,” he added. Earlier on Tuesday, he was booked under Sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race, etc.), 295A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) and other sections of the Indian Penal Code. He was also booked under the Epidemic Diseases Act for conducting the meeting in violation of Covid-19 norms. The BJP had announced a protest on July 28 demanding his arrest. On Friday, the priest had released a video claiming that his words were twisted, and tendering an apology. However, three special police teams were formed to nab him. The priest was brought to Kanyakumari for questioning and produced before the Kuzhithurai court which remanded him in the evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hate-speech-case-priest-nabbed-during-escape-bid/articleshow/84716925.cms||---
---||Nagpur||In Covid times, this unit employs over 300 rural women||Nagpur: Pratibha Vaidya, a homemaker from Karanja Ghadga village on the outskirts of Nagpur district, was finding it hard to run her household after the pandemic struck last year followed by a series of lockdowns and restrictions. Academically just a Std XII pass out, it was tough for her to get a job. Snehal Wankhede, who hails from Kondhali village, too, was on the look out for a job after graduating in commerce. Hailing from an orthodox family, shifting to Nagpur or any other place for work was a Herculean task. A textile mill near Kondhali, started about three months ago, has changed the lives of over 300 such women, who were finding it difficult to make ends meet after their better halves either lost employment or their business suffered due to the lockdown. Christened ‘Nirmal Textile’, the unit has so far employed over 650 persons, a majority of them from nearby towns and villages. Barring a few, the rest have cleared grade 10 or 12 and had no work experience. “I’m happy to have got the job. The work environment is very good. We also get paid on time. This is my first job. Before getting employment, we were trained in machine stitching for 21 days. Many girls and women from the village are my colleagues. This gives me a sense of security,” said Safia Sheikh, who is from Kondhali village. Set up by the city-based Nirmal Group, the unit, which is yet to be formally inaugurated, also provides a lot of indirect employment to the youth near its site. The jobs include transportation, security and labour work among others. Along with spinning, the unit has also forayed into making readymade garments for popular brands, especially shirts, T-shirts and sweatshirts. “We provide 21 days of training in various aspects related to the textile industry at our own expense. We preferred needy women from nearby villages who are in dire straits. After getting trained, they’re performing beyond our expectations. We pay them as per the government rates of Rs 308/day. We’ve also provided a bus for them to travel to the unit from their villages,” said owner Pramod Manmode. A majority of women are employed in the readymade garment unit where they stitch collars, shirt buttons, brand logos and other material. While the mill operates 24x7 in three shifts, the readymade unit works in two day shifts due to the women. However, many men too have been roped in for this work, which is traditionally a woman’s bastion. “I was earlier working in Nagpur in a textile unit. With the opening of this plant, I switched over as it’s close to my home at Pusagondi. I’m getting a better salary than what my previous employer was paying me,” said Dayal Pawar, who stitches shirts. From the first month itself, the unit started getting orders from leading brands and its hands are currently full of work. “We have orders from a well-known brand for shirts and T-shirts till October. We can’t reveal names as you will be surprised that these brands are made here in our mill. Getting orders from these brands is not easy because they have stringent quality checks, not only for the material and finished product, but also for workers making them,” added Manmode. Unit plans to expand, to open garment store The company has big expansion plans and would soon be opening its own readymade garment selling store on the Amravati highway. “We‘ve purchased ‘Kings N Berry’, a popular brand in the western countries and would be selling our garments in its name from the outlet. Our products would be at par with all the leading brands as both would be made by us from the same cloth. We will be selling our garments at one-third the price of branded ones. Our products are already being exported to Dubai and other countries. We aim to make one crore pieces that will include children’s apparels and their inner wear too,” said the owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-covid-times-this-unit-employs-over-300-rural-women/articleshow/84715303.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Hyderabad||New parties out to make forays into Telangana political scene||HYDERABAD: On July 8, Telangana saw the birth of a new party, YSR Telangana Party. Its chief YS Sharmila vowed to usher in ‘Rajanna rajyam’ in the state. Now, speculation is rife over another political party being floated by former IPS officer RS Praveen Kumar who is aiming at ‘now or never’ power. Even though the assembly elections are due in 2023, it appears the season of political parties’ registration has already begun. In June and July this year, four new parties had applied for registration with the Telangana State  Commission (TSEC). After getting approval from the TSEC, the parties are likely to go for registration with the Election Commission of India (ECI). Praja Ekta Party, Jana Chaitanya Party, Telangana Jana Jagruthi Party and Bharat Labour Praja Party were among those which had applied for registration. “Generally, before the elections, new parties register their names with an intention to contest the election. We cancel the common symbol of parties (if given) if they fail to contest 10 per cent of the seats and fail to fulfil other conditions,” a senior official of TSEC said. Interestingly, there are 51 registered political parties, which do not get common symbol during the elections conducted by the TSEC. Of them, 12 parties have ‘Telangana’ in their party name. Some parties are similar to popular parties like Telugu Congress Party, Telangana Janam Party, Telangana Lok Satta Party, Telangana Jana Jagruthi Samithi and Telangana Communist Party. “Though they create confusion among the people, technically we cannot refuse to register them unless there is a specific objection from other parties either on the name or symbol,” a TSEC official said. Twelve parties are national parties and registered with the ECI with a common symbol such as Congress, BJP, TRS, TDP, AIMIM, YSRCP and even other states’ parties like Aam Admi Party, All India Forward Bloc and Janata Dal (United). The TSEC official said they have cancelled reserved symbol facility in the past few months to parties such as Jana Sena Party (tumbler symbol), Hindustan Janata Party (coconut), Marxist Communist Party United (gas cylinder) and Indian Praja Party (whistle) as they had failed to contest even in 10% of total seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/new-parties-out-to-make-forays-into-t-political-scene/articleshow/84718820.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Amaravati||Amaravati raised Rs 2,000 crore in bonds, highest in India||HYDERABAD: Amaravati, the present legislative and once greenfield capital of Andhra Pradesh, holds the record for raising Rs 2,000 crore through municipal bonds — the highest in the country. Hyderabad follows Amaravati with the issue of Rs 495 crore worth municipal bonds. Visakhapatnam, the port city which AP CM Jagan Mohan Reddy has turned into an executive capital and wanted to shift from Amaravati, could pool Rs 80 crore worth funds from the bonds. The Union government revealed this to a member’s query in the Lok Sabha. The government said Rs 3,840 crore had been raised through municipal bonds by 10 cities. Other cities which raised the bonds include Ahmedabad, Surat, Pune and Lucknow at Rs 200 crore each, Bhopal Rs 175 crore and Ghaziabad Rs 150 crore. The then TDP government proposed Amaravati as the ‘only capital’ to be developed at a cost of Rs 1 lakh crore over 20 years under public-private partnership mode. With funds drying up, then government issued ‘Amaravati bonds’ in August 2018. The Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA), which has since been scrapped, managed to get investors like Franklin Templeton Asset Management (India) Private Ltd and Aditya Birla Sun Life Assessment Management Company Ltd for the bond scheme. The CRDA is believed to have spent Rs 900 crore on infrastructure in Amaravati from the bonds raised. C Kutumba Rao, former AP Planning Board vice-chairman and who worked closely with the CRDA for raising the bonds, said: “We approached the right players and succeeded in raising the bonds. Amaravati even got Rs 36 crore as an incentive from the Centre then.” These bonds had a 10-year tenure with a five-year moratorium on the principal amount. After it elicited a good response in the market, the CRDA had even planned to go for ‘masala’ and ‘green’ bonds on the global platforms, but the plan did not materialise. As part of an urban infrastructure development initiative, the Centre encourages the urban local bodies to raise municipal bonds, while cities get between Rs 13 crore and Rs 26 crore as an incentive for pooling funds under the municipal bonds. However, experts said funds raised through these bonds are often diverted though they are to be spent only on infrastructure development. “Despite clear guidelines, some governments quietly divert the funds for other purposes, including payment of salaries for their government employees. The real purpose of raising the bonds will be served only when the needs of a city are taken care of,” A Nakula Reddy, director of Andhra Mahila Sabha College and former economics professor, Osmania University, said. He recalled that Amaravati bonds offered the highest premium (interest) rate for the buyers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/amaravati-raised-rs-2k-cr-in-bonds-highest-in-india/articleshow/84718845.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Nagpur||Don’t politicize a natural disaster: Patole tells Oppn||Nagpur: State Congress chief Nana Patole slammed the Opposition for ‘politicizing’ the flood relief operations in western Maharashtra, saying this is the time for comforting the public. Many politicians from the Opposition had questioned the government about the delay in rescuing and providing relief to people in flood-hit villages. Patol, who arrived in the city on Saturday, said, “This is not the right time to do politics. In 2019, too, we had seen such a situation where rains affected areas right from Mumbai to Kolhapur. So please understand that it’s a natural disaster and the amount of rain which fell in such a short span has caused the mayhem. I was on a visit to affected villages and the government is providing all help to those in need.” Whether he felt that Central aid was inadequate, Patole said, “I don’t want to comment on the Central government because now it belongs to just a handful of people.” With some politicial critics questioning state chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s delayed visit to the area, which took place on Saturday, Patole said weather conditions were not conducive. “There was no way a helicopter could go in such adverse weather conditions. I’m well aware of the ground situation as I myself visited Pathan and Wai talukas (Satara district) by road and know that in the first few days, the situation was really bad. Please understand that when a cloudburst of such a scale happens, there is frankly nothing that the administration can do immediately,” said Patole. The leader then stepped in to defend his party colleague and energy minister Nitin Raut over the prolonged blackout in the flood affected area. “I have been trying to explain to you all repeatedly that the natural disaster has happened at such a scale that neither the energy minister nor the prime minister can do anything. But as of now, situation has improved greatly and yesterday, I was in Jambli village (Wai taluka) and power had been restored after three days. The administration is working day and night to improve the situation. So don’t benchmark things on which minister went there or didn’t,” said Patole. The former assembly speaker went on to caution about disturbing the delicate balance humans have with the environment. “Purposefully destroying nature, through deforestation and mining, is one of the major reasons for such natural disasters. The government must now push for a policy regarding this issue,” said Patole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dont-politicize-a-natural-disaster-patole-tells-oppn/articleshow/84713600.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh to seek central aid to lay 10,000-km road||LUCKNOW: After a landslide victory in recently concluded panchayat elections, BJP has rolled out the blueprint to expedite construction of roads in the rural heartland, signalling the party’s attempt to expand its rural footprint ahead of the assembly elections next year. Highly placed sources in the rural development department said, the UP Rural Road Development Authority will soon move the Centre with a proposal to get 10,000km roads constructed in rural areas. The project is proposed to be implemented under the Centre’s flagship PM Gramin Sadak Yojana (PMGSY). “We are already in the process of constructing over 6500km of roads. We plan to send a fresh proposal to the Centre by August for construction and revamp of another 10,000km roads in rural areas,” said chief executive officer of UPRRDA, Bhanu Chandra Goswami, while speaking to TOI on Friday. Sources said, the proposal will be sent to the Union rural development ministry under PMGSY phase-III for financial year 2021-22. The Centre sanctioned Rs 4172.73 crore for laying 898 roads straddling 6287.37km cutting through five bridges of 134.4mts on January 11. As on July 20, UPRRDA issued work clearance for 878 roads of 6103.50km and five bridges of 134.40mts. Remaining work clearance is under process and shall be cleared soon, officials said. Sources added the tenders for construction of nine roads of 110.18km has been floated for construction/upgradation of roads using technology of full depth reclamation (FDR) using cement and additives. This is seen as a pointer to BJP’s stress on road connectivity in rural areas, which happen to be crucial for determining electoral fortunes of any political party. The party has also been stepping up its rural outreach through party organisation as well the state government. While the party has been trying to consolidate its rural footprint through various programmes, the state government has been charting out various schemes to enhance rural infrastructure. Recently, the state cabinet approved the proposal for establishing a village secretariat in each gram panchayat and appointing panchayat assistant/accountant-cum-data entry operator. The expenditure would be borne by the Finance Commission. The cabinet has also given its nod to make changes in the mandate on gram panchayat office/rural secretariat in gram panchayats with the approval of the chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-to-seek-central-aid-to-lay-10000-km-road/articleshow/84718811.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Hyderabad||App, website for Dalitha Bandhu implementation||HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has given the Centre for Good Governance the task of coming up with an app for the implementation of Telangana Dalitha Bandhu scheme. Right from loading of applications, to availing the scheme, to the details of beneficiaries and other status reports on the implementation of the scheme, everything is proposed to be done through an app and an exclusive website. The CM has already made it clear that the state government will spend almost Rs 1 lakh crore to ensure that all eligible Dalit families are covered under the scheme. Every family from SC community, identified by the government, would be given Rs 10 lakh for self-employment. This money would be directly deposited into their bank accounts. The government proposes to identify all such Dalit families which have not received any welfare sop or financial assistance from the government in the past in the first phase of the scheme to be implemented as a pilot project in Huzurabad Assembly constituency. Officials said the state government has also initially released Rs 250 crore to start the implementation of the scheme and that funds would not be a problem. The chief minister will hold an awareness meeting and face to face talk with select beneficiaries, in all over 400 of them, from Huzurabad Assembly constituency on July 26. The CM along with senior officials and experts in social welfare will discuss the road map for implementation of Telangana Dalitha Bandhu scheme. The identified beneficiaries would be brought from Huzurabad constituency in special buses to Pragathi Bhavan on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/app-website-for-dalitha-bandhu-implementation/articleshow/84718840.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Lucknow||Two bronze statues of Hindu kings to be ready by October||Lucknow: The Yogi government has initiated the process to get the two bronze idols ready that the BJP had promised it would install in UP to glorify the Hindu kings, not given their due in the history that is more of Mughal-centric, thus taking the 'politics over statues' ahead. The state government has given a contract to UP Lalit Kala Akademi for the two statues. While one would be a 51-foot tall idol of Nishad king Guh with Lord Ram, the two embracing each other and the second, a 40-foot tall statue of warrior king Suheldev mounted on a horse. The former would be installed at Shringverpur, Prayagraj which was the territory of the Nishad king and has remnants of his fort present till date, while the latter would find place at Bahraich. In all possibilities, the statues would be ready by October and add to the pitch and tempo of politics in the state which would by then have the state assembly election 2022 drawn even closer. The statues are of two such Hindu kings whose legacy has more than one political claimants in the state and a bigger section of the OBC population, Nishads and Rajbhars, in UP consider themselves to be their descendants. Here, it is also significant that for the first time the state government has given the contract to State Lalit Kala Akademi to make the statues, which shows the government wants the best of the artists to design it. The bids were floated on July 5 and August 2 is the deadline. On August 3, there would be a presentation made by the bidders on the design and structure of the idols. The statues would be ready in three months after the tender was awarded. “We can say anything on the statues beyond their height and the material that it would be made of only after the presentation is made,” said a senior official in the Akademi. Installing the two statues was the long drawn plan of the BJP. Going back in the past, in February this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the statue of King Suheldev of Shravasti in Bahraich on his birth anniversary, virtually. The 11th century warrior king is revered by the Rajbhar and Pasi community, who have a dominant presence in Purvanchal, after Yadavs. Installing his statue, however, is not the only thing that the BJP would do to woo the community he hailed from. The efforts to claim his legacy started in 2016 itself when his statue was unveiled by the BJP national president Amit Shah in Bahraich along the Indo-Nepal border in February. The Modi government has already released a postal stamp after the king and named a superfast train after him. One of the major claimants of Suheldev’s legacy is Om Prakash Rajbhar of Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) who has his politics centred around Rajbhars. He contested the 2017 UP assembly elections in alliance with the BJP and won four of the eight seats after which he became a minister in the UP government. Not with the BJP anymore, he now leads a front of smaller parties, Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha. Similarly, the efforts of the BJP to reach out to Nishads by eulogizing Nishadraj is also not new. In May 2019, while campaigning for Lok Sabha election in UP, union home minister Amit Shah, who was the BJP national president at the time, had announced that Yogi government would install the statue of Nishadraj at the place where the `Kewat’ had washed the feet of Lord Ram at Shringverpur, Prayagraj, as per the folklore. The delay was long enough to prompt the Nishad Party, a political outfit dedicated only to Nishads who, again, have a significant presence in Eastern UP, lay the foundation stone for a 180-feet tall statue of Nishadraj at Shringverpur in April this year. “The fort of Nishadraj in Shringverpur is in shambles. It was Nishadraj who gave his ‘sena’ to Ram for the battle of Lanka. Nishads have been used as a ‘sena’ by political parties only to be dumped later.Time has come when we take this ‘sena’ back from political parties and install the statue on our own,” had said the president of Nishad party, Sanjay Nishad. Installing statues of the icons is one of the ways of the political parties to partake in their legacy. During elections, it gets on the top priorities of the political parties. Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) would install idols of Phoolan Devi in UP and Bihar. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, on Wednesday, unveiled the statue of former SP leader and a significant Nishad leader Manohar Lal in Unnao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/two-bronze-statues-of-hindu-kings-to-be-ready-by-october/articleshow/84718849.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Amritsar||Punjab: Schools’ reopening under lens as minors yet to be vaccinated||AMRITSAR: The Punjab government’s decision to reopen schools from July 26 for students from Class X to XII has come under criticisim from schools and parents in Amritsar district. They said it was a bit early for the government to open schools and it should at least wait for the anticipated third wave of Covid-19. So far, only 20-25% parents have given their consent to send children to schools. While it is mandatory for school staff to be fully vaccinated before coming to school, there is no such condition for students. School managements can ensure that their staff are fully vaccinated, but the same is not possible in the case of students since all students from Class 10 to 12 are not above 18 years of age. The vaccination of minors is yet to start in India. Rajiv Kumar Sharma, principal of Spring Dale Senior School, said based on their experience of previous year, they would follow all guidelines and SOPs, and ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour among staff and students. However, a majority of the managements of schools was of the view that it was a bit early for reopening of schools. “The government should have waited for the third wave. If it is inevitable, schools’ opening could have been delayed,” said the chairperson of a private school who didn’t wish to give his name. Amritsar civil surgeon Dr Charanjit Singh said only 37% of the population above 18 years of age was had been vaccinated in the district so far. “Why are you laying emphasis on vaccination of students below 18 years of age before going to school, there are lakhs of them who are roaming around without vaccination,” said a source in the health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/schools-reopening-invites-scepticism-as-minors-are-yet-to-be-vaccinated/articleshow/84718874.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Nashik||Nashik civic body plans to bring new properties immediately under tax||NASHIK: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided to bring the new properties under tax net online immediately after the issuance of the Building Completion Certificate (BCC) to avoid delay in levying property tax on new properties. At present, owners have to apply to the civic body for levying property tax after the town planning department issues the BCC, which takes some time. There are instances that property tax has been levied on new properties after a decade due to various reasons like delay on part of the residents in applying for the levy of the property tax. This also affects the revenue generation of the civic body. The lack of workforce is also a major issue that delays several works related to the property tax department. . So Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav decided to speed up the process of levying property tax to new properties immediately after issuance of the BCCs to the new properties concerned. Jadhav has directed the Information Technology (IT) department to link online town planning and property tax departments with each other and create a system that the owners of the new properties will immediately get property tax online once the town planning department issues BBC to them. Pradeep Chaudhari, the deputy commissioner (tax) of NMC, said they are in the process of creating software, that will connect the town planning and property tax departments. “Owners will not have to apply for property tax as they will get the property tax bills online immediately after the issuance of the BCCs to them,” said Chaudhari. Currently, NMC has 4.5 lakh properties on its record and it is also in the process of adding more new properties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civic-body-plans-to-bring-new-properties-immediately-under-tax/articleshow/84715326.cms||Tushar Pawar

Residents complained that they are facing difficulties due to the swarming mosquitoes, which gave them sleepless nights.Pandian Nagar near Yagappa Nagar is a newly-annexed area in the corporation. It is a developing area with many houses coming up every year. Just like most of the newly-added areas, Pandian Nagar and its neighboring localities do not have an underground drainage system. While most of the residents have their own sewage tank to take care of the sewage water generated, a few people are letting it flow to empty plots.P Swanalatha, a resident, said the civic body authorities should check and curb this menace. It would result in altercations if they questioned the people involved in the act. “We have spoken to a couple of people who flow sewage water to the open space. But they are not in the mood to lia sten to us. It would only result in a dispute if we insist them to safely dispose of waste water,” she said.S Malliga, another resident, said that they are living under the constant threat of being infected with some mosquito-borne disease. They could not prevent mosquitoes from swarming their houses despite various measures taken. “We could not sleep peacefully. We could not sit out in the evening due to the mosquito menace. We would not allow children to play outside due to the problem,” she said.Officials from the Madurai Corporation said that owners of the plots have the responsibility to keep their space clean. They can take action against those who keep the place in an unhygienic condition. They will conduct a check and take appropriate action against the offenders, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sewage-let-out-by-some-houses-to-empty-plots-makes-life-hell-for-pandian-nagar-folk/articleshow/84716970.cms||V Devanathan

With the Met department predicting heavy rain in the city, it seems to be too late for the civic body to take any action now. Moreover, several of the constructions are in litigation. According to a BMC internal report, there are 15 to 20 buildings in each zone, that are deemed dilapidated. The most dilapidated buildings are in zone 2, 3, 4 and 5. There are buildings mostly of the Nawabi era or the Housing Board and Corporation constructions, which are so dilapidated. A lot has been said about restoration and protection of heritage, but all that lies ahead for the administration is to deem the structure risk to public safety and hammer it down. Currently there is a high alert for rain in Sehore district, the catchment area for Upper Lake in Bhopal. “We estimate a heavy downpour will result in lifting the lakes level to a comfortable level. Full tank level of the Upper Lake is 1666.80 feet. On Saturday, the level was 1659.80 feet,” said a BMC water supply wing official. As many as 242 buildings are declared dilapidated in the city. Structures caving in due to excessive downpour is not new. Recently, 44 shops located opposite Bharat Talkies had collapsed. Fortunately, no one was hurt in the accident.

Precisa had submitted a request for randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled phase-3 study of Covaxin in Brazil to Anvisa. “The Coordination of Clinical Research determined this Friday the precautionary suspension of clinical studies of Covaxin in Brazil,” said a notice by Anvisa on website. “The suspension was carried out as a result of a statement from the Indian company Bharat Biotech Limited International, sent to Anvisa on Friday (23/7). In the statement, Bharat informs that the company Necessidade Comercializacao de Medicamentos Ltda is no longer authorized to represent Bharat in Brazil, which in Anvisa’s assessment makes it impossible to carry out the study. Bharat is the manufacturer of the Covaxin vaccine,” Anvisa said. “The letters communicating the precautionary suspension were sent to Instituto Albert Einstein and the sponsor of the study, the company Necessidade Comercialização de Medicamentos Ltda. The application of the vaccine in Brazilian volunteers did not happen,” the Brazilian health regulator said. The Phase-3 study, which was approved by Anvisa in mid-May this year, was to be carried out on 4,500 volunteers aged 18 years and above at Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Bahia and Mato Grosso. Late on Friday evening, Bharat Biotech announced the immediate termination of its deal with Precisa Medicamentos and Envixia Pharmaceuticals LLC, pulling the plug on the $324 million deal for supply of 20 million doses of Covaxin to Brazil. However, the Hyderabad-based vaccine maker said it would continue to work with Anvisa to complete the regulatory approval process for Covaxin. The Covaxin deal had come under the scanner and was suspended by Brazil after allegations of irregularities surfaced against Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s government. While terminating the deal, Bharat Biotech said in a statement: “We have very recently been informed that certain letters, purported to have been executed by executives of the company, are being circulated online. We would like to emphatically state that these documents have not been issued by the company or its executives and therefore vehemently deny the same.” “The company also stresses that all its actions, including its global dealings, are done in accordance with local laws and that the company employs and follows the highest standards of ethics, integrity and compliance at all times,” Bharat Biotech had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/brazil-suspends-phase-3-trials-of-covaxin/articleshow/84718895.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

However, on July 15 when Sharma and his colleagues were going to Jamnagar, Jadeja and three other unidentified men stopped them near Medhpar Padana Patiya. They abducted Sharma and took him to a hotel where Jadeja abused Sharma and threatened him with dire consequences if he was not given the contract.

---||Patna||Bihar: Woman cop killed in clash over custody death in Jehanabad||PATNA: A woman constable was killed and at least 15 other police personnel, including a trainee DSP, were injured when an irate mob attacked them in Jehanabad on Saturday to protest alleged custodial death of one Govind Manjhi (25). The incident occurred on NH-110 near Nehalpur Bazaar under the Paras Bigha police station area in the district where the police team had gone to quell a mob which had blocked the road in protest against the alleged custodial death of Manjhi. While police said the woman constable, Kanti Devi (54), was beaten to death, sources claimed she was run over by a vehicle. Kanti was a resident of Naubatpur in Patna district. Manjhi, a resident of Sarta village near Nehalpur Bazaar in Jehanabad district, had allegedly died inside Daudnagar sub-jail in Aurangabad on Friday night. The Daudnagar sub-jail had earlier been made an interim jail for keeping new inmates quarantined for 14 days. Manjhi was arrested by Jehanabad police on July 19 for his alleged involvement in liquor smuggling. The irate villagers also damaged police vehicles, including the one of Jehanabad SDPO Ashok Kumar Pandey, and blocked the highway by burning tyres. Sources said police fired at least three to four rounds in air to disperse the violent mob after the situation slipped out of hands. Jehanabad circle inspector Bhavesh Kumar Mandal told TOI over phone that the woman constable died after she was beaten up with rods and sticks by the villagers. “At least 15 more police personnel, including seven officers, were injured in the violence. The injured DSP was identified as Rajeev Ranjan, who was posted as SHO at Paras Bigha police station,” he said. Mandal also received injuries in the attack. The circle inspector said the villagers were demanding Rs 25 lakh compensation along with a government job for next of kin of Manjhi. “The protests started around 8am. When the police reached the spot, the villagers started pelting stones. They later attacked the police team with rods and sticks,” Mandal said. Jehanabad SP Dipak Ranjan and other senior officers also rushed to the spot to control the situation. “Five people have so far been arrested in connection with the violence,” the SP said, adding the police were awaiting postmortem report to ascertain the reason behind Manjhi’s death. When asked about the havildar’s killing, SP opposite to inspector’s statement, said it seems some four-wheeler ran over her. However, he could not clarify if it was a car, truck or bus or if anyone saw it happening. “It seems she could not run when stone pelting started due to her weight. In the meantime, vehicle drivers started to escape from spot to avoid damage during which she might have been run over,” he added.

In response to a question by Congress’s Amritsar MP Gurjeet Singh Aujla, Union minister of road transport and highways submitted in the Lok Sabha that delay in land acquisition, utility shifting and forest clearances are some of the key reasons for these projects not meeting the target dates of completion. Of the total, in 29 projects state public works department (PWD) is the nodal agency, while four projects are being executed by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). In as many as eight projects worth Rs 463 crore, work has been awarded but the work has not commenced. Punjab has been among the worst-hit states in the country, forcing the state government to impose strict restrictions, including lockdowns and curfews during the first and second wave of infection, hindering the development works. At present, Punjab has 71,912 km of the road network, of which 2,677 km is classified as national highways and 1,097 km as state highways. The worst-hit projects include 77-km stretch from Moga-Tallewal section of NH-71 being made at a cost of Rs 904.82 crore and 49-km-long Jalandhar-Hoshiarpur section of NH-70 with a sanctioned cost of Rs 1,069.59 crore. Both the projects are going to miss the revised deadline of August 2021 and June 2022. The other key projects running behind the schedule include four-laning of Talwandi Bhai to Ferozepur; four-laning of Bathinda to Malout; upgradation to two-lane of NH-354 section from Ferozepur-Muktsar-Malout and rectification of black spots on different roads. With third wave projected to hit by August later this year, the completion of these projects is likely to be further delayed as the state government will be forced to reinforce restrictions as soon as there is an upward movement in daily cases of infection. As per the plan formulated to tackle the third-wave, strict lockdown-like curbs will again be clamped if the positivity rate breaches the 5% limit suggested by the World Health Organisation (WHO).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/33-national-highway-projects-worth-rs-5573cr-delayed-in-punjab/articleshow/84718927.cms||Vinod Kumar

The duo were cousins and had plans to go to a residential school for underprivileged children in Uttarakhand's Rishikesh where “they would not have to pay fees”. On Friday night, they packed some clothes and shoes and sneaked out of their home at 1.30am when the family was sleeping. The children walked about 10 km to reach Yamuna expressway from where they boarded a bus to Delhi. “Around 6am they were dropped off at Jewar toll plaza as they didn’t have any money but they hitchhiked to a bus depot in Bawana. A travel agent found them inquiring about buses to Rishikesh. He asked them for their parents’ contact information and then alerted them,” in charge of Kolahar chowki in Mathura, sub inspector Arun Tevatiya, told TOI. Back home, the parents had noticed that the children were missing when they woke up at 4.30am. An FIR was lodged at Kolahar chowki under section 363 (kidnapping) and police started scanning CCTV footage of the area around the house, said Mathura SP (rural) Shireesh Chandra. “We found the children walking towards the highway in the CCTV footage,” he said. Both set of parents were already at the police station when they got a call from an unknown number that their children were in a bus depot in Bawana. A team of Delhi police was informed and they took the children into custody. The children were later handed over to their parents. “The kids told us that they were getting bored and cranky with online classes. They were also scolded at home, so they decided to study in a residential school,” said Chandra. The parents, who run two degree colleges in Vrindavan, are now being counselled on how to identify signs of stress in kids during lockdown. The father of the girl told TOI, "We are incredibly lucky that nothing untoward happened to our children. The 12 hours that they were missing were the longest of our lives."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/bored-with-online-classes-2-kids-run-away-from-up-home-hitchhike-to-delhi/articleshow/84713673.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The rough ride had pushed Ritesh* and his wife to the brink of giving up on their hope of ever becoming parents. Cut to May 2021 and a Hyderabad-based infertility centre offered them a solution: Interest-free loan for IVF procedure."We jumped at the chance since we realised it could be our last one," said the Pune-based executive. The loan, of Rs two lakh from a private financing firm was directly disbursed to the fertility centre and Ritesh now has two years to clear his EMIs. Limited to a handful until recently, infertility experts say that an increasing number of people are now availing of these loans – both for IVF and surrogacy – that range from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 15 lakh and come with repayment terms of six months to five years. Reason: Multiple financial institutions entering the market coupled with better awareness. “Had it not been for the EMI option, we would never have been able to go through with the surrogacy procedure, which costs Rs 15 lakh. I was financially drained from going through three or four IVF cycles,” said Kishore* a private employee from Bengaluru. Kishore has paid Rs 2.5 lakh upfront while the rest has been financed by a Mumbai-based firm. By easing the monetary burden, such options have also allowed couples to avail of fertility treatments at an early age, say doctors. “Previously, people used to wait till they were 40 years or more to opt for IVF or surrogacy since they weren’t financially stable until then. These facilities have given them a chance to become parents sooner,” said Dr Nayana Patel, IVF specialist and medical director of Akanksha Hospital and Research Institute Anand, Gujarat. Metros apart, couples from smaller cities and towns too are reaching out for support now. “During the pandemic last year we received an average of 60 to 70 calls a day and most of them were from tier 3 and 4 cities. This speaks about the volume of people who need assistance and guidance to understand how the entire process works but are often clueless about where to seek information,” said Aditya Damani founder of Credit Fair, a Mumbai-based fintech startup. “In the last quarter, we have disbursed close to Rs 1.5 crore for IVF and fertility treatment,” he added. Since the launch of its programme BSVwithU in December 2020, pharma major Bharat Serums and Vaccines Limited has facilitated 50 couples to avail interest-free loans and free counselling through this initiative, available across 100 centres in India. Strongly focused on women's health, the firm has also rolled out financial support to its employees in need of IVF or ART treatment (assisted reproductive technology) -- a first in India. “Since IVF is not directly covered by any insurance company in India, it becomes a hurdle for many,” said Nilesh Kulkarni, chief human resources officer, sharing how BSV has also “facilitated a dialogue between the medical fraternity, government and insurance agencies” to de-stigmatise infertility and support aspiring couples on their journey to become parents. “These opportunities, especially amid the Covid-19 crisis, have come as a boon for many. Couples who were left to choose between a fertility treatment and other expenses – either due to job loss or pay cuts – now have an option. The awareness that was missing is being addressed by centres like ours,” said Dr Samit Sekhar owner and director of Kiran Infertility Centre, Hyderabad.

They have been booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including 354 B (any man who assaults or uses criminal force to any woman or abets such act with the intention of disrobing) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt). The victim, who works at a shop in Delhi Airport, told police that she had received a call from her partner on Friday morning that her parents were forcing her to marry someone else. “She wanted me to take her away since we are in love and wish to love together,” she told TOI. The girl arrived from Delhi in a cab and parked it at some distance from her partner’s house. But her partner’s family spotted her and dragged her into the house. “They tore my clothes, misbehaved with me and snatched away Rs 25,000 in cash that I was carrying,” she alleged. The driver was also beaten up and the car damaged, said police, adding that the victim suffered severe injuries and is recovering in a hospital in Aligarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/22-yr-old-delhi-woman-thrashed-by-girlfriends-kin-in-up-lands-in-hosp-5-held/articleshow/84713710.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Gamerji, an e-sports tournament platform, is actively in talks with investors for its pre-series A round of funding by the end of 2021. "We’re in talks with a few investors for our next fundraiser. Our aim is to gain more users in India and we are looking to clock 3 million, i.e. 30 lakh users in India over the next 12 months. We also plan to expand in the Middle East and South East Asian region," said Soham Thacker, founder, Gamerji, which was founded in July 2019. Maximum users on the platform come from Mumbai, Bengaluru, Pune, Lucknow, Kanpur, Delhi and a few cities of Gujarat, Thacker says. The startup had raised $500,000 (approximately Rs 4 crore) during November 2020. It was as part of its venture capital (VC) seed round from Unicorn India Ventures, a Mumbai-based early stage VC firm and Lead Angels Network. "This round of funding helped us to expand our user base, and enhance our technology offerings," he said. Gamerji, which is a mobile app-based platform, conducts virtual tournaments for popular games. It hosts over 125 tournaments daily for games such as Call of Duty and Free Fire, among others. The platform has partnered with close to 200 private organizers and Indian gaming influencers to host customized e-sports tournaments. The gaming culture, which is still at a nascent stage in India, has picked up pace since the pandemic, and Gamerji expanded its user base phenomenally. "We clocked a 15x growth in just a year in our active user base. The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent surge in digital adoption played a big role in building conviction in the gaming industry. As more people turned to gaming, our platform started gaining traction and gamers from across the country," Thacker said. An avid gamer and computer engineering graduate from Rutgers University in the US in 2008, Thacker has worked in tech companies including Motorola and also launched a couple of other ventures, prior to starting out with Gamerji.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gaming-co-eyes-pre-series-a-funds-to-expand-global-footprint/articleshow/84718929.cms||Niyati Parikh

Work to restore power supply was ongoing at night. Flood water entered around 110 distribution transformers in several parts of Sattari, Khandepar and Dharbandora, among other areas. “These transformers got embedded in water that was waist deep. The department switched them off on Friday when water levels began to rise and began to clean them and restore power supply once water started to recede on Saturday,” chief electrical engineer Raghuvir Keni told TOI. The department has also issued instructions to its staff to assist the flood-hit families whose wiring may have gotten damaged and gadgets affected due to flood waters entering their homes. “Many of these are mud houses and may require rectification of their internal wiring if there’s any leakage. Our department will do this as a social responsibility at our cost. People should be safeguarded. They could be facing issues with their refrigerators and switching on other appliances. I have issued instructions to all executive engineers and down the line to reach out to these families, make inquiries and assist them,” Keni said. He advised people to avoid coming into contact with wires if they suspect anything and inform the nearest department office, police or fire services on the spot. Several electricity poles were also damaged and uprooted in Mollem and other areas and required restringing, superintending engineer South, Rajiv Samant. The Shigao substation was put off on during the heavy rains as water levels began to rise and power was later normalised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/power-dept-begins-restoring-supply-as-floods-recede/articleshow/84720301.cms||---

It can be risky for commuters-- whether on foot or in a vehicle -- while negotiating amid the waterlogged pothole-riddled roads in the dark. Even busy streets plunge into darkness with the street lights on the blink. Repeated complaints by municipal councillors and local residents to replace or repair the lights have fallen on deaf ears of the civic authorities. On their part, civic body officials have blamed the recent showers for the faults in the street lights. The street lights are not functioning in stretches of city’s traffic lifeline, MG Road besides, Maruti estate, Kothi Meena Bazaar, Prithvinath Fatak, Water Works Crossing, Mall Road, Madiya Katra, Bodla Crossing, different places in Sikandra, vicinity of Rambagh crossing and near Taj Mahal on Mehtab Bagh road. According to residents, in 2018, the old high-pressure sodium or halogen bulbs used to light streets were replaced with LEDs across 100 wards of the city in order to improve the lighting and also save on power consumption. But lack of proper maintenance has failed to improve the situation, they alleged. Around 5,000 LED street lights in the city have stopped working over the past 15 days. There are 42,000 street lights in Agra city. The LED street lights were installed by the Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), an energy service company of the central government. As per the terms of the contract, EESL is responsible for maintaining the LED lights for seven years. Councillor Ravi Mathur said, “The situation of street lighting is poor. Hundreds of LED lights are not working. The matter has been raised with senior officials of the civic body several times. But no action has so far been taken. Now, the matter will be taken up in the board meeting.” Mayor Naveen Jain said, “The complaints regarding non-functioning of street lights have increased following the recent rainfall. Civic body officials have been directed to get all the non-functional street lights repaired. Soon, a citywide survey will be conducted to check condition of street lights in all the 100 wards.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/5k-street-lights-not-functioning-in-agra-city-making-commuting-risky-on-dark-roads/articleshow/84713745.cms||Deepak Lavania

The woman was alone at home at the time of crime as her family members were out of station.According to police, the woman Ameena Khatun Khan was found dead by her neighbours when they noticed that she had not come out of her house for several hours on Friday. Khan’s son Saifur Rehman had gone to his in-law’s house in Bhiwandi with his wife and children to celebrate Eid, so Khan was alone at home since Thursday afternoon.When neighbours called Khan and she did not respond, they broke open the door to find her dead in the kitchen. The valuables of the house were also lying scattered on the floor. The neighbours immediately informed the police and Khan’s relatives about the incident.Police said that Khan was strangulated and also stabbed multiple times in her abdomen with a sharp-edged weapon. It is suspected that Khan was serving food for herself when the robbers quietly entered the house and attacked her from behind.“We are not ruling out any possibilities and have formed different teams that are probing on all possible theories,” said a police official. The incident sent shockwaves in the neighbourhood and a large crowd remained gathered outside Khan’s building until late Friday evening when her son and his family arrived.On checking inside the house Saifur Rehman told police that the killers had fled with gold necklaces, earrings and rings worth Rs 2.3 lakh and Rs Rs lakh cash kept in a safe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/robbers-kill-widow-in-vapi-flee-with-valuables-worth-rs-4-lakh/articleshow/84715458.cms||---

In the backdrop of last year’s landslide at Pettimudy, where the lack of proper communication network created hurdles for officials to rescue the affected people, three satellite phones have been provided to Munnar police, and they will be kept at Munnar DSP office, Munnar and Devikualam police stations. Munnar DSP K R Manoj said “Inmarsat” satellite phones can be used without a mobile network. “The phone functions through satellites and can be used to make calls to any other phone in any terrain. The charge is fixed at nearly Rs 28 per minute. We have given training to police personnel and rescue workers on how to use the satellite phones. These phones will be helpful for rescue works in Munnar and surrounding areas,” said Manoj. Hadlee Ranjith, one of the rescue workers at Pettimudy, said lack of proper communication facilities hampered the rescue operations. “Most parts of the landslide site had no mobile network coverage, thus delaying communication. Rescue workers travelled long distances to inform officials about finding dead bodies. I hope the new facility will ensure better communication,” said Ranjith. After the Pettimudy disaster, a report submitted by a team led by Binu Joseph, former Munnar special tahsildar, to Idukki district collector pointed out that lack of proper communication facility in the revenue department affected rescue operations during calamities. To avoid such issues, the government should immediately provide special frequency wireless sets to the revenue department across the state. The special frequency wireless sets will be helpful for speedy rescue operations and passing on timely information, said the report. “All disaster management works are coordinated through the revenue department and such facilities are needed in the revenue department first,” said a senior revenue department official. An inquiry report submitted by the revenue department said that the landslide at Pettimudy, under Kannan Devan Hills Plantation (KDHP) in Munnar, occurred at around 10:30pm on August 6 last year. The rescue team reached the spot only after 11am on August 7. It has been alleged that delay in the arrival of rescue teams led to a rise in the number of casualties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pettimudy-impact-govt-equips-munnar-police-with-sat-phones/articleshow/84717156.cms||Sandeep Thomas

Five years ago, the district administration had tagged 23 villages as landslide-prone after a detailed survey, but many villagers had refused to leave the region, seeking permanent rehabilitation in the vicinity. Pawar said the government will make the funds at the earliest. “In the wake of the reported landslides in various areas, we will consider their demands and allocate the funds necessary for their rehabilitation,” Pawar said on Saturday. The state government had prepared a report on these 23 villages in 2016 following the Malin landslide tragedy in 2014, but no action was taken in that regard. Pawar said the authorities were closely monitoring landslide-prone areas and have moved 90,000 people living in vulnerable areas — in Ratnagiri, Satara, Thane, Kolhapur, Sangli, Pune and Raigad districts — to safety. Raigad and Ratnagiri districts have been allocated Rs2 crore each under the state Disaster Management Act, while all the other affected districts will get Rs50 lakh each. Pawar, quoting disaster management cell estimates, said 76 people lost their lives in the has lost their lives in these districts, while 38 were injured and 59 were missing. The bridge across Vashishti river in Chiplun was completely damaged, Pawar said. The deputy chief minister said nearly 890 villages have been affected due to the torrential rains in the past two days. “The areas not accessible by road will be provided rice, pulses and kerosene via helicopters,” Pawar said, adding that the administration has been directed to provide aid without waiting for government approval. The deputy CM added that the government was in touch with the Centre and that Union defence minister Rajnath Singh had promised aid through a nodal officer. Pawar further said the government was preparing a detailed report and will approach the Centre for a relief package soon. ‘Taliye not on 2016 list’ Pawar said Taliye village in Raigad — in which at least 49 people were killed and 47 missing following a series of landslides — was not in the list of landslide-prone areas identified by the Raigad district administration. “The list included sites in nine villages. It did not include Taliye; it was not even on the list of low-risk landslide-prone villages,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/funds-for-permanent-rehabilitation-of-23-landslide-prone-villages-in-district-ajit-pawar/articleshow/84719045.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Pointing out that many trees were chopped near the cemetery of the hospital, Lourenco sought to remind chief minister Pramod Sawant of his assurance made in the legislative ssembly, of taking people into confidence before taking any decision on this issue. “Let me remind you once again that residents of Curtorim and Macasana have opposed the state government’s move to set up an IRBn camp on the land which was transferred to the Goa police by the directorate of health services,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govts-clandestine-move-to-take-over-land-worrisome/articleshow/84719052.cms||---

The council, as it’s referred to instead of the common practice of ‘board’, had almost similar results to show at the national level where the pass percentages were 99.98% (ICSE) and 99.76% (ISC). In Nagpur, there are four schools affiliated to the council of which only one offers Std XII. Kenneth Mendonca, principal of Chanda Devi Saraf School (CDS), said, “I feel in Std XII the marks allotted for the physics-chemistry-maths group are not proper. We will be reviewing these marks by sending an application to the council.” Raziya Husain, principal of MSB Educational Institute (Nagpur), said that the rankings for her school are also likely to get changed. “We have observed discrepencies in the marks allotted to some of our students. We are initiating a review process and I’m confident that our school’s ranking list will get changed,” said Husain. Though theory papers were cancelled this year due the pandemic, the council said it took stringent measures to have a transparent marks tabulation policy. Gerry Arathoon, chief executive officer and secretary of CISCE, said, “The data submitted by the schools was analysed by a team of reputed statisticians from some of the premier institutions in the country, along with senior officials of the CISCE. While devising the methodology for computing marks, the endeavour was to ensure fairness to all candidates concerned to the best possible extent. Before I announce the much-awaited results for this year, I would like to place on record my sincere appreciation and indebtedness to all the heads of schools who have worked in unison and close cooperation with the CISCE to ensure successful completion of the compilation of the results.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/all-icse-x-students-in-maharashtra-pass/articleshow/84713852.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Lucknow||Three cheers for Lucknow’s ICSE topper triplets||LUCKNOW: They look alike, were born at the same hour and have scored similar marks. The Yadav household in Preetinagar cheered thrice as their triplets — Ayushi Yadav, Akansha Yadav and Anshika Yadav — students of St Joseph College top scored in ICSE Class 10 results announced on Saturday. School topper Ayushi scored 98.4%, while Akansha and Anshika notched up 97.4% each. Also, the trio scored 100 in commercial studies and economics. In English, while Ayushi scored 94, the other two siblings scored 92 marks. Similarly, in Hindi the school topper struck 99, while the other sisters scored 97. And in computer application, Ayushi again scored 100, while the other two scored 98 marks each. Born on September 26, 2004 at 4.1 pm, 4.2 pm and 4.3 pm, their history and geography marks too followed the uncanny sequence with the elder scoring 96, while the remaining two scored 95 and 94 marks respectively. The triplets were in the same section — Class 10-E — and have another sibling, Ankita, in Class 9 of the same school. The three meritorious students have now appealed to the state government to financially support their education so that their father, Ram Tilak Yadav, who works in a private firm, can fulfil his dream of imparting higher educating to his children. “We would study together, early morning and late night, had healthy competition and did mischief together. The credit for our success goes to my mother, Nirmala, and my father, who always kept aside our academic expenses before opting for luxury,” said Ayushi. She said, they were not bookworms, but believed in studying for limited hours with full concentration. Talking to TOI, Akansha said, “We may look alike and score alike, but from our food to career choices, there is little similarity. Ayushi wants to become a chartered accountant, I see myself as a software engineer while Anshika aspires to become a civil servant.” “At times, we would unleash triple whammy on our parents with one demanding north Indian food, the other Punjabi and the third one seeking south Indian. But we are blessed to have parents who would always fulfil our wishes,” said Anshika. Choked with emotion, their mother Nirmala, said, “From friends to neighbours, everyone would taunt me for not having a son and who would to shoulder responsibilities. Today, I am proud that everyone has got an answer.” Founder manager, St Joseph School, Anil Agarwal, is elated with the performance of the triplets. He said, “The three musketeers have made history. This has never happened that top three rank holders are real sisters. I am proud of them. We will soon felicitate our bright students.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/three-cheers-for-citys-icse-topper-triplets/articleshow/84719060.cms||Mohita Tewari
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu makes two vaccine doses must for industrial employees||CHENNAI: It is now mandatory for employees as well as their family members to take both doses of Covid-19 vaccine to access workplaces or industries, the Tamil Nadu government has announced. Besides treating them as ‘high priority’ group, a new set of guidelines issued on Saturday said all workplaces and industries with more than 300 employees or 10,000sqft space should appoint a qualified health inspector, ‘at their own cost’, for monitoring and to coordinate/implement health activities on the premises. Health inspectors — who have completed courses in public health at recognised universities (not necessarily doctors) — should ensure all staff members are screened at the entrance. Besides measuring temperature, they should record details of symptoms and history of family members testing positive in the past week. Staff having symptoms must be quarantined and referred to the nearest health facility for further tests and management. Staff, who report any family members testing positive in the past seven days, should also be quarantined and referred to a healthcare facility, it said. The new set of 12 guidelines was issued by director of public health Dr T S Selvavinayagam to ensure that strict preventive measures are enforced in all places of public gatherings, especially at workplaces and industries. It was necessitated because the state is in the process of easing restrictions and lockdown, and it might cause a surge in Covid cases again, the DPH said, directing all district health authorities to enforce the guidelines at all workplaces scrupulously. The decision to issue fresh guidelines under the Tamil Nadu Public Health Act was made after a state task force committee meeting on June 23.The guidelines cover such issues as transportation of staff, quarters and dormitories, canteen or dining area, health team and awareness creation, besides sanitation, social distancing and vaccination. Administrators must make necessary arrangements, including CCTVs, to monitor if their staff are wearing masks or face shields at all times. There should be at least two-metre gap between workstations. In places where spacing is not possible, management should ensure they are separated by transparent sheets or screens. Social distancing should be maintained in canteens and dining areas. It has also asked administrators to monitor mask compliance through CCTVs and organise online training programmes to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour among staff members. In February, Tamil Nadu had fewer than 500 cases every day. But new clusters and delta variants rapidly pushed the epidemic curve, overwhelming the healthcare system and doctors and nurses. On May 21, fresh cases peaked to 36,184. However, since then cases have been declining consistently. On Saturday the state reported 1,819 new cases leaving 24,025 people under treatment for the viral infection. The case tally touched 25.4 lakh and the cumulative death toll was 33,889.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-makes-two-vaccine-doses-must-for-industrial-employees/articleshow/84717185.cms||---
---||Surat||Surat: Dhiru Gajera back in BJP after 2007 exit||SURAT: Once the tallest Patidar leader in BJP from the city and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s opponent, Dhiru Gajera has returned to the saffron fold on Saturday, beginning his political journey afresh. The Saurashtra diamantaire, eldest of Gajera brothers, who run diamond and real estate business has parted ways with the party in 2007 before joining the Congress. Gajeras are natives of Amreli. His brothers run Laxmi Diamond, a diamond polishing unit, and Laxmi Developers, a real estate development firm, in the city. On Saturday, Gajera was welcomed back at the party office in the city in an event that was attended by state chief C R Paatil and other BJP leaders. A few of his supporters also joined the BJP on the same day. Political pundits view Gajera’s return as an attempt by the ruling party to strengthen its base among the Patidar voters who recently voted in favour of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the municipal elections. Gajera, a three-term BJP MLA, had lost three assembly and one parliament elections on Congress ticket from the city. He contested assembly election as Congress candidate in 2007, 2012 and 2017 and tried his luck in the Lok Sabha elections in 2009. He resigned from Congress in 2019 when he was vice-president of Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee. “I was unhappy from inside but due to my stubborn nature I did not change my decision,” Gajera told media after joining the BJP. “I contested and lost elections. BJP is doing good under the leadership of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah and hence, I returned to the party,” he added. Observers opine that the BJP’s move of bringing back Gajera, seems more a reactionary decision after businessman Mahesh Savani, once a BJP supporter, joined AAP recently. The Surat unit of Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) worked for AAP in the recent municipal election after a rift with Congress. It resulted in victory of AAP on 27 out of 120 seats mainly in Patidar-dominated areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/dhiru-gajera-back-in-bjp-after-2007-exit/articleshow/84715514.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Free WiFi to be installed at 217 locations across Uttar Pradesh by August 15||LUCKNOW: With six months left for assembly polls, BJP is set to fulfil a major poll promise by providing free WiFi at public places in the state. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced that on August 15, high-speed WiFi connectivity will be made available at 217 public places under 75 district headquarters, municipal councils and municipal corporations. As per plan, WiFi will be provided at two locations in big cities and one in small towns. The urban development department has begun chalking out the blueprint to swiftly implement the project. Divisional commissioners, district magistrates and municipal commissioners have been asked to identify hotspots at major public places, which include bus stands, railway stations, tehsils, courts, block and registrar offices and main markets. A government spokesperson said, the proposal entails free WiFi availability at two places in cities under municipal corporations and at one location in smaller towns. The expenditure will be borne by the Smart City Project or urban bodies. Such facilities can be expected in Lucknow, Kanpur, Agra, Aligarh, Varanasi, Prayagraj, Jhansi, Bareilly, Saharanpur, Moradabad, Gorakhpur, Ayodhya, Meerut, Shahjahanpur, Ghaziabad, Mathura-Vrindavan and Firozabad. “The CM has directed the urban development department to tie up with internet companies to set up the facility across the state, while ensuring high-speed connectivity. The expenditure will be borne by the Smart City Project or urban bodies. Urban local bodies have also been asked to provide regular updates on the status of installation to quickly address glitches,” the spokesperson said. He added companies engaged in WiFi installation will be responsible for maintenance and the speed will be decided by local authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/free-wifi-to-be-installed-at-217-locations-across-up-by-aug-15/articleshow/84719101.cms||---
---||Pune||40 families to be shifted from Pune's Kondhare village||PUNE: The Pune district administration has decided to shift 40 families living in Kondhare village to a safer place in Bhor tehsil due to the possibility of landslides. Over 200 villagers from the village were shifted to safe locations in nearby villages on Friday and Saturday. On Saturday, district collector Rajesh Deshmukh, Zilla Parishad’s chief executive officer Ayush Prasad and officials from the Bhor tehsil administration visited Kondhare and discussed the issue with the villagers. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh and other officials on a visit to Kondhare village on SaturdayDeshmukh told TOI, “The rehabilitation of around 40 families living in the village is necessary in view of a possible landslide there. We will prepare a proposal and forward it to the government for approval.” Deshmukh, who interacted with the villagers, said, “There are landslide-prone villages in the district. We will review them and take appropriate safety measures in the coming days.” Ranjit Shivtare, ZP vice-president, said, “Kondhare village needs at least five acres of land to build houses. Two years ago, the district administration had prepared the proposal, but nothing happened till date.” The Varandha ghat in Bhor, which connects Pune district to Raigad, is still out of bound due to landslides. Shivtare said, “Around 10 villages in Bhor have been cut off for the last two days due to a landslide. We have provided foodgrains and kerosene to the villagers.” Meanwhile, the Indian Army’s troops and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) team evacuated over 1,600 people from the flood-affected areas of Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Raigad and Ratnagiri in the last 24 hours. The rescue teams were mainly deployed in Satara and Raigad as maximum people were stranded in these districts, officials said. As the approach roads to the flood-affected villages have been damaged at multiple locations, they had to wade through a river and rivulet to reach the flood-affected villages, they said. The Southern Command troops on Saturday intensified operation by deploying 15 teams to far-flung locations in these districts. “The columns are involved in rescue of local villagers stranded in submerged areas and in restoring normalcy in the inundated areas. Over 100 persons have been shifted from the affected areas to safer locations,” said the command authorities. The army is also providing cooked meals and drinking water in tankers to the villagers. Medical teams of army doctors and nursing assistants have been deployed for providing necessary aid and medicines to locals evacuated from the flood affected areas. “The army cleared the main route at Posare Budruk village of Ratnagiri district blocked due to landslide,” the officer added. The army has established a flood-relief operation war room at the Pune-based headquarters of the Southern Command to monitor the ongoing situation. Additional 10 flood-relief teams have been put on alert for any contingency. Meanwhile, the NDRF, which had deployed teams at landslide affected villages in Satara, had to work in 10ft slush that developed over the last 24 hours. “Retrieving bodies from slush was very challenging. But our men worked hard in the rain and successfully retrieved 15 bodies since Saturday morning,” said Anupam Srivastava, commandant of the 5th battalion of the NDRF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dist-administration-to-shift-40-families-from-landslide-prone-village-in-bhor/articleshow/84719097.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Nagpur||Fresh tiger sighting triggers panic in Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station||CHANDRAPUR: The reappearance of tigers in Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station (CSTPS) has again triggered panic among the citizens of Urja Nagar, the power plant’s residential colony. Two tigers made a kill near Herai guest house of the power plant, and was captured on camera devouring the buffalo kill by several citizens on Saturday. The videos soon went viral on social media, stirring fresh fear among the local residents. Chandrapur range forest officer (RFO) Rahul Karekar said the tigers were being seen in CSTPS since Friday. He confirmed that the tiger duo made roadside kill and devoured the buffalo on Saturday, but maintained that all precautionary measures were being taken by the forest department. Karekar said the tigers seen in the video clip were adults. There are two other sub-adult tigers in the area on the verge of separating from their mother. He added that the department had installed 10 camera traps around the place where the tigers were sighted and people living in the area were alerted of tiger presence and warned against venturing out alone, particularly during the night. Replying to query, Karekar said that there was little possibility of taking up rescue operation of these tigers considering the number of natural water pools around the shrubby forest of CSTPS. Standard operating procedure prohibits tranquilizing tiger near a water body, as it is likely that the tiger falls unconscious in water and drowns. He said that a team of 10 foresters was deployed in the area for round-the-clock patrolling and keeping vigil against wildlife attack.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fresh-tiger-sighting-triggers-panic-in-cstps/articleshow/84713945.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Konkan towns’ flood nightmare is sludge in houses, loss of loved ones||Mumbai: When heavy rain pounded Chiplun town on July 21, little did Pragati Rane, who runs a coaching centre there, think that she, her family and others would have to scale sloped roofs of their houses and sit there precariously through the night, clinging to hope. Though their nightmare ended when the National Disaster Response Force rescued them, an uphill task of rebuilding their lives awaits Rane and scores others. Chiplun, Khed and many other towns in Ratnagiri and parts of neighbouring Raigad bore the brunt of the rain and subsequent floods over the last few days, with many rivers in the region flowing above the danger mark. Although the water level has receded in most areas, the floods have left a trail of large-scale damage, from sludge and heaps of mud in houses and roads to loss of loved ones. “It was raining heavily on July 21 but I thought the water level will rise for a few hours and then recede. However, due to the downpour, the water level suddenly rose at night and we all had to leave everything behind and reach the sloped clay-tiled roof,” Rane said. “We were rescued by NDRF the next evening… It was a horrible experience…Everything at home is permanently damaged. I have lost many kitchen utensils and other things,” she said. The situation in Khed and Mahad towns is no different. Mujaffar Khan from Mahad, who runs a photocopy shop, said, “After running the shop till 4pm, I went home by 5pm on July 21. After that the rain was so heavy that I could not visit the shop. I could only go there this morning. The road to the shop was under water and now there is a thick layer of mud.” “I have no idea how to remove the mud as it is not only the layer of soil. There are dead creatures like rats. The lane is stinking. We approached the local authorities but everyone is burdened with work now,” he said. Maharashtra government said 76 people have died and 30 are missing in the flood-hit parts of the state. After the floods, the major challenge before the administration is supplying drinking water, food and medicines to those affected. “Several schools and some private properties are being used as shelters and primary treatment centres for the injured. The real challenge is locating those missing,” a senior NDRF official said. Maharashtra minister Uday Samant, who hails from Ratnagiri, has been meeting officials in Ratnagiri to expedite relief work. “Water has receded from some areas of Chiplun town. I held a special meeting with representatives of insurance companies and urged them to expedite claims of property damage and loss of human lives,” he told reporters. A Ratnagiri district collectorate official said, “The topography of Chiplun town is like a bowl. No matter where it rains around it, water reaches the city streets.” PTI||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-konkan-towns-flood-nightmare-is-sludge-in-houses-loss-of-loved-ones/articleshow/84719124.cms||---

Aakash (name changed) had gone missing from Panas area since Thursday and a missing person’s report in this regard was lodged in Khatodara police station by his family members on the same day. Looking at the decomposed body, the police suspect that the boy had been murdered on Thursday itself after he had been kidnapped. Investigation so far revealed that Aakash was kidnapped by the husband of his elder sister, Dablu Singh Rajput. Children in Panas had revealed seeing Aakash leaving with Rajput on Thursday.

---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Dy SP Rajendra Pal & police naik in ACB net for accepting Rs 10 lakh as token bribe||AURANGABAD: Rajendra Pal, the 55-year-old deputy superintendent of police heading the Selu division of Parbhani district, and 35-year-old police naik Ganesh Chavan have been arrested by the Mumbai unit of anti-corruption bureau (ACB) for demanding Rs 2 crore as a bribe and accepting Rs 10 lakh as the token amount from a businessman. Incidentally, this is the second deputy superintendent of police caught in ACB net in two months in the region. Earlier in May, Jalna district deputy SP Sunil Khiradkar and two policemen, including his writer, were nabbed by the ACB while accepting a bribe amount of Rs 2 lakh. The latest trap followed a 48-hour operation carried out by assistant commissioner of police (ACB, Mumbai unit) Abasaheb Patil. Pal and Chavan were produced before the local court on Saturday. They have been remanded in four-day police custody. During the search carried out at Pal’s residence in Mumbai, the ACB found Rs 24.5 lakh of unaccounted cash. Nanded superintendent of police (ACB) Kalpana Baravkar told TOI: “Preliminary probe has revealed that a businessman was allegedly being harassed using an audio clip — allegedly between him and his recently deceased friend’s wife.” Authorities said that on the evening of May 2, Suresh Karwa, a businessman from Manvat, was run over by a speeding truck while returning from his farm. Accordingly, a case was registered against the truck driver on the charges of causing death due to negligence and for rash and negligent driving. Few days later, an audio clip, purportedly of the conversation between the deceased man’s wife and his friend, also a leading businessman, surfaced on social media. This audio clip also reached deputy SP Pal, who then summoned the businessman and citing the audio clip, alleged that he (the leading businessman) and Suresh’s wife had conspired and got him killed. The officer allegedly demanded Rs 2 crore in bribe for not initiating any action against him. After the businessman failed to meet the deadline to pay the bribe, the officer allegedly started harassing him and also abusing him over the phone. Unwilling to pay the bribe, the businessman approached the ACB state headquarters and lodged a complaint on July 21. Soon, a team from Mumbai reached Selu and carried out verification for demand. In the presence of panchas, the bribe amount was negotiated and the accused officer agreed to settle the issue for Rs 1.5 crore at his office on July 22. Accordingly, a trap was set late on Friday night, when the accused officer sent a police naik to accept the token bribe amount of Rs 10 lakh. As soon as the police naik accepted the amount, the ACB team nabbed him, while another team rushed and zeroed in on the senior officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/dy-sp-police-naik-in-acb-net-for-accepting-rs-10-lakh-as-token-bribe/articleshow/84713953.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Surat||Bumpy ride ahead: Moderate rains leave roads pothole-ridden in Surat||SURAT: Just one spell of rain is enough to wash away the tall claims that civic authorities make about regular repair and maintenance of city roads ahead of the monsoon. While rains resulted in potholes across many roads, the ongoing development works have also added to the commuters’ woes. Also, there are many locations where potholes existed even before the arrival of rains. One such location is Kharwar Nagar junction. Heavy traffic, coupled with uneven roads, make a ride on this stretch not only difficult but also risky. The road is in poor condition around the BRTS bus stop and it leads to traffic jams. Vimal Ratnakar often crosses the junction while ferrying goods in his tempo carrier. “Right now, the road is badly damaged due to the monsoon. But even when there is no rain, potholes are a major problem on this stretch. Uneven road surfaces, especially around drainage manholes, can lead to accidents in the rainy season because during waterlogging they are not visible,” Ratnakar said. Not only roads, potholes can be spotted even on flyovers at Anu Vrat Dwar. Strangely, the repair work on the potholes doesn’t last long. “Our teams repair the roads on a regular basis but due to heavy rain it gets damaged again. Cold mix is used to repair roads during monsoon. During dry periods we try to repair it with material that stays for a long period,” said Banchhanidh Pani, city municipal commissioner. The upcoming metro project will benefit the residents of Bhatar area. But because of the ongoing construction commuters of this area have to bear with the damaged road. With the soil testing process being initiated, barricades have been put up at multiple points leaving only half part of the road open for commuters. “The work started recently and due to the barricade the water is splashed on to the nearby shops when a vehicle passes at high speed from the limited space. The road is damaged at a few locations where water gets collected,” said Akshat Patel, a local resident. Also, the space near the starting and ending point of these barricades is used as a parking lot by the locals, which adds to the traffic problems. Due to unavailability of parking space at most of the commercial complexes on Bhatar road vehicles are now being parked in these spaces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/bumpy-ride-ahead-moderate-rains-leave-roads-pothole-ridden/articleshow/84715546.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||HC: Get bail-giving court’s nod to arrest accused by adding sections||Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court, while deciding a writ petition, ruled that after an accused is released on bail, if in such a case some serious offences are invoked at a later point in time — to make a fresh arrest of the accused — the investigating agency should apply for permission from the court that had granted the bail. Citing series of judgments of the Supreme Court, Justice Mangesh Patil ruled: “It has now been emphatically concluded that after an accused is released on bail and some serious offences are invoked at a later point of time, there is no question of seeking any cancellation of bail and the investigating agency would only be required to apply for permission from the court which granted the bail to arrest the accused.” “Instead of proceeding on the technicalities, when the law does not require cancellation of bail and merely requires permission to arrest the accused, the wording of the prayer in this application can be interpreted to mean that what is contemplated in law was in fact sought by the prosecution.” The ruling came while hearing a petition filed by a group of six suspects, who, on March 5, 2019, were booked and arrested for attempt to murder, voluntarily causing grievous hurt by using dangerous weapons, rioting and unlawful assembly, and the Arms Act by the Hingoli police. After being released on bail, the Hingoli police slapped sections of the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), and moved an application for cancelling their bail in August 2019. Considering the police’s plea, additional session judge, Hingoli, cancelled the bail granted to the six men on February 8, 2021. Soon after the cancellation of bail, all the six suspects, through lawyer Pratap Vikhe Patil and senior counsel Rajendra Deshmukh, filed a petition before the HC and contested that in the absence of any supervening circumstance or a breach of terms and conditions subject to which the bail was granted, it could not have been cancelled. The lawyers went on to allege that the sanctioning authority for the MCOCA was hand-in-gloves with the complainant in the case. Meanwhile, three of the six accused were arrested by the police under MCOCA and over a period of time, chargesheets were filed against them. After hearing both sides, HC concluded: “I find no illegality in the impugned order. At the most, it can be clarified that it be read as not amounting to cancellation of bail but granting permission to the Investigating Officer to arrest the petitioners.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-get-bail-giving-courts-nod-to-arrest-accused-by-adding-sections/articleshow/84713989.cms||Mohammed Akhef

While 53 people have been injured so far, 99 were reported missing. Over 1.4 lakh people have been evacuated. Crop losses across the state are estimated at an area of more than 1.5 lakh hectares. The Konkan and Western Maharashtra have borne the brunt of landslides and floods since Thursday, Raigad being the worst-affected district. Although rainwaters receded by Saturday, the Panchganga and Krishna rivers in Western Maharashtra stayed above the danger mark, keeping parts of Kolhapur city and Sangli district submerged. President Ram Nath Kovind called Maharashtra governor B S Koshyari to express his concern over the lives lost. The Pune-Bengaluru national highway stayed closed for the second day, with over 2,000 trucks stuck on the key road. The bridge connecting Mumbai to Chiplun in the Konkan on Vashisti river has collapsed, impacting movement. Konkan Railway resumed operations after being closed for two days. Two more landslides were reported near Taliye village in Raigad on Saturday shortly before CM Uddhav Thackeray’s visit, but these were minor. The village is the site of the state’s worst landslide, which occurred on Thursday. Thackeray said the state is making a plan to rehabilitate settlements that are in landslide-prone areas. The state agency Mhada will be rebuilding homes in Taliye. He also said he was satisfied with the response from the Centre. As many as 34 NDRF teams, 3 Army teams, 7 Navy teams and 3 coast guard teams are assisting with relief operations||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/99-still-missing-as-maharashtra-rain-fury-toll-rises-to-112/articleshow/84721196.cms||Bhavika Jain

Work on the network, which began in 2013, has still not been completed, he said. “Now with the rain, the chambers are flooded and some are throwing up water like fountains. The entire Baga road is in a mess and motorists are having a tough time travelling on that road,” Sequeira said. He said there are more than 2,000 sewerage chambers all over Calangute. “If the sewerage network is commissioned, then the entire Calangute will start stinking as the sewerage will spill out from the chambers and Calangute will no longer be a tourist destination,” Sequeira said.  and most of them have started sinking because of shoddy construction work. “This has resulted in a number of accidents involving tourists. The entire Baga road is in a mess and motorists are having a tough time travelling on that road,” he said, adding that even the pumping stations for the sewerage network are yet to be completed. If the sewerage network is commissioned, then the entire Calangute will start stinking as the sewerage will spill out from the chambers and Calangute will no longer be a tourist destination Sequeira was Calangute sarpanch when the sewerage project had been launched by the state government. “We had asked for this project because sewerage was being released in fields, on the roads, the sea and other places leading to contamination and stench. We had supported Michael Lobo and worked to get him elected and the sewerage project was one of our promises,” Sequeira said. Although Sequeira had supported Lobo in the 2012 assembly election, they later had a fallout.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sewerage-network-sinks-at-calangute/articleshow/84720325.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Heavy rain, hyacinth trigger fear of Ramnadi overflowing||PUNE: The Ramnadi Restoration Mission (RRM), a network of activists, river and water experts working to restore the Ramnadi that runs through western Pune, has warned that the build-up of water hyacinth in the river and swelling of Mula river due to heavy rains have put thousands at the risk of flooding. They also alleged that despite multiple letters, reports, including causes of devastating flooding, especially in 2019, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), as well as the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), have been slow to act to clear the Ramnadi from water hyacinth and have been tardy in cleaning the Mula river into which the Ramnadi flows along with other rivers in west and north-west Pune. The stretch along the Ramnadi, which flows through areas, such as Bavdhan, Sus, Baner, Pashan, and others, has witnessed violations of flood lines. The RRM has said that water hyacinth gathering at Pashan Lake has flown into the Ramnadi, which originates from the Manas lake at Bhugaon. “The water hyacinth that has gathered along the river and near the confluence should be removed and lifted from the spot as soon as possible. With the orange alert that has been issued for the region over the next few days, the volume of the Mula can increase further. Although the PCMC cleared the hyacinth in some areas, they did not remove it from the banks. Since the flow of Mula has already been restricted due to encroachments and hyacinth, the water is now flowing back into rivers and streams that open into it. Despite having sent multiple letters and reports to the PMC and elected representatives, no action has been forthcoming,” said Shailaja Deshpande of Jeevitnadi, one of the members of the RRM network. Senior PMC officials stated that they have stepped up removal of water hyacinth from various stretches, including the Ramnadi, but claimed that people along it are not in immediate risk of relocation. “We used our departmental resources to clear some water hyacinth in March and April, and our tender was finalized in and awarded in June. In the last two days, we have used our machines to clear hyacinth from the Ramnadi and other stretches, although it is difficult to operate them sometimes, especially when the dams release water. Right now, people living along the Ramnadi do not need to shift, as we have observed volumes of around 25,000 cusecs, and relocation won’t be required unless the volumes reach 50,000-55,000 cusecs or more,” said Kunal Khemnar, the additional commissioner of the PMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/with-heavy-rains-and-hyacinth-build-up-activist-group-warns-of-ramnadi-flood-risk/articleshow/84719182.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

The state administered 10.06 lakh first doses of Covid vaccine in 24 hours, which the state government hailed as a milestone. Previously, the government had conducted 10.03 lakh vaccinations on July 6. Additional chief secretary (ACS) health Amit Mohan Prasad said that over 4.38 crore people had received both doses of the vaccine in UP, the highest in the country. “The feat was achieved on Saturday—a day when the government shifts its focus on routine immunisation of children while Covid vaccination continues. It is a benchmark for the state. Both vaccinations and Covid testing remain the highest in UP across the country,” said ACS health.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-records-max-10-06l-jabs-in-a-day/articleshow/84719207.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Move to bin-free Hyderabad not as smooth as hoped||HYDERABAD: With the onset of monsoon, GHMC’s attempt towards a bin-free city is turning out to be a major problem in several areas of the city. The areas where the bins existed earlier are now apparent from the proliferation of garbage mounds that spread onto the road with every spell of rain, causing severe inconvenience to commuters as well as residents. Residents of several areas have asked for a permanent solution as the garbage keeps piling up on roadsides even after the sanitation staff clears it, reporting the issue to the concerned officials. “The garbage which was being dumped on the roadsides after the GHMC decided to remove bins from street corners is now coming onto the roads every time it rains. The area near Syed Ali chabutra in Shalibanda is one place where garbage keeps piling up. The entire situation is not only turning out to become an eyesore, but it is also causing severe inconvenience to commuters as well as pedestrians,” Rustam Ansari, a resident of Shalibanda. The Salar Jung bridge in front of Imliban Park is another example where the entire road turns into a slippery mess even if it rains for a short period. Locals alleged that the situation is despite several complaints to the officials to provide a permanent solution. “The garbage which spreads onto this busy road caused several accidents where two-wheeler riders have suffered serious injuries. This entire stretch has now become prone to accidents due to negligence of the concerned sanitation officials,” said Mohammad Ahmed, a social activist. In some areas like Yakutpura, Red Hills near criminal court, Budvel village in Rajendranagar, Maithri Enclave at Kapra, Sanath Nagar, Bahadurpura crossroads and Murad Nagar in Mehdipatnam, residents say that the garbage keeps accumulating within two or three days even after the GHMC workers collect the waste. Ashok Samrat, GHMC zonal commissioner (South Zone) said, “The GHMC workers are lifting garbage continuously from these places, and despite that, people continue to throw waste on the roads. The permanent solution for this problem is that people should be more responsible and ensure that waste is disposed properly.”, Officials added GHMC has recently decided to procure 1,350 Swachh Auto Tippers (SATs) for door-to-door collection of garbage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/move-to-bin-free-city-not-as-smooth-as-hoped/articleshow/84717298.cms||Moulika.KV

Besides deciding to continue the shortened syllabuses for the second year in a row, the CBSE released the term-wise syllabus for these classes to all schools on Saturday. The board has divided the academic year 2021-22 into two terms for Classes X and XII to avoid total cancellation of the board exams like last year. The first term exam, which will be multiple-choice-based questions, will be held in November-December and the second term exam that will include all types of questions in April-May 2022. Teachers and principals said the term-wise syllabus and guidelines are providing clarity on what the teachers, students need to do if the pandemic continues. Last year, the board had cut the syllabus by upto 30% for classes IX to XII for 2020-21 academic year, as students were learning through online mode. This year also the pandemic situation across the country forced schools to remain closed in the first quarter of the academic year and schools are teaching students online. Asha Nathan, principal of Chennai Public School in Anna Nagar, said the board has retained the same syllabus with deleted portions issued last year. “In the bifurcation, they equally divided 50% of portions from last year for term I and term II. The practicals are also divided by two this year,” she said. In the guidelines, the board also announced that even if practicals are not conducted due to the pandemic there will be theory based practicals. R Srinivasa Raghavan, principal of Bala Vidyamandir Senior Secondary School in Adyar, said the examination will be conducted seamlessly under the new term system for Class X and XII students. “Schools have a lot more clarity as the board has given the blueprint how the mark will be considered for next year. Validating the marks at the end of the year also will be better,” he said. He further said the students need to perform continuously throughout the year to score well in the current scheme. Some principals said some of their teachers have already completed portions moved to term II this year. “Though the syllabus is the same like last year, some portions completed by our school have been moved to term II this year. It will put the schools in a tricky situation. Further, multiple-choice based questions (MCQs) will work against the students as moderation may not be possible,” a principal from a city school said. C Sathish, former principal of DAV Boys Senior Secondary School in Gopalapuram, said they have reduced the syllabus for all subjects for both the terms. “This rationalised syllabi will be advantageous for students since the duration before the term I and term II exams are less,” he said. Along with the bifurcation of syllabus, the board also issued guidelines to conduct internal assessment, practicals and projects. “The schools should ensure that internal assessment is reliable, fair, and transparent for all students. The evaluation done by teachers for internal assessment/practical/project work needs to be based on evidence of the students’ performance throughout the academic session. The evidence of internal assessment/practical/project work needs to be presented/ uploaded by schools as per directions of CBSE for verification,” the guidelines said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cbse-syllabus-cut-by-30-for-2021-22/articleshow/84717282.cms||A Ragu Raman

The contraband was brought from Odisha by road and was meant for distribution in the city and other parts of south Gujarat, said police. Since it was in large quantities, the drug was stored outside the city and was transported to the city in small quantities via scooter. “It is the biggest seizure in the recent past and we are working to nab those who supplied it,” said Usha Rada Desai, superintendent of police, Surat. Police arrested Bikas Buli Gauda, 19, a resident of Katargam area in the city and native of Chatula in Ganjam district of Odisha. Gauda would maintain the stock and work for two other accused, Babu Nahak and Vikram Maglu Parida, both residents of Utkal Nagar in Katargam. Nahak and Parida are yet to be arrested. The ganja was supplied by Sibram Nahak of Sachina village in Ganjam district of Odisha. “The ganja was brought to this location around four days ago. But it is not yet clear who were their regular buyers. The accused used to supply the drug in small quantities from this spot,” said police. “We have seized the moped that they used to deliver the drug and was also used to keep a watch in the area,” said K J Dhaduk, police inspector, SOG, adding that this is the biggest haul cops have managed to seize so far in the region. Earlier in November 2019, around 967 kg ganja worth Rs 96 lakh was seized from a sugarcane field near Kathodara village in limits of Kamrej police station. In February 2020, around 750 kg ganja worth Rs 75 lakh was seized from Kudsad village in the limits of Kim police station. Price of the ganja has been calculated on the basis of a CID Crime circular which fixed per kg price of ganja at Rs 10,000. In August 2019, 331 kg ganja was seized from Pipodara GIDC of Surat district by Ahmedabad crime branch and per kg value was calculated at Rs 30,000. The circular was issued after that seizure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/biggest-haul-of-1k-kg-ganja-worth-rs-1cr-seized/articleshow/84715588.cms||---

To boost tourism in the region, the Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) will introduce vistadome coaches in trains before Durga Puja. Passengers on board will get to experience the nature and wildlife as the train from Siliguri Junction to Alipurduar Junction passes through the dense forests of the Dooars. Apart from enjoying the raw nature, the passengers, if lucky, can also have a glimpse of wild elephants from the train as it crosses Mahananda and Chapramari wildlife sanctuaries — two key elephant habitats in the region. The transparent plexi-glass roofs and large windows will allow the passengers to get a better and clear view of the surroundings. Apart from this, the trains on this 168-km track also cross Jaldapara National Park and Buxa and other forest tracts like Kalimpong division’s Mongpong and forests in Jalpaiguri division. In eastern India, such coaches have already been introduced in toy trains of the heritage Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (DHR). The Kalka-Shimla Railway, the Jan Shatabdi Express between Mumbai and Goa and the link train from Visakhapatnam to Araku also have vistadome coaches. “This will be a special treat for the region. These coaches will be attached to trains that pass between Siliguri Junction and Alipurduar Junction railway stations traversing a distance of 168 kilometres,” NFR CPRO, Subhanan Chanda told TOI. Each coach has a seating capacity of 44. Seats are rotatable 180 degree, wide and the large windows offer a clear view to the passengers. There are nearly a dozen trains that pass through this route during the day. The vistadome coaches will not be attached to trains crossing the forests after dark.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/this-puja-enjoy-the-dooars-from-comfort-of-vistadome-coaches/articleshow/84689901.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya

---||Lucknow||Have no objection if Bhagidari Morcha allies with SP: AIMIM||Lucknow: Asaduddin Owaisi-led All-India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) on Saturday said that as a constituent of Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha (BSM), it has no objection if the convenor of the front decides to enter into alliance with Samajwadi Party for 2022 Assembly elections in UP. This is the first time that there has been any talk of AIMIM coming together with SP in UP. The statement assumes significance, particularly in the light of recent attacks that AIMIM chief Owaisi has launched on SP leadership for its failure to get a single Muslim district panchayat chairperson elected. AIMIM is one of the 10 political parties which have joined hands under the banner of BSM led by Om Prakash Rajbhar, the president of Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP). SBSP was earlier a part of NDA but parted ways following differences with the Yogi government. “If Rajbhar, the convenor of the morcha, decides that it should enter into an alliance with the SP, our party will abide by the decision,” said AIMIM state president Shauquat Ali. “It is good that the SP is ready to join hands with smaller parties to defeat the BJP in the assembly elections due early next year. UP has 20% Muslim population but the community is yet to receive its due in terms of representation in the government,” he said. “Why hasn’t any party appointed a Muslim deputy CM in the state,” he asked, adding that it was time that the community was given proper representation in the government. “AIMIM will be the voice of UP’s Muslims in the 2022 elections. We have already put in place the organisational structure and every district in the state has a party unit and a district chief,” Ali said. He added that AIMIM’s demand of adequate representation to Muslims in the government would gather momentum with the party president’s visit to the state in August. Though AIMIM state chief was unwilling to divulge the details of Owaisi’s schedule of UP tour, sources said the firebrand MP is slated to visit Prayagraj, Kaushambi and Fatehpur once the Monsoon session of Parliament concludes on August 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/have-no-objection-if-bhagidari-morcha-allies-with-sp-aimim/articleshow/84719300.cms||---

---||Pune||Irrigation department to maintain around 90% storage in Pune's Khadakwasla dam||PUNE: The Khadakwasla dam will maintain around 90% stock for the next few days as part of a water release mechanism to avoid sudden increase in discharge, which could cause flooding in low lying areas, an official from the state irrigation department said. The dam was releasing water at the rate of over 10,000 cusec since Thursday because of the massive water inflow. The irrigation department said that the water stock in Panshet had reached near the 80%-mark and the dam might release water, which would come to Khadakwasla. Some space to accommodate the incoming water would be created because of the water release. On Saturday, the Khadakwasla dam released water at the rate of 18,000 cusec in the morning. It was brought down to 7,872 cusec in the evening. The live storage of water was recorded at 82%. An official from the state irrigation department said, “The dam’s storage would be maintained between 80% and 95% depending on the status of inflow of rainwater and rainfall prediction. Some space would be maintained that would prevent a huge discharge of water. Also, water release would be increased in a phased manner.” The official said that initially, the water release was started at the rate of 4,000 cusec and was increased subsequently. Water release went beyond 20,000 cusec on Friday within hours because of the huge inflow of water. Meanwhile, rainfall activity in the catchments of all the four dams — Temghar, Panshet, Khadakwasla and Varasgaon — of the Khadakwasla circle reduced on Saturday. Temghar received 40mm rainfall, while Panshet and Varasgaon recorded 20mm and 30mm rainfall, respectively. Khadakwasla received 2mm rainfall throughout the day. The storage in Panshet reached 78%, while Varasgaon’s stock increased to 68%. Sanjeev Chopde, the superintending engineer at the Pune irrigation circle, said, “As part of the reservoir operation schedule some space would be set aside at both Panshet and Varasgaon dams while preparing the discharge plans. Khadakwasla is a small dam, so it fills to its maximum capacity faster than the other dams.” As per the plan, water released from both Panshet and Varasgaon flows into the Khadakwasla and it is then released in the Mutha river. The collective stock in the four dams of the Khadakwasla circle increased to 20.71 TMC on Saturday evening. The dams added 9 TMC water in four days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/irrigation-dept-to-maintain-around-90-storage-in-khadakwasla-dam/articleshow/84719363.cms||Sarang Dastane

Teaching will begin at the Deoria-based medical college from the ensuing academic session and it’s one of the nine colleges that would be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi after a nod from Medical Council of India. Referring to the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana, the CM said, no one could have imagined Deoria would have a medical college even five years ago. “More than Rs 155crore have been spent on the Rs 208crore project. Appointment of faculty has been completed and remaining work would be complete by December,” he said. The CM said, a chain of medical colleges has been established in UP covering 59 districts with Central and state resources. Elaborating on the plan, Yogi said, while BRD Medical College, Gorakhpur, was the sole institute to cater to eastern UP, now there would be medical colleges at Deoria, Basti and Siddharthnagar too. Construction work is already underway in Kushinagar. “AIIMS Gorakhpur with world class medical facilities has become functional and will be inaugurated by PM Modi in October,” he said. The medical colleges have played a significant role in flattening the pandemic graph in the country’s most populous state. “Encephalitis was also controlled in the last four-and-half years. Once Deoria was also among the most encephalitis-affected districts, but now deaths have dipped by 95%,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/all-districts-to-get-medical-colleges-in-6-months-cm/articleshow/84719341.cms||---

---||Pune||Floods cause crop losses on 1.5L hectares in state||Pune: The state agriculture department has estimated that crops planted in 1.5 lakh hectares of farmland in the state have been damaged by the recent heavy rain and floods. Senior officials told TOI on Saturday that they expected the final figures to be much higher and said Kharif resowing in some affected regions has not been ruled out. Rough estimates till the night of July 23 showed that over 10,000 farmers in Pune district have been affected, with damage to crops spread over 3,183 hectares. “Our assessment is still on. The preliminary crop loss is pegged at 1.5 lakh hectares but may increase. As of now, crop damage has been reported in Pune, Kolhapur, Sangli, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Palghar, Thane, Parbhani, Nanded, Akola, Washim, Nagpur and Wardha. Agricultural land has been submerged in in Konkan, Kolhapur and Sangli,” a senior state agriculture department official said. The official said wherever there was topsoil loss due to the floods in Konkan, there could be damage to paddy crops. As of now, the agriculture department has mainly received reports of losses to crops such as paddy, soyabean and vegetables. Soyabean crop in particular was badly hit. “Kharif sowing was done in over 119 lakh hectares so far; most were standing crops in the growing stage,” the official said. Surveying teams from the agriculture department are still not able to access many areas in the affected regions and the losses are expected to mount once ground surveys are completed, the official said. Another senior official said figures of crop losses in Kolhapur and Konkan were still awaited. Officials said farmers who had agricultural fields next to rivers and in catchments that have been inundated may have to undertake resowing as the topsoil may have been washed away. “There has been widespread destruction of vegetable crops in western Maharashtra, though it is relatively less when one moves towards Nashik-Pune. But losses are being reported in most parts of the state due to heavy rain,” Shriram Gadhave, president of the Vegetables Growers’ Association of India, said. Gadhave explained that floodwater was uprooting vegetable crops from the fields. “Vegetables’ roots extend just a couple of feet into the ground and can easily be uprooted in such weather. Thousands of tonnes of vegetables are likely to be damaged, but as of now, there are no official figures,” he said. He said among fruits and vegetables affected were tomato, cucumber, cabbage, cauliflower, and gourds. “Onions, which are currently in storage structures, could also be affected by rot; there have been reports of floodwater seeping through the base of such storage structures,” Gadhave said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/floods-cause-crop-losses-on-1-5l-hectares-in-state/articleshow/84719401.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Lucknow||Aam gift for special people: CM Yogi Adityanath sends Uttar Pradesh mangoes to PM Narendra Modi, ministers||LUCKNOW: A day after calling out senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his ‘uncharitable’ remarks on UP’s mangoes, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath sent especially selected export quality fruit from the state to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his cabinet colleagues. UP’s mangoes were also sent to the chief ministers of BJP-ruled states. When asked why other CMs were left out, a senior official quipped:”Leaders of other parties don’t like UP’s mangoes.” A letter accompanying each consignment says: “Uttar Pradesh’s mangoes are world famous…Varieties like Dussehri, Chausa, Langda and Ganvarjeet are not only famous in India but throughout the world.” Talking about Kakori’s mangoes, the CM’s letter says: “Kakori, which is situated near the state capital, has historical significance. The place has a significant role in the Independence battle. Kakori (Malihabad) is the main centre of mango production. In the past few years, the state government has begun distribution of mango in the name of “Kakori” brand. “…A few of the mangoes from here (Kakori) have been sent to you to relish. I hope that the taste and sweetness of these mangoes will be liked by you,” the CM’s letter concludes. Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, the recently appointed deputy leader of Rajya Sabha and the Union minority affairs minister, tweeted the letter while thanking the UP CM for sending delicious mangoes from the state. Naqvi confirmed to TOI that he received the mangoes on Saturday. “I have received Langda varieties of mangoes,” Naqvi told TOI. On Friday, Rahul Gandhi’s video went viral in which he is purportedly saying: “I don’t like UP’s mangoes.” While BJP instantly linked his comment to his defeat in Amethi in 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Yogi tweeted: “Dear Rahul Gandhi ji, your taste is divisive. The whole country is aware of your divisive culture. Your divisive bad culture is so dominating that it has dragged the taste of mangoes into regionalism. But you should remember the taste of India is one from Kashmir to Kanyakumari.” Additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal confirmed to TOI that the export quality mangoes as part of promotion had been sent to PM Modi and his cabinet colleagues. Mangoes have also been sent to several chief ministers, Sehgal confirmed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aam-gift-for-special-people-yogi-sends-up-mangoes-to-pm-mins/articleshow/84719390.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

Central Railway (CR) had cancelled 44 services on Friday and announced more than 50 cancellations till July 28. A CR spokesperson said, “We resumed 12 services, mostly on KR.” KR services had come to a standstill as water breached the danger mark between Kamathe and Chiplun stations on Thursday. After rain water receded, a track fitness certificate on the stretch was given, allowing trains to resume. “The rake and crew management system gets disturbed when there is such a prolonged disturbance. Gradually, we will keep introducing services whose cancellations were announced,” said a CR official. Thousands of passengers were stranded in trains on KR and CR’s Mumbai-Lonavla route and Mumbai-Igatpuri route as rain caused extensive damage to rail infrastructure on Wednesday. Later, Mumbai-Pune and Mumbai-Igatpuri routes were restored. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-trains-slowly-resume-on-konkan-route/articleshow/84719423.cms||---

One member of the opposition and five independents also filed nomination. Those in fray include 12 BJP members for as many seats in the school board. The BJP is sure of a victory as it has sufficient numbers to see its candidates through. The Congress has put up Sai Dhekane as a candidate. But the candidature is directed towards ensuring that BJP does not win uncontested. The nomination of five independents will be rejected as they do not have corporators proposing and seconding their candidature. While four independents did not have a proposer and a seconder at all, in the case of the fifth candidate these were not corporators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/bjp-confident-of-winning-school-board/articleshow/84715665.cms||---
---||Goa||‘Announcement of house nos. to illegal structures is to woo voters’||Margao: United Goans Foundation (UGF) has taken exception to panchayat minister Mauvin Godinho’s announcement of allotting house numbers to illegal structures across Goa to generate revenue for panchayats. Stating that the move lacked any application of thought, UGF in a press note alleged that the announcement was meant to “woo his voters many of whom are living in slum like conditions on Comunidade land.” “Before the 2017 elections, a similar policy was implemented to appease the vote bank of encroachers. The Regularisarion of Unauthorised Structures Bill was proposed to regularise illegal structures on Comunidade land and private properties. When we exposed the bill, the government took a step back and tabled a bill that permitted regularisation of unauthorised structures in a person’s own private property,” UGF secretary Avinash Tavares said. Stating that thousands of people applied for house numbers under the Act, Tavares said, “Five years later, the government has not regulated even the unauthorised structures of applicants in their own property, let alone those in comunidade land.” Accusing Godinho of abusing his position “to create a back door to give legal rights to encroachers and squatters”, Tavares said, “His justification is that the panchayat is losing revenue since these encroachers don't pay house tax. He and his government doesn't realise that the government will stand to lose far more in terms of conversion sand fees, zone conversion charges, sale deed stamp duty and registration charges, partition and mutation fees, technical clearance fees, construction licence fees etc.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/announcement-of-house-nos-to-illegal-structures-is-to-woo-voters/articleshow/84719577.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Panjab University senate polls: Focus on online campaigning||CHANDIGARH: Campaigning for Panjab University senate elections has started after the Punjab and Haryana high court approved the dates for the polls — submitted by the university — between August 3 and 23, campaigning.The four-year term of the senate had ended on October 31, 2020. Harpreet Singh Dua, a former syndicate member, said, “We are happy with the decision taken by the bench as the authorities tried to control the polls. If you see, there have been elections taking place in some states of the country, but senate elections were kept on hold citing the pandemic. The preparations have started for the campaigning. As colleges are closed at present, the campaigning will be more directed towards different social media platforms.” Senate polls were first scheduled for August last year but were postponed by PU’s vice-chancellor (VC) professor Raj Kumar, citing the Covid-19 pandemic and rise in a number of cases in the city. In April, after the high court asked the VC for the delay, polls were set to be held from April 26, but were postponed again due to the onset of the Covid-19 second wave. Navdeep Goyal, a former senator, professor, department of physics and candidate from science faculty, said, “Most of the candidates are prepared, so not much of the campaigning is required. It is now up to the university how they want to hold the elections in the right manner. Most of the candidates are experienced and they know what to do during campaigning.” Earlier this week, several former senators, seeking re-election to the body had sent a representation to Panjab University chancellor, demanding that appropriate instructions be issued to vice-chancellor for holding of the senate polls, in lieu of the order issued by the high court. The candidates contesting the elections are happy after the decision of the high court which strictly asked the PU authorities to conduct the elections on the given dates. D P S Randhawa, who is one of the contestants from registered graduates, said, “We were prepared for the elections as dates were out a couple of times before, so things were already in motion. It will be a challenging time as things are going to be different this time. We are more focused on our online campaigning and concerned about voter turnout given the current situation. Like on previous occasions, I hope the university sends out the letters to the voters and asking them for their maximum participation”. Polling will commence with constituencies of principals and staff of technical and professional colleges on the first day followed by the staff of technical and professional colleges, professors at university teaching departments, associate, assistant professors of teaching departments, heads of affiliated art colleges, professors at affiliated art colleges, registered graduates, who are the prime group with 3,61,869 eligible voters, and finally, the faculties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pu-senate-polls-focus-on-online-campaigning/articleshow/84715667.cms||---

According to current water levels, there was only an eight feet gap at Manjira and a seven feet gap at Singoor, to their respective FTLs. Currently, the water board is drawing 44 million gallons and another 36 million gallons from Manjira and Singoor is being drawn to meet the demand of nearly half a dozen GHMC peripheral circles and few villages in Medak and Sangareddy under Mission Bhagiratha and industries and defence organisations. While few floodgates of Osmansagar and Himayatsagar were opened and surplus flood water was discharged into Musi river, officials of HMWS&SB and Telangana Irrigation Department are jointly monitoring the inflows of Manjira and Singoor.“We are expecting heavy inflows in Manjira and Singoor in the coming weeks, and then a decision will be taken to open the gates,” according to a HMWS&SB official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/manjira-singoor-reservoirs-close-to-ftl/articleshow/84717452.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Drier days ahead after fortnight of intense rainfall||MUMBAI: After almost two weeks of intense rain activity, Mumbai can expect drier days ahead as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast light to moderate rain. The IMD on Saturday said that due to the west north westward movement of a low pressure area, a gradual reduction in rain activity is expected. In the 24 hours till 8.30am on Saturday, the weather bureau’s Colaba observatory recorded 13.2 mm and Santacruz 5.9 mm of rainfall. But rainfall in the interiors was much higher: Karjat recorded 134 mm, and the hill station of Mahabaleshwar 321 mm. Matheran, another hill station, recorded 81 mm. The total rainfall recorded so far at Colaba and Santacruz are 1488.4 mm and 2026.7 mm, which are 379.8 mm and 877.3 mm above normal, respectively. Throughout Saturday, light rain was recorded across the city and the suburbs. The IMD said that on Sunday, light to moderate rain and thundershowers is expected in Mumbai, with the possibility of occasional intense spells. The currently prevailing weather systems that are giving Mumbai these showers include a trough which runs from the cyclonic circulation associated with the low pressure area to the north Gujarat region across Madhya Pradesh, a well marked low pressure area over Jharkhand and adjoining areas of north Chhattisgarh and Odisha, which now lies as a low pressure area over Jharkhand and adjoining north Chhattisgarh, with an associated cyclonic circulation and an offshore trough at mean sea level, which now runs from the Karnataka coast to the Kerala coast. “Due to the west-northwestward movement of the low pressure area, a gradual reduction in rainfall activity is expected over Maharashtra during the next four to five,” said IMD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-drier-days-ahead-after-fortnight-of-intense-rainfall/articleshow/84719468.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Lucknow||VIP aims to unite Nishads on Phoolan Devi’s Shahaadat Diwas ahead of UP elections||LUCKNOW: The Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) will observe Shahaadat Diwas of former MP Phoolan Devi on July 25, Sunday, the day the ‘bandit queen’ was shot outside her residence in Delhi in 2001. VIP president and Bihar minister Mukesh Sahni said, “The UP government does not want us to go ahead with the programme. In Bihar, we are facing no resistance. But we will hold the programme we have planned for the day in UP also.” Sahni will arrive in Varanasi on Sunday to join the event. The party had planned to install 18-foot statues of Phoolan Devi at 18 divisional headquarters in UP to mark the day. Police took possession of the statues at two places on Friday and is on guard at others. “Statues would be installed, if not now, then when we come to power in UP. We will buy land to install the statues,” said Sahni. The party plans to install statues of Phoolan in all districts in phases. The party had planned to launch its electoral campaign for 2022 UP assembly elections on Shahaadat Diwas after it recently opened its office in Lucknow and appointed Choudhary Lautanram Nishad as state president. “In Bihar, we are with BJP and that is the reason we are facing no problem,” said Sahni, adding the party plans to go alone in UP assembly elections. The Sarvadaliya Nishad-Kashyap Union, a group of several social and political outfits centred around Nishads had started a march in the state since July 11 demanding reservation for Nishads and is supported by VIP. Shahaadat Diwas of Phoolan Devi is not only observed by Nishad-centric political outfits in UP but also other parties, including Samajwadi Party that fielded her from Mirzapur in 1996. By installing statues of Phoolan, VIP aims to consolidate Nishads by celebrating her struggle she faced being a Nishad and rise she attained despite all oddities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vip-aims-to-unite-nishads-on-phoolans-shahaadat-diwas-ahead-of-up-elections/articleshow/84719438.cms||Neha Shukla

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Crop damage due to heavy rains Rs 1,000 crore, say farmers||HYDERABAD: The torrential rains that caused floods in many parts of the state in the last four days have washed away cotton, maize and other crops. Over 470 mandals in the districts had received excess rainfall. Farmers’ associations said the crop damage could be Rs 1,000 crore in over a lakh acres. With the Met department predicting more rains, farmers are worried that their crops would be washed away in the intiail stages itself and that they may have to go for sowing operations once again. “The state government should compensate the farmers for the losses and also make arrangements for distribution of seeds. Crops in more than one lakh acres had been damaged. At many places, even the fertile soil was washed away and sand patches have formed in agricultural fields,” said Sarampalli Malla Reddy, vice-president of All India Kisan Sabha. He alleged that the state government has not been paying compensation for crop damages to the farmers in the last few years. “The state government cannot wash its hands of by distributing Rythu Bandhu money alone to the farmers,” he said. All India Kisan Congress state president Anvesh Reddy said the agriculture sector was the worst hit due to continuous heavy rains. The unseasonal heavy rains and floods had caused Rs 12,000 crore crop loss last year but the government did not pay compensation to the farmers. “The state government is not paying its share under the Prime Minister Fasal Bima Yojana due to which the Centre is not releasing compensation or relief towards losses caused due to natural calamities,” he alleged. However, officials of the agriculture department said heavy rains were not uncommon for Telangana in July, August and September. The extent of damage may not be much as the farmers were in the initial stages of sowing operations. “It will take a week to 10 days for assessment of damage, if any, caused to crops due to rans. Once the flood water recedes, the sprouts and soil get rejuvenated,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/crop-damage-due-to-heavy-rains-rs-1k-cr-say-farmers/articleshow/84717559.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Military doctors achieve a rare medical feat, salvage child’s eye||LUCKNOW: Celebrating the first birthday of their son, a couple of Baghpat district was busy capturing happy moments on their smartphones. But one of the images caught the attention of the kid's mother as it captured the reflection of her son’s eye which glowed white following camera flash. After extensive medical investigation it was found that the minor had retinoblastoma—a type of eye cancer in children. The kid lost his left eye and there was danger of losing the right one too. But a team of doctors, led by UP ophthalmologist of colonel rank, salvaged the boy’s eye by conducting the military's first successful plaque brachytherapy. The feat was achieved on July 9 and army hospital research and referral (AHRR) Delhi became the second government hospital to gain expertise in plaque brachytherapy. Identified as Arav Tomar, the four-year-old has now normal vision. Team was led by Col Sanjay Mishra, a Mau district lad and country's youngest and highest decorated medical officer with four sena medals. He is the HOD of ophthalmology AHRR and his team comprised ocular oncologist Lt Col Sonali Vinay Kumar, Lt Col Ashok Kumar, HOD radiation oncology unit and scientist Dr Manoj K Semwal. For the operation, the army procured Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC) indigenous developed Ruthenium 106 plaque for the medical procedure. Speaking to TOI, Lt Col Sonali Vinay Kumar, who conducted the operation, said, “Last year we got nearly 18 referrals of retinoblastoma cases from across the country and in majority of the cases, the cancer was in the last stage or beyond help. In Arav's case, the left eye had to be enucleated as the tumour was spreading towards brain—risking his life. But we managed to save his right eye by adopting plaque brachytherapy.” “The plaque brachytherapy is a form of local radiation exposure therapy targeting only the affected area in the retina, and provides focused treatment of eye cancer without damaging the surrounding normal structure. This is one of the safest treatments for retinoblastoma,” said the officer, who has been a specialist in the field for 11 years. She hails from Pune. Colonel Sanjay Mishra said, “In Arav’s case multiple courses of chemotherapy and cryotherapy had failed to correct the disorder as the cancer was recurring. Our team at AHRR contacted BARC and acquired indigenous developed Ruthenium plaque. Each plaque costs around Rs 60,000 but it’s cheaper than chemotherapy.” “Last week our team, especially Lt Col Sonali Vinay Kumar, who has done her specialization in plaque brachytherapy from LV Prasad eye hospital, Hyderabad, created history by conducting military's first plaque brachytherapy. Now AHRR is the second government medical facility in the country to achieve this landmark,” he added. Meanwhile, Aarav’s mother Sonika Chaudhary who herself is a nursing officer in a private hospital praised the efforts of military doctors for saving her son’s life and eye. “After three years my son has clear vision and all thanks to military doctors,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/military-doctors-achieve-a-rare-medical-feat-salvage-childs-eye/articleshow/84719482.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Lucknow||Lack of credible OBC face may hit BSP’s social engineering plan||Lucknow: While the BSP’s eye-catching sammelans to woo Brahmins as part of its social engineering programme hog the limelight, the party is also silently working on the ground to reach out to another crucial segment of voters in UP – the other backward classes (OBCs). However, for a party that has lost many senior backward leaders over years, the exercise may be too little, too late, especially as the party lacks a popular OBC face and there are just six months for assembly polls, experts said. A senior party member said the same problem could be repeated with Muslims, and with negligible representation of backward Muslims in the party, BSP will have to compete with other parties for their support. In November, Mayawati had appointed Bhim Rajbhar as the party’s state chief, replacing former Rajya Sabha member Munquad Ali. He himself had replaced another OBC, RS Kushwaha, in 2019. Party sources said the decision was driven by the BSP’s focus on upper castes and OBCs for the 2022 polls. However, Rajbhar’s popularity is restricted among his own community and the expulsion of former state president Ram Achal Rajbhar in June might create a conflict, sources added. “The party has activated ‘bhaichara’ committees in all blocks and sectors which have one member each from the Dalit community, OBC, Muslims etc. These are working within the community quietly, and garnering support of most backward castes (MBCs) like Kahar, Kashyap, Bind, Nishad, Pal etc. Like Kurmis, their numbers are quite high. However, unlike Kurmis, concentrated in limited areas, MBCs are spread across districts,” a senior leader said. Party workers acknowledge that the absence of a unifying OBC face and lack of representation to backward Muslims like Ansaris is a concern. “The concern is valid, given as there is little time left for elections. Representation of backward Muslims is not a problem just with the BSP but with other parties too, including the SP. Ajlafs and Pasmandas, for instance, will not be seen in a leadership role in any of these parties. Of course, BSP will try its best but elections are too close for any major game-changer,” social historian and Dalit expert Badri Narayan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lack-of-credible-obc-face-may-hit-bsps-social-engineering-plan/articleshow/84719504.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Chandigarh||Panchkula municipal corporation to take over paid parking lots||PANCHKULA: The Municipal Corporation (MC) plans to take over paid parking in Sectors 8, 9 and 10. Revenue from these parking lots has been going to the District Child Welfare Council for the last two years. In the first meeting of the Revenue Relation Committee, mayor Kulbhushan Goyal expressed displeasure at non-recovery of the Corporation’s income from various sources by municipal officials. For the last three years, Goyal said, three big parking lots of the MC have been given to the District Child Welfare Council. By bringing these under the ambit of the Corporation, revenue should also be used by the Corporation, he said, directing officials to take action in this regard. The mayor said targets fixed had to be accomplished to make funds available for development works. He pointed out that property tax worth crores was pending in the city but only Rs 10 crore to Rs 11 crore had been collected against a target of Rs 30 crore. The mayor said notices had been given to those who were not paying property tax and the sealing process should be started after hearing them out once. Despite having resources like license fees and advertisement fees, which could strengthen the MC financially, no effort had been made to increase revenue over the last several years, said Goyal. Other issues that were discussed included house tax, mobile towers, mobile lines, WiFi, wires of Reliance, Airtel and other companies, property tax of Shalimar mall, advertising policy, maintenance of community centres and income from them, road cuts fee, CNG etc. He said that cable operators had laid a network of wires in the city, but no fee had been deposited with the Corporation. Councillor Jai Kaushik, a member of the committee, said that no mobile tower company had taken permission to lay down poles and wires all over the city. Kaushik said that security of companies that did not fill the pits properly should be confiscated. Councillor Suresh Verma suggested that committee members cut the connection of mobile towers which had not paid fees to the MC while councillor Sonia Sood demanded development of the evening and night food market to enhance the MC’s income.

Though this facility was available earlier as well, the person conducting the search had to visit different departments to collect the information. A KMC official on Saturday admitted the earlier process was cumbersome and that the new facility would considerably ease transactions in properties. Sources in the KMC said a feedback was sought from several civic departments, such as survey, assessment, building, water supply and sewerage and drainage, before launch of the facility. “The data from these departments was essential before we could officially launch the facility and offer it to the public,” said a KMC official. Municipal commissioner Binod Kumar said the facility would lead to ease of doing business in the city. “We want to ensure that no citizen is unnecessarily harassed. Helping citizens obtain encumbrance certificates without hassle is the essence of this civic scheme,” the commissioner said. Queries can be made on unpaid property tax amount with break, unpaid tax on account of water supply and drainage, pending case in the tribunal and pending licence fee amount. The Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India, an umbrella body of builders, as well as real estate consultants who deal in sale of properties have welcomed the move and said it would go a long way in enhancing ease of business. At present, a prospective buyer of a house or a developer intending to buy a property has to conduct searches in various KMC departments, including property tax, water and sewage to know the outstanding amounts. “It usually takes at least a week to 10 days to get the search results from each department. If the KMC brings in a single-window system, it will save time and effort,” said Credai Bengal president Nandu Belani. Arrears are required to be cleared before a building plan can be submitted for sanction. Realtors also said it would particularly help individual buyers of properties as they would otherwise not know which departments to approach and who to pursue to get the requisite information. “This is a very progressive decision,” said Biplab Kumar of NK Realtors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-launches-single-window-search-system-for-property-arrears-info/articleshow/84715770.cms||Saikat Ray

---||Kolkata||New plant to boost water supply to north Howrah||HOWRAH: The Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) has taken up construction of a water treatment plant in Howrah that will benefit around 4.5 lakh people within the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) jurisdiction. The Rs 75-crore proposed 29 million gallon per day (MGD) water treatment plant will come up in the Golabari area and go a long way in solving the acute water crisis in large areas of north Howrah. This is the second major water supply scheme planned for Howrah after the Padmapukur plant, which was constructed 36 years ago. Residents of large areas of north Howrah such as Fakirbagan, Dharmatolla Road, Pilkhana, Salkia, Nanda Ghosh Lane and Bandhaghat have been hit by a severe water crisis following large-scale construction of highrises in the belt. According to a HMC engineering department official, Padmapukur water treatment plant hardly meets the water demands of north Howrah as there is no adequate water pressure in the entire belt as the existing plant is 10km away. Water shortage in some north Howrah areas is so acute that it compels locals to buy water regularly. Golabari resident and a BJP leader Umesh Rai welcomed the state government’s initiative to set up a water treatment plant to mitigate water crisis in north Howrah. “We have been demanding the augmentation of potable water for the past 10 years. Finally, it’s happening. We will happily wait for its inauguration,” Rai said. HMC board of administrators chairman Arup Roy on Saturday said the joint inspection of the proposed plant site was done by KMDA and HMC engineers. “We hope to start the construction by October and complete it in 18 months,” Roy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-plant-to-boost-water-supply-to-north-howrah/articleshow/84715797.cms||Rupak Banerjee

These details were revealed by Ashish Vashisth, the director of Delphia labs, one of the accused in the case, who was arrested by the SIT on Thursday. The head of the SIT, Rakesh Rawat, told TOI, “Max Corporate Services and Delphia laboratories were the mastermind of this scam. Ashish Vashisth was executing the plan and giving all information to Mallika and Sharat Pant, founder-directors of Max Corporate Services. They managed to involve Nalwa laboratories in the plan and also prepared bills to clear the amount from the mela administration.” The SIT also claimed that most of the numbers submitted by Max Corporate Services on testing bills were fake. According to the SIT, neither Max Corporate Services nor Delphia laboratories were authorized by the Indian Council of Medical Research to conduct Covid tests during Kumbh mela. So, they roped in Nalwa Laboratories, Hisar Haryana and Dr Lalchandani lab, Delhi to get the contract for conducting Covid tests during the Kumbh. They hired untrained workers and uploaded fake test reports on the ICMR portal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/fake-covid-tests-at-kumbh-a-well-planned-conspiracy-sit/articleshow/84714320.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Lucknow||Our social behaviour will decide the shape of Covid-19 third wave||After grappling with the devastating second wave of Covid-19, the Indian subcontinent is finally breathing easy with a downward trend of new infections. As we ease the restrictions, our minds are filled with all types of questions related to new variants, possibilities of third wave and most importantly, if the worst is yet to come. Taking a cue from a famous quote by the great scientist Louis Pasteur , ‘chance favours only the prepared mind’, we need to be well-prepared to face the worst-case scenario. With the right approach and preparedness, we can douse the next wave and achieve herd immunity without inflicting many wounds. To achieve that we have to follow science and listen to our experts. We need to look at the data coming from other countries, as it will tell us a lot about the nature and severity of a possible third wave. One obvious fact that has emerged from the recent trends across the globe is that vaccines work. In fact, they work pretty well even against all the existing variants. Barring some recent sporadic outbreaks, Israel is standing tall among all the nations and has managed the subsequent waves very effectively by rapidly vaccinating the adult population. The mighty US, which fared quite poorly in managing the first and second waves, ramped up its vaccination programme and currently seems to be gaining the pre-Covid era normalcy, with more than 60% of the adult population vaccinated with at least one dose. The United Kingdom and Canada have also fared well in implementing their vaccination programme, subsequently managing the next wave. We are a country of 1.3 billion and achieving herd immunity through vaccination is a long road. Lately though our vaccination drive has picked up and we are vaccinating an average 5 million doses each day from the day the government started its ambitious free vaccination programme on June 21. With this rate, the government aims to immunize the entire adult population by December 31, 2021. This leaves us with a few more months to keep the infection in control and avoid resurgence of any new variant of concern. The recently notified variant of concern, Delta plus, has emerged as a major concern for the next few months. The government and health agencies have taken all precautions this time and declared it a variant of concern at a very early stage and instructed the state governments to take all measures to control the spread of this variant. Until we achieve immunization, we must, as citizens, understand our responsibilities too. The one thing that this pandemic has taught us is that we must not let our guard down. Our reckless behaviour may force the governments to put strict restrictions, further debilitating our economy and causing bigger problems of unemployment and poverty. We must contribute in this process by following strict mask mandates, social distancing and avoiding public gathering for next few months. The damage caused by second wave in rural areas is yet to be revealed completely. Another wave in our villages could create catastrophe. Rural health workers have dual responsibility. First, they need to be vigilant and teach the people about Covid-19 related norms and the importance of observing symptoms regularly and reporting them at an early stage before spreading it to the community. Secondly, they have a bigger responsibility to break the chain of misinformation and work on the vaccine hesitancy of the rural population. We must encourage people in our surroundings to take the vaccine at the earliest possible date and ensure the security of their lives and the lives of their loved ones. Governments—both state and Centre—are doing their part with all precautions and speed. We need to supplement it by getting our act together as a disciplined citizen to defeat a perceived third wave and to avoid economic hardships due to inevitable lockdown.

Besides, SS Sandhu, the chief secretary of Uttarakhand, has also sought a report from the education department in this regard. These universities — 12 in Haridwar and the remaining in Dehradun — affiliated to the Sri Dev Suman University (SDSU) allegedly flouted norms by giving admissions to a total of 700 more students than the permissible limit. The issue came to light after SDSU officials found irregularities in the exam documents. The varsity officials have claimed that the private educational institutions carried out the ‘scam’ in connivance with each other and were conducting the exams of these ‘extra’ students without keeping the state university in the loop. A majority of these students are in the first year of undergraduate courses like BA, BCom and BSc. The results of these 700 students have been held by SDSU for the time being. The SDSU administration has said that if the private universities under the lens are found guilty of any wrongdoing, their affiliations will likely be cancelled. A total of 112 colleges/private universities in the state are affiliated with state-run Sri Dev Suman University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/probe-ordered-into-pvt-varsities-taking-more-admissions-than-permitted/articleshow/84714325.cms||Mohammad Anab

He could pull out his wife and son by following their screams, but his daughters, aged 5 and 6, could not be saved. Sutur, his four-year-old son Sarthak and nine others injured in landslides in Taliye in Mahad and Poladpur in Raigad district, were brought to JJ Hospital, Byculla, for treatment. Six to eight of them have fractures, while the condition of the others is being evaluated. Those traumatised will be counselled, hospital authorities said. Eight were brought on Friday and three on Saturday from Taliye and Poladpur. Raigad, the worst affected, reported 60 deaths in three landslides, including the worst at Taliye village that claimed 49 lives. Sutur said he cannot believe he lost Sanskruti (5) and Sidhi (6) in a span of minutes. “Around 8.30pm, we sat down for dinner when a pile of mud and stones entered our homes. There were screams everywhere. I came out alive and stood on my feet. I could hear my wife and son scream for help. I followed their voice and pulled them out, but I could not find my daughters. I kept calling their names,” the father said. The girls’ bodies were found two hours later. He said locals worked all night to look for survivors as rain battered the region. It had been raining for four days before the landslides struck several villages in Raigad. Sutur said they lived in a pucca house and never imagined this could occur. Born and brought up in Sakhar Sutarwadi, Sutur, a construction labourer, said their house withstood many monsoons. He sustained blunt trauma and abrasions but no fractures. His son has not suffered serious injuries. Sutur said his wife was being treated at a hospital in Raigad. “Most have suffered bone, leg and hand fractures. Overall, all are stable,” said Dr Sanjay Surase, medical superintendent of JJ.

An offence regarding the incident was registered after a video of the episode went viral on social media. Eight people were arrested in connection with the offence. The incident took place at the Bhuvero village of the Dhanpur taluka. This is the third incident of its kind to take place in the district in July and the second one in Dhanpur. The video shows a group surrounding two teenage girls and shouting at them. Some members of the group also beat up the two girls and manhandled them. Dhanpur police reached out to the mother of one of the girls who was badly beaten up and registered a complaint after the video went viral. The mother of the 13-year-old girl revealed that the incident took place on June 25. The girl’s paternal uncle and her brother took her out of the house. They were furious as the girl had been speaking to someone using a boy’s mobile phone. The uncle’s daughter was allegedly facilitating this. Around 15 persons that largely comprised of close relatives of the two girls surrounded them even as the girl’s uncle and others reprimanded. Her brother also even manhandled them. Dhanpur police sub-inspector B M Patel said that eight accused were arrested in connection with the offence. He said that some time back too the girl had been spotted speaking to someone over a phone and had been reprimanded. Patel said that the girl had been counselled and the remaining accused would be arrested. Earlier, a video of a woman being forced to carry her husband on her shoulder in Khajuri village in Dhanpur taluka had gone viral. It had come to light that this was done after beating her up as she had eloped with her paramour. More recently, a woman and her paramour were beaten up and partly tonsured in the Uchwan village of Devgadh Baria taluka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/two-minor-girls-become-victim-of-mob-justice-in-dahod/articleshow/84715842.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Shot in the arm for tourism: Madhya Pradesh's Khajuraho in 100% vaccination club||BHOPAL: A shot of hope for tourism in Khajuraho. The temple town, which draws thousands of foreigners every year, is now 100% vaccinated. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced this on Saturday, and said that people of the state have played a vigilant role in the vaccination campaign launched to make Madhya Pradesh a Covid-free state. “In many gram panchayats and urban bodies, an example has been set by completing cent-per-cent vaccination. In the same sequence, Khajuraho has also come under the category of 100% vaccination due to the awareness shown by the people in the world famous tourist city,” the CM said, lauding Khajuraho residents, the district administration, vaccination teams, social workers and Corona volunteers. The pandemic has brought tourism – Khajuraho’s main revenue source – to its knees. In the last 16 months, there has been a massive drop in footfall at the Unesco world heritage site, plunging the hotel and tourism industry into a deep crisis. Hundreds of jobs were lost. There was 60% to 70 % retrenchment of staff in hotels. Tour guides ran out of their meagre savings. Some hotels began to host destination weddings with big discounts to make the best of the unlocking after the second wave, but it was far from enough. News of 100% vaccination will bring cheer to the city and those linked to the tourism industry. The district administration held an event to honour vaccination teams after the achievement. So far, about 2.77 crore people have been vaccinated in the state, said Chouhan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/shot-in-the-arm-for-tourism-khajuraho-in-100-vac-club/articleshow/84719576.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Speculation rife over CM Ashok Gehlot cabinet reshuffle next week||JAIPUR: There is intense speculation of cabinet reshuffle next week. AICC general secretary (organisation) K C Venugopal and general secretary in-charge of Rajasthan Ajay Maken met chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday night to give final touches to the rejig, appointment of district presidents of the party and other political appointments. PCC president Govind Singh Dotasra was also present in the meeting. MLAs and PCC members will greet Venugopal and Maken at the PCC office on Sunday at 10.30am. Congress leader Sachin Pilot had met both the leaders during his Delhi visit a few days ago and pressed for expediting the process. A couple of days ago, Pilot had indicated that the Congress leadership would take suitable steps soon to address issues raised by him. “Punjab crisis has been a lesson for the Congress. It allowed the crisis to pester and blown on its face before the elections. Now, the crisis has been resolved with the appointment of Navjot Singh Sidhu as PCC president. The Congress leadership wanted to set its house in order in Rajasthan to avoid a repeat of Punjab in Rajasthan,” sources indicated. According to sources, the committee comprising Venugopal and Maken had finalised the list of probable names for inclusion in the ministry and will meet the chief minister with the names for his consensus. The committee was constituted after last year’s political crisis in the state triggered by the revolt of Pilot to look in to his grievances and political accommodation of the MLAs and leaders loyal to him in government and party. According to sources, since the chief minister was advised to avoid travel by doctors due to health reasons, the Congress president sent Venugopal to Jaipur give final touches to the cabinet reshuffle which was pending for a long time. At present, there are nine vacancies in the council of ministers. The party may appoint some parliamentary secretaries as well to accommodate the Independents supporting the government and the former BSP MLAs merged with Congress. The dispute was mainly on the names from the Pilot group as Gehlot refused to recognise such a faction and was wooing MLAs from the Pilot group towards him. But Pilot has been insisting on inclusion of at least four MLAs from his group as was the strength earlier. Pilot and two of his supporters were sacked from the ministry while transport minister Pratap Singh Kachariyawas, considered from his camp switched side to the chief minister’ camp. Thus, Pilot faction had four ministers including himself in the ministry earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/speculation-rife-over-gehlot-cabinet-reshuffle-next-week/articleshow/84719579.cms||Joychen Joseph

Two persons, Thanripaw Rangmai from Assam and his accomplice, Pradeep Nehwal from Doon, have been arrested. Police said that after gaining access to a system, the duo would install hacking softwares bought from the dark web, that breached even high-security safety walls. The accused had created fake toll-free numbers and used a fake name “Victor” to interact with potential victims. They charged anywhere between 200 to 400 US dollars from US citizens for software support and accepted payment in Google gift cards and stored the money in multiple bank accounts. Police recovered eight laptops, several gadgets and luxury cars like BMW and Land Cruiser worth Rs 80 lakh from their possession. The STF had been tracking the use of softwares and electronic tools for the past several days, which is how the team detected the call centre in Preeti Enclave, Shimla Bypass. Rangmai, the mastermind, had come to Dehradun in 2015 and worked at a call centre here for some time where he learnt about sharing screens of other users to install softwares. Later, he started his own company in Jakhan. In the last six months, the STF has busted five such call centres and arrested over 16 fraudsters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/call-centre-that-hacked-systems-by-pretending-to-offer-tech-support-busted-in-doon/articleshow/84714414.cms||Abhijeet Singh

---||Dehradun||57% posts of specialist doctors vacant in Uttarakhand; Tehri worst affected||Dehradun: In yet another example of threadbare health infrastructure in Uttarakhand, an RTI reply has revealed that 57% of the sanctioned posts for specialist doctors, including surgeons and gynaecologists, are lying vacant in the hill state. Of the 1,147 sanctioned posts for specialist doctors in Uttarakhand, 654 have not been filled, according to the state health department's response to an RTI query by Dehradun-based Social Development for Communities (SDC) Foundation, a social organisation tracking the pandemic scenario in the state. The data — updated till April 30 — excludes AIIMS Rishikesh as it doesn’t come under the purview of the state health department. According to the state health department, Tehri Garhwal, with only 13% of the sanctioned posts filled, is the worst-hit of all 13 districts. Out of the sanctioned 98 posts of specialist doctors, only 13 posts are filled in the hill district. The data adds that there are just two gynecologists in Tehri Garhwal, which has a population of more than 5 lakh. Also, crucial positions of surgeons, forensic experts, dermatologists, microbiologists, and psychiatric specialists are vacant. When asked about the large number of vacant posts, Dr Sanjay Jain, chief medical officer of Tehri Garhwal, told TOI, “The district hospital and two of our community health centres (in Devprayag and Belashwar) are running under the PPP mode. All posts of specialist doctors are filled in these facilities. The scenario has improved in the district after the management of medical facilities were handed over to private players.” After Tehri Garhwal, Chamoli and Pauri Garhwal have the highest percentage of vacant posts for specialist doctors. Only 27% of the sanctioned posts are filled in Chamoli, followed by 28% filled vacant posts in Pauri Garhwal. “The number of vacant posts in the state is alarming, especially when a pandemic is ongoing. I urge the state government to fill the vacancies at the earliest possible. Shortage of specialist doctors will impact our fight against the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Anoop Nautiyal, SDC founder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/57-posts-of-specialist-doctors-vacant-in-uttarakhand-tehri-worst-affected/articleshow/84714427.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Jaipur||NREGA: Labourers can demand work for whole year||JAIPUR: The rural development department has drafted a new format for ‘Form 6’ - an application form required to enroll oneself for MGNREGA work. As per the new format, a worker under the scheme will be able to demand for work for the whole year (100 days) altogether, instead of for 15 days or a month. Each Form-6 is applicable for the whole family under the scheme. Krishna Kant Pathak, secretary, rural development department said, “This will be an option for them. It will not be mandatory. There are two benefits of this: first, we will know in advance how many workers will be available for work each month and accordingly we can plan our work. Second, they will not be dependent on mates and sarpanchs to raise a demand for work. We will run a campaign across the state to create awareness among workers about the new format of Form-6. We can start this initiative in a full-fledged manner by September.” “Eight fortnights account for 100 days of work. If a family wants to demand work for 100 days altogether, they will have to tick eight fortnights on the application form (Form-6). Once they do it, the demand for work for 100 days will be made. If they wish to demand work for all the members of the family, they will have to mention the names of the members,” said Arvind Saxena, superintendent engineer, MGNREGA. “They can either demand work for eight fortnights uninterrupted or they can also take a break in the middle. As there are two fortnights in a month, they can tick on the month in which they would like to demand for work. All the months (from April to March) and fortnights are mentioned on Form-6. In the current situation, they mention the time period (for eg: June 1 to June 15) during which they wish to work,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nrega-labourers-can-demand-work-for-whole-yr/articleshow/84719642.cms||Sidhartha Dutta

Of ICSE (for class X) students, 99.96% passed and of ISC (for class XII) students, 99.85% passed. In ICSE, boys outperformed girls, registering a pass percentage of 99.97%, against girls’ 99.94%. Girls outshined boys in ISC, scoring a pass percentage of 99.96%, against boys’ 99.75%. The Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) results were declared for students all over the country on Saturday. A total of 7,234 students from 105 schools of Uttarakhand (52.9% boys and 47.1% girls) applied for ICSE (Indian Certificate for Secondary Education) assessment, while 5,164 students from 93 schools (53.2% boys and 46.8% girls) applied for ISC (Indian School Certificate) assessment. A total of 266 Scheduled Caste (SC) candidates, 80 Scheduled Tribe (ST) candidates and 644 Other Backward Castes (OBC) candidates took the ICSE assessments. All of them passed. As for ISC, all 151 SC candidates and 326 OBC candidates who took the assessment passed. However, one of the 66 ST candidates appearing for ISC did not pass, taking the pass percentage to 98.48%. In ICSE, three students from Uttarakhand (one boy and two girls) did not clear the assessment. In ISC, eight students (seven boys and one girl) were unsuccessful. This year, students will get only marks, no marksheets, as they could not appear for Board exams and have been marked on an alternative assessment. Riddhi S, a class XII student of Convent of Jesus and Mary School in Dehradun, said, “We have been marked based on an assessment system and not the usual Board exams, so we are somewhat uncertain about college admissions. Most students are now banking on college entrance tests to get admissions. Some universities like Delhi University announce cut-offs. I believe they should tweak this a little this year based on the new normal. We believe the percentage we have received is lower than what we could have gotten had we taken the exams.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/boys-outperform-girls-in-icse-girls-score-better-in-isc-in-uttarakhand/articleshow/84714463.cms||Mohammad Anab

---||Dehradun||U’khand plans to fell 25k trees for constructing a research college near elephant reserve||Dehradun: The Uttarakhand government is planning to fell 25,000 trees for the construction of a Science research college in the biodiversity-rich Balawala area of the Raipur forest range under the Mussoorie forest division. The officials have already identified a 103-acre land in the forest for the construction of the campus of the institute, which is to be developed on the lines of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER). The state education department, according to TOI sources, has even sent a proposal to the Union government regarding the construction of the college. A senior official of the education department, requesting anonymity, told TOI, “A proposal has been sent to Centre. The idea is to have an IISER-level college as Uttarakhand needs a Science research college.” However, the proposal to fell trees has drawn flak from activists as it will not just deplete green cover but also destroy the natural habitats of several animals like elephants, leopards, deer, snakes, avian species, rabbits, and innumerable small creatures. The dense Balawala forest is rich in sal, amla, and teak trees. Besides, the Song river flowing through the forest makes for a robust forest ecosystem in the area. Further, the forest is close to Shivalik Elephant Reserve and thus, is often frequented by elephants. In fact, the state government, on November 8, 2020, had inaugurated a three-km-long solar power fencing to stop the movement of elephants from Balawala forest to agriculture fields and nearby human settlements. Rakesh Negi, range officer of the Balawala forest, said, “According to our estimate, the 103-acre area has around 20,000-25,000 trees. We have already counted about 5,000 trees. The process of tree estimation is ongoing, although at a slow pace due to the monsoon season.” Meanwhile, an IFS official told TOI that the state government is planning to acquire forest land for the institute campus as it is cost-effective. “Acquiring land from people requires a heavy amount of money. On the other hand, the government just has to pay the net present value while acquiring the forest land,” said the official. Kahkashan Naseem, divisional forest officer of the Mussoorie forest division, under whose jurisdiction the identified 103-acre land falls, said, “The project will take off only after multiple levels of clearances.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-plans-to-fell-25k-trees-for-constructing-a-research-college-near-elephant-reserve/articleshow/84714462.cms||Shivani Azad

Two hours after the jeweller was rescued, police were stunned to know that the four arrested persons included the woman who has been continuously harassed and raped by the accused jeweller. On Saturday, police have taken the accused in police remand along with the four persons, including two women for his kidnapping and assault. Police was in tizzy when Sita Devi (32), wife of the jeweller identified as Kamlesh Soni, informed police that some unknown assailants kidnapped her husband. “We started barricading and checking every vehicle since it was known that the assailants were in a jeep. Finally, after two hours, we managed to rescue the jeweller from the roadside who was injured. After technical surveillance and local inputs, we managed to arrest four persons on Friday and one person on Saturday for the kidnap and assault of the jeweller,” said Sanjay Sharma, station house officer, Singhana police station. “Soni had taken the mobile number of a woman one year ago while the latter had come as a customer to his shop. He raped the woman and made video of the act. Soni has been blackmailing the woman for more than one year. Thus, in order to teach him a lesson, she planned his kidnap to thrash him badly and to recover the video,” Sharma added. Woman after getting arrested with four others too has lodged a case of blackmailing and rape. “Based on her FIR, we have arrested the accused on the charges of rape. The rape survivor was also arrested for kidnapping Soni,” he added. Police were also interrogating the jeweller to retrieve the video footage he had of the rape through which he was blackmailing the woman. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rape-survivor-kidnaps-jeweller-both-arrested/articleshow/84719664.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||As the world looks for idyllic urbanism, Chandigarh needs to catch up||As the post-pandemic world opens up, the big city romance is cooling off. Mega cities of the world are undergoing major reconfigurations. During the pandemic, many living in astronomically expensive, tiny apartments of New York moved to large leafy suburbs offering better quality of life, working from home by virtual mode. With Covid in decline, many offices are now switching over to mixed models of physical-cum-virtual work modes. The day of the dense, expensive city as the great ‘engine of growth’ populated by a talent pool living in close proximity is clearly over. Many key European cities have decided to make their cities compact, green and walkable in the future. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo has plans to build 870 miles of cycling lanes this year.  What’s happening in Manhattan, London and Paris today, is bound to percolate to our own Gurugram, Pune, Bengaluru and Delhi too. Ironically, Chandigarh that was conceived as a city built to human scale with pedestrian and cycle paths, turned to marauding automobiles gobbling up maximum road space, elbowing out the lowly cycle wallah ! The city was planned by visionary Swiss-French planner and architect Le Corbusier. His Capitol Complex, recognised by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, is rated the world over as one of the greatest architectural ensembles of the 20th century. But has the city done enough to promote this globally famous marvel? Yes, tremendous restoration work of the Capitol Complex was undertaken during the run-up to the UNESCO nomination in 2015 and efforts are on to complete some unfinished monuments. Still, a lot needs to be done to make it more attractive and accessible to the visitor. Many of Corbusier’s visionary ideas, art, enigmas and symbolism need to be explained to the uninitiated and everyday users of these buildings through conducted tours and lectures. Only then will they value it in their hearts to become its future custodians. If we want to maximise the huge pool of architects, planners, art lovers and urbanists the world over to come and visit the city, we will have to create synergy between combined assets of architectural interest. The city not only has Corbusier’s Capitol Complex, but also the government museum, schools of art and architecture and the lake club buildings designed by him. Even the Sector 17 City Centre was planned by Corbusier. The marvellous government housing in Sectors 22 and 7 and numerous public, civic buildings designed by Corbusier’s associates Pierre Jeanneret, Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew along with Indian colleagues are also a huge draw. Come autumn and I would be swamped with requests for help from various architects the world over, planning visits to Chandigarh to study or as personal pilgrimages to the hallowed ‘Le Corbusier Land’ –his greatest realisation. Wary of the Indian bureaucracy, they would be most anxious about permissions to visit the Capitol Complex and other works by him! If we have to fully realise this great potential, then dedicated architectural tourism packages have to be created for guided tours. Besides iconic Corbusean buildings, three excellent architectural museums and a world famous art museum exist in the city, hardly known even to residents. Why such apathy? Do we not publicise them enough? Is there a lack of digital and published information material or are our websites dull, boring, static and uninviting? The city should promote walking/cycling heritage tours besides the usual hop-on hop-off bus tours. The small spread of the city’s geography makes it ideal for compact walking tours. Any curious mind living in any part of the country, when offered an assuring ‘hand-holding’ experience by dynamic tourism facilities will be drawn to the city with its other attractions like the Sukhna Lake, Rock Garden and unique gardens. If we can package Chandigarh as a living model of responsible urbanism -- combining modernism with sustainable green city values: promoting pedestrian/cycling as the preferred transport mode, safeguarding environment using renewable energy and endowed with clean air –it can become the envy of the world! There are a number of untapped areas of growth for tourism. The recently vacated Press Building—the first public building to come up in the city-- designed by Maxwell Fry, Corbusier’s associate can become a hub of numerous mini-museums showcasing Chandigarh’s heritage furniture and other artefacts like manhole covers, tapestries and concrete lights etc. These will draw people to look at Chandigarh beyond architecture as a design/innovation hub too. Chandigarh, with its unique heritage of planned tree plantation, can be showcased through a digital ‘Tree Interpretation Centre,’ also located in the building. Similarly, with concentration of institutions of higher learning in the city and its emergence as a knowledge hub, the scientific curiosity of its youth needs to be nurtured by adding a mini-planetarium. Often, during major astronomical events/occurrences or sighting in the night sky, city’s astronomy clubs set up telescopes on the lake embankment, offering free sightings and guidance to the celestial wonders for passers-by. The vast expanse of the sky vault over the lake with no city lights to disturb, offers an idyllic place for such observations. Similarly, a Museum of Design or Modern Art will be in keeping with the city’s ethos of modernity, innovation and experimental ethos. It is not enough to just build museums and then treat them like sarkari sanghralays dumping grounds for displays with poor maintenance. Unfortunately, a lot needs to be done for the city’s three pivotal architectural museums where invaluable original sketches, drawings of the original planners and documents of the founding fathers’ vision are displayed. The famous art museum, with its world famous collections of Pahari miniature paintings and Gandhara sculptures is bursting at its seams, needing more space to grow. Spotless state-of-the-art best practices of conservation and maintenance along with dynamic outreach programmes for citizens and visitors’ education need to be put in place. The museums need to become hubs of enlightened discourses, seminars and debate to create interest among citizens. Annual art and architecture festivals of world stature need to be envisioned. Regarding showcasing of the city’s marvellous Garden City concept –besides regular tree walks, public lectures and seminars, an annual ‘Tree Watching Festival’ in the month of March when most trees are in bloom—something on the lines of Cherry Blossom festivals held in Kyoto and Washington --need to be organised. There is even a list of notified ‘Heritage Trees’ that need to be showcased with proper signage explaining their characteristics etc. Signage of heritage objects/locations/art works etc. with brief explanatory notes should be widely used. Only then will people understand the intrinsic worth of these valued landmarks. In London, every little nook and corner of the city’s great history spills over to the streets with excellent signage. Of course no one can beat the Americans in turning history into profit ( quite literally ). While Chicago has a large number of excellent city tours on various facets of its history-- they even have a ‘Gangster Tour’ that takes you around the famous hideouts of Al Capone, the legendary gangster on whom a Hollywood film too was shot there. Chandigarh can create its own tourism model. Nowhere in the world do you have such a rich blend of utopian urbanism, iconic architecture, great art and Arcadian landscape –all nestling in a compact area of 114 sq km. A city whose lowly manhole cover sells for over thousands of dollars, surely needs to showcase its heritage better.

---||Kochi||Tabulation of marks enters final stage||Kochi: The tabulation of Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class XII final results by schools has entered the final stage, and more than 60% of schools in the state have completed all the procedures. With the board having extended the deadline from July 22 to July 25, the remaining schools are expected to complete the tabulation in the next two days. However, many schools are still struggling to meet all the conditions mentioned in the assessment formula as officials have to rework the tabulation even at the slightest error detected by the software provided by the board for the purpose. As per the assessment scheme, students will have their results based on their performance in the final exams of Classes X and XII, and Class XII pre-board exams, which the CBSE said would serve the board’s intended purpose of declaring a valid, reliable, fair and unbiased results in the time of the pandemic. However, as the process involves a lot of complex calculations, many schools have been making mistakes in the tabulation and seeking the help of CBSE for rectification. Following this, on Wednesday, CBSE examination controller Sanyam Bhardwaj said that the board decided to extend the deadline as “the teachers involved in the result preparation process were under stress and getting panicky”. Teachers said that the moderation of marks is the most complicated process that hinders the completion of the tabulation. “The tabulation of Class X has been completed already by the schools and the results are expected in the coming week. The works of Class XII are in the final stage, and it takes much time as the finals results must be moderated to ensure that it matches the historical performance of the schools. The software keeps on directing to rectify errors and the five-member result committees in all schools have been working hard to complete the process before the deadline,” said Juby Paul, principal of ToC-H Public School, Ernakulam and general secretary of Kochi Metro Sahodaya. Another issue faced by the school is to pacify the students and parents who raise concerns about the tabulation policy fearing whether they would lose the marks they deserve.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tabulation-of-marks-enters-final-stage/articleshow/84715911.cms||---

A long queue of trucks and other private vehicles was on the highway stretches and people were providing those stranded food, water, fruits and biscuits. Officials said the highway may reopen in two days. Ramesh Patel, a truck driver from Rajasthan said, “I had gone to Belgavi to drop an industrial machine and was returning to Mumbai. Police stopped vehicles yesterday at 7pm and since then I am stranded at Uchgaon. People of Kolhapur are very kind and are providing us food, water, biscuits and fruits. I am having further transport orders and need to return to Mumbai as early as possible.” Vasanti Adhav, a banker travelling with family to Goa from Pune, said, “We got stuck at Sangli phata since last night. Hotel rooms are full, so we had to sleep in our car. We checked for flight or train tickets but they are not operational. Washroom facilities are available at a petrol pump nearby, but it’s getting frustrating. There is no alternative route. Hopefully, the water will recede quickly.” Vikram Salokhe, highway in-charge, MSRDCL, said, “The flooded stretch at Sangli phata has fast moving flood water and has a depth of 8-10 feet.

Except a few spells of heavy rainfall, majority of the districts are yet to witness good rainfall. The average rainfall of the state is 35.6% lesser compared to the rainfall occurred in 2020 till July 24. According to the data available with the Jaipur Met office, only Jaisalmer has fared well in terms of getting monsoon rainfall. “Till Saturday, Jaisalmer received a rainfall of 139.33mm compared to 70.20mm received till July 24,” said an officer with the water resources department while quoting the rainfall figures on Saturday. Even the state capital Jaipur is in the category of deficit rainfall having 39.4% lesser rainfall compared to 2020. “Jaipur in this season so far has received a rainfall of 128.9mm compared to 212.80mm. It is clearly indicating that the city had poor spells of rainfall so far,” the officer added. Jaipur Met office stated that various cyclones during April and May have impacted the progress of the southwest monsoon this year so far. “Also, the catalysts which invite the monsoon winds are missing in various regions is the reason why we are seeing lesser rainfall activity,” said a senior officer of Jaipur Met office. Likewise, the average rainfall of this season so far for the state has been 35.1% lesser compared to last year. “Hopefully, the coming week will bring good rain in widespread form,” said an officer with Jaipur Met office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/monsoon-yet-to-gain-momentum-even-a-mth-after-its-arrival-in-raj/articleshow/84719669.cms||---

Amidst reports of Congress firming up plans to go solo in the local body polls, Patole’s meetings gained more importance. Speaking right after his arrival at the city airport on Saturday, Patole more or less confirmed that his party won’t be allying with anyone for the local body polls. “All these things (going solo) are internal policy matters of a party and have been decided. I don’t think it’s right to discuss it (in public),” he said. When asked if his review meetings to check poll preparedness are a result of his discussion with Gandhi, he said, “The review meetings are a regular process which keep happening all the time. We discuss various issues that affect the public like fuel, inflation etc. And even election preparedeness is a part of such review meets.” City Congress chief Vikas Thakre, who is also MLA from Nagpur West constituency, said, “Patole is our state chief and it’s but natural that he will review local party issues.” Former minister of state and Congress leader Rajendra Mulak said, “Patole will be visiting three assembly constituencies in the city. Discussions will be held with ward level representatives regarding the party’s presence in the area and other issues which are relevant. Elections are not the sole purpose for which review meetings happen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/patole-takes-feedback-on-local-polls-preparedness/articleshow/84715953.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand govt preparations for another Shravan sans devotees||RANCHI: With the holy month of Shravan starting on Sunday, the administration is making extra preparations to enforce Covid-19 protocols. As per Hindu beliefs, Shravan is an auspicious month to seek the blessings of Lord Shiva. Devotees in lakhs visit prominent shrines across the state during this time of the year and especially on Mondays. But keeping the Covid-19 situation in mind, the state government has continued its ban on large-scale religious congregations, notwithstanding the demands of several BJP leaders to reopen temples for devotees. In Deoghar, which is home to the Baba Baidyanath dham temple, the district administration on Saturday gave final touches to its preparedness to ensure that no devotee is allowed inside the temple as per the government diktat. Deputy commissioner Manjunath Bhajantri along with other officials visited different places across the district to take stock of the administrative preparation. Speaking to TOI, Bhajantri said, “We are ready for smooth conduct of Shravan month sans devotees and mela this time due to Covid-19. All ground works have been completed and teams have been deployed at sensitive pockets.” As part of the strategy, the district administration has put up check points at five key intersections along inter-state and inter-district borders to prevent devotees from thronging the temple. The check points have been put up at Dumma more, Bardmara, Andrigadan, Jainpur more and Chakai. “In all these places, we have deployed quick response teams (QRTs). Within the town, all roads leading to the temple have been sealed,” he said. Simultaneously, the district administration has been holding awareness drives across the district and along bordering Bihar to inform devotees about the ban on temple visit. “We are being specially vigilant near Sultanganj, along the Bihar border, from where kanwariyas carry holy water to offer Lord Shiva. This apart, we have put up awareness boards to announce the ban on devotees,” he said, adding that puja at the temple would be carried out like usual. “The rituals will be telecast live daily on Jhargov.tv,” he said. Similar measures have been put up in Dumka as well, which is famous for its Basukinath temple. In Ranchi, where scores of people visit the Pahari temple during Shravan, officials said they have made arrangements for online puja and darshan. “One can observe the rituals through Pahadimandirranchi.com and can also book special puja online,” said Abhishek Anand, the treasurer of the temple. He added that they will keep the main gates of the temple closed for the general public on all days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/govt-preps-for-another-shravan-sans-devotees/articleshow/84716878.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Stating that the very purpose of women’s safety and security has been defeated by the act, road safety activist Kamaljeet Singh said the state transport department connived with three Mumbai-based entities to award the project fraudulently. While addressing a press conference here on Saturday, Singh, who is also a member of the European Association for Accident Research and Analysis, said, “Three firms, namely M/s Paras Infra, M/s Pragati Enterprises and M/s Konark Structural Engineers, were shortlisted by the technical committee of the transport department.” He further said, “The committee completed the evaluation of bids during a meeting held on April 8 this year. The meeting was presided by transport commissioner Kiran Kumari Pasi during which M/s Paras Infra was selected for the project. However, the company had submitted forged documents for its experience certificate and they were ignored by the transport department officials.” The project is about the development, customization, deployment and management of a statewide vehicle tracking system. The project is assisted by MoRTH under the Nirbhaya Fund for the safety and security of women while travelling on public vehicles. The proposed system seeks to equip all public passenger transport vehicles with vehicle location tracking (VLT) devices and emergency buttons for raising an alarm. Singh further said RTI responses from the public sector units — Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL), Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited (CPCL) and Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) — confirmed that none of the three Mumbai-based companies, which qualified for the technical evaluation, had engaged them for work related to vehicle tracking devices. All three companies, in support of their experience, had submitted documents of these petroleum and gas companies as having worked for the PSUs. While HPCL denied issuing a work order worth Rs 6.19 crore to M/s Paras Infra as the latter claimed in its bid, another RTI reply from IOCL confirmed that no work order of Rs 6.97 crore related to vehicle tracking device was awarded to M/s Paras Infra, said Singh, who is based in Ludhiana and Delhi and attached with the NRSC as a consultant. The other two companies had also submitted work experience relating to vehicle tracking devices with CPCL and GAIL. In its reply to the RTI query, GAIL said no work order or contract was awarded to M/s Pragati Infra worth Rs 8.97 crore. CPCL also denied giving any work to M/s Konark Structural Engineers relating to the vehicle tracking device, he claimed. Singh also said, “I have been working on the issue of road safety for the last two decades and the wrongdoings of the state transport department are going to affect the safety of women and children on the roads. How can I let that go? I had also raised this issue here during my last visit but the government hasn’t taken any cognizance.” Transport commissioner Kiran Kumari Pasi was not available for comments on the charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-govt-misused-nirbhaya-fund-on-road-safety-project/articleshow/84717086.cms||Gaurav Pandey

They were arrested on the complaints of Congress MLA from Bermo, Anup Singh alias Kumar Jaimangal Singh. On Saturday evening, Ranchi SSP Surindra Jha agreed after photographs came out that two of the accused were detained in Bokaro on Friday, subsequently brought them to Ranchi for further investigations on Saturday and were arrested from there. Earlier in the morning, the police had released a press statement saying that they have arrested three persons from different places, including from a raid at a city hotel. The statement also said the trio have confessed to their involvement in the conspiracy to topple the state government. The cops have seized Rs 2 lakh cash, documents and electronic equipment. Several others involved in the case were absconding, the statement said. “The accused have admitted that they planned to contact political personalities and offer them cash. Police are trying to identify and verify all the persons involved in the case. The examination of documents and electronic equipment seized during the raids is going on,” Jha said in the statement. He, however, refused to comment from where the third person was arrested from. It was also not clear why police said they conducted a raid in a Ranchi hotel to arrest two of the accused when they were detained in Bokaro and allegedly brought to the hotel. “I will not divulge further information other than what is written in the statement,” Jha said when contacted. According to information available on social media, Abhishek Dubey’s profile is not known but an identity card seized from Amit Singh says he is a contract worker at BSL while Niwaran Prasad Mahto is a vegetable vendor who had fought the assembly election in 2009. A case (159/ 2021) was registered on July 22 under sections 419, 420, 124A, 120B and 34 of the Indian Penal Code, Section 171B of the Representation of People’s Act and sections 8 and 9 of the Prevention of Corruption Act against the trio. Acting on the same FIR by the MLA, the trio was arrested and produced before a court on Saturday. In his complaint to the Kotwali police station on Thursday, MLA Singh had said hawala traders and BJP leaders from outside were camping in Ranchi with the intention to destabilize the alliance government. He further said some influential and rich people were staying in hotels under fake names and trying to establish contact with the MLAs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/3-held-for-bid-to-destabilize-govt-face-sedition-charges/articleshow/84717039.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ranchi||Arrests trigger buzz of bid to topple Hemant Soren government||RANCHI: A war of words broke out on Saturday between the ruling coalition and the Opposition after the arrest of three persons from a city hotel by Jharkhand police. Those arrested have been charged with sedition among various other sections of IPC and Prevention of Corruption Act. Soon after the arrests, the ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) at a news conference, accused the BJP of trying to topple the government. It said the three, holed up inside the hotel, were calling up MLAs of the ruling coalition and offering them bribes to switch sides. Party’s central general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said the real picture would be clear after a police investigation. “I am not privy to the investigation but prima facie it appears that those arrested from the hotel were contacting MLAs of the ruling coalition to offer them a bribe to bring down the government. But I would like to clarify that the JMM-Congress and RJD MLAs are intact and the nefarious motives have been exposed,” he said. To justify his claim that the BJP was masterminding a coup, Bhattacharya said the BJP leaders have been saying repeatedly that they are going to form the government in the state and that days of the Hemant Soren government were numbered. “BJP state president Deepak Prakash and Godda MP Nishikant Dubey have gone on record to say that the BJP is going to form a government in the stat e during Dumka and Madhupur byelections,” he said. Bhattacharya also pointed finger at BJP MLA C.P. Singh for saying that if horse trading of MLAs would have been planned by the BJP, the people would not have got arrested. “From his statement it appears that the BJP by its own admission has mastered the art of overthrowing elected governments with impunity which was evident in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka,” he said. Taking strong exception to the allegations, BJP’s Nishikant Dubey, tweeting a copy of the FIR, wrote, “Ab to do lakh me chaar aadmi milkar Jharkhand ke vidhayak kharid rahe hain. Jharkhand ke vidhayak ki kimat mukhyamantri Hemant Soren ji ne 10,000 laga dia. Bakrid me to bakre ki kimat isse kai guna hai. (Now four people with Rs 2 lakh are purchasing Jharkhand MLAs. CM Hemant Soren has valued the MLAs at Rs10,000 each. The goats in Bakrid market fetch several times this price). Working president of the state Congress, Rajesh Thakur, attacked the BJP directly saying its nefarious motives were dislodged by the state police. It was Congress MLA from Bermo, Kumar Jaimangal aka Anup Singh, who had lodged an FIR on July 22 with Kotwali police against unknown persons for bringing money through the hawala channel to approach MLAs of the ruling coalition and destabilise the government. BJP state spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo rubbished the allegations and said that the entire case has been cooked up by the ruling party to keep their MLAs in control. “The matter must be probed by the CBI or any neutral agency because the police are involved in cooking up a false case. Those arrested were picked up from Bokaro on Friday night and shown to be arrested from Ranchi hotel. They are all from poor families and how can they engage in horse trading of MLAs?” he asked. A complainant in the case, Jaimangal Singh, told TOI that he had information about the MLAs who were being approached. “Though I had not mentioned the names in my complaint, I had the names of the MLAs and I have informed senior leaders of the Congress and the chief minister. I had been tracking the case since July 18 and after being convinced, lodged a complaint with Kotwali police on July 22,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/arrests-trigger-buzz-of-bid-to-topple-hemant-govt/articleshow/84716874.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||India||Covid fight: Up to 88% drop in prices of 5 devices||NEW DELHI: The maximum retail price (MRP) of 90% of the brands of five medical devices that are widely used for Covid management, including pulse oximeters, blood pressure (BP) monitoring machines and nebulisers, have come down by up to 88%. The reduction in prices is a result of the recent capping of trade margins of five such products at 70% by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority. While MRP of pulse oximeters reduced by up to 88%, price of BP monitoring machines have dropped by up to 83%, glucometers by up to 80% and nebulizers and digital thermometers by up to 77%. Of the total of 684 brands marketing the five medical devices, 620 brands (91%) have reported a downward revision of MRP. The imported brands — with high margins — have shown maximum reduction following the price cap, an official said. The maximum downward revision has been reported by an imported brand of Pulse Oximeter, showing reduction of Rs 2,95,375 per unit, the government said. Such costly devices are, however, atypical. The common brands, seen as reliable, cost in the Rs 3,000-Rs 5,000 range and have become cheaper too. Trade margin is basically the difference between the price at which a manufacturer sells the device or product to a distributor or stockist and the price paid by the end consumer (MRP). While these products are among the commonly used medical devices, demand has surged further in the wake of Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-fight-up-to-88-drop-in-prices-of-5-devices/articleshow/84721329.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||Goa||Old Goa police station case: Human rights panel seeks reply from chief secretary||PANAJI: The Goa state human rights commission has sought a reply from the chief secretary and the director general of police, by August 23, on the action taken to improve the working condition of police personnel attached to Old Goa police stationA complaint was filed with the human rights commission stating that no steps have been taken to comply with the commission’s recommendations in its December 2017 inquiry report which found the working condition of police personnel to be “not satisfactory” and requiring “drastic improvement”. The complainant, Aires Rodrigues, in a new complaint has stated that the condition of the police station at Old Goa remains pathetic, with staff working in an inhumane environment. Eleven villages come under the Old Goa police station. These include Ribandar, Old Goa, Corlim, Carambolim, St Estevam, Cumbharjua, Divar, Chorao, Chimbel, Merces and St Cruz. “…Despite such a very wide and vast jurisdiction, the crucial Old Goa police station, for the last few decades, is housed in extremely cramped premises which is not more than 150 sqm. The lack of proper space is adversely affecting the working of the police station which is deficient in basic amenities for the staff and the public who visit the police station,” Rodrigues stated in his complaint. In 2017, after conducting two random inspections of two police stations, Colva and Old Goa, the commission stated that the working conditions of police personnel are “not satisfactory” and “require drastic improvement”. At the time the commission had recommended that the government carry out inspections of all police stations to ascertain shortcomings and take appropriate steps to improve the working conditions, particularly for women police staff members. The commission, at the time, found the police station buildings to be overcrowded and not suitable to accommodate the total staff working at the police station. It also found the staff strength insufficient to cope up with the workload.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/old-goa-police-stn-case-rights-panel-seeks-reply/articleshow/84718360.cms||---

This is the second time that the petitioner, who is a nurse, invoked the contempt jurisdiction of the court because the respondents defaulted in compliance with its order concerning payment of her salary, the court observed, adding, “Now that the amounts have been paid and there is no contest, we refrain from initiating any serious action under contempt of court.” The court noted that these costs are required to be personally paid by Pillai, without taxing the coffers of the panchayat. “This is because respondent No.1, as the sarpanch, should have realised that it is not proper to disobey the orders of the court. This is a case where the panchayat neither sought modification nor chose to comply with the orders made,” the division bench comprising Justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar stated. After the petitioner knocked on the doors of the court, the panchayat credited Rs 4.6 lakh into her account towards pending monthly salary from November 2019 to December 2020. Senior advocate S D Lotlikar, representing the nurse, confirmed the receipt. Counsel Nikhil Vaze, representing the panchayat secretary, submitted that there was no work for the nurse and therefore, the panchayat felt that no salary could be paid to her. He submitted that from 2014, the local dispensary stopped functioning and even the doctor posted at the dispensary retired. He added that the panchayat has been pursuing the matter with the government for the nurse’s absorption in the local health centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sancoale-sarpanch-must-pay-nurse-rs-10k-costs-hc/articleshow/84718514.cms||---

This is in line with her request to NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Congress’s P Chidambaram to get the opposition together to work on the goal of forming a national front. Sources said TMC had now taken the onus of organising the meeting, given the short window before Mamata leaves for Delhi on Monday. Trinamool national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee and poll strategist Prashant Kishor are believed to be leading the initiative to revive the opposition front. A party member said the presence of senior leadership of all opposition parties at Delhi’s Constitution Club for TMC’s July 21 virtual rally laid groundwork for the meeting. Mamata urged the opposition leadership “not to waste a single day” and set aside “self-interest for national interest”. Apart from Pawar and Chidambaram, the July 21 gathering for TMC’s virtual rally included Supriya Sule (NCP), Digvijay Singh (Congress), SP’s Ram Gopal Yadav and Jaya Bachchan, DMK’s Tiruchi Siva, RJD’s Manoj Jha and Shiv Sena’s Priyanka Chaturvedi among others. They are likely to be back for the proposed Banga Bhawan meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/didi-to-meet-oppn-netas-after-pm-talk/articleshow/84721408.cms||---

---||Nagpur||‘Heart work: New exigency, will have strongest effect on staff’||How an organization can fortify its people and in due process make them adaptive, prudent, and embedded? In this unforeseeable situation, how can employees be taken care of, how can they bring their whole self at work, how can a firm help to relieve employee concerns, how can they be made to respond meaningfully? Moreover, how can employees be helped to bounce back, how can a firm stand as a social support system for its people, what path can be followed to make employees adapt the new normal? Debarun Chakraborty, deputy director at Symbiosis Institute of Business Management, Nagpur, a constituent of Symbiosis International (deemed university), discussed these vital questions in his recent research work. Titled ‘Marching toward heart work: Connecting in new ways to thrive amidst Covid-19 crisis’, it was published in an international journal. The paper was authored by Chakraborty, Wendrila Biswas, assistant professor of Haldia Institute of Technology, India; and Ganesh Dash, assistant professor of Saudi Electronic University, Riyadh. Excerpts from an interview with TOI... Q. What prompted you to undertake this study? A. The path went like this: January 2020: Coronavirus is taking a toll on lives in distant countries (facts and figures); February 2020: But it’ll not affect us (denial); March 2020: “The Lockdown”. Okay I need to stay home for two weeks…that’s it? (deal with it); April-May 2020: Cannot stay home for so long…I have a job and other responsibilities (anger); June 2020: “Unlocked” with constraints. My friend lost a job, there’s a 25% cut in my pay (sad); July 2020: God when it’ll end? (grief); Later: We have to go on with it. I have to work out things (acceptance). This is how we are heading in this pandemic. Faces are hidden behind little screens and we are hidden behind anxiety and uncertainty. By now, we have become painfully aware that recovery and growth in this crisis are far off. Amid such stoking fears of the pandemic, the business and work environments are becoming unpredictable. With lack of social support system, employees are facing psychological and emotional distress. Thus, lack of resilience has become one of the critical concerns as companies march to adapt the changes and survive in the downturn. Q. What were your key findings? A. As the spread of Covid-19 is engulfing the world, a parallel spread of worry, fear and instability is overtaking the minds of people at work. Amid the threat of pandemic, employees are trapped into negative thinking. A series of changes in employee policies, regulations, guidelines, targets, and expectations, together with remote working process, has distracted the working minds. They are now hooked by compulsive thinking and a feeling of helplessness. Yet, there is no one to show them the positive possibilities. Thus, it is crucial for firms to connect with employees through compassion. Nourishing an organization with ‘heart work’ and bounded optimism would never disrupt the equilibrium amid existential crisis. Q. What is heart work? A. It is the new exigency. It would have a strongest influence on employees’ strength and virtues to rebound. It is a time not to ensure performance but to integrate and reintegrate so that resilience can be set up as a trajectory, as a process and as a system to recuperate and revive. Such a ‘heart work’ is all about vitalizing future performance. This is how we can frame, accept, interpret, and overcome the crisis together. Studies on resilience, employee engagement, empathy, and gratitude have been covered by research studies all across the world. However, exploring the essence of ‘heart work’ in organizations under unpredictable circumstances is scarcely investigated in emerging economies like India. The research is about enlivening employees with renewed self-esteem, self-efficacy, and self-worth. It is about being stable amid wretched surroundings. Q. What role ‘heart work’ has in these times? A. Varied collaborative pattern would collectively help employees perceive potential risks and emerge from it together with new opportunities. Sincere expressions of gratitude when employees are afflicted by anxiety and stress shall renew their energy, be a hope to overcome barriers, and initiate a thought process. The essence of ‘heart work’ cultivates a feeling of inclusivity and gesture of unity amid Covid-19 turbulence. Engaging in an open dialogue with employees would help them adapt to the required level of variance. It is the time for a company to generate value that drives transparency and mutual respect to make its people endure this stretching situation. Q. You also delved upon energy moments... A. The study provides a new approach for endorsing resilience at work and a significant direction for its continuance. The findings showed clearly that when firms help their people face the crisis and remains transparent showing them the actual scenario, employees get active to work towards exploring opportunities for a new beginning. It highlighted that when organizations boosted and empowered their employees at times of uncertainties, it generated a hope for them to put on their best efforts and overcome the setbacks. Q. What is your advise for those losing employment? A. Allow yourself plenty of time to acclimatize. Don’t be too hard on yourself and don’t try to hold your emotions. Express how you feel about being laid off or unemployed, including anything you wish you had said (or didn’t say) to your previous supervisor. This is especially therapeutic if you were terminated in an insensitive manner. While it’s critical to recognise how tough job loss and unemployment can be, it’s also critical to avoid languishing. Rather than concentrating on the unfairness of your job loss, or how poorly it was handled, or how much better your life would be if it hadn’t happened, attempt to accept the circumstance. The sooner you do so, the sooner you’ll be able to get on with your life. Q. When you’re unemployed, it’s tempting to start judging or blaming yourself. A. Consider the loss of your employment as a temporary setback. The majority of successful people have faced big failures in their lives, but have recovered by picking themselves up, learning from their mistakes, and trying again. At such a low time in your life, ask yourself whether there is anything you can gain from this experience. Perhaps your unemployment has given you the opportunity to re-evaluate your professional priorities and reflect on what you want out of life. Perhaps it has strengthened you.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/heart-work-new-exigency-will-have-strongest-effect-on-staff/articleshow/84715218.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Bogga alias Sandeep Dawandewar, the leader of his Bogga gang, has been shifted to Nagpur for emergency treatment. Sources said an old feud was brewing between Bogga and his rivals since many months. Both gangs were baying for each other’s blood and waiting for opportunities to settle scores. The rival gang, led by one Vinod alias Bunty Kondawar, spotted Bogga at Subhash Chowk and attacked him with a sword. Sources claimed the incident took place when Bogga was consuming beer at a roadside eatery with his friend Rinku Chavan at night. Vinod Kondawar and his accomplices got a whiff of Bogga’s presence and decided to eliminate him. While the gang, armed with swords and knives, stabbed Bogga multiple times, his friend Rinku managed to flee. A team of cops arrived at scene of crime and rushed the injured Bogga to hospital. Later, the cops learnt about the identity of the assailants and rounding up operation was launched. Vinod Kondawar from Maharana Pratap ward in Ballarpur was arrested late in the night, while three other accused are still at large. The critically injured Bogga was taken to Chandrapur GMCH and later shifted to Nagpur. PI Umesh Patil is investigating the case. Ballarpur city is in the spotlight for its high crime rate. The town witnessed the murder in broad day light of mafia kingpin Suraj Bahuriya. The recent firing incident in Chandrapur was a fall out of Bahuriay’s murder. Cops are investigating whether this incident too is connected with the Bahuriya murder and the recent shootout.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/goon-attacked-in-ballarpur-police-on-alert/articleshow/84715251.cms||---

Later, during a brief interaction with the media where he spoke about low yields and low incomes in agriculture forcing farmers to agitate, he said, “Whenever the farmers call me, I will go to them barefoot and ask them to give suggestions on how the strength of our state can help the farmers’ agitation.” At Chamkaur Sahib, the farmers, raised slogans against him and waved black flags. They were protesting against Sidhu’s statement, made in the context of farmers, in which he had said a thirsty person goes to the well, the well doesn’t come to the thirsty person. However, police managed to get Sidhu out safely from the parking site of Chamkaur Sahib Gurdwara, where he had gone to pay obeisance. The protesters claimed that Sidhu changed his route on learning that a huge group of farmers was protesting against him on the road near the bus stand.  Sidhu, who had earlier in the day met Channi in Morinda, said during a brief media interaction, “The victory of Sanyukta Kisan Morcha is my top priority and I have been calling this ‘Kisan Morcha’ pure because it is strengthening the heart of the Indian Constitution. Our Congress party has given a pro-people 18-point agenda for Punjab and each MP, MLA, and worker of the party, including me, will work for it. No other models, including Gujarat model and Delhi model, can compete with this 18-point agenda for Punjab.” “It is my wish that this movement should turn economically powerful and farmers should earn their livelihood respectfully,” he said. “People are asking about the names of ‘big fishes’ involved in drug rackets, and we had no option other than to tell them. There is no need to hide on ‘power’. Why to make contracts (PPA) of Rs 18 per unit when power is available at Rs 2 per unit? When we know that each year solar power rates are declining by 20%, then why should Punjab not purchase power from the national grid? We have to answer all these questions,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/new-pcc-chief-sidhu-faces-protest-by-punjab-farmers/articleshow/84721429.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Flagless mast near Atal Setu exposes BJP’s fake nationalism, says Congress||PANAJI: Congress said on Saturday that BJP, which harps on nationalism, has neither time to replace the missing Indian tricolour on flag mast near Atal Setu nor to repair the mast opposite the old secretariat building. Spokesperson Shrinivas Khalap said that BJP, however, had the time to erect hoardings, party flags, and demanded an apology from BJP’s national president JP Nadda for the mismanagement of the pandemic. “As the flagless mast at Atal Setu and damaged side ropes of the flag mast opposite Adil Shah palace welcomed Nadda, the fake nationalism of the BJP stands completely exposed,” Khalap said. He said it has been months that the two flag masts are in a sorry state. “Unfortunately, the same BJP government has used money, muscle power to erect hoardings, cutouts of Nadda, and display their party flags all over the route of their national president’s travel,” said Khalap. Congress said that BJP keeps trying to divert people’s attention from core issues by bringing in “their fake narrative” of nationalism. Congress has demanded that Nadda speak on Mhadei, the three linear projects coming up in Mollem, the coastal zone management plan, resumption of mining, and rising unemployment. “The BJP national president must answer to the people of Goa why their governments sold our mother Mhadei to Karnataka. Why do they want to destroy the environment, forest and wildlife to convert Goa into a coal hub?” Khalap said. Khalap said Nadda should explain to people why fuel prices have hit Rs 100 per litre despite BJP promising to cap it at Rs 60 per litre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/flagless-mast-exposes-bjps-fake-nationalism-says-cong/articleshow/84718781.cms||---

A part of the mosque’s water tank wall collapsed on Thursday after the soil was inundated with rain water. Repair work on the collapsed part was taken up on priority by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and Gaude inspected the same on Saturday. The demand for the flyover was raised during the construction of the bypass road. However, local MLA and then PWD minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar had said that a flyover was not possible at the spot since the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) does not allow any elevated structure in front of protected monuments. The mosque committee’s president, Murtuza Shaikh, however, blamed the vibrations created by heavy vehicles passing on the highway stretch in front of the structure for the wall developing cracks, ultimately leading to a portion of it collapsing on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gaude-assures-flyover-in-front-of-safa-masjid/articleshow/84718864.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

Sircar, in his first reaction, said: “I too am surprised, there were so many well known politicians and VIPs (to choose from).” Sircar stepping into the RS as an MP appears foregone given TMC’s two-third majority in the Bengal assembly even though BJP isn’t keen to give him a walkover yet. In a statement, TMC said it was “delighted” to nominate Sircar and his “invaluable contribution to public service shall help us serve our country even better”. Sircar fills in one of the two vacant Rajya Sabha seats from Bengal, and he is expected to replace Dinesh Trivedi, who resigned from the Upper House on February 12 and defected to BJP. Sources said Sircar appeared to be a late entrant in the list for TMC’s possible nominees, clogged by political veterans, including party vice-president Yashwant Sinha. Asked if BJP will also field a RS candidate to take on Sircar, TMC Bengal chief Dilip Ghosh said, “We have not taken a decision (on this) as yet.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/prasar-bharati-ex-ceo-sircar-tmcs-rs-pick/articleshow/84721454.cms||---

Although the official statement did not name the group, it followed the raids on the Bhaskar group, a media entity which has interests in other sectors as well. The finance ministry issued a separate statement on the I-T department’s action against a UP-centric group. It said searches in Lucknow, Basti, Kanpur, Varanasi and Kolkata turned up evidence which “establishes that the group has been earning huge outsidethe-book income through mining, processing and sales in liquor, flour business, real estate etc. Unaccounted income emanating out of these transactions has been found exceeding Rs 90 crore as per preliminary estimates”.

---||India||Report: Commander’s reclined seat led to AI Express crash at Trichy||MUMBAI: The accident involving an Air India Express aircraft that took off from Trichy for Muscat, with a lacerated belly, occurred due to events set into motion by a sudden and unexpected reclining of the commander’s seat, according to the final investigation report released recently by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB). The reclined seat had the commander inadvertently move back the thrust levers. The aircraft consumed the full length of the runway, rolled past the paved surface and its tail struck the soft ground on lift-off. It did a sluggish climb, downed antennas of a ground-based navigation aid, hit the airport boundary wall and sustained a gaping belly wound. The aircraft functioned satisfactorily and the pilots of flight IX-611 of October 12, 2018, with 130 passengers on board, continued their journey, the report said. The flight had reached Muscat airspace when the Air India Express team instructed the pilots to divert the flight to Mumbai, where it landed safely. As the flight duration exceeded the two-hour capacity of the cockpit voice recorder, the conversations between the pilots during the take-off and climb were not available to the investigators. The AAIB released the final report 33 months later, well beyond the 12-month deadline set by International Civil Aviation Organisation. The report listed the probable cause of accident as “delayed takeoff due to reduction of take-off thrust from 98% to 77%” , breakdown of crew coordination and loss of situational awareness. Among the contributory cause was the commander’s reclined seat during during the take-off roll at 210 kmph when he moved back the throttle levers inadvertently. Capt Amit Singh, an air safety expert, said: “The idea of an investigation is only to prevent similar occurrences by carrying out a root cause analysis. This report has touched on symptoms, but not the root cause. It has left a number of questions unanswered.” “The calculated speed at which the aircraft should have lifted off the runway, if it indeed weighed only 71 tonnes, was 144 kts. That’s irrespective of the take-off thrust,” said Capt Singh. An annotated picture carried in the report showed the aircraft at 145 kts on the runway, so why did it lift off much later? Also, why did the pilots continue their journey even after being informed by the Trichy air traffic control and later by AIX officials about the extent of damage?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/report-commanders-reclined-seat-led-to-ai-express-crash-at-trichy/articleshow/84721497.cms||Manju V
---||Nagpur||Covid patients ‘damaged, stole’ items worth Rs50L in police flats||Nagpur: The police department has submitted to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) a list of items costing over Rs50 lakh that were either damaged or stolen from its new flat scheme at Pachpaoli which was first used as a quarantine centre and later as Covid Care Centre (CCC). The materials were allegedly damaged and stolen by Covid-19 suspected and positive patients. According to NMC officials, majority of the damage was done by people who were quarantined during the first wave. NMC did not execute works in the last seven months citing lack of funds. Now, families of cops have no option but to take possession of the flats after doing the repairing and cleaning work themselves. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi, who confirmed receipt of the list from DCP (headquarters) Sandip Pakhale on Friday, told TOI that the NMC’s public works department has been directed to prepare a proposal seeking funds from the district planning committee (DPC). “We are hopeful of that as the flats were used for Covid management,” he said. Along with the list of items, Pakhale has also sent copy of a letter dated February 10 addressed to municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B. It mentioned that 196 flats were taken over for quarantine centre on April 25, 2020, and around 6,000 persons were quarantined there till January 24. The flats were vacated and handed over to police after patients were shifted to other centres, the letter mentioned. Pakhale mentioned in the letter that all the taps in C, D, E and F wings have been stolen and materials kept in kitchen, cupboards, fans etc have been damaged while the walls have been stained due to spitting. As per the letter, police department wrote to NMC Ashi Nagar Zone on February 2 to carry out repair works. “Then, a joint inspection was done by NMC and police to ascertain the damage. A list of items has been prepared. Therefore, I request you to repair the damaged items and carry out cleaning work through your department,” wrote Pakhale. On Saturday, TOI visited the flats in seven wings and found that even blades of ceiling fans in some flats are bent. Right from electric boards to furniture, the damage is huge. Three police personnel and their family members were white-washing and cleaning their flats. “The entire flat scheme was ready last year and we were allotted flats. It was the responsibility of NMC to hand over the flats after repairing and cleaning. But we can’t wait more. Around nine families have got the works done themselves before shifting to the flats,” the families said. The NMC did not even repair the water pump at one of the wings due to which there is no water supply in 28 flats, they said. Last month, a thief was caught for stealing some taps, fans etc from the flats. LEFT IN A MESS * In April 2020, NMC took over police flats to quarantine suspected Covid patients * It was made Covid Care Centre during peak of first wave and operated till January * Police found materials damaged and stolen from flats, garden ill-maintained * NMC has not done repairing and cleaning works since February * Police submitted a list of items stolen or damaged to NMC on Friday * Cops peg loss at Rs50 lakh * NMC to submit proposal for DPC funds for repair, cleaning works||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-patients-damaged-stole-items-worth-rs50l-in-police-flats/articleshow/84715670.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The Indian Railway on Saturday started an Oxygen Express carrying 200 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) from Tatanagar in Jharkhand to Benapole in Bangladesh. “This is the first time ever that the Oxygen Express is put into operation to a neighbouring country,” the railway ministry said in an official statement. The railways had started the operation of Oxygen Expresses on April 24 to provide respite to states requiring medical oxygen. More than 35,000 tonnes of LMO was transported to 15 states. Around 480 Oxygen Expresses were operated, the ministry said. The demand for LMO in India rose to around 9,000 tonnes per day during the peak of the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indias-o2-train-to-chug-into-bangladesh/articleshow/84721540.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 48 days on, cop confesses to killing lover, destroying evidence||AHMEDABAD: His experience as an investigative cop allegedly came in handy while evading arrest when police came looking for his missing partner Sweety Patel. However, ending the 48-day drama surrounding the 36-year-old’s disappearance, Ajay Desai – an inspector with the Vadodara Rural police’s special operations group – finally confessed to her murder. Blood stains found at his bungalow in Karjan and his refusal to undergo a narcoanalysis test kept the police at his heels. Their efforts finally paid off on Saturday. “Desai had strangled Sweety, his lover of over five years, following a domestic feud. He then disposed of her body at Atali village near Dahej in Bharuch district, about 121 km from Vadodara,” said officials of Ahmedabad city crime branch. The Vadodara Rural police had handed over the case to the crime branch on July 18. ACP (Crime) D P Chudasama told media on Saturday that the couple had a major altercation regarding their relationship on June 4. “Around 12.30 am, Desai attacked Sweety and choked her. Realizing she had died, he first kept the body at their residence in Prayosha Society, Karjan,” he said. Investigators said that Desai then wrapped the body in blankets and kept it in the boot of his SUV. “The same day, he drove the vehicle to Dahej. He went to his friend Kiritsinh Jadeja’s roadside hotel in Atali village. Jadeja helped Desai in burning the body near a dilapidated hotel adjoining Jadeja’s property. “Based on the complaint filed by Sweety’s brother Jaydeep Patel, a case of murder and disposing evidence has been lodged against Desai and Jadeja with Karjan police station. Inspector D B Barad will carry out further investigation,” said Chudasama. The case received a lot of attention due to Desai’s suspected involvement in Sweety’s disappearance from the beginning. Sources said, “He hadn’t shown much interest in tracking down Sweety. Also, being a police officer, Desai knew the possible ways an investigation could turn and had tried to destroy evidence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-48-days-on-cop-confesses-to-killing-lover-destroying-evidence/articleshow/84721502.cms||---

He will also soon be reunited with his family in Kerala after 45 years. Thangal cut off communication with family in Kollam district after he narrowly escaped a crash of an Indian Airlines plane in Mumbai on October 12, 1976, which killed 95 people. “Thangal used to organise Indian cultural programmes at Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the 70s. In October 1976, South Indian actress Rani Chandra and others had gone to UAE for one such event. While flying back from Abu Dhabi to Madras, via Bombay, Thangal decided not to go with the troupe, and escaped the crash, while all of the troupe, including Chandra, died,” said the founder of Social and Evangelical Association for Love (SEAL) Ashram, Pastor K M Philip, who gave shelter to the man. Philip added that Thangal suffered from post-traumatic stress and related psychological issues after the crash, in which his friend Sudhakaran also died. He started doing odd jobs in Mumbai, like filling visa and passport forms for others and worked in the catering line to survive in the city. “In 2019, he was admitted to our shelter as a very frail old, sick man. But he slowly recovered and started narrating the story of his life . On getting his village, Shasthamkotta, address in Kollam, we were surprised to know that his 91-year-old mother Fathima Beevi is there along with his younger brothers and sisters,” added Philip. Talking to social activists over the phone in Malayalam, his mother broke down and said, “All these years we were hoping against hope that he is alive. His father Yunus Kunju, who died in 2012, helped several people in Kerala; so we were praying that his good deeds will help us find our lost son.” Thangal has three younger brothers and four sisters; his family had earlier checked if his name was in the list of the crash victims. When they could not find it, they hoped someday Thangal will contact them. At the SEAL shelter, Thangal said, “I first moved to UAE from my village in 1971. I worked as a storekeeper and did few other jobs. I later started organising Indian cultural events. After the crash I got a big shock. I was afraid there may be an inquiry against me as I had survived. I did not earn much money in UAE, so I did not want to go back to my family in such a sorry state.” Pastor Philip said, “Since there are so many missing persons in India, we at SEAL are working on a project on how to help them reunite with their families. Had Thangal not been cared for when he became ill, he may have gone away without his family knowing it.” Watch Kerala man Sajjad Thangal reunites with family after 45 years||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/man-reunited-with-kin-45-years-after-air-crash/articleshow/84721573.cms||Vijay Singh
---||India||Murder an accidental death, says court, asks insurer to pay ₹15 lakh||AHMEDABAD: A consumer court has ordered the Life Insurance Corporation to pay Rs 14.6 lakh for 19 different policies with accidental death benefits by considering the insured person’s murder an accidental death. Narendrasinh Parmar was shot dead by unidentified assailants in 2009. Police filed an FIR but later closed the case as they were unable to determine why Parmar had been killed and by whom. Parmar’s widow Chetna claimed the payouts for 19 different insurance policies with accidental death benefits that Parmar had. The claim was rejected on the grounds that Parmar was murdered and didn’t die in an accident. In 2012, Chetna approached the Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, Ahmedabad (Additional), but the forum rejected her complaint. The dispute reached the Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, which ordered the insurer to pay the claims, holding that Parmar was not a party to the murder, was not instrumental in provocation, and the immediate cause of action was not a result of a deliberate act by the insured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/murder-an-accidental-death-says-court-asks-insurer-to-pay-15-lakh/articleshow/84721579.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: BS Yediyurappa flags off Rs 1,800 crore projects for home district||BENGALURU: Ahead of July 26 — when he completes two years in office — chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Saturday virtually inaugurated a slew of development projects worth Rs 1,800 crore to be taken up in his home district, Shivamogga. Their inauguration at one go assumes significance in the wake of reports about leadership change in the state. The CM recently said he is expecting a call from the party brass about his future on Sunday and will abide by their decision. While most of the works are related to irrigation, some healthcare and construction-related projects were also launched. While some projects inaugurated were announced in the budget speech for the financial year, opposition JD(S) questioned Yediyurappa’s urgency to approve them. Former CM HD Kumaraswamy alleged the government approved Rs 12,000 crore works in a hurried manner over the past few days amid talks of leadership change. Some ruling party members, including senior MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, had also questioned Yediyurappa’s bonanza for his home district and accused him of neglecting other backward districts of North Karnataka. In March, the CM launched the Rs 105-crore Muguru lift irrigation project. He recently released funds to take up some politically significant projects, including Anubhava Mantapa linked to 12th century social reformer Basavanna, in Basavakalyana, Bidar district. On July 24, the CM unveiled a bust of Basavanna outside Gandhi Park in Shivamogga, which had been donated by Lambeth Basaveshwara Foundation, a UK-based non-profit organisation. Yediyurappa got voted to the assembly from Shikaripur, Shivamogga, nearly nine times since 1983, and his son BY Raghavendra is an MP from the region. “The development projects may be a thanksgiving gift for people of his district,” said some party MLAs. But deputy chief minister Govind Karjol denied reports that Yediyurappa was on his way out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bsy-flags-off-1800cr-projects-for-home-dist/articleshow/84715860.cms||---
---||India||Five protesters, four cops hurt in clash at Baghjan over payout||DIBRUGARH: A week-long agitation over allegedly delayed compensation to families affected by the Baghjan oil well blowout in Assam's Tinsukia flared up on Saturday, leaving five civilians and four cops injured in a hail of rubber bullets, tear gas shells and retaliatory stone-pelting by the protesters. The police said they used tear gas and rubber bullets only when the situation threatened to spiral out of control. The protesters, who are residents of the Baghjan area, had been squatting on the road leading to the oilfield every day for a week to demand release of the full quantum of compensation fixed by the National Green Tribunal. On Saturday morning, officials of the Tinsukia district administration, accompanied by a police and CRPF contingent, reached the site and asked the protesters to clear the road. As the blockade continued, orders were issued to evict the protesters by force. “We tried to reason with them, but they remained adamant. Ultimately, we had to lathicharge the protesters to disperse them. Some of them started throwing stones at the police, because of which we fired rubber bullets and burst teargas shells,” Tinsukia SP Debojit Deuri said. The protesters claimed that even after a year since the Baghjan blowout, most of the affected people were yet to receive the full compensation amount. OIL has been compensating them in a phased manner and many are still on the waiting list. “Instead of sympathising with the people, the government is resorting to high-handedness,” Satyajit Moran, president of the Baghjan Gaon Milanjyoti Yuba Sangha that is spearheading the protest, said. “Last year, the NGT’s expert panel fixed compensation of Rs 25 lakh to 173 families and Rs 20 lakh to 439 families affected by the Baghjan blowout. But as on date, only 12 families have received Rs 25 lakh, 161 families have received Rs 15 lakh and 439 families have received Rs 10 lakh,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/five-protesters-four-cops-hurt-in-clash-at-baghjan-over-payout/articleshow/84721615.cms||Rajib Dutta

The district is estimated to have 1,87,644 cases in the third wave, according to the models released. Ajit Pawar said learning from the experience from Iran, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Spain, South Africa and UK, there was a need to create enough capacity. The assessment was being done of cases during the peak of both the first and the second wave so that citizens did not face any difficulties in finding beds in case the third wave hits Maharashtra, he said. Against the backdrop of experts’ warning that the possible third wave might commence by August, Ajit Pawar said the administration would have to keep themselves ready on all fronts. “We are trying to increase the oxygen- and ventilator-supported beds by three times,” he said. On vaccination, Ajit Pawar said Pune district was carrying out inoculation according to the availability of doses. He said that Maharashtra had been demanding more vaccine supply to streamline the drives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/districts-should-be-ready-on-all-fronts-for-third-wave-says-maharashtra-deputy-cm-ajit-pawar/articleshow/84721619.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The injured have been shifted to Chittaranjan National Medical College and two people have been arrested. Around 11pm on Friday, miscreants opened fire and hurled bombs at the house of Manjur Alam Sardar in Netulatala village under Fulmani gram panchayat. Their target was Manjur’s relative, gram pradhan Yusuf Molla, who was scheduled to have dinner there. Manjur was hit by a bullet in the leg. His mother, Manwara Biwi (52), was shot dead as she rushed out of the house to save her son, who was bleeding profusely. Manjur’s associate, Hasan Sardar, was also heavily injured in the attack. Yusuf assumed charge of the gram panchayat last month, replacing upapradhan Sankar Sardar. Sardar had been running the panchayat in Yusuf’s absence after the latter was accused in a violence case a year ago and made to leave Basanti under a court directive. The rival group had refused to accept Yusuf’s reinstatement as pradhan.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Covid antibodies found in 50% kids screened for vax trial||KOLKATA: About 50% of the volunteers at a Covid vaccine clinical trial for children at the Institute of Child Health (ICH) Kolkata were recently deemed ineligible for the study. The reason: they already had Covid antibodies, indicating that they were infected by the Covid virus at some point but remained asymptomatic or escaped with mild symptoms. The exercise, however, was not a sero survey but a chance detection during a mandatory screening of potential participants before enrolling them for the vaccine trial. Health experts say such data brings hope against the apprehension of a third wave where children are expected to be the most vulnerable. The institute at Park Circus, one of the oldest referral hospitals for children in India, was selected as one of the sites for the phase 3 clinical trial of Zydus Cadila’s ZyCov-D vaccine on children between 12 and 18 years of age. As part of a pan-India study, the Kolkata institute had aimed to enrol 100 volunteers. “About 50% of the children who were brought for the vaccine trial tested positive for Covid antibody. This means these children were unknowingly infected by the virus and have developed natural immunity. So, we had to keep them out of the trial,” said ICH professor Jaydeep Choudhury, co-investigator for the trial. Potential volunteers of a vaccine trial need to undergo a series of screening, including a check for antibodies, before they can be enrolled for the programme. Earlier this week, the ICMR, too, had come up with its sero-positivity report that found 57.2% children between the ages of 6 and 9 had antibodies against SARS-CoV2. For the paediatric population between 10 and 17 years, antibody prevalence was even higher at 61.6%. “Earlier, we found antibodies in certain children who had come to the hospital with suspected MIS-C (multisystem inflammatory syndrome) or unresolved fever of unknown origin. On testing, they were found to have Covid-19 antibodies. So, we already had an inkling of a good number of children having antibodies. Now, the ICH data along with the ICMR survey report brings a ray of hope,” said ICH associate professor Prabhas Prasun Giri. The fear about children being worst-hit during the possible third wave arose primarily because they are yet to be vaccinated though a section of health experts like IPGMER hepatology head Abhijit Chowdhury and neonatologist Arun Singh, national advisor with RBSK (Rashtra Bal Swasthya Karyakram), have been insisting that this apprehension has no scientific basis or evidence. “Children have been equally exposed to the virus as adults. It is just that their immature immune system don’t mount the kind of resistance to the virus like that of adults. That is the reason despite being infected they mostly remain asymptomatic exhibiting no sign of the infection,” said Chowdhury.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-antibodies-found-in-50-kids-screened-for-vax-trial/articleshow/84718198.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Didi lines up opposition meet at Delhi’s Banga Bhawan||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee is likely to attend a meeting in New Delhi’s Banga Bhawan during her July 26-30 visit for which senior opposition leaders will be invited, senior TMC leaders said on Saturday. The meeting has been tentatively scheduled on July 28 at 3 pm. Before that, on the same day, Mamata is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi around noon. The proposed meeting, unlike the other such meetings in the past, will not be held at the residence of any party leader. Mamata had in her July 21 meeting urged NCP leader Sharad Pawar and Congress leader P Chidambaram for a meeting with opposition leaders. According to sources, TMC has now taken the onus of organising the meeting given the short window of the CM’s Delhi travel itinerary. Sources said Trinamool national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee and poll strategist Prashant Kishor, who reached Delhi immediately after the July 21 meeting, are playing a key-role to revive the opposition “front”. A party leader said the presence of senior leaders of all opposition parties at Delhi’s Constitution Club for the July 21 virtual rally laid the groundwork for the meeting. In her July 21 address, Mamata also declared that she will invite all senior political leaders, including Pawar and Congress president Sonia Gandhi, for a winter rally at the Brigade Parade Grounds if Covid remained under control. In the July 21 meeting, apart from Pawar and Chidambaram, Supriya Sule (NCP), Digvijay Singh (Congress), SP’s Ram Gopal Yadav and Jaya Bachchan, DMK’s Tiruchi Siva, TRS’s K Keshava Rao, AAP’s Sanjay Singh, RJD’s Manoj Jha, Shiv Sena’s Priyanka Chaturvedi and SAD’s Balwinder Singh Bhunder had attended. It is likely all these parties will also attend the Banga Bhawan meeting. These meetings, sources said, are a culmination of several political parleys after the Bengal polls. Kishor had met several leaders, including Pawar and Rahul Gandhi. In the interim, Abhishek after being made the party national general secretary, had broadly outlined that TMC will now take the fight to Delhi. On June 22, former Union minister and now TMC vice-president Yashwant Sinha was part of an informal meeting of leaders and former MPs at Pawar’s residence in Delhi. In her July 21 speech, Mamata urged senior opposition leaders “not to waste a single day” and to set aside “self-interests for national interest” to “work together, make a front” for “people will never forgive us if we don’t”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/didi-likely-to-meet-oppn-leaders-at-banga-bhawan-on-wed/articleshow/84718304.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Going Places||Kolkata: Park Street has flaunted the ‘Food Boulevard’ title here for decades, thanks to its wide assortment of eateries that offer everything from fast munch to fine dining experience. But now, a clutch of city thoroughfares is vying for the coveted crown. From American cafes to fusion fare, Southern Avenue, Sarat Bose Road, Kasba and New Town are going the whole hog to steal the spotlight from Park Street. Ranjan Biswas, the owner of Saptapadi that offers authentic Bengali cuisine on Southern Avenue, says “plenty of parking space is a major driving factor”. Grant Walsh, who runs 8th Day, an American cafe, believes Southern Avenue has a great vibe, which in turn is a crowd magnet. “We love places brimming with energy and this stretch is one of them,” he said. The USP of Sarat Bose Road, on the other hand, is its “cosmo crowd, and well-balanced blend of commercial and residential establishments”, according to Aakarsh Bhargava, the owner of My Big Fat Belly. “We are one of the few authentic American cafes in the city. So, our bagels, cookies and cinnamon rolls transport guests from Kolkata to New York in the blink of an eye,” Walsh said. Siddhant Dalmia runs Dosa Coffee on Sarat Bose Road “to bring a slice of south India to the east” and to cater to the vegetarian population in the city. “Some of our dishes like Malkapodi Idli, Guntur Karampodi Dosa, Ghee Roast Dosa and Malabar Paratha with Upma are hot favourites. We have a branch in Salt Lake Sector 3 and are now excited to open at Forum Mall,” he said. At Chinar Park, there’s the nostalgic connect. Divya Mishra, owner of Dacres Lane, a cloud kitchen in Chinar Park, said: “We are inspired by Dacres Lane, and our specialities include English breakfast, chicken stew, bread-butter-ghugni, French toast, poha, vegetable daliya, sandwiches and wraps.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/going-places/articleshow/84719399.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal BJP goes all out to confine Mamata to state||Kolkata: While Mamata Banerjee’s party is using all its might to corner the Narendra Modi government in Parliament, Bengal BJP is planning to strike the Trinamool at source in Bengal. Gearing up for a statewide stir based on the NHRC panel’s report to Calcutta High Court, the state BJP will also raise livelihood issues such as increasing unemployment and migration to expand its public outreach. Like the Sahid Shraddhanjali Diwas held on July 21, Bengal BJP will observe Paschimbanga Banchao Diwas on August 16 while TMC observes Khela Hobe Diwas. “What is this khela (game) all about? Unemployment in Bengal has reached 26%, which is above the unemployment rate in some neighbouring states. The state government announced 28 lakh jobs a few days ago. Where are the jobs? Skilled people from Bengal are leaving the state to find jobs elsewhere,” Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said on Saturday. Pointing to Bengal’s burgeoning debt burden, Ghosh added: “The state’s debt burden will reach Rs 4,52,429 crore in 21-22. Where is the money going? Is a portion of it wasted as cut money?” The BJP state president also lashed out over the “poor plight” of the much-touted Silicon Valley project and deserted Tata Nano compound in Singur. “How many units have come to Silicon Valley? Cows are grazing in the compound. There is neither any trace of industry, nor farming. TMC is now pleading with the Tatas to make a comeback,” he said. Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari met BJP president JP Nadda in Delhi on Friday after calling on Union home minister Amit Shah to fine-tune the agitation programmes in the pipeline. The party BJP brass is likely to overhaul Bengal BJP organisation soon, said a source. Ghosh rubbished the TMC charge that the Centre was not giving enough vaccines to the state. “Let the state government come clear on the 90.7 lakh doses it received from the Centre free in July. Citizens are being charged anything between Rs 250 and Rs 1,250 to get a jab,” he said. The BJP leader asked Trinamool leaders to look at themselves before throwing stones at the Modi government. “The state government has been using Pegasus spyware. It has sold out Metro Dairy and East Bengal Club,” Ghosh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-bjp-goes-all-out-to-confine-mamata-to-state/articleshow/84718388.cms||Rohit Khanna

Family members and the party claimed that Anesur Rahman had been murdered. Rahman, a TMC convener of Harishchandrapur-2 block, had left his home on the morning of July 18 and wasn’t heard from again. Wife Maseda Bibi said that he was not seen at the brick kiln he owned either. It is believed that he was abducted from the road. A complaint was lodged at the local Bhaluka outpost and Harishchandrapur police station the following day. Although no phone call was received demanding ransom, party leaders hinted at a financial motive for the alleged abduction. TMC panchayat member Maqbul Hosain said: “We have heard that Rahman had a tiff with some people at Kaliachak regarding his business. This might be the cause behind his abduction. Let police do the inquiry.” On Friday, a photo of the hanging body found near Dalkhola went viral on social media. The body was recovered by Balarampur police station and sent to Katihar Medical College for postmortem. It was sent home on Saturday morning. Brother Saidur Rahman said: “It is evident that my brother was brutally killed and hanged. We want a probe on this matter by none other than CBI.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/missing-tmc-leader-found-hanging-from-tree-in-bihar/articleshow/84718401.cms||Subhro Maitra

The duo were produced before a lower district court on Saturday. On July 2, the Calcutta High Court had ordered a second autopsy on Abhijit after his brother, Biswajit Sarkar, urged the court to seek a DNA test of the deceased and said his brother’s body had been damaged by maggots in the morgue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2-more-held-in-bjp-leaders-murder-case/articleshow/84718285.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||A Recipe for Success||Kolkata: When you fall in love at first bite, the secret ingredient is unbridled passion. Meet this bunch of first-generation entrepreneurs from the City of Joy who have turned their home-grown brands into a gastronomic tradition in Bengal and beyond. Debaditya Chaudhury, the managing director of Chowman, Oudh 1590 and Chapter 2, grew up seeing people flock to an old Chinese restaurant in south Kolkata and it sowed the desire to have his own grub hub someday. He was still a member of the Bengali rock band ‘Lakkhichhara’ when he turned his childhood dream into reality. “I travelled and tried out local cuisine. What came as a surprise was the contrast between Chinese food in India and the authentic dishes prepared in China. That inspired the first Chowman in 2010 — a 350sqft eatery for 16 guests at a time. Today, we have 18 outlets in the city. Our latest outlet opened in Serampore, Hooghly,” Chaudhury said. The brand has travelled beyond Bengal with three cloud kitchens in Bengaluru. “We are about to open our first dine-in outlet at Kalyan Nagar this month. Two more are on the cards in Bengaluru by December-end,” he added. Asked if the Covid pandemic has impacted business, Chaudhury said: “Even though dine-in suffered, our delivery business went up by 35%. Amid the pandemic, we opened six new outlets and retained all our employees. If things go as planned, the business will expand to Mumbai in 2022, followed by Delhi in 2023 and Hyderabad in 2024. The aim is to emerge as a national brand by 2025.” The journey of Bhojohori Manna began in 2003 from a garage off Ekdalia where five friends met. Currently, Rajeev Neogi, Siddhartha Sankar Bose, Siddhartha ‘Topse’ Chatterjee, ace filmmaker Goutam Ghose and Ranjit Dutta Gupta (the board of directors) have 10 outlets in the city and three others in Siliguri, Puri and Bengaluru. “My experience with Bhojohori Manna has been a significant one. The footfall at our outlets has been the highest and the credit goes to all the foodies of Kolkata,” Bose said. “At present, we are focused on remodelling and restructuring of business. We had to shut down some outlets, including base kitchens, in Mumbai, Bengaluru, Bhubaneswar and Garia owing to factors like high rentals and curbs on dine-in. We have relocated two outlets from Shyambazar and Sector V (Salt Lake) to Chinar Park and Down Town Mall in New Town. Our sales are down to 30% of normal times. We will draw up future plans once things swing back to normalcy,” Bose added. Savourites Hospitality Private Limited launched in 1998 with three directors — S Ramani, Aninda Palit and chef Sushanta Sengupta. In 2002, they forayed into the fine dining segment with 6 Ballygunge Place. “We have three 6 Ballygunge Place outlets, two of The Wall, two quick-service restaurants (QSR) and a lounge. Our recent addition is 6 BP Takeaway and we have also launched our authentic Tamil cuisine with Ramanee. We are coming up with 6 Ballygunge Place Chowringhee and post-pandemic, we are ready to open in Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and London,” said Ramani. The lockdown gave Savourites Hospitality only 20% business. “With restaurants opening now, we are approximately at 60% of pre-Covid business,” Ramani added. For Sagar Daryani, the CEO and co-founder of Wow! Momo, the “dumpling dream” began in college. During group study with friend Binod Homagai, he would order momo and that’s where the idea gained meat. The duo started the momo chain immediately after final exams in 2008 with an initial investment of Rs 30,000. They were only 21. Today, it is the largest home-grown QSR chain in the country with 350 outlets across 17 cities. “We have 120 outlets in Kolkata and its suburbs alone. North Bengal, Durgapur and Kharagpur are on our radar. The plan is to raise the number of pan-India outlets to 400 by year-end. We have just forayed into FMCG with instant momos and received good response in just 15 days. Our own delivery platform will go live soon,” Daryani said. While the Covid first wave was disastrous, the brand is now pandemic-proof. “We rolled up our sleeves and focused on growing our delivery business and building capabilities beyond QSR for maximum reach,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/a-recipe-for-success/articleshow/84718997.cms||Sarthak.G
---||Kolkata||Trinamool nominates Jawhar Sircar for Rajya Sabha||KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress on Saturday packed a surprise by nominating Jawhar Sircar, the former Prasar Bharati CEO who has been a vocal critic of the Narendra Modi government, for Rajya Sabha. Sircar, in his first reaction, said: “I too am surprised, there were so many well-known politicians and VIPs (to choose from).” Sircar stepping into the RS as an MP appears foregone given TMC’s two-third majority in the Bengal assembly even though BJP isn’t keen to give him a walkover yet. In a short statement, TMC said it was “delighted” to nominate Sircar and his “invaluable contribution to public service shall help us serve our country even better”. Sircar fills in one of the two vacant Rajya Sabha seats from Bengal, and he is expected to replace Dinesh Trivedi, who resigned from the Upper House on February 12 and defected to BJP. Immediately after the party’s nomination, Derek O’Brien, TMC’s Rajya Sabha leader, took to Twitter to post, “Jawhar Da, see you soon in Rajya Sabha. In #Parliament Looking forward. Match on #KhelaHobe.” Sources said Sircar appeared to be a late entrant in the list for TMC’s possible nominees, clogged by political veterans, including party vice-president Yashwant Sinha. BJP Bengal president Dilip Ghosh, asked if the party will also field a RS candidate to take on Sircar, said, “We have not taken a decision (on this) as yet.” A Presidency College political science graduate, Sircar joined the IAS in 1975 and has seen Emergency. The 1952-born Sircar said his first task would be to expose the “worser Emergency” under BJP’s tenure. Sircar, who put down his papers as the Prasar Bharati CEO in 2016, has been a fierce critic of the Modi government. “Ï have one mission: to expose Modi’s emergency rule,” he said. “I left my job in 2016 and since then I have been trying to show how the Centre is misleading people and causing untold miseries. I had almost 42 years of public service,” he said, adding, “When I had joined IAS it was an Emergency and now it is something which is harsher than Emergency. We have to fight to end it.” “Since 2016, I have been writing on history and culture. I did join several apolitical protests as a member of civil society. In fact, after my last book — ‘The construction of the Hindu identity in Medieval West Bengal: The popular cults’ — got critical acclaim from historians and foreign universities, I was keen on research and writing,” said the former Union culture secretary. Sircar said the nomination was “unexpected because I had never thought of joining politics” but now he intended to use it best to raise his voice for the people. Sircar is currently chairman of the board of governors of the prestigious Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Kolkata, a research and teaching institute set up in 1973. Sircar had more recently strongly criticised the Centre’s moves over the former Bengal chief secretary, prompting the latter to refuse a three-month extension and choose retirement instead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/trinamool-nominates-jawhar-sircar-for-rajya-sabha/articleshow/84718259.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

On Saturday, city schools cheered as several of their students scored in the high 90s and the school toppers were mostly placed in the 99%-plus category. Though the Council did not declare how many students in Bengal had scored 90% or more, indications are that the figure could match or even overtake that of HS, in which 9,013 students scored 90% and above. With board examinations cancelled, the CISCE had used a complex statistical formula to calculate the marks of each candidate. “This time, the students didn’t get to write the exams at all and were particularly stressed about the outcome. But I am happy to say they are relieved and happy at the marks,” said Seema Sapru, principal of Heritage School, where 75 students have scored above 95% and five above 99%. The school’s highest was achieved by Harshit Jain, who notched up 99.8% and was touted to be the country topper. The Council, however, has not officially released a merit list this year. The overall ISC pass percentage in Bengal was 99.63% with girls outdoing boys yet again in the success rate. In a large number of schools, the toppers missed the perfect score by a whisker. Modern High School had three students with 99.5% marks and the school’s ISC average was 94.30%. La Martiniere for Girls principal Rupkatha Sarkar said 40% of their students had secured over 95%. “The ISC class average is 92.8%. We are extremely happy,” she said. In some schools like DPS New Town, 199 students achieved 90%-plus scores. Some schools felt the formula-based assessment worked to the advantage of average students, who have mostly been placed in the 79%-85% category. Educationists said ISC students could have an edge over HS students because only a little over 9,000 state board students had scored over 90%. The CBSE Class XII results are awaited. The CBSE XII marks are being calculated using a formula that gives 30% weightage to Class X board marks, 30% to Class XI school performance and 40% to Class XII pre-boards. The actual marks of practical exams and projects of Class XII boards are also factored in. The CBSE recently asked schools to moderate marks of students and resend data by July 25 after it found the number of students with 95%-plus marks ballooning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/high-isc-scores-raise-hopes-of-better-admission-prospect-this-yr/articleshow/84718131.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

According to the results announced by CISCE, 99.95% students in ICSE and 99.7% students in ISC cleared examinations across the state. The pass percentage for both ICSE and ISC went up by 1.4% and 3.9%, respectively. Nationally, 99.98% students passed ICSE while 99.76% cleared ISC. Total 46,889 students, including 20,221 girls, appeared for Class 10 examination from UP. Out of them, 46,867 students were successful while 22 failed. In Class 12, 31,801 students, including 13,869 girls, took the examination. A total of 31,709 students passed while 92 flunked. UP has 386 ICSE and 307 ISC schools. Genderwise, the results showed that girls outshone boys in both Class 10 and 12. While 99.96% girls cleared Class 10 examination as against 99.95% boys, 99.8% girls in Class 12 were promoted as compared to 99.6% boys.

Likewise in ISC, 99.7% students from SC and OBC categories and 99.2% from ST were declared successful. There were 1,957, 121, and 7,757 students from SC, ST and OBC who took the ISC examinations from UP. Chief executive and secretary, CISCE, Gerry Arathoon said given the exceptional circumstances this year, CISCE did not publish the merit lists for ICSE and ISC examinations. Arathoon commended the school heads for working in close cooperation with the Council to ensure successful compilation of the results. “While devising the methodology for computing marks, the endeavour was to ensure fairness to all candidates concerned to the best possible extent,” Arathoon said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/99-95-students-clear-icse-99-7-pass-isc-in-uttar-pradesh/articleshow/84721629.cms||Isha Jain

The people said the one who provides food,” read the flex board, which bears a huge portrait of Pinarayi Vijayan. Authorities at the Pachiri Maha Vishnu temple said the board came up along the main road to coincide with the swearing-in of the second LDF government in May. While temple authorities said CPM activists had put up the flex board, local CPM leaders said the party had no role in the incident. There was another flex board with photographs of the CM and cabinet ministers installed alongside it that said that the places where prominent temples were located had “turned Red” this election. The second flex board had asked what further proof was needed in elections that the gods were communist.

---||World||In a shift, US CDC says those at risk may need booster||WASHINGTON: Biden administration health officials increasingly think that vulnerable populations will need booster shots even as research continues into how long the Covid vaccines remain effective. Senior officials now say they expect that people who are 65 and older or who have compromised immune systems will most likely need a third shot from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna. That is a sharp shift from just a few weeks ago, when the administration said it thought there was not enough evidence to back boosters yet. On Thursday, a key official at the Centers for Disease Control said the agency is exploring options to give patients with compromised immune systems third doses even before regulators broaden the emergency-use authorisation for vaccines, a step that could come soon for the Pfizer vaccine. Dr. Amanda Cohn, chief medical officer of the CDC’s immunisations division, told an advisory committee to the agency that officials were “actively looking into ways” to provide certain people access to booster shots “earlier than any potential change in regulatory decisions.” “So stay tuned,” she added. The growing consensus within the administration that at least some Americans will need a booster is tied in part to research suggesting that the Pfizer vaccine is less effective against Covid after about six months. The mostrecent figures from the Israeli ministry of health, released late this week, suggested that Pfizer’s vaccine was just 39% effective in preventing infection in that country in June and July, compared with 95% from January to April. The shot remained over 90% effective in preventing severe disease and nearly as effective in preventing hospitalisation.

---||World||Persuasion vs coercion: Vax debate heats up||PARIS: As Europe and the US scramble to find an appropriate balance between curbing the Delta variant of the coronavirus and curbing personal freedom, President Macron of France has led the way down a narrow path combining limited compulsion to get vaccinated with widespread coercion. His approach of ordering health workers to get vaccinated by September 15, and telling the rest of the population they will be denied access to most indoor public venues if unvaccinated or without a negative test by August 1, has prompted other countries including Italy to follow suit, even as it has stirred resistance. “You are creating a society of generalised control for months, maybe years,” Eric Coquerel, a lawmaker from the far-left France Unbowed party, said during a 48-hour parliamentary debate on Macron’s measures that ended on Friday with a narrow victory for the president. Europe’s problem is similar to that of the US: vaccination levels that, at around or just under 60%, are inadequate for herd immunity. But where the US has generally not gone beyond hospitals and health systems requiring employees to get shots, European economies including France and Italy are moving closer to making vaccines mandatory for everyone. Macron’s measures, announced on July 12, have spurred both protests and an extraordinary surge in vaccinations, with 3.7 million booked in the first week after the president spoke. The socalled “health law” would oblige the French to get a health pass — known in Italy as a “green pass” — showing they have been vaccinated, or recently tested negative, if they want to go to restaurants. The French draft law will now go to the Senate. Besides France, people also took to the streets in Australia, Greece and Italy on Saturday in protests against lockdowns, compulsory vaccination plans and efforts to prod reluctant citizens into getting jabs through sanctions against the unvaccinated.

The department also wants to change the state board’s curriculum to give the international touch to schooling in Gujarat. The state government is looking for tie-ups with other international boards too. A key source aware of the developments said, “The state is considering a dedicated international board or a dedicated curriculum for the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board which can match international curricula.” The move to adopt an international curriculum may mean not adhering to the model of the NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training). But sources said that all states have been permitted under the new national education policy (NEP) to form their own curricula. “The objective is to benchmark school curriculum with 21st century international education,” the source said. “Through a bilingual medium, this curriculum will build English and 21st century skills in all students.” The source said internationally benchmarked assessment systems will be followed. The aim is to prepare students thoroughly for the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2024. PISA measures 15-year-old students’ reading, mathematics, and science competencies. Sources further said that consultations have begun with multiple boards, including the Cambridge Board and the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE). Best practices from these boards as well as from the International Baccalaureate are being studied, sources said. “Recently, the country representative of Cambridge met the top officials of the state government,” the source said. “The modalities of long-term ties were deliberated upon. Also discussed were the upgrade of curricula in line with the Cambridge Board’s standards and teacher training.” Govt considering adoption of international curricula’The state government is also in talks with the CISCE to build international curriculum in partnership with globally acclaimed educational boards. In the past also, the state government claimed to have ties with international boards, but such projects were gradually given up. State education secretary Vinod Rao said: “To help our students qualify for international exams, the government is considering the adoption of international curricula for our proposed schools of excellence chain.” He added: “That will help the state in preparing a large number of our students for international studies.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/curriculum-overhaul-gujarat-seeks-to-tie-up-with-cambridge-board/articleshow/84721701.cms||Kapil Dave

In a phone call, Biden and Ghani “agreed that the Taliban’s current offensive is in direct contradiction to the movement’s claim to support a negotiated settlement of the conflict”, the White House said. The call came soon after Taliban demanded Ghani’s ouster. In an interview with AP on Friday, Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen had said there won’t be peace in Afghanistan until there is a new negotiated government in Kabul and Ghani is removed. Violence has risen since the withdrawal plan was announced in April, with the Taliban launching offensives, taking districts and important border crossings. Biden told Ghani the US would remain engaged diplomatically “in support of a durable and just political settlement”, the White House said. The US is also preparing to begin evacuating thousands of Afghan applicants for special immigration visas who risk retaliation from Taliban insurgents because they worked for the US government. Biden on Friday authorised up to $100 million from an emergency fund to meet “unexpected urgent” refugee needs stemming from the situation, the White House said. He also authorised the release of $200 million in services and articles from the inventories of US agencies to meet the same needs, it said.

---||India||Mountbattens' unseen personal diaries published amid UK court battle, but 1947-’48 diaries and letters mysteriously ‘withheld’||LONDON: A battle to force the publication of all the personal diaries and letters of Lord and Lady Mountbatten that are in the Broadland Archive, which could shed light on the royal family, the relationship between Edwina Mountbatten and Jawaharlal Nehru, the fairness of drawing the Partition borders and the Mountbattens’ views of Gandhi, Nehru and Jinnah, has had some success as a huge tranche of their diaries was published this week for the first time. Diaries up to 1960 were released digitally on Thursday, four days after an early day motion signed by 22 British MPs was tabled in the House of Commons on July 19 calling for "their publication without further obfuscation and delay". Andrew Lownie, author of "The Mountbattens", has spent £250,000 (Rs 2.5 crore) and raised £50,000 (Rs 51 lakh) through a crowdfunding campaign to fund a court battle to get all their diaries up to 1960, and the couple’s letters to each other, released. The University of Southampton bought the Broadland Archives — some 4,500 boxes dating from the 16th century CE to the present, centred on the Temple (Palmerston), Ashley, Cassel and Mountbatten families, which include the diaries and letters of the Mountbattens — from the trustees of the archive in 2011 for £4.5 million (Rs 46 crore), relying on a £1.9 million grant ( 19 crore ) from the National Memorial Heritage Fund. But immediately the university closed off all 47 volumes of Lord Mountbatten’s diaries and all 36 volumes of Lady Mountbatten’s diaries, and their letters to each other, citing "directions from the Cabinet Office". Lord Mountbatten’s diaries for 1943, 1947 and 1948, and Lady Mountbatten’s diaries for 1947 and 1948 (when she was Vicereine of India), still remain mysteriously withheld from the public, as do Nehru and Edwina’s letters to each other and the Mountbatten correspondence. The 1947 diary is among the longest. A University of Southampton spokesperson said: "After communication from the Cabinet Office, the university has been able to make available online early diaries of Earl Mountbatten of Burma, for the period 1918-1934, and diaries of Countess Mountbatten of Burma, 1923-1934. In addition, some selected diaries up to 1960 have also now been published. The material is online. As part of the allocation of the archives in August 2011, the University was directed to keep a small number of the papers closed until we were otherwise advised. The university has always aimed to make public as much of the collection as is possible whilst balancing all its legal obligations." "They have not released all the diaries and I’ll have to check if any are redacted and they have not released any of their letters to each other. So still much is held back. Why are they withholding the 1947/1948 diaries," Lownie said. "No university should be blocking public access to archive material of great historical significance which it purchased using public money. Will I get my £250,000 back?" The diaries for 1947 and ’48 are likely to reveal more of the Mountbattens’ views of Jinnah, Gandhi, Nehru, and British officials like Cyril Radcliffe, who drew the boundary between India and Pakistan, the communal violence, why decisions were made, how close they were to Nehru, and how impartial or not they were, Lownie said. "These are crucial questions if we are looking at Indian Independence and Partition and an important source for Indian historians." Central support to his crowdfunding campaign has come from "various Pakistani businessmen and historians," he said. "If Mountbatten’s diary says he had had lunch with Radcliffe, that is significant because the line has always been there was no interference. If the diary says the Mountbattens invited Nehru to stay, Lord Mountbatten was not meant to be inviting one of the Indian leaders and not the other. I think we will get a lot from this on how fair Partition was," he added. After unsuccessful Freedom of Information requests to obtain the diaries and letters, Lownie complained to the regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which ordered the university to disclose them in December 2019. The university released the first tranche up to 1934 digitally in May, and this latest tranche up to 1960 on Thursday. But with the support of the Cabinet Office, the university is appealing the ICO decision to the First Tier Tribunal. The hearing will take place in November. The Cabinet Office said, "Before he retired as Chief of Defence Staff in 1965, the first Earl Mountbatten accepted that personal diaries could not be put into the public domain without first being vetted. Earl Mountbatten made clear that ownership of all of these papers would be handed over to the Broadlands Trustees. In 1969, the Broadlands Trustees entered into undertakings not to give general or particular access to these papers without the express permission of the Prime Minister of the day through the Cabinet Secretary." Lownie said his battle for the release of all the diaries up to 1960, and the couple’s letters to each other, will continue. After that he will fight for access to the Nehru-Edwina letters, as well as "a whole series of missing files" in the Mountbatten inventory. Lownie said in his view it was the royal family preventing their release and that was why the Cabinet Office was involved. "It is clear — members of the Royal Household are copied in on all the correspondence."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mountbattens-unseen-personal-diaries-published-amid-uk-court-battle-but-1947-48-diaries-and-letters-mysteriously-withheld/articleshow/84721756.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||Chandigarh||AFT: Reinstate soldier, now fit, invalidated out 7 years back||CHANDIGARH: Seven years after a soldier was invalidated out of service due to low medical category, the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) has ordered the military authorities to reinstate him as he has been declared medically fit now. It has directed the Army authorities to reinstate him in the same rank in which he was invalidated out of service in 2014. The AFT has made it clear that if a soldier released on medical grounds for a specific period is totally cured , he may be reinstated in the service. However, the tribunal made it clear that the soldier would not be entitled to any back wages for the period he remained out of service. AFT's Lucknow bench, comprising Justice Umesh Chandra Srivastava, judicial member and Vice Admiral Abhay Raghunath Karve, administrative member, has passed these orders while allowing an application filed by an armoured corps former soldier Anuj Pratap Singh. Army had rejected soldier’s reinstatement plea in May 2019Applicant was enrolled in the Indian Army on September 28, 2012, and was invalided out of service on July 21, 2014, in terms of clause 13 (3), Item IV of Army Rules, 1954 in low medical category having rendered one year, nine months and 18 days of service. The applicant was initially placed in the low medical category. The medical authorities opined that "in view of the sequelae of tuberculosis in the form of residual structure changes and functional deficit in spirometry," the individual will not make a fit soldier. The Invaliding Medical Board (IMB) held at Military Hospital, Pune on June 24, 2014, assessed his disability "New Smear and Culture Positive Pulmonary Tuberculosis (now smear negative)" at 100% for two till June 2016 and opined the disability as attributable to military service. He was granted service element at 4,275 per month and disability amount of Rs 3,510 per month for two years. His disability was again assessed 100% for another two years till May 12, 2018. Further re-assessment medical board of the applicant was held at military hospital on April 13, 2018, and his disability was assessed at "Nil for life" and the medical specialist opined that “No further Re-Assessment Medical Board required”6. Accordingly, the disability amount was discontinued from May 13, 2018. Thereafter, the applicant submitted an appeal to the Army chief for reinstatement into service. However, the Army authorities on May 14, 2019, dismissed his plea, stating "there are no such provisions for reinstatement in the Army once discharged from service". The applicant approached the AFT contending that at the time of enrolment, he was found mentally and physically fit for service in the Army and there was no note in the service documents that he was suffering from any disease at the time of enrolment. He claimed reinstatement citing regulation 143 of the Defence Service Regulations, 1987. The rule provides, “Exservicemen, medically boarded out without any disability pension or those whose disability pensions have been stopped because of their disability having been reassessed below 20% by the re-survey boards, will be eligible for re-enrolment, either in combatant or non-combatant (enrolled) capacity in the Army, provided they are remedically boarded and declared fit by the medical authorities." After hearing all the parties, the AFT has held that the plea of the military authorities that there is no such provision of reinstatement is not tenable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aft-reinstate-soldier-now-fit-invalidated-out-7-years-back/articleshow/84721761.cms||Ajay Sura

---||Kochi||Kerala govt insurance schemes a non-starter for Covid treatment in private hospitals||KOCHI: In Kerala, almost 80% of patients had to pay out of their own pocket for Covid treatment in private hospitals. Only 8% availed the benefits of government insurance schemes and another 12% had private insurance. Till June 30, 2021, almost 8.2% of the total population (29,24,166 people) had Covid infection and of that an estimated 4,38,625 required hospitalization with many requiring ICU and ventilator support. During the initial phase of the first Covid wave, Covid treatment was limited to government hospitals. However, from October, private hospitals were roped in for treatment and now 50% of Covid hospital admissions, mostly category C patients (mainly critical patients), are treated in private hospitals. An analysis of hospitalization trends in southern states by Project Jeevan Raksha, a public-private partnership initiative involving Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), that has been submitted to central and state governments shows that in Kerala, till June 15, only 34,755 had sought treatment in private hospitals under government schemes and another 51,102 made claims under individual health insurance schemes. ‘Kerala Covid management disappointing in second wave’This clearly indicates that in Kerala preference of empaneled hospitals for direct payment admission is relatively higher understandably due to higher per bed realization or profit. More disturbing is that even people who had taken insurance cover seem to have been denied admission. Kerala government has failed to regulate admissions effectively. On the other hand, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka have been successful in ensuring the maximum number of people having medical insurance schemes either government or private are able to leverage on the available benefits," said Mysore Sanjeev, convener of Project Jeevan Raksha, which puts out monthly Covid projections for each state. This despite almost 5.7% of the population having group or individual health insurance (non-government schemes) in Kerala, while in India, it is only 2.4%. Another, 41.5 lakh families (almost half of state’s population) are covered under Karunya Arogya Suraksha Paddhati (KASP), a healthcare scheme of the state government under which approximately 19 lakh additional families get the benefits of Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) along with the existing 21.87 families. “Kerala Covid management, especially in the second wave, is disappointing. It has neither controlled the virus spread nor effectively regulated empaneled hospitals in bed allocation for insured people (government scheme or private). People seem to be scared of getting isolated in hospitals due to non-affordability,” said Sanjeev. However, an official with the state health agency said, “Majority of Covid treatment is in government hospitals and Covid treatment is completely free here for all. Only very critical patients were referred to private hospitals.” Police check vehicles in front of the Secretariat as part of weekend lockdown, in Thiruvananthapuram on SaturdayDue to out-of-pocket expenditure, according to Project Jeevan Raksha, during the second Covid wave, hospitalization in Kerala was less than 15% while that in neighboring Tamil Nadu was around 30%. However, the number of people on ventilator support among active cases increased by three times in Kerala. On October 10, 2020, only 189 of 95,918 active cases were on ventilator support, which works out to only 0.2%, whereas on July 10, 2021, out of 1.15 lakh active cases, 707 people were on ventilator, which is 0.6% of total active cases – indicating that due to delayed hospitalization, the condition of more number of moderately infected people deteriorated, leading to them slipping into critical condition. Kerala Private Hospitals Association (KPHA) secretary Dr Joseph Benaven admitted that almost 80% of the patients admitted to private hospitals paid out of pocket. “Almost 90% Covid patients to private hospitals are direct walk-ins. Not many patients covered under the government insurance schemes have been referred to private hospitals and there is ambiguity regarding the KASP scheme when it comes to Covid treatment. Realizing that the majority have to pay out of pocket, most private hospitals have tried to ensure that the patient’s health and finances are protected,” said Dr Benaven. Though during the Covid peak government had issued an order bringing in price regulation after the Kerala high court intervened and said that all private hospitals will have to reserve 50% beds for Covid treatment, of which 25 % will be for KASP patients, the fact remains that only 281 of the 1,286 private hospitals are empaneled for Covid treatment under KASP. So far, the state health agency has received 71,484 KASP claims amounting to Rs 227 crore, of which more than Rs 100 crore has already been released.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-govt-insurance-schemes-a-non-starter-for-covid-treatment-in-private-hospitals/articleshow/84721933.cms||Preetu Nair

She started her strike around 5pm, and four hours later, police reached the spot with an electrician and rectified her complaint. Subsequently, she ended her protest. “After my calls yielded no action, I went to the station and filed a written complaint. Two policemen came to the convent, enquired about the matter and went back without doing anything. That is when I decided to go on strike,” said Sr Lucy. She said that she called off the strike as the issue was rectified by 9PM. “They reinstalled the power supply to the area where I wash my clothes. The switchboard in the washroom was also corrected. They also installed lights in the way I used to go and have meals,” said Sr Lucy. She said that it is unfortunate that she has to take such drastic steps to gain basic facilities in a place that she has lived for years. “They keep saying that I have no rights here. I have worked hard for decades for this place. After taking the money that I earned for all these years, how can they say one fine day that I have no rights here,” she asked. Sr Lucy was earlier expelled by the congregation alleging that she violated the rules of FCC. However, she moved civil courts against her eviction from the convent. Sr Lucy was one among the prominent faces in the protest demanding the arrest of bishop Franco Mulakkal who is an accused in the nun rape case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-sister-lucy-kalappura-ends-strike-after-cops-intervene/articleshow/84722012.cms||---

The collector, who is also the chairman of the district pokkali land development authority (PLDA), directed the deputy director of fisheries to withhold the issuing of licence required for the subsequent saline aquaculture cropping if the padashekaram committee does not finish the dewatering process by Tuesday. The district principal agriculture officer and Chellanam agriculture officer (AO) have been given the responsibility to supervise the dewatering operations. The Chellanam village officer (VO) has been directed to monitor the water level in the Padashekharam daily. The VO has been authorized to handle the situation arising out of power line disruption/ failure. Chellanam AO has been asked to file a report on the completion of the dewatering process on Tuesday. The move follows a meeting of officials of the panchayat and agriculture and fisheries departments held at Chellanam on Friday, where it was pointed out that the padashekaram had not dewatered the farms despite several calls and letters issued by the officials concerned. Despite the high court directing that the farms be released for paddy cultivation, the committee did not follow the orders. One of the farmers, 73-year-old Chandu Manjadiparambil, filed a contempt petition against the district collector in May following which the court ordered that farms be dewatered immediately. The high court has asked the district collector to file a report on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ernakulam-dewater-field-to-facilitate-pokkali-farming-at-chellanam-says-district-collector-jafar-malik/articleshow/84722046.cms||---

---||Gurgaon||Agency that was in charge of biopark upkeep will develop Gurgaon urban forest||Gurgaon: The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has finalised iamgurgaon, a city-based NGO, as the agency for the development of an urban forest in Sikanderpur and Chakkarpur areas. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) in this regard has been signed between the two agencies. According to GMDA officials, they found iamgurgaon’s proposal to be the most feasible after an evaluation of the three proposals submitted to them. “On the basis of the proposal it submitted, we have finalised iamgurgaon as the agency for the urban forest project,” an official said. The NGO was responsible for the maintenance of the Aravali Biodiversity Park until recently, when Hero MotoCorp took over its upkeep. Latika Thakural, the co-founder of the NGO, confirmed the development and said they signed an MoU with GMDA on Thursday. “We have finalised the MoU and are currently going through the maps and other details of the project site,” said Thakural. She added that they would soon begin an inspection of the site. Thereafter, the agency plans to start planting saplings. The urban forest will be developed over an area of 200 acres in the city. It will come up on the land which was earlier illegally occupied by squatters and was popularly known as the marble market. TOI had earlier reported that three agencies — DLF Foundation, iamgurgaon and IORA Ecological Solutions — had expressed interest in the project and were asked to submit their proposals to GMDA for further evaluation. The project was approved by the chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar in GMDA’s last authority meeting held in April. The scope of the project will include fencing of the area, establishment and maintenance of wood blocks with emphasis on locally-appropriate tree and shrub species, theme-based plantations and establishment and maintenance of public facilities. The agency will not claim any funds from GMDA and arrange for funds on its own. As of now, Gurgaon does not have an urban forest. The only place that comes close is the Aravali Biodiversity Park. In the absence of other green areas in the city, the proposed urban forest will not only provide a public place for residents, but also help increase Gurgaon’s green cover. The city’s per capita green cover, according to GMDA’s own estimates, is 7 sqm, whereas it should ideally be 9 sqm. Some within GMDA have, however, disputed the metropolitan authority’s green cover estimates, and said the figure is likely to further come down in the coming years owing to new infrastructure projects and felling of trees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/agency-that-was-in-charge-of-biopark-upkeep-will-develop-gurgaon-urban-forest/articleshow/84719854.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||It’s time for hope, again: Why this Olympics may be different||(By Jitender Dabas) It is that season of hope again. As the world’s biggest sporting event begins in Tokyo amid the global pandemic, it is time for Indians to build their hopes again. A nation of 1.3 billion people is again looking for its Olympic glory. By the time you read this, hopefully, more than one young Indian athlete would have set the tone for the next 10 days. As a nation, we have had a chequered relationship with the world’s biggest sporting event. Olympic glory is something that has eluded us as a nation. For very long, the Olympics were a reminder of how a nation of 1 billion-plus people hasn’t been able to produce Olympic champions. Success at global sporting events has a huge contribution in the self-esteem of citizens and is a source of national prestige. As India marched ahead as a nation over the last few decades, we achieved success in all fields. We produced global CEOs, became an economic force to reckon with, even tested our own nuclear bomb and sent a satellite to Mars. But the Olympics have been a different story. Growing up in the 80s, our greatest stories of individual sporting triumphs were of those who missed the podiums at the Olympics by a whisker (Milkha Singh and PT Usha). We grew up with 4th-placed athletes as our heroes. As a nation, we didn’t win any individual medal for more than four decades after 1952. I often wondered if we, as a nation, took Pierre de Coubertin’s saying about participation and not winning being more important at the Olympics more seriously than any other country. Every four years, the Olympics would come and leave us disappointed. No wonder, our love for cricket grew manifold during this period. We could beat the world (okay, about 10-12 countries) and feel good about ourselves as a nation. Cricket not only gave us excitement but also a lot of self-esteem (especially after hockey, our national game, went into a decline post the 1970s). However, cricket and hockey were team sports and we needed world-beating individuals. Exceptions like Prakash Padukone and Vishwanathan Anand could never get us that elusive individual Olympic gold as their games didn’t feature in the event. Despite all this, the Olympics remain very special. Apart from collective glory, the Olympics are also about an individual’s quest to become the very best in the world. And there is nothing more inspiring than that. The story of Olympic glory is made of heroism, determination and dedication of years. That’s why individual successes inspire thousands of kids. We waited around six decades for the first ever (and only till date) gold by Abhinav Bindra in 2008. That inspired a generation of kids to take up shooting. No wonder, the Indian shooting team in 2021 has nine young shooters who are ranked among the top few in the world. That’s why, hopefully, the Olympics this year could change our relationship with the event. The Tokyo contingent is full of athletes who represent the “Naya India”. Unaffected by history and confident of the future, a number of these young athletes are ranked 1 or 2 in their fields. The team is full of inspiring stories of teenagers who have risen to become world beaters. Soccer and cricket give us unparalleled excitement, but individual sports give us heroes. Kids around the world look up to them, especially when they hear of the trials and tribulations they endured just to get to the Olympics, let alone the struggle for the gold. In 2010, a 14-year-old Yashaswini Deswal got inspired by watching Indian shooters win medals at the Commonwealth Games. In Tokyo, she is world No.1 in 10m air pistol and a medal hope for India. So, the next 10 days in Tokyo, will, hopefully, not only change India’s relationship with the Olympics, but also tell thousands of youngsters across the country that they can be world-beaters too in whatever fields they choose. If there is anything you should be watching with your kids over the next week, it should be what’s happening in Tokyo. This could possibly be the best Olympics to watch as an Indian.

The residents complained that the razor-sharp wire has been laid horizontally on the central verge, which pose a serious risk to residents, especially children, senior citizen sand stray animals trying to pass through the divider. The residents alleged that the RWA is creating bedding of barbed wire, which is not visible and could cause injury at low light. VMK Singh, a resident, said, “The use of barbed wire in such a manner is potentially harmful.” Abhey Poonia, another resident, said, “They can use a rope or other alternatives. They also need the installation to be vertical so that it is visible to everyone,” he said. Taru Sharma, joint secretary of the RWA, said: “The barbed wire has been placed on the central verge to prevent people and animals from stepping over the saplings. It is a temporary arrangement and a net will be placed in the space soon.” Meanwhile, a senior official of the MCG said that they have yet to receive any complaint on the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/barbed-wire-on-central-verge-angers-suncity-residents/articleshow/84719919.cms||Akanksha Gupta

The hospital and its doctors have been accused of negligence during the abortion of a 34-year-old woman, whose left forearm had to be amputated following an infection. Vinita, the victim, and her husband Sarfaraz said that though they had approached police and the health department, no action was taken against the doctors. With no option left, they finally approached the court of judicial magistrate first class Harsh Kumar Singh, who on Friday directed the SHO of the Udyog Vihar police station to file an FIR and submit a copy of the same by July 29. Vinita, who works as a domestic staff, went to the little-known Park Hospital — not the one in Sector 47 near South City II — for abortion on April 23. After the abortion, she was administered an antibiotic injection that allegedly caused a reaction due to which her left forearm turned black within few days. “We went to the hospital again but were told by the doctors there that the reaction was due to an infection. We were subsequently referred to Delhi’s RML Hospital for an ultrasound scan. But by that time, the infection had spread so much that her left forearm had to be amputated to save her life,” Sarfaraz told TOI. A driver by profession, Sarfaraz lost his job last year due to the pandemic. And being the only breadwinner for the family, Vinita was unable to go to work. It was then that Pure Hearts, an NGO came forward and arranged for her medical treatment at a private hospital in Delhi. Dr Mathew Verghese, who conducted the surgery for free at St Stephen’s Hospital, said, “It was distressing to see the immense trauma suffered by this woman. Though the loss of limb was unavoidable, my team endeavoured to facilitate her optimum recovery.” The couple made rounds of the local police station and thye district health department. Finally, with support from the NGO, they approached the court. “While her life will not be the same again after losing her forearm, the least that can be done is to compensate her for the loss of livelihood and inconvenience caused due to the hospital's negligence,” said her lawyers, Ambika Yadav and Rachna Bakhru. “I visited the hospital for abortion and due to the negligence of the doctors, my life changed forever. I have two small kids, nobody should face such things,” said Vinita. Despite repeated attempts, Park Hospital authorities could not be contacted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/34-year-old-loses-forearm-fir-ordered-against-hospital/articleshow/84719920.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Gurgaon||‘Revenge for marital rift’: 6-year-old killed in Gurugram||GURUGRAM: A 30-year-old man allegedly kidnapped and killed the six-year-old son of his wife’s maternal aunt, enraged by her interference in his family life. Guddu Kumar Sahni, who was arrested by the crime branch on Saturday, told cops that he committed the crime to take revenge on the relative for causing a rift between the couple and inciting his wife to eventually leave him. Originally from Samastipur in Bihar, Guddu lived with his wife in a rented accommodation at Basai Enclave in Sector 10. Guddu, according to police, claimed they would often have fights over small matters. And in June, his parents-in-law and his wife’s maternal aunt visited their house to counsel them. But their fights didn’t stop and a few days later, his wife returned to her parents’ home in Panipat. “Guddu, a daily wager, used to think that his wife’s family, particularly her maternal aunt (who lives in the same neighbourhood), instigated his spouse to leave him. He used to hold them responsible for the rift in the family,” said ACP (crime) Preet Pal Sangwan. “Being neighbours, the aunt used to visit the family often and counsel them. Guudu thought that she was the one who took his wife back to Panipat.” On July 22, Guudu allegedly kidnapped the minor boy while he was playing outside the latter’s house in Sector 10. He allegedly lured the boy to a vacant plot and strangled him. He subsequently smashed the face of the boy with bricks and hid the body in the bushes. The body of the boy was recovered on Saturday after the arrest of the accused. The boy’s father, Budhu Sahni, lodged a missing person’s complaint at the Sector 10 police station a day later. In his complaint, Budhu claimed that he and his wife went out for work, leaving their four children at home and when they returned later in the evening, one of them was missing. “Despite all our efforts, we could not locate our child and finally approached the police,” said Budhu. ACP Sangwan said a police team was formed to trace the child soon after the complaint was lodged. “With the help of technical surveillance and human intelligence, we zeroed in on the suspect. During interrogation, he confessed to having killed the boy. Guudu told us that he wanted to take revenge on his wife’s aunt as she was the one responsible for all the problems in his family,” he added. A case under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC was registered at the Sector 10 police station against Guddu on Saturday. He was produced in a court and sent to 14-day judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/revenge-for-marital-rift-6-year-old-killed/articleshow/84719962.cms||Bagish Jha

The pass percentage of students in Kerala in the ICSE and ISC exams were 100% and 99.96%, respectively. In 2020, the pass percentage rates for the ICSE and ISC exams were 99.96% and 99.48%, respectively. This year, the pass percentage is higher than the national average of 99.98% (ICSE) and 99.76% (ISC). As the exams were not held last year due to the pandemic, the results were tabulated through a special assessment policy using student’s performance in previous exams and internal marks. “Given the exceptional circumstances under which the results have been prepared, this year too, the CISCE will not be publishing the merit lists for the ICSE & ISC year 2021 exams,” said Gerry Arathoon, chief executive and secretary of the council. In Kerala, 158 and 68 schools presented candidates for the ICSE and ISC exams, respectively, this year. While 7,787 students appeared for ICSE exam, 2,775 students appeared for ISC exam.

---||Kochi||Canal project in Kochi meets with fresh hurdles||KOCHI: The Integrated Urban Regeneration and Water Transport System (IURWTS) project to rejuvenate six major canals in the city has met with a fresh hurdle. A tussle has erupted between KMRL, the nodal agency, and the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) over a sewage treatment network which is a component of the Rs 1,526 crore worth project. KMRL wants to entrust construction of the sewage treatment network with KWA. But KWA is not ready to take over the work. “It is because KWA has expertise in sewage treatment projects that we want the agency to take over the work. We can move ahead with the project only after a clear decision on who will do the sewage project,” an official associated with the IURWTS project said. Besides the rejuvenation of major canals in the city, the project also targets construction of sewage treatment network and plant. Most of the houses and establishments on the shores of the six canals open the outlets of their toilets into these waterbodies. It is to avoid the pollution that a sewage treatment plant also is being included in the project. In what can be termed as another hurdle, the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA) has returned the application for environmental clearance for the project seeking further clarifications. The application submitted by KMRL is pending before KCZMA for the past several months as the Metro agency is unable to clear back-to-back doubts raised by KCZMA. “We got the note from KCZMA seeking clarifications on floodgates we are to construct as part of the project. Though the meeting of KCZMA was held on July 2, we got the note a couple of days ago only. We will soon give reply to the authority,” an official with KMRL said. Similarly, the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), the funding agency, which sat on the detailed project report (DPR) of the project since June 2020, has now asked the KMRL to rework the tariff for the works and submit the DPR again. Officials associated with the project said that they will submit the revised DPR without much delay. After Alkesh Kumar Sharma, who was the managing director of KMRL, left for taking over new duties with the Centre, the Metro agency is almost a headless institution. Though the government gave K R Jyothilal the additional charge of KMRL, he is unable to focus on the Metro and its projects due to multiple responsibilities he holds with various government departments. The work on IURWTS project should be completed within 40 months of starting the project. Even after three years, the work is yet to be started.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/canal-project-in-kochi-meets-with-fresh-hurdles/articleshow/84722243.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
