A cloudy sky, short but recurrent spells of rainfall and the sun playing peekaboo on rare occasions — citizens are soaking it all in. Twitter is aflutter with posts on the cloudy and chilly weather. From lack of motivation to do any work to finding it hard to dry their clothes, Bengalureans are churning out memes and jokes. “Is it only me or Bangalore does feel like Ooty at the moment?” reads a tweet by Vandana Sharma. Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) had announced that parts of Bengaluru will experience rain and overcast sky till Saturday night. It predicted “generally cloudy sky with isolated very light to moderate rain in the city”. As Bengaluru continues to receive intermittent drizzle for almost a week now, the weather has become a talking point for netizens, many of whom are blaming it for not getting any work done and even pitching it as a point of envy for other cities in the country which are humid and slightly hot at present. ‘Can’t get any work done’Twitter user Shrinivassg said: “How-do-you-even-work-in-this-weather” season in Bangalore,” while Rakshith S Ponnathpur, a policy researcher, tweeted: “Dear Bangalore weather, can you suck for few hours a day so that we can all get some work done?” Another Twitter user Shruthi shared several netizens’ thoughts: “Bengaluru people should have cosy weather holidays added with rest of leave policies!” Sathwik tweeted: “Bengaluru weather right now is like that one friend - “Aree bhai chal na, bad mein kar lena kaam (Hey bro, let us go, work later).” Some argued the city’s weather was the best in the country. “Bengaluru has the best weather among the metropolitan cities in India. Change my mind!” Sachinn tweeted. Dinesh Nair shared a picture of a hazy city horizon with the tweet: “I am confused. Am in Namma Bengaluru or in Manali? And it’s not overflowing (with tourists)! Kick-ass weather. Very hill station types! This is a really wonderful city to live in! The weather — can’t get that in any other part of India!” A user with the handle @BLRrocKS concurred with Nair. “Bengaluru weather is so awesome, this morning! Feels like a hill station. Enjoy Maadi!” he tweeted. Netizens also shared memes celebrating the weather — from frozen TV characters to their own pictures in sweaters and socks. Some miss the sunHowever, not everyone was enthused. While some Bengalureans said they hated the gloomy weather, some felt it aggravated their allergies. Shashi T, a techie, said she has been sneezing due to her allergies and suffering from a headache. “I know my opinion will raise eyebrows, but I am tired of this weather. Though I like the feel of it, it is scary during a pandemic to experience cough and sneezing,” she added. Kirti Patnaik tweeted: “Unpopular opinion. I am sick of the cold and the rain in Bengaluru. I desperately want the sun.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/citys-hill-station-weather-bowls-over-netizens/articleshow/84689900.cms||Farheen Hussain

Though there was no rain on the coast, heavy rain in the plains, near Yellapur, has wreaked havoc in the district. Landslides were reported from many places. The district administration, with the help of the Navy, Coast Guard, police, SDRF and NDRF, rescued many people in Karwar and Ankola taluks. The district received 224mm rainfall against the normal 34mm. Deputy commissioner Mullai Mugilan said 79 villages were affected and two persons died. Mugilan and superintendent of police Shivaprakash Devaraju said there was a flood-like situation on the lower banks of Kadra dam across Kali river and on both sides of Gangavali river. Though water level in Aghanashini river is going up, the situation is under control, the DC said. The DC added that the situation on the banks of Kali worsened after heavy rain in the basin. There was an inflow of 1.5 lakh cusecs into Kadra dam and 2.1 lakh cusecs into Kodasalli dam. The flow of Kali water was very heavy and to maintain the level in both dams, water was released. Five naval boats, a helicopter, two teams of SDRF and a 20-member NDRF team evacuated people, he added. Some who refused to shift to safer places were caught in flood waters and were rescued after several attempts. Kaiga township of NPCIL in Mallapur near Karwar is marooned. Rescue teams faced a landslide in Anashi ghat area, Arabail ghat on NH63. Six persons who sneaked into forest near Shirle Falls in Yellapur on Thursday without informing police and forest officials were rescued on Friday morning. Till Friday evening, over 3,000 people were shifted to safer places in Karwar and Ankola. Navy helicopters and boats were used to rescue 48 people stranded in two hotels in Ankola. Hundred people were rescued by boat at Sinagudda and Bhaire villages and eight personnel were brought safely by a helicopter at Dongri .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/uttara-kannada-reels-under-heavy-showers-in-plains-3000-evacuated/articleshow/84689938.cms||---

The incident occurred when the class 8 student had ventured into a maize farm to answer nature’s call. Police suspect her abusers followed her into the field. The girl had been left alone at home since her parents had taken her younger sister to Bharamasagara PHC. Her parents were alarmed on not finding their teenage daughter at home on returning, and after enquiring with neighbours, they learnt she had left for the field. After searching the field, they found her maimed body – the girl had sustained injuries on her cheek and neck. A case has been booked under Pocso Act and an FIR filed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/13-yr-old-girl-raped-killed-in-village/articleshow/84689953.cms||---
---||World||G20 ministers sign deal but stuck on global warming caps||NAPLES: G20 environment and energy ministers announced on Friday an agreement that re-affirms commitment to the 2015 Paris Agreement, although they failed to agree to wording on global warming caps. Following two days of environment and climate talks in Naples, Italy's Ecological Transition Minister, Roberto Cingolani, said negotiations were "particularly complex" but expressed satisfaction with the result. "This deal is fundamental for opening the way to the COP26," said Cingolani, referring to November's UN climate talks in Glasgow. However, two articles out of 60 were struck from the document as they could not be agreed upon, he said. Those will now be taken up by G20 heads of state for decision-making. One involved the wording of limitations on global warming increases to 1.5 to 2 percent as set by the 2015 Paris Agreement, adopted by nearly 200 countries, said Cingolani, speaking to journalists. The Paris Agreement calls to collectively cap warming at "well below" two degrees Celsius and 1.5 degrees if possible. "Everyone is committed to decarbonization, the question is on the time scale," Cingolani said. "Some countries risk economically not being able to do it." The Naples gathering came two weeks after the G20 meeting of finance ministers in Venice, in which the final statement cited carbon pricing as a possible tool to fight global warming. "Everyone from China to India to the United States, Russia and European countries agreed that, especially after the pandemic phase, the energy transition to renewable energy is a tool for inclusive and fast socio-economic growth, job creation and must be a just transition that leaves no one behind," read a communique published on Friday evening after the ministers' talks ended. COP26 will gather climate negotiators from 196 countries and the European Union, along with businesses, experts and world leaders in Glasgow between November 1-12. COP26 was originally scheduled for November 2020 but was pushed back due to the pandemic. Groups of activists protested in Naples during the conference with one banner reading, "The G20 is dancing on the Titanic, save the planet".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/g20-ministers-sign-deal-but-stuck-on-global-warming-caps/articleshow/84689842.cms||---
---||World||Chief wants Kansas site included in unmarked graves search||The leader of an American Indian tribe is concerned that a former Kansas boarding school will be left out of a federal initiative seeking to determine whether thousands of Native American children were buried at schools across the country in the 1800s and early 1900s. Shawnee Tribe Chief Ben Barnes said federal authorities have not indicated whether the Shawnee Indian Mission in Fairway, Kansas, would be part of the investigation US Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland launched last month. Barnes said he and others worry the Kansas school could be overlooked because it was run by the Methodist church, rather than the federal government, as were many other boarding schools for Indigenous children.  Much of the conversation since the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative was announced has centered on federally run schools such as the notorious Carlisle Indian Reform School in Pennsylvania, which promoted the idea of erasing American Indian culture and assimilating Indigenous children into white society. Barnes noted many of the boarding schools, including the one in Kansas, operated for decades before the Carlisle school opened in 1879.  "There's been a lot of rumor and innuendo about what they are going to investigate," Barnes said. "We are in touch with the federal government and lobbyists to help educate them that the Indian mission system didn't start with Carlisle."  A spokesman for the Department of the Interior said in an email the agency has only recently begun working on the federal program and no information was yet available about individual locations.  Barnes said making distinctions between federally run schools that forcibly removed children from their families and church-run schools that "persuaded" families to send their children to the schools is offensive "hair-splitting" because both types had the same mission.  Congress contracted with Indian agents to work with missionaries to convince Native American families to send their children to church-run schools. They attempted to convince the families they would have no future if they stayed with their tribes, which had been forced to walk to Kansas in the 1800s as part of what became known as the Trail of Tears, Barnes said.  "It was coercion," Barnes said. "(Tribal families) were told if they wanted to fit in, they needed to not act so different, behave and get along. It was considered the best solution for our future."  When discussing the initiative in June, Haaland acknowledged the process will be painful and difficult but said it was necessary to address the lasting trauma caused by the schools. The US effort came after close to 1,000 unmarked graves were discovered at former residential school sites in Canada in the last several months.  Bobbie Athon, a spokeswoman for the Kansas State Historical Society, which owns the mission in Fairway, said the agency has not been contacted by federal officials but would be happy to work with the initiative if asked.  Barnes said the Shawnee Tribe, which has headquarters in Miami, Oklahoma, has a strong working relationship with the historic society and the city of Fairway, which oversees the mission's daily operations. He said it should be the federal government's responsibility to investigate the mission site.  The Shawnee Indian Methodist Manual Labor School was started at its present site in 1939 by Thomas Johnson, a Methodist minister for whom Johnson County was later named. Children from many tribes attended and were taught basic academics, manual arts and agriculture, according to the historical society. At one point, it had 16 buildings on more than 2,000 acres, with nearly 200 students a year ranging in age from 5 to 23.  Barnes said Johnson, a slave owner, and others forced Native Americans to pay for the construction materials and build the school, and tribal families paid up to $20 per student to attend. He contends Johnson became rich off the school because the children spent most of their time doing manual labor rather than academics.  Most of the original 2,000 acres owned by the mission have been developed. At a minimum, the Shawnee Tribe wants the federal government to conduct ground-penetrating radar searches on the 12 acres that remain at the mission site to search for unmarked graves.  But Barnes said he is hopeful the new attention on the boarding schools will prompt national leaders to make the resources available to seriously address their painful legacy.  "Let's use this moment, not to just genuflect toward the cause of good and right, let's really do something," he said "We know Shawnee children died at that mission. We want those kids' names. Someone wrote them down somewhere. Who has the record? Where did they go? What more can they do to find out?"  Barnes said a part of him hopes no graves are found at the site but if they are, the tribe would hold private conversations about how to honor the children.  "I'm not sure I could bear it if we were to find them," he said. "I don't know how we could make it right. But I have an obligation to the families, as the descendants' leader, to demand that we look."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/chief-wants-kansas-site-included-in-unmarked-graves-search/articleshow/84691077.cms||---

The airport has merged the extended runway of 1300 feet with the existing runway and all allied work will be completed by August 31. Facilities like Instrument Landing System (ILS) and CAT-1 lights have already been installed and commissioned at the airport. “The commencement of the night flight operations will give impetus to the local economy, investment by enhancing aerial connectivity and increasing tourism footfall in the region. It will also provide much needed flexibility for residents of the Jammu division to travel to the national capital and beyond,” said Sinha. The J&K administration recently signed an MoU with Go Air for subsidised transportation of vegetables and fruits from Jammu and Kashmir by air. First consignments of Srinagar’s cherries and Jammu’s litchis will soon be dispatched to Dubai and Mumbai, respectively. The formal inauguration of the cargo facility is expected soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lt-guv-flags-off-night-flight-ops-at-jammu-airport/articleshow/84690836.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

In a written reply, the food and consumer affairs ministry told Rajya Sabha on Friday that 23,493 out of the 86,696 food samples that were analysed were found non-conforming to the standards and 4,675 samples were found to be “unsafe”. Another 11,027 of the samples that were analysed were found as substandard. According to the government data, a maximum of 1,921 food samples were found unsafe in Uttar Pradesh, followed by Tamil Nadu (1,221) and Kerala (543). Meghalaya was the only state where all 48 samples were found to be conforming with the prescribed standards. The ministry informed the Upper House that 20,959 civil cases were registered against the offenders and 13,195 cases were decided. Another 3,608 criminal cases were initiated against the violators and 486 cases were decided. According to the ministry, the state government agencies have raised a penalty of Rs 4.21 crore against the violators. It said no separate data is available with respect to action taken in respect of food grain distributed at PDS shops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nearly-27-food-samples-found-substandard-in-2020-21-one-in-five-such-samples-found-unsafe-govt-in-rs/articleshow/84692041.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||World||Pak asks UN to probe Imran's phone hacking by India||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan called on "relevant United Nations bodies" on Friday to "thoroughly investigate" reports about India allegedly using the Israeli-origin spyware "Pegasus" to spy on Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, besides Indian opposition politicians, activists, journalists and global leaders. The Pakistan foreign office said that "in view of the gravity of these reports" it was asking the UN to "bring the facts to light, and hold the Indian perpetrators to account". In a collaborative investigation into a data leak, the use of the software Pegasus, developed by Israel’s NSO (Niv, Shalev and Omri) Group, was reported last week by the Washington Post, the Guardian, Le Monde and 14 other news outlets. "We have noted with serious concern the recent international media reports exposing the Indian government’s organised spying operations against its own citizens, foreigners as well as Prime Minister Imran Khan, using an Israeli-origin spyware," Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhry said in a statement. "Keeping a clandestine tab on dissenting voices is a long-standing textbook ploy of the RSS-BJP regime to commit human rights atrocities in Jammu and Kashmir and peddle disinformation against Pakistan," read the statement. At least one mobile number once used by PM Imran Khan was also targeted by the NSO Group and its Pegasus malware, which is capable of switching a phone’s camera or microphone on and harvesting its data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pak-asks-un-to-probe-imrans-phone-hacking-by-india/articleshow/84692635.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||India||Top commander among Lashkar duo killed in J&K encounter||SRINAGAR: Two Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists, including a top commander, were killed in an encounter in Sopore’s Warpora area in north Kashmir’s Baramulla district on Friday. The slain terrorists were identified as self-styled commander Fayaz Ahmad War alias Rukana alias Umar, a resident of Warpora; and his aide Shaheen Ahmad Mir alias Shaheen Molvi, a resident of Budgam’s Cherpora, IGP (Kashmir range) Vijay Kumar said. Both were part of groups involved in numerous terror crimes. With War’s killing, the last perpetrator of recent violence in north Kashmir has been slain, said IGP Kumar. Among the terrorists killed in Kashmir Valley this year, most belonged to Lashkar, official records revealed. Instrumental in planning and executing attacks on security establishments besides civilian killings, War was one of the most wanted terrorists in north Kashmir, the IGP said. Active since 2008, War was earlier associated with terrorist outfit Hizbul Mujahideen before surrendering with arms and ammunition and being detained under the Public Safety Act. After his release in March 2020, he again picked up arms and joined Lashkar. He was the last active terrorist who perpetrated a series of various terror crimes and violence in north Kashmir, including attacking a police party at Warpora in March last year in which a cop and a civilian were killed; killing three CRPF personnel and a civilian at Ahad Baba crossing a month later; killing a CRPF trooper and a civilian in Sopore; killing two municipal councillors and a cop in Sopore, and killing two policemen and two civilians at Main Chowk Sopore. War was also involved in a series of grenade attacks on police and security establishments in several areas in Sopore. On May 26, 2020, he carried out a grenade attack on a police post in Potukhah; on December 12, 2020, he carried out a grenade attack on PP Bus Stand in which four civilians were injured; on March 13, 2021, he conducted another grenade attack on PP Bus Stand in which two cops were injured. Giving details of Friday’s encounter, the IGP said a joint team of the Army, J&K Police and CRPF launched a cordon-and-search operation in Warpora late Thursday evening. Holed-in terrorists were repeatedly asked to surrender, but they rained bullets on the search party, triggering a gunfight in which the Lashkar duo was killed. Arms and ammunition and other incriminating items were recovered from the spot of the encounter, the IGP added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/top-commander-among-lashkar-duo-killed-in-jk-encounter/articleshow/84692732.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||World||Search for bodies concludes at Florida condo collapse site||MIAMI: Firefighters on Friday declared the end of their search for bodies at the site of a collapsed Florida condo building, concluding a month of painstaking work removing layers of dangerous debris that were once piled several stories high.  The June 24 collapse at the oceanside tower killed 97 people, with at least one more missing person yet to be identified. The site has been mostly swept flat and the rubble moved to a Miami warehouse. Although forensic scientists are still at work, including examining the debris at the warehouse, there are no more bodies to be found where the building once stood.  Except during the early hours after the collapse, survivors never emerged. Search teams spent weeks battling the hazards of the rubble, including an unstable portion of the building that teetered above, a recurring fire, and Florida's stifling summer heat and thunderstorms. They went through more than 14,000 tons (13,000 metric tonnes) of broken concrete and rebar, often working boulder by bounder, rock by rock, before finally declaring the mission complete. Miami-Dade Fire Rescue's urban search-and-rescue team pulled away from the disaster site Friday in a convoy of fire trucks and other vehicles, slowly driving to their headquarters for a news conference to announce that the search was officially over.  At a ceremony, Fire Chief Alan Cominsky saluted the firefighters who worked 12-hour shifts while camping out at the site.  "It's obviously devastating. It's obviously a difficult situation across the board," Cominsky said. "I couldn't be prouder of the men and women that represent Miami-Dade Fire Rescue."  Officials have declined to clarify whether they have one additional set of human remains in the hand that pathologists are struggling to identify or whether a search for that final set of remains continues.  If found, Estelle Hedaya would bring the death toll to 98.  Hedaya was an outgoing 54-year-old who loved to travel and was fond of striking up conversations with strangers. Her younger brother Ikey has given DNA samples and visited the site twice to see the search efforts for himself.  "As we enter month two alone, without any other families, we feel helpless," he told The Associated Press on Friday. He said he gets frequent updates from the medical examiner's office.  Leah Sutton, who knew Hedaya since birth and considered herself a second mother to her, is worried that she will be forgotten.  "They seem to be packing up and congratulating everyone on a job well done. And yes, they deserve all the accolades, but after they find Estelle."  The collapse also fueled a race to inspect other aging residential towers in Florida and beyond, and it raised broader questions about the nation's regulations governing condominium associations and building safety.  Shortly after the collapse, it became clear that warnings about Champlain Towers South, which opened in 1981, had gone unheeded. A 2018 engineering report detailed cracked and degraded concrete support beams in the underground parking garage and other problems that would cost nearly $10 million to fix.  The repairs did not happen, and the estimate grew to $15 million this year as the owners of the building's 136 units and its governing condo board squabbled over the cost, especially after a Surfside town inspector told them the building was safe.  A complete collapse was all but impossible to imagine. As many officials said in the catastrophe's first days, buildings of that size do not just collapse in the U.S. outside of a terrorist attack. Even tornadoes, hurricanes, and earthquakes rarely bring them down.  The disaster was one of the nation's deadliest engineering failures. A set of overhead walkways collapsed at a Kansas City hotel in 1981, killing 114 people attending a dance. But that wasn't the structure itself. A Washington, D.C., movie theater collapsed in 1922, killing 98. But that came after a blizzard dumped feet of snow on the flat roof.  In the weeks after the collapse, a 28-story courthouse in downtown Miami, built-in 1928, and two apartment buildings were closed after inspectors uncovered structural problems. They will remain shut until repairs are made.  The first calls to 911 came at about 1:20 am when Champlain residents reported that the parking garage had collapsed. A woman standing on her balcony called her husband, who was on a business trip, and said the swimming pool had fallen into the garage.  Then, in an instant, a section of the L-shaped building fell straight down. Eight seconds later, another section followed, leaving 35 people alive in the standing portion. In the initial hours, a teen was rescued, and firefighters believed others might be found alive. They took hope from noises emanating from inside the pile that might have been survivors tapping, but in retrospect, the sounds came from shifting debris.  Rescue crews worked tirelessly, even when smoke and heat from a fire inside the building's standing portion hampered their efforts. They persisted when the temperatures pushed into the upper 90s (35 Celsius) under the blazing sun, some toiling until they needed IVs to replenish fluids. They carried on when Tropical Storm Elsa passed nearby and dumped torrential rain. They left the pile only when lightning developed.  The portion of the building that remained standing posed another grave threat as it loomed precariously above the workers. Authorities ordered it demolished on July 4.  In the end, crews found no evidence that anyone who was found dead had survived the initial collapse, Cominsky said.  The dead included members of the area's large Orthodox Jewish community, the sister of Paraguay's first lady, her family and their nanny, as well as a local salesman, his wife, and their two young daughters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/search-for-bodies-concludes-at-florida-condo-collapse-site/articleshow/84692734.cms||---
---||India||Terror attack foiled, drone shot down in Jammu’s Akhnoor||JAMMU: Jammu and Kashmir Police on Friday claimed to have foiled a major terror bid by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad, and shot down an IED-fitted drone in Jammu’s Akhnoor area. Jammu ADGP Mukesh Singh confirmed that the threads found on this drone matched with those on the flying objects used to carry out the twin explosion at Jammu Air Force Station on June 27, which left two IAF personnel injured. The drone was a hexacopter (six-winged) fitted with a flight controller and GPS. It was loaded with 5kg ready-to-use IED, which could be triggered by assembling the wires, ADGP Singh said while addressing a press conference. The serial number on the flight controller used in the hexacopter was just one digit different from another drone earlier gunned down in Akhnoor, he added. Police had received a specific input that Jaish-e-Mohammad was planning to drop a payload using a drone near Akhnoor, based on which a team rushed to the area and began surveillance. “Around 1am, the team noticed the activity of a flying object and kept a close watch. Just as it was about to drop the payload, the cops shot it down,” ADGP Singh said. The drone was shot down around 8km from the international border in Gurah Pattan village, just about 10-12ft from the Jammu-Akhnoor national highway. The payload was supposed to be collected by someone. “We waited for a suspect but none turned up,” the ADGP said. The hexacopter was assembled and it was found that its parts were made in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Speaking about the connection between the back-to-back drone incidents in J&K, the ADGP said, “It seems that Jaish has assembled many such drones of the same series. Further investigation is underway.” The drones recovered in the recent past were used to drop payloads including AK-47 rifles and IED material. “Such drones can travel up to 20km depending on the payload,” ADGP Singh said, adding that in the past one-and-a-half year, J&K Police have so far recovered 16 AK-47 rifles, numerous magazines, 15 grenades and 18 IEDs air-dropped from Pakistan.

---||World||Do vaccinated people need to go back to masking?||WASHINGTON: With the Delta variant pushing US Covid cases back up, fully vaccinated people are wondering whether they need to start masking indoors again. Covid vaccines remain extremely effective against the worst outcomes of the disease (hospitalization and death) and breakthrough infections remain uncommon. But experts told AFP that one size doesn't fit all, and people should consider factors like community transmission, personal risk levels, and their own risk tolerance to help decide what's right for them. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention dropped its mask guidance for vaccinated people in May. At the time, cases were plummeting and the administration of President Joe Biden was keen to declare a return to normal on the back of a vaccination campaign that was still going strong. On Thursday the country registered more than 50,000 cases, a surge driven by the now overwhelmingly dominant Delta variant, the most contagious strain to date, and centered in low-vaccination regions. Crucially, however, the rise in cases has been largely decoupled from hospitalizations and deaths. With 80 percent of seniors fully vaccinated, average daily deaths remain in the 200's, much lower than the more than 3,500 deaths per day seen in the worst wave over winter. More than 97 percent of hospitalizations are among the unvaccinated, CDC director Rochelle Walensky said last week, while 99.5 percent of people dying were unvaccinated, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said last weekend. Walensky defended the unchanged mask guidance on Thursday, stressing the agency has always said communities and individuals should consider local conditions. "If you're in an area that has a high case rate and low rates of vaccination where Delta cases are rising, you should certainly be wearing a mask if you are unvaccinated," she said. "If you are vaccinated, you get exceptional protection from the vaccines. But you have the opportunity to make the personal choice to add extra layers of protection if you so choose." Joseph Allen, an associate professor at Harvard's TH Chan School of Public Health, said he supported the CDC's view. While the World Health Organization has urged fully vaccinated people to continue to wear masks, that is in light of the global situation where just 13.4 percent of the world population is fully vaccinated. "I just don't think we're at the phase in the US and other highly vaccinated countries where this top-down blanket guidance makes sense anymore," he told AFP. "For me, the goal is and has always been with all the vaccines to prevent severe disease, and death, and that's exactly what they do really well." As far as breakthrough infections go, a recent study of a US prison found 27 positive cases from 2,380 vaccinated individuals, or 1.1 percent. All were asymptomatic and detected through routine screening. Research shows that asymptomatic people are less likely to transmit, while people who develop symptoms are supposed to self-isolate, still, the greater the community prevalence of the virus, the more likely such breakthroughs become. People's personal risk levels vary by their age and underlying conditions, some people may have high risk people at home they want to protect, while some just have lower risk tolerance, the divergence in case levels across the country closely correlates with vaccination rates, and parts of Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana and Florida are currently experiencing the worst spikes. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease physician and epidemiologist, compared the situation prior to Delta surges to driving your car in your own neighborhood, while the current scenario is closer to driving on a race car track. "When you're driving around in your neighborhood, a seatbelt is enough," she told AFP, with the seatbelt representing a vaccine. "But if you're driving on a NASCAR race track, in addition to seatbelts, those drivers also have helmets, they have airbags," she added, emphasizing that masks add an additional layer of protection. Even without the CDC, some parts of the country, like Los Angeles County and Philadelphia, have reinstituted mask guidance. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease doctor at UC San Francisco told AFP she has been advocating for statistical benchmarks, "as the back and forth is very frustrating for people." She suggests tying mask mandates to the local hospitalization rate (a more reliable measure of disease prevalence than cases) and, along with other experts, has proposed fewer than five hospitalized cases per 100,000 people as the threshold for resuming normal activity. Gandhi, Allen and others argue such "off-ramps" can also be applied to schools when they reopen in fall, while the American Academy of Pediatrics favors universal masking, even among vaccinated teachers and students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/do-vaccinated-people-need-to-go-back-to-masking/articleshow/84692827.cms||---

Keegan Casteel's arrest for having a rifle with a laser sight and a handgun in his hotel room during the July Fourth holiday weekend prompted Mayor Lori Lightfoot and police Superintendent David Brown to suggest he may have intended to fire on Navy Pier crowds from his hotel window.  Casteel's attorney has said those remarks were baseless and spurred sensational media coverage, while his client was in Chicago to propose to his girlfriend, not to launch a mass attack. He also suggested that the weapons made the Ankeny, Iowa, man feel safer in a crime-ridden city.  A message was left Friday seeking comment from Casteel's attorney, Jonathan Brayman, on the police bodycam footage released Thursday.  Casteel, 32, was charged with two felony counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon after a member of the cleaning staff at the W Hotel discovered the weapons and ammunition. Prosecutors have said a grand jury would review the case.  The weapons were found on the window sill of Casteel's 12th floor hotel room with a view of Ohio Street Beach and Navy Pier, a major tourist attraction.  "Why didn't you leave your firearms at home?" a responding officer asks Casteel in police footage.  Casteel replies that he forgot to remove all the firearms from his gun range bag because he packed in a rush after his son was injured and hospitalized the night before he left with his girlfriend and children for Chicago.  He said he removed the guns and ammunition from the bag and left them in the hotel room so that he could use the bag at the beach.  "I didn't expect anything to happen. I just left them there for the day. Went to the beach. Came back. Went shopping," Casteel tells officers, also adding that he planned to propose to his girlfriend.  "It's my fault. I didn't mean to startle anyone. I understand 100% why I'm here. But like I said, it's an honest to God accident," Casteel said.  Casteel was released on $10,000 bond after a judge reminded him that gun laws in Chicago are different than in Iowa. Once he was released from the police station, he proposed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/iowa-man-with-guns-at-chicago-hotel-didnt-mean-to-startle/articleshow/84693825.cms||---

This was Xi’s first visit to Tibet since taking over as president in 2013. According to Xinhua news agency, the president visited the Tibet Autonomous Region in connection with the 70th anniversary of Tibet’s “peaceful liberation the first time in the history of the party and the country”. Chinese President Xi Jinping, waves to villagers while visiting Galai village of Nyingchi, southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, Wednesday, July 21, 2021. (Reuters)During his visit, Xi stressed the need for fully implementing the guidelines of the Chinese Communist Party for “governing Tibet in a new era and writing a new chapter of lasting stability and high-quality development for the plateau region”, the report said.  The visit was kept under wraps by China’s official media till the end of the trip on Friday. Nyingchi is also where China is constructing a massive dam on the Brahmaputra river. The visit comes amid border tensions with India and at a time when China is said to be suppressing local culture by promoting education in the Chinese language and also slowly taking control of Buddhist monasteries. Chinese leaders periodically visit Tibet. But Xi is perhaps the first top leader in recent years to visit Tibet’s border town. He visited Tibet as vice president in 2011. The last sitting president to officially visit Tibet was Jiang Zemin in 1990.

Grant Thompson thanked a British photographer the best way he knew how - by ripping the flight patch from his shoulder and handing it to the man whose quick action last week ensured he landed safely after an engine in his F-15E Strike Eagle malfunctioned.  Ian Simpson was standing outside the fence of a Royal Air Force base in eastern England and snapping pictures of fighter aircraft taking off when he spotted a shower of sparks flying from the back of a plane. He and a group of aviation enthusiasts listening to flight control traffic realized the pilot didn't appear to know there was a problem with the aircraft.  So Simpson, who used to work in the aviation industry, Googled RAF Lakenheath's phone number and persuaded a switchboard operator to put him through to flight operations at the base, home to the US Air Force's 48th Fighter Wing.  "I said, 'Look, something is wrong with the plane, definitely. We've got lots of photographs of sparks coming out the back,"' Simpson, 56, told The Associated Press.  Word was relayed to the pilot. Asked to take a look, his wingman confirmed damage to one of the engines, the base said. The pilot returned to base, "just to be safe."  "For most of us here, this was a very rare occurrence that we have not personally witnessed," the airbase said in a statement. "It's wonderful to know that the Liberty Wing has such a great partnership with the local community - and the courage that Ian displayed was next to none."  Simpson said he was motivated by the death of another young American pilot whose plane crashed into the North Sea on June 15, 2020.  "I thought someone should call," he said. "I didn't want anything like that to happen to another family."  On Wednesday, Thompson said thank you by giving Simpson a cap and insignia and then throwing in the shoulder patch for good measure.  "That was a nice touch," Simpson said.  The base noted Simpson's actions in a Facebook post that won widespread attention, particularly from Americans grateful for his assistance.  "For me, the most humbling thing has been the families of servicemen who thanked me for doing what I did," he said. "I wasn't expecting to get so much thanks."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/us-pilot-thanks-british-man-who-guaranteed-a-happy-landing/articleshow/84694129.cms||---
---||World||Explainer: Does suspension end Giuliani's career in law?||CHICAGO: The days of practicing law for the mob-busting prosecutor turned point man for pushing Donald Trump's false claims about the 2020 election may be over. Rudy Giuliani's law license has already been suspended in his home state. That suspension, in practice, may well amount to a national suspension.  A New York appeals court took the action in June, saying Giuliani's bid to discredit the election was so egregious that he poses "an immediate threat" to the public.  Here's a look at the implications for the 77-year-old Giuliani: What's the ripple effect in other states?  States have an interest in weeding out lawyers deemed unethical. So when one state takes steps against a lawyer, other states typically take the same steps.  That means there will be few places, if any, where Giuliani will be able to practice law or appear in court on behalf of clients as long as his New York license is suspended.  States seek to mirror disciplinary actions of other states under what's known as Rule 22 on reciprocal discipline, modeled on American Bar Association recommendations. All states have some version of it. How else will the suspension stop him from practicing? Lawyers don't necessarily need a law license in a state to represent clients at a court hearing. They can file a motion asking a state or federal judge to grant them permission to participate. The motions - called pro hac vice, which means "for this occasion" in Latin - are regularly granted.  But lawyers, like Giuliani, who are no longer in good standing in their home states are unlikely to get the OK.  The importance of a clean disciplinary record was illustrated by Giuliani himself in litigation over the election.  Weeks after the Nov. 6 election, he was granted permission to represent Trump in a federal court in Pennsylvania, where he does not have a law license. It was granted based on his then-valid New York license.  In his motion, Giuliani listed multiple courts in which he was authorized to practice, including all courts in New York and the District of Columbia. As required, he also verified he'd never had his license suspended and was not the subject of any disciplinary process. That's no longer true. Have jurisdictions other than New York taken action?  Yes. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals in July pointed to the New York ruling in suspending Giuliani from practicing in D.C. courts - at least until the discipline procedures play out in New York. The two-page ruling cited the district's reciprocal discipline rule requiring that it mirror the New York suspension.  Giuliani's law license had already been inactive in D.C., meaning he would have had to pay dues and apply to start practicing in the city anyway. The D.C. court ruling means that, even if he wanted to, he can no longer seek to practice in the city.  New York requires that lawyers whose licenses are suspended in the state themselves notify regulatory bodies in other states. It's unclear if Giuliani has done so for all the states in which he holds a law license.  Regulators can also learn about a suspension in another state via a national database managed by the ABA. As of Wednesday, there was no record of Giuliani's suspension in New York. The normal notification process can take several weeks. What reason did New York give for the suspension?  The New York appeals court said Giuliani not only made false statements but may have made them knowing they were false.  Among the examples it gave were Giuliani's claims that thousands of votes in Philadelphia were cast in the names of people who were dead, including, he asserted, deceased former boxing champion Joe Frazier. What's next in the New York process?  The New York court is expected to make a final decision on Giuliani's license after additional depositions, hearings and testimony. That mostly confidential process could take months, even years.  For now, the suspension is considered interim. A final ruling could include a fixed-term suspension or disbarment for Giuliani. A simple reprimand would also be an option.  The tough language of the court's June ruling, though, suggests Giuliani could be looking at the most severe sanction, said Bruce Green, director of the Louis Stein Center for Law and Ethics at the Fordham University School of Law.  "Having read the court's opinion, I would say the chances (of disbarment) are pretty good," he said. How has Giuliani responded? Giuliani suggested to WABC-AM that the New York court's decision was part of an effort "to shut me up." He added: "They want Giuliani quiet."  In filings before the court ruled, Giuliani said his statements on the election were protected by the First Amendment and that he didn't knowingly make false statements.  Giuliani's lawyers have said they are confident his license will be restored after a fuller hearing of the issues. How hard will the suspension hit Giuliani? He will no longer be able to step up and lead battles in court on Trump's behalf. With most other attorneys balking at Trump's post-election legal theories, Trump relied heavily on Giuliani's eagerness and, some would argue, lack of scruples to help.  Otherwise, Giuliani hasn't shown much enthusiasm for courtroom work. Before he began representing Trump in litigation over vote counting, court records indicate Giuliani had not appeared in court as an attorney since 1992.  The suspension of his law license may not directly impact his lobbying work or business as a security consultant. But it adds to the reputational damage for Giuliani, whose widely praised work as a U.S. attorney in New York City had helped him become the city's mayor. What about other Trump lawyers?  A federal judge in Michigan is considering whether to order fines or other penalties against several of them, including Sidney Powell and L. Lin Wood.  They had brought a lawsuit alleging votes for Trump were destroyed or switched to votes for Joe Biden. The suit was dropped after a judge found nothing but "speculation and conjecture" in the filing.  Wood's name was on the lawsuit, but he said he had no role other than to tell Powell he'd be available if she needed help. Powell has said it was "the duty of lawyers and the highest tradition of the practice of law to raise difficult and even unpopular issues."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/explainer-does-suspension-end-giulianis-career-in-law/articleshow/84694474.cms||---

"This evening, I spoke with President Biden over a phone call. We discussed the evolving but continuing relationship between the two countries. President Biden reassured me that support for the ANDSF will continue. We have confidence that they will protect & defend Afghanistan," Ghani tweeted. Both leaders reiterated the enduring partnership, continued diplomatic and economic support for the Afghan government, security forces and the importance of preserving the gains of the last twenty years. "We stressed on the importance of the Afghans coming together for peace and security. And reiterated the enduring partnership, continued diplomatic and economic support for the Afghan government, security forces and the importance of preserving the gains of the last twenty years," Afghan President added. The US military in the past few days conducted airstrikes in Afghanistan to support Afghan security forces, the Pentagon confirmed on Thursday. At an off-camera press briefing, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said that "in the last several days, we have acted, through airstrikes, to support the ANDSF (Afghan National Defense and Security Forces)." "But we continue to be able to and we continue to, as the Secretary (US Defence) said yesterday, conduct airstrikes in support of the ANDSF. General McKenzie has those authorities," he added. At least five Taliban terrorists were killed in airstrikes carried out in several provinces in Afghanistan over the past three days, according to local media. General Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff on Wednesday, had said that the Taliban are propagating "inevitable victory" in Afghanistan with control over nearly 212 district centres. "There is clearly a narrative out there that Taliban are winning. In fact, they are propagating inevitable victory on their behalf. As of today, more or less, I guess it is about 212, 213, it is in that range. The district centres are in Taliban control, it is about half of the 419 that are out there," Milley had said. Previously, the Biden administration had said that the US military pullback from Afghanistan will conclude by August 31, however, US Central Command said last week that over 95 per cent of the withdrawal had already been completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-reassures-support-for-afghan-security-forces-over-phone-call-with-ghani/articleshow/84694904.cms||---
---||World||After little rain, California tourist town runs low on water||MENDOCINO: A Northern California coastal town popular with tourists is running low on water after two years of little rainfall during a drought in the US West, forcing residents and business owners to truck in water from elsewhere.  Mendocino, known for its beaches, cliffside trails, and redwood forests, relies on mostly shallow, rain-dependent aquifers, and many of the wells are running low or have dried up, the Press Democrat reported Thursday.  The 170-year-old hamlet has roughly 1,000 full-time residents but about 2,000 daily visitors, said Ryan Rhoades, superintendent of the Mendocino Community Services District.  All of their water needs are supplied by a network of 420 wells at various depths. Many of them were hand-dug in the early years of the historic town and are only 35 feet (11 meters) deep or shallower, Rhoades said.  By late spring last year, well shortages were being reported, even though locals are so focused on water efficiency that they easily meet 40% conservation mandates, he said.  A historic drought tied to climate change is gripping California and other Western states. It comes just a few years after California declared its last dry spell over in 2016. The earlier drought depleted groundwater supplies and changed how people use water, with many people and businesses ripping out landscaping and replacing it with more drought-tolerant plants.  Recently, Mendocino businesses like hotels have had trouble meeting their water needs, and water trucks making deliveries are now becoming almost as common as tourists.  Some hotels are charging extra for daily linen replacement and hot tub use, and other businesses are considering portable toilets to conserve water.  Most water had been purchased from Fort Bragg, a town of about 7,300 people whose primary water source is the Noyo River. But as the river's flow has diminished, officials shut off the supply to Mendocino this week to safeguard supplies for its residents.  There's been talk of shipping in water by barge to deliver to Mendocino and other cities in need on the southern Mendocino Coast, transporting it by railway from the inland city of Willits and trucking it to the coast from Ukiah in wine tankers.  For the foreseeable future, Mendocino is expected to be hauling in ever-greater amounts of water, though exactly where it will come from and how isn't clear.  "From fires to pandemic to drought," Mendocino County Supervisor Ted Williams said. "I think drought might be the worst."  Rhoades said the Community Services District has reached out to the Mendocino School Board, which has two storage tanks with capacity for 110,000 gallons, to see if its members would sell some well water to the town. But it would have to be a small enough amount to allow for well recovery, especially since the community's fire hydrants rely on the same source.  But he said the community needs to find a long-term strategy to withstand dry conditions.  "But right now," Rhoades said, "the focus is on surviving this year."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/after-little-rain-california-tourist-town-runs-low-on-water/articleshow/84695030.cms||---
---||World||Poland a step closer to adopting controversial property law||WARSAW: Poland's Senate on Friday approved, with some amendments, much-disputed changes to property restitution rules, moving them a step closer to adoption. The draft regulations have drawn strong criticism from Israel and from Jewish organizations who say the new administrative law would prevent Jewish claims for compensation or property seized during the Holocaust and communist times. Israeli Foreign Minister Yari Lapid said the legislation will "severely damage our relations with Poland.'' If adopted, the changes would prevent property ownership and other administrative decisions from being declared void after 30 years. It affects Polish, Jewish and other property. Poland says it is a response to fraud and irregularities that have emerged in the restitution process, leading to evictions or giving real estate to property dealers. The changes have been ordered by the Constitutional Court which ruled in 2015 that the current state of administrative regulations was against Poland's supreme law. Poland's authorities insist restitution claims will still be possible through courts, regardless of the claimants nationality or place of residence. The amended draft now goes to the parliament's lower chamber for approval and then will need the signature of President Andrzej Duda, who has spoken in its favor. Gideon Taylor, Chair of Operations of the World Jewish Restitution Organization, has urged the lower chamber to "reject the bill in its entirety.'' He said the organization encourages Poland to "once and for all settle the issue of private property by adopting comprehensive restitution legislation.'' "As the remaining Holocaust survivors get older, they deserve a measure of justice in their lifetime,'' Taylor said. Before World War II, Poland was home to Europe's largest Jewish community of some 3.5 million people. Most were killed in the Holocaust under Nazi Germany's occupation and their property was confiscated. Poland's post-war communist authorities seized those properties, along with the property of non-Jewish owners in Warsaw and other cities. The end of communism in 1989 opened the door to restitution claims, most of which would be coming from Poles. The still unresolved matter has been a constant source of bitterness and political tension between Poland and Israel. In 2001, a draft law foreseeing compensation for seized private property was approved in parliament but vetoed by President Aleksander Kwasniewski. He claimed it violated social equality principles and would hurt Poland's economic development, implying that compensation claims would result in large payouts. He said individual claims should be made through the courts. Poland is the only European country that has not offered any compensation for private property seized by the state in its recent history. Only the remaining communal Jewish property, like some synagogues, prayer houses and cemeteries, mostly in disrepair, have been returned where possible or compensated for.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/poland-a-step-closer-to-adopting-controversial-property-law/articleshow/84695059.cms||---

Wednesday's discussions in Geneva come as the two countries are embroiled in myriad disputes ranging from weapons systems to cyberattacks, Ukraine and allegations of Russian interference in US elections.  However, the Geneva talks are expected to deal mainly with strategic stability issues as Presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin agreed during their meeting in the same Swiss city last month.  "This meeting follows up on a commitment made between President Biden and Russian President Putin to have a deliberate and robust dialogue between our two nations that will seek to lay the groundwork for future arms control and risk reduction measures," the State Department said.  Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, who is currently traveling in Asia and will meet China's foreign minister on Sunday, will lead the US delegation, accompanied by the newly confirmed top US arms control diplomat, Bonnie Jenkins. Russia's team will be headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.  The two sides expect to explore how to move beyond the New START treaty that Biden and Putin agreed earlier this year to extend until 2026. That treaty had been due to expire in February and former President Donald Trump's administration had not moved to extend it.  The Trump administration had withdrawn from several arms control and related agreements with the Russians during its time in office, causing angst among US allies in Europe and elsewhere. The previous administration said the pacts were outdated and Russia was in persistent violation of them.  The Biden administration wants further arms negotiations to include Russia's numerically superior arsenal of non-strategic nuclear missiles, which are not covered by New START and are a particular concern to European allies.  The Russians have said they will insist that any new agreement include negotiated limits on US missile defenses, which they see as a longer-term threat to the viability of their strategic arsenal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/at-odds-on-myriad-issues-us-russia-to-hold-strategic-talks/articleshow/84695194.cms||---

---||World||Trump inaugural committee chair to be released on $250 million bail||LOS ANGELES: The chair of former President Donald Trump's inaugural committee was ordered freed Friday on $250 million bail to face charges he secretly worked as an agent for the the United Arab Emirates to influence Trump's foreign policy.  Tom Barrack, 74, will be subject to electronic monitoring and largely confined to his residence after he is arraigned Monday in a New York courtroom. He was arrested Tuesday in Los Angeles near his home.  Barrack is expected to plead not guilty to conspiring to influence US policy on the UAE's behalf during Trump's 2016 campaign and while Trump was president. Barrack, the founder of private equity firm Colony Capital, was among three men charged in the case.  Prosecutors said Barrack used his long personal friendship with Trump to benefit the UAE without disclosing his ties to the US government.  US Magistrate Judge Patricia Donahue in Los Angeles ordered strict conditions for Barrack's release. He must surrender his passport, wear a GPS-monitor to track his whereabouts, limit travel between Southern California and New York City and obey a curfew.  Barrack is charged with conspiracy, obstruction of justice and making multiple false statements during a June 2019 interview with federal agents. Matthew Grimes, 27, a former executive at Barrack's company from Aspen, Colorado, and Rashid al Malik, 43, a businessman from the United Arab Emirates who prosecutors said acted as a conduit to that nation's rulers, were also charged in the seven-count indictment.  Grimes was ordered released on $5 million bail. Al Malik fled the US three days after an April 2018 interview by law enforcement and remains at large, authorities said. He and is believed to be living somewhere in the Middle East.  Barrack is one of several of the former president's associates to face criminal charges, including his former campaign chair, his former deputy campaign chair, his former chief strategist, his former national security adviser, his former personal lawyer and his company's longtime chief financial officer.  Barrack was an informal adviser to Trump's 2016 campaign before becoming the inaugural committee chair.  He raised $107 million for the lavish celebration scrutinized both for its spending and for attracting numerous foreign officials and businesspeople looking to lobby the new administration. The inaugural committee was not implicated in the indictment.  After Trump took office, Barrack informally advised senior US government officials on Middle East foreign policy. He also sought appointment as special envoy to the Middle East or US ambassador to the UAE, prosecutors said.  He relayed sensitive information about developments within the Trump administration to UAE officials- including how senior US officials felt about a years long boycott of Qatar conducted by the UAE and other Middle Eastern countries, prosecutors said.  He told al Malik that landing an official position within the administration would enable him to advance UAE interests, prosecutors said.  Such an appointment "would give ABU DHABI more power!" he wrote to al Malik, prosecutors said.  Prosecutors originally sought to detain Barrack because they said he owned a private jet and was a flight risk. They also noted he has citizenship in Lebanon, a country with no extradition treaty with the US.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/trump-inaugural-committee-chair-to-be-released-on-250-million-bail/articleshow/84695220.cms||---

Zomato witnessed a stellar listing on Friday as the stock jumped over 53% over its IPO price of Rs 76 on debut to quote at Rs 115. After hitting an intra-day high of Rs 138 on the BSE, the stock finally closed at Rs 126, giving the company a market valuation of Rs 98,732 crore, ahead of traditional giants like Tata Motors, M&M and Coal India. Zomato’s strong debut also proved a lot of Dalal Street pundits and doubters wrong who had questioned the new-age company’s pre-IPO valuation of Rs 60,000 crore. Even those who believed in the loss-making company’s valuation then, were expecting its listing gain to be limited at 25%-30%. On July 16, the company had closed its IPO bidding process with an over 38 times oversubscription and advanced its listing date by at least four days to Friday. S Ramesh, MD & CEO, Kotak Mahindra Capital Company, one of the merchant bankers that took the company public, said such a strong market debut was a testimony to the fact that investors “are willing to bet big on new-age technology companies which have the characteristics of a disruptive business model”. “With growing internet penetration and the number of smartphone user base increasing month after month, the entire private digital ecosystem will enable wealth creation and further deepen our capital market in the coming years,” Ramesh added. Market veterans said in 1993, the IPO of Infosys was on the verge of being withdrawn till a clutch of market veterans recognised its future growth prospects and bailed it out. The rest, as they say, is history. Over the last 30 years, Infosys has ranked among the top wealth creators in the Indian market. Zomato’s success would give confidence to new-age tech companies planning to go public, along with their merchant bankers, to move ahead, industry players said. Digital payment solutions companies PayTM and Mobikwik, online auto classified company CarTrade and e-commerce logistics startup Delhivery have already filed for IPOs. There are also a host of other such tech-enabled companies in their late stage of PE-driven growth for which Zomato was a test-case. All these companies are likely to rush to D Street to go public, they added. In the run-up to Zomato’s IPO, there was a divide between top fund managers and investors. On one side, Nilesh Shah, MD, Kotak Mutual Fund, supported the recent trend of Indian new-age companies going public, and said the trend had the potential to attract global investors who have burnt their hands in China. On the other side of the spectrum was billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala who had expressed skepticism about the valuation of these new-age companies and said the upside in Zomato was capped at 10%-15% while the downside risk was 50%-60%. With a market valuation of about $13.3 billion, Zomato is among the top 50 most valued companies in India. On a global scale, it’s still a minnow though. Meituan, the Chinese giant that also has other businesses in addition to food delivery service, is valued at $215 billion while its US counterpart, recently listed DoorDash, is valued at $58 billion. A recent Ambit Capital report on Zomato, however, said the company was in a sweet spot compared to its global peers since it operated in a growing market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/zomato-market-cap-crosses-coal-india-mm-on-debut/articleshow/84695259.cms||---

Minutes later, the CM attended the ceremony at the Punjab Congress office as Sidhu formally took charge as PCC chief. Amarinder congratulated him and talked about "working together for the welfare of Punjab", just days after putting a precondition of a public apology by the Amritsar East MLA for his tweets against the CM. The cricketer-turned-politician mimicked a lofted shot, as if hitting a sixer, as he went past the CM to deliver his speech. There were people’s issues that needed resolution, he said, addressing Amarinder. On his part, the CM told party workers, "It is your responsibility to support the party president." Sidhu spoke of infusing new life in the party cadres, while listing the various issues facing the state – farmers’ stir, sacrilege case, protests by various employee groups and the previous government’s power purchase agreement with companies. "CM saheb, there are issues that need to be resolved," he said. "Punjab is asking questions. Why should electricity be bought at Rs 18 per unit? Why shouldn’t the truth of the power purchase pacts be brought out?" On the other hand, Amarinder listed the key achievements of his government and said the focus should be on strengthening the Congress party. "When Soniaji told me that they want to make Navjot Singh the new president, I came out and told the press that we will bow before the decision of the Congress president. Now, we will have to be together in the fight for keeping Punjab and our country safe." Describing the fight against Covid, the state’s top ranking in primary education and the highest contribution of wheat crop to the central pool as his government’s key achievements, the CM said: "But with time, the expectations of people grow, and they start complaining about unfinished works." On the sacrilege issue, Amarinder sought to clarify that sometimes legal issues crop up. "Challans in Bargari, Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan cases have been submitted. These things take time. They (Badals) gave the investigations to the CBI, we took it back from the apex court. They have been exposed, the Badals and Majithia will be decimated in the next elections," he said. "Not only Punjab, we have a duty towards the nation. We share a 600-kilometre border with Pakistan and daily ammunition is reaching there; they want to spoil the atmosphere, drones are being sent. The people of Punjab will have to join in the fight and remain vigilant… Navjot, you will have to bring Punjabis along to fight this with courage," he said, adding, "I don’t trust the Akalis or AAP, we have reports that AAP is complicit." Sidhu raised the issue of drugs and said, "We will have to disclose the names of the big fish". The new PCC chief spoke of taking everyone along. "I have a thick skin, nothing bothers me. I have no ego and will work shoulder to shoulder with you. Those who criticise me make me better." Making a veiled reference to Badals, Sidhu said he will soon get into action and set up base at the Congress Bhawan on August 15 and would also want ministers to spend three hours every day there. "I will not back out from the 18-point agenda of the high command. The Punjab model will beat the Delhi model," he said, in a jibe directed at AAP.

In a written reply to a question, the ministry submitted that a total of 4,150 cases are pending before the consumer commissions in Delhi during the past five years. On whether the government proposes to set up fast track courts to clear cases of persons above 70 years of age, the ministry said, “Consumer Protection (Consumer Commission Procedure) Regulations, 2020 notified under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 provides that the cases filed by or against the senior citizens, physically challenged, widows and persons suffering from serious ailments shall be listed and disposed of on a priority basis.” In response to another question on the number of complaints pending in consumer commissions across the states in the past two years, the ministry said in 2019 a total of 1.71 lakh complaints were filed and 1.26 lakh of them were disposed off. But in 2020, the consumer commissions could dispose off less than 50% of the complaints. The ministry said the commissions disposed off 53,352 complaints out of the 1,15,866 complaints. The number of pending cases was 63,733 during last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/11702-complaints-linked-to-housing-pending-with-national-consumer-commission/articleshow/84695447.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||India||Intelligence Bureau says my number tapped, claims Rahul; BJP dares him to allow probe||NEW DELHI: Claiming that Intelligence Bureau officers had told him that his phone was being tapped, Rahul Gandhi on Friday accused PM Narendra Modi of treason for snooping on the opposition and institutions, drawing a strong riposte from the saffron party which demanded that the Congress MP hand over his phone to the investigating agencies so that a proper investigation could be conducted. Rahul reiterated his demand that home minister Amit Shah be removed from the Cabinet and a Supreme Court inquiry be conducted against the PM. "I get phone calls from IB people who tap my phone and they tell me we are tapping your phone. My security people tell me that they have to debrief to their seniors what I say. So, I am under no illusion that my phone is not tapped," he said. Soon after Rahul’s remark, BJP spokesperson Rajyavardhan Rathore told reporters, "If Rahul Gandhi thinks his phone is being tapped, he should submit his phone to the competent agencies so that action is taken as per the IPC." Rathore mocked Rahul's charge, saying, "I don't think even a junior copywriter will tap the Congress leader’s phone since the device cannot have anything original." "No phone or any gadget is being recorded illegally and if someone feels so, they should seek help from the agencies for action as per the law of the land. The law of the land prevails in India. If anyone has any doubt that some agency is doing it illegally, then he can complain and lawful action will be taken. We will now wait for Rahul Gandhi to deposit his phone for the investigation to proceed," Rathore said. Speaking to reporters after participating in an opposition protest against the alleged Pegasus snooping in Parliament complex, Rahul said Israel has classified Pegasus as a weapon to fight terrorists but the Indian government has used it against national institutions, against the Supreme Court and to stop investigations into the Rafale deal. He said the then CBI director’s phone was tapped when he was about to lodge an FIR on Rafale and he was blackmailed. "Only the PM and the home minister can authorise the use of Pegasus," he said. Rathore said Congress has manufactured the issue of snooping since it is determined to stall Parliament for one reason or another after being rejected twice by the people. "We are well aware of his record in Parliament," the former Union minister said in a dig at Rahul over his frequent absence from the Lok Sabha, where he represents the Wayanad constituency. He often goes abroad on vacation during monsoon sessions, Rathore said, adding that the former Congress chief is now not letting Parliament function for "manufactured" reasons. Drawing a link between the alleged Pegasus snooping on the then CBI director and others related to Rafale deal, Rahul said it was clear that there was "gross theft" in the deal and it will finally come out that the PM was personally involved in corruption. Claiming that he was not intimidated by these actions of the government, Rahul said, "If you are corrupt, then you will fear Modi, but if you are not corrupt, you will not fear Modi. You will only laugh." AICC spokesman Pawan Khera alleged a connection between the "snooping scandal" and the steep jump in the budget of the National Security Council Secretariat. He said the grant went up from Rs 33 crore in 2017 to Rs 333 crore in 2018 with an additional head of Cyber Security Research and Development, noting the period coincides with the start of alleged snooping.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/intelligence-bureau-says-my-number-tapped-claims-rahul-bjp-dares-him-to-allow-probe/articleshow/84695493.cms||---
---||India||HC quashes UP police’s notice to Twitter India MD||BENGALURU: The Karnataka high court quashed on Friday UP police’s notice to Twitter India MD Manish Maheshwari to appear in connection with a probe, calling it mala fide and an “arm-twisting method”. Police in Ghaziabad, which had issued the notice, said they were awaiting a copy of the order. “We will take a call only after going through it,” Ghaziabad SSP Amit Kumar Pathak said. The notice was issued on June 21 under CrPC Section 41-A, four days after the initial notice under Section 160, asking Maheshwari to report at the Loni border police station on June 24 regarding a communally sensitive video uploaded by a user on Twitter. Maheshwari moved the Karnataka HC as he lives in Bengaluru. Disposing of Maheshwari’s petition, Justice G Narendar said the notice should be read under CrPC Section 160, and if the investigating officer desires to secure a statement or any information, UP police can question the Twitter India MD via a video link or meet him at his residential or office address. On June 24, the HC had directed UP police not to take any coercive action against Maheshwari and maintained that he could be questioned via video-conferencing. "The action of the respondent (UP police) trying to invoke Section 41-A leaves no doubt in the mind of the court that it is used as an arm-twisting method as the petitioner refused to heed the notice issued under CrPC Sec 160. The respondents inferred it as an audacious act of refusing to bow to its command (sic)," the judge noted in his order . In a lengthy order dictated over more than five hours, the judge pointed out that the notice threatens punitive action and deprivation of liberty, which admittedly is a fundamental right. He noted that failure to comply would have resulted in deprivation of the petitioner’s liberty, and, had he complied, it would still have curtailed his day-to-day activities vis-a-vis his profession by compelling him to travel all the way to Ghaziabad. Criticising police’s approach at the preliminary investigation stage and the method used to secure records in the public domain, the judge took exception to what he called UP police’s "ominous silence with regard to the merits of the matter" and its attempt to coax the court to look into the ground of jurisdiction alone. ‘No control over content’On the contentious issue of the status of Twitter India, the judge said that the record maintained by statutory authorities and available in the public domain clearly demonstrates that Twitter India is an independent entity, and that the shareholding pattern and control of the affairs of the company are in the hands of Twitter International, Ireland. A perusal of the annual returns of Twitter India’s business activities shows that it is into advertising and market research, and has no control or authority over the content on the social media platform, which is operated and controlled by Twitter Inc, USA, the court said. "The petitioner is not controlling the content on the social media platform. Provisions of the statute cannot be permitted to become tools," the judge said. "Though hearings have been conducted for the past several days, the respondent has not filed even an iota of material to demonstrate the prima facie involvement of the petitioner in the case," the judge observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-quashes-up-polices-notice-to-twitter-india-md/articleshow/84695593.cms||Vasantha Kumar

HUL has claimed that its new Domex Fresh Guard disinfectant toilet cleaner “consists of surface modification molecules that leaves a protective hydrophobic layer on the toilet commode surface which reduces water, stain, and germ build-up, thereby troubleshooting persistent problems such as cleanliness, hygiene, and malodour”. The new television commercial, which features actors Divyanka Tripathi and Revathy (Tamil version), has a supermarket as the setting where a consumer is forced to reconsider her toilet cleaner purchase when her son questions her choice of product when she picks up Harpic from the retail shelf. HUL’s executive director & VP, home care (South Asia), Prabha Narasimhan, said, “The latest communication is in line with our goal to give consumers the evidence to help make informed decisions determined by scientific insight and technology. Our extensive studies, research and data-backed certifications underpin the superior science-first formula of the offering.” Reckitt did not respond to a query by TOI on this subject till the time of going to the press. Domex is a market-leading brand in large parts of Europe. In India, however, the brand has not cut much ice with consumers. Harpic is a market leader in the category with a lion’s share of over 70%, while Domex has a share of 7% in the Rs 1,300-crore segment. Through the campaign, HUL hopes to make some share gain. “We are confident of significant share gain since this is a scientific, evidence-based and technology-driven product that solves real consumer needs when it comes to household toilets. At this stage, the intention is to give consumers complete and true information so that they can make an informed choice,” said Narasimhan. Toilet cleaners do not occupy a lot of the consumer’s mind space unlike certain other high-involvement categories. “The purchase decision tends to be fairly automatic or by default. What we’re trying to do is to just shake up a little bit of that default purchase to say there is a better alternative out there,” said Narasimhan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/domex-targets-harpic-in-ad/articleshow/84692098.cms||Namrata Singh

The MPs sought a debate in both Houses on issues concerning the state, which include the bifurcation promise of granting special category status, release of funds for Polavaram, and withdrawal of privatisation proposal of Visakhapatnam steel plant. The protest in Rajya Sabha was led by V Vijayasai Reddy, who also issued notice to the chairman seeking special discussion under Rule 267 on the Polavaram project and release of funds. He told the House that the central government is delaying reimbursement of Rs 1,917 crore due to the state for Polavaram, and also delaying in giving approval to the revised cost of Rs 55,657 crore. Another party MP, V Prabhakar Reddy, also issued a notice under Rule 267 seeking a debate on Anti-Defection Law. “Elected representatives have to be responsible and accountable. If any member of legislature behaves or acts irresponsibly and utterly disregards the party on whose symbol he contested and got elected, or its leader who gave him the opportunity to contest, is nothing but undermining the democratic principles and Parliamentary democracy of the country,” Reddy said in his notice. The MPs also held protest outside the Parliament hall after the Houses were adjourned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/mps-continue-with-protest-in-parliament/articleshow/84688830.cms||Gopi Dara

The vendors argue that the entire city has been opened, but 2,500 weekly markets are yet to start their operations on a regular basis. “As per the Covid guidelines, weekly markets should not be allowed on roads and civic agencies should look for space in schools or open ground. But where no such ground is available, the civic agencies are not allowing us,” said a vendor. Calling the authorities “biased”, they argue that thousands of people have no earning now. Ashwani Bagri, convener of Delhi Weekly Bazaar United Front and president of north Delhi unit of Hawkers Joint Action Committee, said, “If an appropriate decision is not taken soon, vendors will be forced to intensify their agitation. If opening these markets is not possible, the government should pay us a monthly compensation at the rate of minimum wages.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/weekly-market-vendors-to-hold-protest-today/articleshow/84689892.cms||---

SKMCH superintendent Dr B S Jha said Shivani, a resident of Faridpur village under Sakra block in Muzaffarpur district, was admitted to the facility on July 19. “She was brought to the hospital in a critical condition,” he said. SKMCH paediatric department head Dr Gopal Sahni said Shivani’s family kept her at their residence for three-four days after she complained of fever and body ache. They admitted her to Sakra hospital only when her condition deteriorated and showed symptoms of convulsion. She was subsequently referred to the SKMCH on July 19. “She died today despite our best efforts,” Dr Sahni told this newspaper over phone. According to the hospital authorities, altogether 51 children with symptoms of AES have been admitted there since January this year. Of them, 11 have died. Dr Jha said four more children with AES symptoms have been admitted in the last 48 hours. Of them, Rajesh Kumar (07) and Shabnam Kumari (08) belong to Goroul and Lalganj in Vaishali district while Sahil (07) and Annu Priya (02) hail from Musahari and Sakra blocks respectively in Muzaffarpur district. They are undergoing treatment at PICU ward of the hospital. He said three of the four children have been diagnosed as infected with AES. The fourth one is being treated as unknown case of AES. They are undergoing treatment as per the AES protocol, he added. He said high temperature coupled with humidity in the last few days led to fresh AES cases in the region recently. Awareness campaign has been launched in rural areas to check the spread of the deadly disease. Since January this year, 51 cases have been reported to the SKMCH. Of them, 39 were the known cases of AES while the remaining 12 were unknown. Dr Jha, however, said the reported AES cases were far less this year than the previous year. He attributed the reason to awareness campaign and proper surveillance on the residents of the previously affected villages. A senior administrative officer said DM Pranav Kumar took stock of the situation prevailing in the villages in the district from where the AES cases had been reported earlier. Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, Sitamarhi, Sheohar, East Champaran and West Champaran districts have been identified as the worst hit as majority of the AES cases were reported from there only.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/7-year-old-girl-dies-4-more-kids-with-aes-admitted-to-skmch/articleshow/84687731.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||Patna HC to Centre & Bihar govt: Resolve price issue for land acquisition||PATNA: The acquisition of land for a 2.8km-long liner strip to connect Patna-Gaya-Dobhi Road (NH-83) has become a bone of contention between the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the state government as its price has increased from Rs 176 crore to around Rs 580 crore over the years. The Patna high court on Friday directed both sides to resolve the issue. The NHAI has refused to pay the additional cost of land to be acquired on the plea that it had already deposited Rs176 crore into the competent authority for land acquisition (CALA) bank account in 2012-13 and notified the land for acquisition, but the state government could not acquire the land and, instead, increased the circle rate. Now, the farmers were demanding the land price as per the new circle rate. The land strip is from Saristabad to Nathupur village, from where the zero point of Patna-Gaya-Dobhi Road starts.This stretch was earlier part of Patna-Koilwar-Bhojpur-Buxar NH project and was planned to serve also as a common link road for Patna-Gaya-Dobhi NH-83. Representing the NHAI, senior counsel SD Sanjay along with Anshay Bahadur Mathur submitted before the high court that the state should bear the additional cost alleging that land was not acquired timely resulting in its price rise. State’s additional advocate general Anjani Kumar submitted that it was the central agency that abandoned the acquisition process and the state was not liable to pay the increased land price. The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar, which is monitoring all NH projects in the state, directed the state chief secretary to convene a meeting of all stakeholders to resolve the issue and think of sharing the escalated price by the Centre and the state government. The bench gave two weeks’ time to the chief secretary to submit a counter-affidavit apprising about the developments made to resolve the issue after the meeting. The bench also directed the authorities concerned that the money disbursed by NHAI for acquiring the land be transferred into the district judge or district magistrate’s bank account from the CALA account. Parts of the stretch were acquired eight years back when the circle rates were less. AAG Kumar also apprised the court that the state government will disburse compensation to the landowners against their land for all NH projects. The court directed that if the state failed to meet the timeline, it would have to deposit the remaining amount into the bank accounts of the district judge or the DM. ‘Remove bus and auto stands at Hajipur’: The bench directed the Vaishali DM to remove a bus stand, an autorickshaw stand and a police station existing near Ramashish Chowk at Hajipur within a fortnight to speed up construction of national highway connecting Hajipur and Muzaffarpur. The court also directed more than a dozen DMs to remain present on July 28 for hearing on land acquisition related to Varanasi-Aurangabad section of NH-2, an important greenfield NH project to pass through Patna and several other districts across Bihar. At least 38 NH-project issues were taken up by the bench one after another and necessary directions were passed on them to speed up construction work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-hc-to-centre-bihar-govt-resolve-price-issue-for-land-acquisition/articleshow/84687411.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Around 15 acres of land will be acquired on the southern, northern and western sides of the bus terminal to increase parking space and boost other facilities. The district administration has submitted a report to the urban development and housing department, providing detailed information, including the nature of the land and its feasibility.  “The process of land acquisition is likely to start after the department approves the proposal and provide funds for the same,” district land acquisition officer Pramod Kumar said. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh said some land would be acquired from the northern and western sides of ISBT and major part of land from the southern side of the terminal up to Badshahi Pine.  “At present, the ISBT has only nine acres of land for the parking of vehicles, around 10 acres for four blocks and six acres for road, drainage lines, green belt and other facilities,” he said. “The land to be acquired will be mostly used as a parking space and other facilities like workshop, cleaning and servicing of buses, CNG fuel station and charging point for electric buses. Looking at the future, there is a need for additional space to accommodate more buses. The buses from Bankipore bus stand near Gandhi Maidan will also shift to ISBT,” Singh said. The state-of-the-art bus terminal, developed with an expenditure of Rs 300 crore, has four multi-storey blocks for travel facilities and commercial activities. Presently, more than 360 buses from seven districts – Gaya, Nalanda, Nawada, Jamui, Sheikhpura, Lakhisarai and Jehanabad – have been operating per day from the ISBT. The district authorities have planned to shift all the buses from Mithapur to Patliputra ISBT. According to a Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation official, the ISBT can handle up to 3,000 buses daily. “After the acquisition of 15 acres of land, the capacity will increase to 7,000 buses per day,” the official added. The DM said all the buses from Mithapur would be shifted to ISBT by the end of this month. “One more gate at ISBT will be ready in a week. With this, there will be a separate gate for entry and exit of vehicles,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/15-acres-of-land-to-be-acquired-for-expansion-of-isbt-patna-dm/articleshow/84687517.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Kolkata||Peek into unseen stills of Ray-Uttam magic on actor’s death anniversary||KOLKATA: On the death anniversary of Uttam Kumar on July 24, news about two never used scenes of the actor from ‘Nayak’ (1966) and ‘Chiriyakhana’ (1967) have come to light. Satyajit Ray’s ‘kheror khata’ has descriptions of these scenes and the director had shot them too. However, neither did the scenes make it to the films nor did the footage survive. Three stills from these unused scenes will be published in literary magazine ‘Bichitrapatra’, the cover of which will be unveiled on Saturday. The unused scene in ‘Nayak’ is from the day before the release of the first film of the character (Arindam) played by Uttam Kumar. Arindam is seen travelling in a bus and suddenly he spots a poster of his film with his face in it. The co-passengers have also seen the poster and they begin to stare at him making the latter uneasy. Ray Society member Riddhi Goswami says that in the unused scene from ‘Chiriyakhana’, Byomkesh (Uttam Kumar) comes to visit his friend Dr Nag for a pressure check-up but his real intention is to collect information about Bhujangadhar. The scene describes their conversation. Ray’s high regards for Uttam Kumar is widely known. At a programme after his demise in 1980, Ray had famously said that he couldn’t find a single fault in the actor’s performance in ‘Nayak’. “There is no one like Uttam and there will be no one to ever replace him,” Ray had said. That’s why his decision to delete Uttam’s scenes has come as a surprise to many, including Sayandeb Chowdhury, who has authored “Uttam Kumar – A Life in Cinema”. “This scene would then be the first instance when Uttam’s character gets a taste of fame in ‘Nayak’. To shoot a scene in a bus with Uttam Kumar must have taken additional effort. I find it intriguing that Ray dropped it after shooting,” Chowdhury said. According to film-maker Sandip Ray, it’s difficult to pinpoint why his father never used these scenes. “He had shot the scene from ‘Nayak’ in an actual bus outside New Theatres I. The scene involving Arindam’s point of view was not shot. We would complete shooting everything before the crowd understood what was happening. We didn’t have a separate still photographer. These stills were from the camera used for filming,” he said. Soumyakanti Dutta, co-editor of ‘Bichitrapatra’, said: “These scenes are very significant. During the release of ‘Nayak’, Ray had done a sketch of Uttam Kumar for the film’s advertisements. He had also designed an interesting tabloid during the release of ‘Chiriyakhana’. This is the only time he had done such a design. As a mark of respect to the legends, we are offering a facsimile edition of this tabloid along with ‘Bichitrapatra’.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/peek-into-unseen-stills-of-ray-uttam-magic-on-actors-death-anniversary/articleshow/84691634.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Over 1,600 speeding vehicles booked, 50% from Bypass||KOLKATA: A Kolkata traffic police special drive to check speeding in the past two weeks — after a dozen fatal accidents this month — revealed a total of 1,614 violations across the city. That’s an average of 115 cases per day as detected on the laser speed guns, 11 of which were procured recently during the time of the enhanced Covid restrictions. According to Lalbazar, close to 50% of the total cases reported in the past two weeks have been reported from EM Bypass alone. In all, 886 cases have been reported from four guards serving the Bypass — Garia, Tiljala, Beliaghata and Ultadanga. “Once the restrictions were lifted, citizens were inclined towards overspeeding as they probably believed that the roads were less crowded. But we wanted to send out a strong message. We now possess 20 laser speed guns that can pick up the exact speed of cars much ahead of the spot where it is fixed,” said DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha. “The special drive has not only helped us understand how rampant is speeding, but has also helped identify the roads that need monitoring,” said an officer from the equipment cell of traffic police. 886 of speed violations have been reported on EM BypassThe cops have also identified the stretch between the Ruby Crossing and Kadapara where greater surveillance will be required. “The roads are wide and there are not enough vigilance at the borders — that would require coordination with both Bidhannagar city police and the Baruipur police — makes Bypass and its connectors most vulnerable to overspeeding,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar. “The Tiljala guard has recorded a maximum of 341 cases. Ultadanga has 232 cases. Beliaghata traffic guard reported 171 cases and Garia 142 cases. The south traffic guard has reported 266 cases of overspeeding. It is clear from the figures that besides Bypass, Basanti Highway (Tiljala guard) and the Park Street-JL Nehru stretches (South guard) will need monitoring, especially at night,” stated an officer. In contrast, Bhowanipore and Tollygunge traffic guards have reported 10 and 11 cases respectively. The cops have now proposed setting up of a dozen speed cams on the stretch between Garia and Ultadanga, along with night drives against trucks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/over-1-6k-speeding-vehicles-booked-50-from-bypass/articleshow/84689890.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Business||NCLAT won’t stay Piramal plan for DHFL||MUMBAI: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Friday refused an interim stay on Piramal Group’s resolution plan for Dewan Housing Finance (DHFL). The appeal against the resolution plan, which was approved by lenders and the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), was filed by 63 Moons Technologies. Last month, the NCLT had approved the resolution plan submitted by Piramal Capital and Housing for DHFL under the insolvency proceedings. The approval for the plan was challenged in the NCLAT by 63 Moons, which holds around Rs 200 crore of debentures issued by DHFL. The appellant company had requested an interim stay on the resolution plan until two appeals filed by it were disposed of. “If the averments made by appellant are juxtaposed with averments made by respondents, we do not find it a fit case to pass interim orders as sought. We do not think that any interim order as sought with regard to resolution plan approved needs to be passed,” the appellate tribunal said. Meanwhile, 63 Moons said that further action on Piramal’s DHFL resolution plan would be subject to the plea by 63 Moons. “The NCLAT today clarified that any steps taken in the DHFL matter in furtherance of the resolution plan will be subject to the outcome of the 63 Moons appeal and has set September 15, 2021 as the date for final hearing on the matter. Therefore, at the moment, the NCLAT has not interfered at the interim stage,” the appellant company said. It added that it will choose its future course of action after receiving a copy of the order passed by the NCLAT. “63 Moons has challenged NCLT’s approval of the resolution plan whereby Piramal had ascribed Re 1 for the potential recovery of Rs 45,000 crore of fraudulent transaction recoveries at the cost of DHFL’s creditors. This sum is the amount that the Wadhawans and others siphoned away from DHFL by defrauding the creditors. This Rs 45,000 crore should come to all the creditors, including the NCD holders,” the company said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nclat-wont-stay-piramal-plan-for-dhfl/articleshow/84692178.cms||---

The BJP leadership has taken up three days special campaigns from Friday to Sunday (July 23 to 25) to promote vaccination among the eligible recipients and deputed a three members team at every vaccination site to assist the beneficiaries. Mritunjay Tiwari, member of BJP state working committee told TOI, "a three-member team of the BJP including a youth party worker, a woman party worker and an office-bearer of the party with medical background is connecting and assisting with the beneficiaries at the various vaccination sites – community health centres and other medical units where vaccination is underway." He further added that “ the party leaders are also holding chaupals among the masses to promote vaccination among the eligible recipients and for that purpose they have also been knocking on the doors of the recipients in different wards, blocks and villages." Tiwari, meanwhile, added that the party aims to reach out to as many eligible recipients as possible and convince them to visit the vaccination sites and get vaccinated against the deadly virus. The party leadership has also spelt out the role and responsibilities of district-level leaders and office bearers to make the campaign successful.

Manjhi told mediapersons there was no wrong if the Mahadalit families (Hindus) have converted to Christianity on their own for their “growth and betterment”. “Ponder over this. Why have they adopted Christianity? They must have been ignored and their sentiments deeply hurt. They don’t get respect in their own houses,” Manjhi said, adding nobody pressured the Mahadalits to change religion. “Religious conversion is not a threat to the national security. Ours is a democratic country where every religion is equally respected,” he added. The HAM (S) chief recalled how a temple in Madhubani district was once washed soon after his visit. “This happened when I was the chief minister. If such a situation prevails, more incidents of conversation will come to light,” he added. Referring to Dr B R Ambedkar’s ideology, the HAM(S) supremo said he talked about common schooling system to bridge the gap between haves and have nots. Manoj Manjhi, a resident of Belwadih village, said most members of the Mahadalit community took part in prayers at a church under Dobhi block in the district. He alleged that they were not being allowed to offer prayers at the village temple by a section of people. Locals said around 200 Mahadalits from 35 families had earlier adopted Christianity at Atiya village under Pararia panchayat in Gaya district about seven years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/gaya-mahadalits-who-adopted-christianity-get-manjhis-support/articleshow/84687842.cms||Ramashankar

The HC bench, headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya, said necessary orders would be passed in the next hearing of the petitions. Residents of colonies abutting the Benz Circle flyover moved the high court seeking directions to construct a service road along the flyover according to National Highways Authority of India guidelines. They alleged that NHAI has been building the western side of the flyover in a similar manner on the eastern side without taking measures to develop the service road. They sought to vacate the stay on the single judge orders who directed NHAI to complete the service road within the stipulated time as per the guidelines. Senior counsel P Veera Reddy, arguing on behalf of NHAI, said as the flyover was developed on either side of the existing highway which makes it a 10-lane passage, a slip road has been proposed instead of a service road. The court asked to submit guidelines pertaining to development of service roads when highways pass through urban areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/flyover-service-rd-hc-to-study-nhai-guidelines/articleshow/84688447.cms||Srikanth Aluri

At Tata AIG, requests for business proposals and quotes have seen a sharp surge from one or two per day to five to 10 proposals per day. Its associate VP of Trade Credit & Political Risk, Amol Thakur said, “Most of the queries are formed on the back of businesses experiencing both delay and default in payments. Interestingly, there is a growing demand for trade credit insurance from MSMEs, with about Rs 5 crore turnover. Even have provided coverage on their entire receivables for large IT companies and even FMCG giants in the country.”Trade Credit Insurance is a risk management tool that covers the payment risk resulting from the delivery of goods or services. Currently, companies want insurers to customize policies which cover catastrophic losses Rs 5 crore to Rs 10 crore, unlike the range of Rs 5-Rs 50 lakh reported in the pre-Covid times, Thakur added. The premium could be in the range of Rs 5-Rs 10 lakh and over Rs 1 crore. For HDFC Ergo, it saw a 30% growth in premium collection between Q1FY2020 and Q12021, from across sectors with premium cost ranging between 1% to 5% of the sum assured. Anurag Rastogi, president – chief actuary & chief underwriting officer, at HDFC ERGO General Insurance, said, “Unlike the pre-Covid period in 2019, now any delay in payment of goods and services is reported as loss, as business owners fear uncertainty around State-imposed lockdowns and business disruption.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/trade-credit-insurance-demand-up-30-in-april-june-quarter/articleshow/84691037.cms||Mamtha Asokan

He said if this argument is true, then the arrest of an employee of the commission taking a bribe of Rs 23 lakh is a sample of foolproof system? “If you call it a foolproof system then what is a non-foolproof system? If your system is a fool proof system, what about the audio of employees seeking bribe to increase the score published in the newspapers,” he asked. He said cases of corruption and nepotism have come to the fore on such a large scale and nobody knows the number of candidates got unfair benefits. Another BJP leader and lawyer from Bikaner Surendra Singh Shekhawat in a media conference demanded that “the distorted interview process of RPSC be completely abolished. If necessary, it should be kept personality test without any bearing on the merit.” Shekhawat alleged that the relatives of Dotasra who come under the creamy layer category had denied the rights of genuine backward OBC candidates by making fake non-creamy layer OBC certificates. He asked what is the relation of Dotasra family had with Kalam Coaching Centre in Sikar? He alleged that a large number of selection in government recruitments are done after the Congress government came to the state from this institute, which proves that the racket of recruitment in government jobs is being operated from here. Meanwhile Congress leader and PCC secretary Jaswant Gurjar said Dr Pratibha Poonia and Avinash Dotasra were selected in RAS in 2016 during BJP rule and Dr Pratibha's marriage was decided after getting selected in RAS.

However, the head clerk of the office, Madhav Chandra Sah, managed to escape. Sources said Bharti was trapped by a vigilance team led by DSP Surendra Kumar Mauar. They added Bharti and Sah had demanded bribe from Raj, a resident of of Oli Tola of village under the Maranga police station area in Purnia, to disburse compensation of Rs 31.59 lakh for a piece of land acquired for construction of a national highway (NH) in Purnia. “One kattha of land owned by Raj’s mother Bindu Devi had been acquired by the government for the construction of the NH, but the compensation amount was not disbursed.

---||Nagpur||Study engineering in Marathi at two Pune colleges from this year||NAGPUR: Two colleges from Maharashtra have received permission from AICTE to start undergraduate engineering degree programmes in Marathi. They’re among 14 institutions across the country which applied to launch the course in vernacular languages after the apex body for engineering education invited applications as part of New Education Policy (NEP). Quoting AICTE chairman Anil Sahastrabudhe, TOI had on May 27 highlighted AICTE’s latest initiative in detail. AICTE aims to reach all aspirants, particularly from the rural and tribal areas, who find it difficult to study in English language. It plans to offer BE and BTech courses in Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Tamil, Gujarati, Kannada and Malayalam, besides Marathi. College of Engineering in Pune (COEP), and Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering (PCCE) received approval from AICTE to start engineering courses in Marathi. The COEP, one of the oldest and autonomous institutions, would be starting BTech in electrical and civil engineering, while PCCE would be offering the degree in computer engineering. “AICTE would be providing entire reading material in Marathi to colleges. We would be translating the material through our specially made software, that can translate the entire engineering syllabus into 22 regional languages in quick time. The students would also need to go through courses offered by Swayam and massive open online course (MOOC) portals,” AICTE’s approval process head Prof Rajendra Kakde said. Students would be admitted in batch size of 30 or 60, which can be increased from next academic year, depending on response. “They would also need to undergo ‘English graded courses’ from the first to eighth semesters, so that they attain fluency in English language when they graduate. We will also explore roping in experts to prepare study material for these courses so that there is uniformity across the country. The AICTE’s initiative has been applauded by vice president Venkaiah Naidu and new Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan,” Kakde, who earlier worked with Nagpur University’s department of pharmacy, told TOI. Out of 14 colleges to get permission, three are from Uttar Pradesh, two each from Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, and Rajasthan, and one each from Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, and Andhra Pradesh. Those from UP, Rajasthan, MP and Uttarakhand would offer the degrees in Hindi, while other states would offer them in their regional languages; Marathi, Telugu, Bengali and Tamil. A majority of them will be offering courses in computer science, followed by electrical, electronics, civil, mechanical and other branches. “The colleges from Vidarbha could have taken advantage of this golden opportunity from AICTE, as many parts, like Gadchiroli and Melghat, are still backward. Students from these areas would have benefited. I hope next year colleges will come forward to offer courses in native languages,” Kakde said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/study-engg-in-marathi-at-2-pune-colleges-from-this-year/articleshow/84687510.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Dr Meghna Dutta of IIT-Patna, who delivered the lecture, said, “The growing emphasis on small and marginal enterprises as a major source of economic growth has caused greater focus to be placed on the efficiency of credit markets in meeting the needs of these businesses. The exclusion of the unorganised production units from the formal lending process has over the years led to increasing outsourcing of the existing production structure whereby the small firms are forced to work for bigger formal firms on a ‘piece rate’ basis. This is effectively reducing even the owners of informal firms to becoming mere ‘piece rate’ wage workers.” Lack of formal credit for unorganised sector units has been a burning issue for a long time across the country and governments’ responses have often been far from being satisfactory, Dutta said. The lecture was attended by scholars and academics from Patna and other places in the country. Prabhat P Ghosh, member secretary of ADRI, was also present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/credit-for-unorganised-sector-a-far-cry-expert/articleshow/84687608.cms||---

The S-M bund is also called the Dagmara marginal bund. The superintending engineer of the flood control wing at the water resources department (WRD) headquarters, Patna, Lakhman Jha said as a result of the breach, the Kosi water was flowing into its tributary called Tilyuga located between the western Kosi embankment and the Majhari low bund. There is no threat to the western Kosi embankment, he added. The water flowing through the breach on the S-M bund had been running towards the Tilyuga river. The old bund – which is in the nature of a village protection bund – had been constructed way back in the early 1960s. The S-M bund is in the direction of Dagmara locality, while Nirmali is an emerging local business and trade hub in Supaul district. At present, the gushing water does not pose any threat to the Nirmali bazaar and its three panchayats.  “Fortunately, the water discharge through the Birpur barrage across Kosi river on the India-Nepal border had fallen to 1.70 lakh cusecs, when the breach occurred. Also, the water level in the Tilyuga is low and, therefore, it is comfortably taking in the gushing water and also letting it flow downstream and then back into Kosi,” Supaul DM Mahendra Kumar said, when contacted on phone. The Supaul DM also said no loss of life and property has yet been reported. “The situation is under control. The people in the villages in the lower reaches of the Tilyuga have been asked to move to higher ground near a village school,” he said, adding that the administration has also opened two community kitchens on the nearby school premises to provide relief to the displaced persons. Kumar, along with SP Manoj Kumar camped at the breached site till the situation was brought under control. Immediate alerts in the villages lying along the downstream of Tilyuga river have also been sent. “We have made arrangements to get the breach plugged,” the DM said, adding: “The velocity of the gushing water was very high.” The panic caused by the breach reminded of the fears of the August 18, 2008 breach in the eastern Kosi afflux embankment. It had caused huge losses in two districts of Nepal and six in Bihar. At Patna, WRD sources said a team of engineers from the Birpur division of the department, led by the area chief engineer, has been camping there to plug the breach. “The speed of the current is high, but the plugging work will be over by Saturday,” WRD source said. “The apprehension at the WRD headquarters is that the breach was caused deliberately by the local miscreants to let the gushing water coming from the already breached old bund near Bhutaha Chowk flow into Tilyuga river,” a WRD source said. The Supaul DM maintained that if Tilyuga river overflows its banks, it might result in water entering into the low-lying areas of three panchayats of the Nirmali block and 13 other panchayats of Maraura block.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/breach-in-sikarhatta-majhari-bund-creates-panic-in-supaul/articleshow/84688234.cms||Abhay Singh

The yellow-coloured wall has been decorated with colourful cartoon characters like Doremon, Micky Mouse, Spiderman and Madagascar among others, with an aim to create a warm and joyful ambience for children as there is a speculation that the third wave may affect kids more than people of any other age group. IGIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said to ensure that kids do not get scared during the Covid-19 treatment, the wall has been decorated like that in a playschool with images of birds, animals, family values, colourful alphabets in English and Hindi, Madhubani art and cartoon characters. “Kids usually get distressed in hospitals and we want to ensure that they feel happy during the visit,” he said. “Preparations have been made for the third wave as the government has already said that kids would likely to get affected. When a kid falls ill, the parents and the one who treat get emotional. To make kids and their parents at ease, the paediatric ward has been redesigned as a playschool. These arts will help divert their minds when they need to be administered injections or medicines,” Dr Manish said. “Psychological well-being plays an important role in the treatment and recovery from illness. The paintings will improve the atmosphere of the ward. Besides, kids will also learn through these paintings,” he said. The hospital administration has made all the preparations to tackle the Covid-19 cases among kids, if it happens, and arranged a 40-bed ward for them, including six with ventilators, eight beds in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), including two with ventilator support, and four beds in newborn intensive care unit (NICU). All the beds are connected with the oxygen supply. Dr Jayant Prakash, head of the paediatric department, said preparations have been made not only for Covid-19 but to ensure that children and their parents feel safe in the ambience of colorful wall paintings. “The ward has been made child-friendly,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/igims-paediatric-ward-walls-painted-with-colourful-images/articleshow/84687688.cms||Faryal Rumi

Under the new structure, Anganwadi and Intermediate standards will be included at the high school level, structured as pre-primary I to class XII. This was announced by chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy during his review meeting with officials on education at his Tadepalli camp office on Friday. He told the officials to start English medium from the pre-primary (Anganwadi) level itself to impart quality education. The schools are being restructured as satellite foundation schools, foundation schools, foundation plus schools, pre-high schools, high schools and high school plus, providing education in the English medium from the pre-primary (Anganwadi) level to the Plus II (Intermediate) level, the chief minister said. He wanted the satellite foundation schools to be located in every habitation, while the foundation schools are to be made available in a one kilometre radius and foundation plus schools in a 3 km radius. He told the officials to ensure that teachers are ready for the new structure and new teaching methods in English medium. The chief minister told them to create awareness among teachers and parents about the new education system. The officials informed the chief minister that two batches of class X students graduated without examinations due to Covid-19. They said that some students were facing problems in recruitment due to non-availability of marks. The chief minister told the officials to calculate marks for these two batches and give them marks lists based on their previous performance. The chief minister also reviewed the progress of renovation of schools, hostels and junior colleges under the Nadu-Nedu programme.

Started in 2010 by entrepreneur Devraj Sanyal and professor Suvojyoti Roy Chowdhury to investigate claims of paranormal activities and discover the truth behind unexplained phenomena, the core team of Sanyal, his wife Ishita, mechanical engineer Anindam Ghosal and phys-ician Ujjal Gupta has been attempting to eliminate fear of spooky occurrences. It was a documentary on one of their investigations in Darjeeling’s Dowhill that caught the attention of Kolkata Police and the team received a call from the police headquarters in Lalbazar to explain what they did. “Of over 200 cases we investigated, more than 99% are cases of mental illness. The only instance when we could not find a plausible explanation was at Dowhill,” said Sanyal. One of the first cases they were handed by the police was the ‘haunted’ Jorabagan Traffic Guard, located in a heritage building. During a visit to the traffic guard, additional CP (IV) Tanmoy Roy Chowdhury had learnt how a cop had taken a transfer citing spooky experiences and cops residing in the barracks on the second floor often complained of the “presence of a ghost”. “Some would wake up at 2am after a knock on their head and others complained of heaviness in the chest as though someone was sitting on them,” a cop said. Another said he had seen a child sleeping next to him before waking up with a start. The ghostbusters visited the traffic guard twice — they arrived at 7pm and stayed till 4am, around the time when the experiences apparently occurred. Sanyal was alone on the third floor but did not feel anything. “First, we try to discover the normal reasons behind what’s happening. Ghost experience can be psychosomatic or due to toxic gas or a powerful electromagnetic field radiation. In this case, it was the latter. There is a telecom tower on the roof and the third floor has a high degree of radiation. We believe this causes sleep disorder and sleep paralysis, which leads to hallucination,” said Sanyal. The owners of the nearby Putulbari have now sought the team’s help to resolve the ghostly occurrences in the mansion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-police-joins-ghostbusters-to-rise-above-fear-of-unknown/articleshow/84691610.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Desai told TOI that the two projects have been proposed in Nashik and he had a meeting with the MIDC officials on the issue. He said he has given instructions to the officials concerned to identify the land for both the projects at the earliest. The Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) has proposed a dry port project on over 100 acre in Niphad taluka of Nashik district, but the acquisition for the same is yet to be finalized. Last year, the JNPT had engaged a private professional services firm to prepare the detailed project report (DPR) for the dry port, but the overall project was delayed due to the Covid outbreak. The dry port will be connected by rail. Agricultural produce and other goods will be transported directly from the proposed dry port to JNPT Mumbai by rail and further exported by ship. The dry port will have facilities like custom clearance, value-added services like packaging, grading, loading and unloading, cold storage among others, that are required for the export of agricultural and industrial goods. Last week, the local BJP MP Bharti Pawar, who recently took charge as minister of state for health and family welfare, had a virtual meeting with the deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on the dry port issue. She had urged the CM to allot over 100 acres for the proposed dry port project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/midc-asked-to-identify-land-for-dry-port-project/articleshow/84703128.cms||Tushar Pawar

All officials, who acted as district sand officers in the past, have been repatriated to the parent department. About 15 senior officials of the mines and geology department including one joint director, three deputy directors, eight assistant directors and three assistant geologists have been relieved from the AP Mineral Development Corporation (APMDC) and asked to report to the parent department. Many of these officials were posted as district sand officers (DSO) when the government itself handled sand excavation and sales for over a year. The government had introduced an online system for the sale of sand after cancelling old leases granted to private parties. However, the government could not manage sand sale operations resulting in criticism from all the quarters. Subsequently, the government decided to go for open tender bidding system and selected JP Ventures to handle sand quarries in the state. The government directed the agency to appoint its own staff to manage the operations. Meanwhile, the government appointed G Paparao as deputy director in West Godavari district, P Venkateswara Reddy as DD, Anantapur and B Ravi Kumar as DD, Visakhapatnam. N Chandrasekhar who acted as OSD (sand) will get a new posting in APMDC. Similarly, B Jagannatha Rao was posted as DD, Nellore; N Venkata Krishna as DD, Vizianagaram; SKV Satyanarayana as DD, Chittoor; and D Sri Venkata Sai as DD in APMDC after getting promoted to deputy director from assistant director.

The court granted two weeks to the residents, who have been given alternative land and compensation for their houses, to look for alternative accommodation. Several petitions were filed in the high court challenging the demolition of houses. While some petitioners argued that they are being evicted without being given notices, others alleged that they were not given alternative house site or compensation. Special government pleader C Sumon told the court that the eviction process was taken up according to norms. He said all residents who encroached into irrigation lands have been paid compensation and are also being given alternative house sites. Arguing on behalf of petitioners, advocate Srinivas Rao Velivela said officials did not follow guidelines and forcefully evicted residents without giving them time to look for alternative accommodation. As Sumon told the court that he would file an affidavit pertaining to petitions alleging non-allotment of house sites, the matter was posted for further hearing after two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/court-stops-eviction-in-amara-reddy-colony/articleshow/84688517.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Acting president of Vishnupad Temple Management Committee (VTMC) Shambhu Lal Vitthal, secretary Gajadhar Lal Pathak and a senior member of Gayapal Panda Samaj, Mahesh Guput, met Gaya DM Abhishek Singh recently and requested him to convey their plea to CM Nitish Kumar for reopening of the shrine. “As the Covid situation in Gaya has improved, the government should reopen the Vishnupad temple,” Vitthal said. Guput too said the Vishnupad temple should be reopened ahead of Pitripaksh Mela. He added at least eight Gaya traders’ bodies, including Central Bihar Chamber of Commerce, and Autorickshaw Drivers’ Association have favoured reopening of the temple. “In absence of any income, pandas, footpath vendors selling ‘prasad’, flowers and garlands around the temple have been facing acute financial crisis,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-end-to-uncertainty-over-pitripaksh-mela/articleshow/84688361.cms||---

She framed definite guidelines for implementation of bail orders in line with the recent Supreme Court observations over the usage electronic means of communication. Observing that protection of personal liberty of an individual is undeniably the constitutional duty of the high court, Justice Lalitha said speedy delivery of justice is also equally important, and it is high time for the courts to address various issues causing delay in delivery of justice.

The matter came up during the hearing of Aslam’s bail application that was rejected by the court. Special public prosecutor Raghuvir Pandya said, “Aslam had threatened a court clerk some months ago over the issue of hearing dates and his application. The clerk had informed the court in writing about this. Aslam had applied for bail five days ago and the hearing for it was slated on Thursday.” “I raised the incident about Aslam’s threat to the court staffers during the bail hearing and said that if he can resort to such an act while in jail, then his behaviour won’t be good if he is given the bail. The court rejected his bail application and also ordered an FIR against Aslam for threatening court staffers,” Pandya told TOI. Aslam had applied for his transfer to another jail some months ago. A court staffer informed Aslam during a video conference that his application was dismissed and that angered him. He later threatened two court staffers.  Aslam was arrested by the crime branch in February this year after he and his Bichhu Gang members were booked under the Gujarat Control for Terrorism and Organized Crime Act (GCTOC) in January. It was the first case of GUJCTOC in the city and the crime branch arrested almost all the 26 members of Bicchu gang in the subsequent months. The cops decided to act sternly against the gang after its members committed two robberies in the city earlier this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/fir-ordered-against-bodiyo-for-threatening-court-staff/articleshow/84690009.cms||---

Profit grew 4% to Rs 13,806 crore in Q1FY22. Revenue totalled over Rs 1.4 lakh crore, up 58%, even as it faced disturbance in its activities due to the second wave of the pandemic. If the Rs 4,966-crore exceptional gain of Q1FY21 is excluded, then the company’s Q1FY22 profit is up 67%. Operating profit edged up 28% in the April through June months, aided by strong earnings in its three main businesses. “The results demonstrate the resilience of Reliance’s diversified portfolio of businesses that cater to large parts of the consumption basket,” said chairman and MD Mukesh Ambani. Operating profit of digital services climbed 19% to Rs 9,268 crore due to higher data usage by people, while remaining sheltered at homes due to Covid. However, average revenue per user (ARPU), a key metric that influences income, was down to Rs 138 even as the company added 14 million subscribers in Q1FY22. ARPU is the total revenue of the telecom operator divided by the number of users on its network. Launched in 2016, Jio has 441 million customers and saw data and voice traffic growth of 39% and 20%, respectively, on its network. ARPU in the year-ago period was Rs 140. Operating profit of O2C increased 50% to Rs 12,231 crore due to higher exports and price realisations. The company had combined its refining and petrochemicals units to form O2C. Significantly, digital’s profit was higher than its traditional bread and butter O2C business. Operating profit of retail rose 80% to Rs 1,953 crore, despite constrained operating conditions. Grocery and consumer electronics boosted the growth. To be sure, RIL had transferred the petro-retailing business to a joint venture with BP. “Covid-related restrictions on store operations impacted our retail operations. This is a temporary phenomenon. We remained focused on ensuring supplies of necessities through a combination of online-offline channels,” said Ambani. Store expansion was constrained as the business opened just 123 outlets. Operating profit of financial services, which the company recently started to report separately, plunged 65% to Rs 132 crore. Oil & gas, which recently turned around with the revival in KG-D6 gas production, made an operating profit of Rs 797 crore. While, operating profit of the media unit zoomed 596% to Rs 188 crore. RIL’s debt at the end of Q1FY22 was Rs 2.53 lakh crore. But RIL had more than enough in cash and cash equivalents (about Rs 2.57 lakh crore) to cover its debt. “RIL’s overall numbers are decent, taking into account the lockdown in India for several days in Q1FY22 followed by rising oil prices. However, the company’s vision of diversifying from chemical to retail has started to play out strongly,” said Sanctum Wealth Management director (research) Ashish Chaturmohta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ril-q1-profit-rises-4-to-nearly-rs-14k-cr/articleshow/84692050.cms||---

The severely undernourished and injured minor who was kept locked inside a dingy room. had to be admitted to the Rajkot Civil Hospital for treatment. However, the woman and her aunt with whom the girl lived, fled the spot fearing backlash. According to primary details, girl’s father Devesh Rangapara (name changed died four years ago. The crime perpetrated on the little girl would have remained confined within the house had her uncle not paid her a visit when the family had come to the village to attend an engagement ceremony. "On Thursday, when girl’s uncle Hitesh’s family and other relatives came to Navagam for an event in the family, they met the girl’s mother, Mithi (name changed). But she lied to them that her daughter had gone to her maternal home when they inquired about the minor. The uncle was, however, not convinced by the explanation and so, he went to check their house himself and found the house locked from outside. He jumped a wall to enter the house and found the girl locked up inside a room,” said sources. Hitesh was totally shocked to find the minor alone in the room with a stale bread and a bowl of water beside her. He got suspicious that the girl may have also been physically tortured seeing the injury marks on her body. But the girl was too scared to reveal and claimed that these were wasp stings. The uncle did not give up and softly convinced the girl to reveal the horrific tale she had been subjected to daily. The minor finally confiuded to her uncle the whole story on how her mother thrashed her over domestic chores and didn’t give her food, and also that the injury marks were borne from the clamp that she used to pin the girl. The uncle lost no time in rushing back to his family who were at the event and told them about his horrible discovery. An angry clan cornered Mithi and her maternal aunt, Prabha Dabhi, demanding the truth, but both women escaped from the spot. Rajkot police took the statement of the minor and her uncle and sent details to Chotila police for further probe in this case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/tortured-by-mom-6-yr-old-girl-rescued/articleshow/84690560.cms||---

Last year’s lockdown and the fear of getting infected among people indirectly gave warehouse space leasing in Surat and other clusters in south Gujarat a huge fillip. At least 75% of the warehousing leasing from Kosamba to Palsana belt in Surat district was done by e-commerce companies and third-party logistics firms. However, all metro and big cities witnessed an average drop in warehousing leasing of over 29% in fiscal 2020-21. As per details shared by real-estate consultant Knight Frank India in its Warehousing Report 2020-21 reveal that there was a massive increase of 80% to 8.3 lakh square feet. The report also stated that the Palsana-Sachin belt is a preferred region for e-commerce companies due to its proximity to Surat city and 44% of the transaction by volume were registered here as big e-commerce players occupied spaces. Vapi region combining Vapi, Daman and Silvassa too witnessed a surge of 296% to 6 lakh square feet of warehousing space being leased out. “Pandemic is a major factor as people e-shopped even for smallest of things. As this trend has increased, e-commerce companies are expanding their facilities to cater to the growing demands,” said Balbirsingh Khalsa, national director of industrial and asset services at Knight Frank (India) Pvt Ltd. Khalsa added that the entire region from Bharuch to Vapi will become a hub of warehouse market after Ahmedabad. Local realtors too believe that the online business has boosted demand for warehouse spaces in areas nearby Surat city. “People prefer to buy everything online nowadays after the pandemic. Therefore, many warehouses have come up especially in Palsana and Hazira-Palsana Road besides Navsari and Bardoli,” said Velji Sheta, a prominent realtor of Surat and former chairman of Credai Gujarat. “Industrial real-estate market in Surat is going through a good phase right now. As economic activities have picked up after the lockdown, the demand for warehouse spaces in areas like Sachin GIDC, Palsana, Kamrej and Kadodara have also increased and in some areas there has also been an increase in prices,” said Chuni Gajera, another prominent realtor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/shop-from-home-boosts-warehouse-leasing/articleshow/84690301.cms||Jay Pachchigar

Earlier, banks were allowed to lend just up to Rs 25 lakh. The central bank has also come out with definitions about which are the companies where the director is considered to be a major shareholder and the definition of their ‘control’ over a business. According to the circular, a director is considered to be a major shareholder if he has more than 10% of the paid-up share capital of a company or at least Rs 5 crore in paid-up shares, whichever is less. A person is considered to have control of a company if he has the right to appoint a majority of the directors or to control the management or policy decisions exercisable by a person acting individually or in concert. According to banks, the limit of Rs 25 lakh was fixed many years ago. With inflation, even average home loans were above this amount. This meant that even small borrowings would have to be approved by the bank’s board or management committee. The increase would mean that bank directors will not have a problem raising personal loans or other advances. A similar increase in limit has been allowed in the case of loans advanced to relatives of directors. Earlier, the RBI circular said that unless sanctioned by the board or management committee, banks should not grant loans and advances aggregating Rs 25 lakh and above to any relative other than the spouse or minor dependent children of the director. Here again, the limit has been increased to Rs 5 crore. The circular defines personal loans to directors to mean advances to individuals which consists of consumer credit, education loans, loans given for the creation of immovable assets and loans given for investment in financial assets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-raises-limit-for-loans-to-directors/articleshow/84692141.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Munna was carrying a reward of Rs50,000 on his head. He had been evading arrest since 2015. The village shares its border with Deoria district of (UP). Munna, also known as Dilip Mishra, Manoj Mishra and Eknayan Mishra, was coming to Gopalganj from UP on a bike when a Special Task Force (STF) and Gopalganj police team arrested him. STF sources said Mishra was a difficult catch as he didn’t use any phone to avoid surveillance. They said that Gopalganj SP Anand Kumar said they have so far been able to track 37 criminal cases of heinous nature against Munna, most of them of murder and extortion, registered with different police stations in Gopalganj. The SP said at least 14 criminal cases were registered between January 26, 2017 and May 24 this year. He was declared absconder by the court in many cases. “Besides Gopalganj, he was also active in Siwan and Deoria (UP). We are gathering details from the police of these two districts. We expect the number of criminal cases registered against Munna to exceed 50 once details against him from the other two districts are made available to us,” Kumar said, adding Munna was evading arrest from UP police, too. The SP said he had killed a key witness of a murder case on September 6 last year and then a trader for his refusal to pay extortion on May 24 this year. Both the cases were registered with Kateya police station. “He had used the same AK-47 in both the murders. Munna has shared details from where he had procured the automatic weapon. But we can’t disclose it at present,” Kumar said. SP Kumar said Munna used to operate in a different way and never made any extortion calls to anyone. “He would directly reach the residence of a contractor on his getting a tender passed or a businessman for extortion. He used to give them a fortnight’s time for payment. One additional chance was given after failure to pay within that period. On failure to pay, he used to kill them,” he said. Kumar said Munna had been active in crime world since 1998. Kumar said he had first killed a person on April 12, 1998 under Kateya police station area. “He was in jail for at least five years and had come out on bail in 2015 to become active again,” SP said. “At least seven gang members of Munna had already been arrested and three more are yet to be nabbed,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/criminal-wanted-in-bihar-up-and-carrying-rs-50k-reward-held/articleshow/84688449.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Poster boy of aggressive expansion, Vasan Eye went into insolvency process after it failed to repay debts of nearly Rs 1,628 crore and its creditors dragged the company to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to recover their dues. Its misery was compounded after regulatory authorities initiated probes into investments made by politicians. It further went down the spiral after its promoter Dr Arun died last November, pulling the company into insolvency courts. Two attempts to find a suitor didn't make any progress and the current one is the third. The Resolution Professional appointed by NCLT has called for a preliminary expression of interest (EoI) with the last date for submission of EoI ending July 19. Serial healthcare entrepreneur Dr GSK Velu’s MaxiVision has submitted its initial intent for a takeover. “Our eye care business MaxiVision has submitted its interest. It is a long shot. Our logic is simple: we are strong in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Vasan has a strong presence in other southern states. Vasan has 94 units operational and earned nearly Rs 140 crore in revenues last year. And since the process is driven by NCLT, legal issues will be dealt with and the asset will come clean to the buyer,” Dr Velu said. Calls and text messages to the Resolution Professional turned futile.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gsk-velus-maxivision-shows-interest-in-vasan-eye/articleshow/84691080.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli

Last year, three women were robbed in a similar manner in the city within a span of 24 hours. Verma and Meera were returning to their home in Bhandewadi when they were approached by a couple and a teenager with them. The teenager went near Verma and Meera, asking them about any ATM outlet in the vicinity. As they denied knowing any ATM outlet nearby, the couple and the teenager circled them once, following which the victims started following them. The trio stopped after reaching a desolate place and asked the women to rest, also offering them some water. The women were subsequently asked to hand over their jewellery, which they allegedly did without resisting. The tricksters soon left the place. After regaining their bearings, the women went home and later approached Pardi police station, where an offence was registered against the three unidentified tricksters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hypnotized-women-hand-over-valuables-to-tricksters/articleshow/84687520.cms||Soumitra Bose

The revamped centre had started offering Covid-19 services in the second wave from April, while teleconsultation services began in May. The state health department has brought in 5,523 doctors, including 1,132 specialists, for virtual triaging of suspected cases based on their symptomology and diagnostics through this centre. These doctors would call Covid-19 patients who opted for home isolation and guide them on medications and treatment. They would also counsel suspected cases on testing and other measures. In case of any deterioration in the health of patients in home isolation, the doctors would refer them either to designated hospitals or Covid care centres. The health department conducted trainings and webinars on Covid-19 protocols to these doctors, and a dedicated application was created for them. When it came to inbound calls, the call centre executives were tasked with providing information related to testing centres, status of tests and the availability of beds in hospitals and Covid care centres, and raising a request for Covid-19 testing and hospital/care centre admissions. To achieve all these objectives, the district call centres have also been fully activated with dedicated phone lines and placement of sufficient manpower to work on a round-the-clock basis At the peak of the pandemic in May, the centre received an average of 15,000 calls a day. Corresponding with the reduced case numbers, the daily calls have now dropped to below 1,000. According to officials, about 180 people are working at the state 104 call centre in three shifts. Apart from virtual triaging by doctors, the centre has also tied up with ambulances to shift patients to hospitals. Contact tracing, as well, is being done through the centre. The health department recently decided to expand the 104 call centre to all urban local bodies and mandals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/aps-104-telemedicine-service-crosses-10-lakh-consultations/articleshow/84688322.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Serbian winged visitors find the going tough in Telikunche bird sanctuary||SRIKAKULAM: Negligence by officials and frequent cyclones are taking a heavy toll on the Telikunche bird sanctuary that houses migratory birds. Like every year, the winged visitors—open billed storks—have landed in the tiny village of Telikunche in Ichapuram mandal but their numbers have come down drastically. Over the years, cyclones such as Titli and Phailin have uprooted hundreds of trees in the region and the migratory birds have lost their nesting place in the village. The number of birds has come down by around 30% compared to previous years. “Presently, the birds are depending on haystacks, houses and farm fields for nesting. But poisonous insects pose a threat to them,” locals said. Birds stay in the village surroundings for almost six months from June to November-December every year. This year, they arrived late from Siberia. Migratory birds nest in and around the village, mostly in private places, that are often trees in the backyards of the houses of villagers, but many say government officials are not helping out by constructing sheds or nesting facilities. Villagers of Telikunche believe that the birds bring good fortune and treat them as their children by protecting the eggs of the birds. “They used to nest on the trees in the backyards of our houses. Villagers never harmed the birds. In fact, they believe that these birds would bring rain. Villagers get tense if the birds do not land on time,” Ramu, a local, said. Every year, the villagers warn others that if anybody tries to hurt or harm the birds, they would be tonsured. They even protect the birds from poachers. “Each bird lays two to six eggs and hatches them. They leave the place in December or January along with their newborn. These birds have been coming to the village for more than a century as we came to know from our grandfathers. We are trying to protect them. The authorities should also make few arrangements for the nesting of the birds,” village sarpanch P Rajasekhar Reddy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/serbian-winged-visitors-find-the-going-tough-in-telikunche/articleshow/84688660.cms||Siva G

During the hearing on a petition challenging the appointment of Nilam Sawhney as state election commissioner (SEC), Justice Battu Devanand said the government should also consider the state’s economic condition while appointing advisors. “Earlier, advisors to the government were not used to speak to the media. But now some of them are talking politics in public domain. Are there any guidelines to appoint a person as advisor to the government and the need for as many as 41 advisors?” Justice Devanand asked. One Regu Maheswara Rao from Vizianagaram had moved the high court challenging the appointment of Sawhney as SEC, stating that the appointment was in violation of Supreme Court guidelines direction that an independent person should be appointed as SEC. Advocate general S Sriram said the appointment was made by following the norms. The petitioners cannot allege that she is not an independent person only because she worked as an advisor to the government. Justice Devanand asked about the eligibility criteria to get appointed as an advisor. Sriram said there were no specific guidelines, adding that subject experts are being appointed as advisors to bring in more efficiency. Further hearing on the petition has been posted to July 28.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/consider-eco-state-while-appointing-advisors-hc/articleshow/84688481.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Recently, a report was published that government schools in small towns and villages have started calling students to schools without any formal declaration by the state government. Yashodhar Tiwari, a principal of a school in Jamwa Ramgarh, said that parents have started forcing them either to start schools or give them transfer certificate. “We are calling students as in most of the villages, government schools are opened. Hence, parents started pressurising us to open schools as well. Most students are not comfortable in online classes, so for those students we have opened schools,” said Tiwari.In Alwar city, another school is functioning and Lokesh Mishra, school principal said that they have to call students who do not have facilities for online classes and gadgets.Anil Sharma, president of School Shiksha Pariwar, said that government must take action against the government schools that are functioning in rural areas. “In most of the government schools in small towns and rural areas classes are being held, then why shouldn’t we call students in our schools. Parents have also pressurised us for the same as not everyone can afford online classes with good internet and gadgets. It is better for both and government need to curb their own before pointing fingers at us,” said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/several-schools-functioning-even-before-announcement/articleshow/84692315.cms||---

An already rain-soaked Mahabaleshwar in Satara district broke records since 1901 when it received 594.4mm rainfall in 24 hours till 8.30am on Friday. It is the highest rainfall so far not only for July but also for any month for the hill station. It had received 480mm of rain till 8.30am on Thursday. Poladpur weather station in Raigad district recorded 305mm rainfall in 24 hours till 8.30am on Friday, the third-highest 24-hour rainfall for July since 1901. Vaibhawadi and Dodamarg in Sindhudurg district recorded the fourth-highest 24-hour spells in 120 years on Friday. Pulak Guhathakurta, head of the climate research division in India Meteorological Department (IMD), Pune, told TOI that rainfall over the last two days in Mahabaleshwar was unique for 24-hour. “On July 22, the hill station recorded 480mm rainfall in 24 hours till 8.30am on Thursday. The previous highest 24-hour July rainfall in Mahabaleshwar was 439.8mm, recorded on July 7, 1977. The next two highest July precipitations were 432.9mm on July 26, 2005 and 432 mm on July 31, 2014,” he added. All four rivers that originate in this scenic town in the Western Ghats___Srishna, Koyna, Venna and Savitri__are in spate, flooding the districts they flow through. The inundation, landslides and devastation over the past two days is unlike that of 2019, when large amounts of water was discharged from the dams. Incessant and heavy rain in Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli, Ratnagiri and Raigad districts have caused havoc now,” he added. As the aerial distance between Mahabaleshwar and Mahad in Raigad district as well as in Navaja in Satara district and Chiplun is not much, heavy rainfall brings water gushing into these towns. Ratnagiri’s guardian minister Uday Samant said Navaja had received 726mm rainfall while Chiplun had received 600mm of rain on Friday. “In Chiplun, we have to count the actual rainfall here and the torrents that flow down the hills and bring water to the town. Even now, the rivers in the district __Jagbudi, Vashishti, Kajali, Shastri, Kushkundi__ are flowing above the warning level. Till 2am on Friday morning, we did not know what the next day will bring. The water has receded now and people are able to step out of their houses in some parts. However, the IMD has issued a warning for the next three days and we have to stay alert," he said. Poladpur weather station in Raigad district recorded 305mm rainfall till Friday morning, the third highest 24-hour rainfall for July in 120 years. It rained 589mm on July 26, 2005 and 378mm on July 28, 1991. Guhathakurta said since July 18, Mahabaleshwar has received heavy to extremely heavy rainfall for all six consecutive days. “The strong off-shore trough from Maharashtra coast to north Kerala coast along with a well- marked low pressure area over northwest Bay of Bengal off north Odisha-West Bengal coasts have caused such spells over the state. Whenever these two systems exist together, rain intensity and spread increases,” he added. Meteorological sub-divisions of Konkan & Goa, Madhya Maharashtra and Marathwada received excess rainfall from June 1 to July 23 with Mumbai suburbs, Ratnagiri, Beed, Jalna and Parbhani recording a large excess.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/594-4mm-rain-for-already-soaked-mahabaleshwar/articleshow/84692338.cms||Neha Madaan

Thus, inoculation will take a hit for the 19th day in 32 days since resumption of vaccination for 18-44 years age group. Vaccination had been hit on Wednesday and Thursday due to lack of Covishield doses. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) resumed vaccination on Friday in the city and 27,558 people took the jab at 153 centres while 870 people were administered vaccine in 14 private centres. Thus, 28,428 people benefited in the city on Friday. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said, “Vaccination of 18-44 years age group will not happen at the centres for Covishield on Saturday due to shortage of doses. Inoculation of 45-plus will continue at Covishield centres but in limited manner. Vaccination will also continue for 18-plus in centres for Covaxin.” As per sources from the office of deputy director of health services (DDHS), fresh stock is likely to arrive in the district on Saturday evening. So, the civic body can resume vaccination on Sunday. Last week, NMC had decided to keep vaccination closed on Sunday despite receiving fresh stock last Saturday. A decision for this week will be taken in the meeting on Saturday. Vaccination continued in rural as Zilla Parishad (ZP) had sufficient stock of doses and 13,585 people took the jab. Joshi said NMC has started to receive applications for vaccination of bedridden people. “We have received detailed information from 19 such persons. We will wait for some more and decide the date to start vaccination of such people by sending teams to their homes,” he said. A few days ago, the government had allowed vaccination of bedridden people and made available an email ID to send the details. NMC launched its own Google form for collecting the details.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/28248-took-jab-on-fri-no-vax-again-today/articleshow/84687538.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

But this rare owl let out just a handful of its soft, musical hoots in broad daylight and it was discovered in the heart of MCM DAV College for Women campus in Sector 36A. The discovery of a lone Brown Hawk owl, also known quaintly as the Brown boobook, was realised as part of the college's annual biodiversity audit conducted during lockdown. The star feathered guest on campus, which has, in decades past, felicitated guests of honour as illustrious as late Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw and legendary cricketer Kapil Dev, elated the principal and the Zoology department. Requests came pouring in from Tricity birders and enthusiasts who wanted to have a look or photograph the elusive owl. The college has a densely-foliaged nallah running at its rear, which bears a rich biodiversity that spills over into the campus. Some cobras also venture in, which sends a shiver down the faculty's spines! Apart from this lone, rare owl, the Zoology department's team of Dr Neetu, Dr Divya Sharma, Dr Sarabjit and Kadambari Pathania have recorded 33 avian species on the campus, including the Indian Scops owl, Indian Paradise flycatcher, White-throated kingfisher and the Crimson sunbird. Principal Nisha Bhargava, a Nature enthusiast, encouraged the Zoology faculty to initiate the audit in right earnest and provided the team with a camera. Bhargava herself compiled a booklet of her Nature photography on the campus, including photo-documentation of a growing family of Indian Grey hornbills (Chandigarh's State Bird). The rare boobook ventured into the campus and took refuge in a bamboo clump next to the lawn because the area was undisturbed due to a lockdown-enforced absence of students. Online classes provided the faculty some extra time, which was fruitfully used for a biodiversity scan. Searching for owls requires considerable craning of the necks to scan the foliage maze above as these creatures effect camouflage by keeping perfectly still, largely silent during the day and merging with the colour and shapes of foliage. Had it not been for a couple of hoots in broad daylight while the team members were wandering on the campus looking for birds to count, they may never have realised its secretive presence right under their noses. This owl species is a rarity for Chandigarh as its density of occurrence increases only well east of the city, extending through the Terai foothills to the North-east and then to South-east Asian countries. They were first discovered in Chandigarh at Punjab University's Dr P N Mehra Botanical Gardens in 2014. Since then, photographic records of a few specimens have come in from Shanti Kunj, Leisure Valley, Nagar Van, and a recording only of its nocturnal hoots from GCG, Sector 11. It is commonly known as a hawk owl because it lacks the typical facial disc of owls, has a barred tail, a hawk-like profile with slim body and long tail and narrow head. The owl's flight of rapid wing beats and glides and then sweeping upwards swiftly to alight on a branch is so typically hawk-like. The Zoology faculty's concern is that when the campus teems with student life once again when colleges reopen, would the star guest prefer to stick to its perch on the campus despite the attendant chatter and exuberance or depart leaving glorious memories, photos, and a few discarded feathers in its wake? But what the audit has shown is that it is fruitful to look up the proverbial backyards of institutions, parks and bungalows for avian and other delights. Chandigarh, with its rich array of mature trees and geographical location, harbours an awesome, untapped potential for biodiversity discoveries. At IISER, Mohali, its Behavioral Ecology Lab, under the tutelage of Dr Manjari Jain, has over the years, listed 130 resident/passage/migratory bird species on campus and as many as a 100 moth species during the course of the proverbial 'backyard mothing'.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rare-boobooks-noon-hoot-reveals-secret-perch-at-mcm-dav-college/articleshow/84689894.cms||---

---||Delhi||‘White-collar crimes’: Delhi court denies bail to Amrapali group head||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has dismissed the bail plea of one of the directors of Amrapali group, Ajay Kumar, in a multi-crore scam case involving alleged cheating of investors and homebuyers, saying the allegations fall within the category of economic offences that are committed in a “pre-planned” manner. Additional sessions judge Surabhi Sharma Vats said the chances of the accused threatening the victim could not be ruled out as huge money was involved in the case. “The offences alleged are white-collar crimes and fall within the category of economic offences that are committed in a pre-planned manner with cool calculations and designs to derive wrongful personal gains regardless of its consequences on the society at large. Economic offences stand at a grave footing than the other offences. The nature and gravity of the offences alleged are quite serious. The present matter involves huge amount of money affecting the public at large,” the court said. Advocate Gaurav Dalal, appearing for complainant Anubhav Jain, had claimed that the investigation has revealed that the agreement/transaction between the parties was for sale/purchase of 26 flats and Rs 6.6 crore was paid to the accused persons in the case, but later it came to light that the flats were in a non-existent project. An FIR was registered by the Economic Offences Wing of Delhi Police on Jain’s complaint against M/s Amrapali Silicon City Pvt Ltd and its directors or officials, including Kumar. It has been alleged in the FIR that in November 2011, the directors had approached Jain and represented that they would hand over the vacant physical possessions of 26 fully furnished flats in Tower G-1 in the project “Amrapali Silicon City”, proposed to be developed at Sector- 76, Noida, by September 2013. The complainant invested in the project by making full payment of Rs 6.6 crore in November 2011 and an MoU was also signed as per which possession of the flats was to be delivered by September 2013. Police claimed that Tower G-1 was not sanctioned by the Noida Authority, but still the accused persons sold/allotted the flats. Kumar claimed he was falsely implicated in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/white-collar-crimes-court-denies-bail-to-amrapali-group-head/articleshow/84689924.cms||Usha Das

Shivajinagar recorded 77.2mm rainfall, while Pashan and Lohegaon recorded 63.4mm and 57mm rainfall, respectively, from 8.30am to 5pm on Friday. Anupam Kashyapi, head of IMD Pune’s weather department, said, “The Mumbai weather radar on Friday night showed clouding over Pune with strong westerlies approaching the city.” Hence, a few intense spells continued on Friday night as well, he said. The city roads resembled rivers at several spots in Warje, Karvenagar and Mhatre bridge. Waterlogging on roads near Bhairoba nullah triggered congestion in Fatimanagar. Traffic slowed in other parts too. Discharge from Khadakwasla swelled the Mutha river and submerged the Bhide bridge. The situation was better at Ambil Odha compared to the September 25, 2019 deluge as PMC continued water discharge from the two Katraj lakes . At least “15-foot free level” would constantly be maintained at the lakes, an official said. The Bhairoba nullah did overflow, but it did not flood the nearby homes. The local corporator, Nanda Lonkar, said, “We regularly cleaned the nullah. The boundary wall protecting societies was reconstructed.” Poornima Bhattari, a resident, said, “Our basement was waterlogged for two days during the 2019 floods. This time, there was no such issue.” The PMC had a plan to shift 300 families living along the riverbanks.

---||Varanasi||Hindus, Muslims swap land for Kashi Vishwanath Dham||VARANASI: Just before the beginning of the Hindu holy month of Shravan, the Muslim community has announced a gift for Shri Kashi Vishwanath Temple Trust (SKVTT) in the form of a piece of land measuring 1,700 square-feet, adjacent to the Gyanvapi mosque for the development of Kashi Vishwanath Dham (corridor). In return gift, the temple administration has given a piece of land measuring 1,000 square-feet to the Muslim community. Though the announcement in this regard was made on Friday in Varanasi, the deal between the two parties was finalized on July 9. However, the dispute of Kashi Vishwanath Temple (KVT) and Gyanvapi mosque regarding the survey of the entire premises by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is still in the court. The exchange deal was finalized on July 9 and signed by chief executive officer (CEO) of Shri Kashi Vishwanath Temple Trust, Sunil Kumar Verma on behalf of the UP governor and Abdul Batin Nomani of the Anjuman Intezamiya Masajid. The property description includes house number CK/12, 13 Aadi Vishweshvar and CK 31/19 Gyanvapi ward, Chowk. The stamp duty (Rs. 9.29 lakh) was paid by SKVTT CEO. Talking to TOI on Friday, divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, “The property given by the Muslim side was owned by the Wakf Board and the Gyanvapi-KVT control room was situated on this land. Since the land was needed for the development of Kashi Vishwanath Dham, we offered a piece of land to them (Muslim community) on the main road and they agreed.” “It took almost two years to make the exchange deal,” said SM Yasin of Anjuman Intezamiya Masajid, adding that the permission of Sunni Central Waqf Board and opinion of all clerics was taken before the deal. “All agreed, and the deal was finalized amicably. There was no pressure from the government side,” Yasin told TOI on Friday. “The existing dispute regarding ASI survey in the court has nothing to do with this deal. We hope that it will give a message of communal harmony,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/hindus-muslims-swap-land-for-kashi-vishwanath-dham/articleshow/84690311.cms||Binay Singh
---||Chandigarh||Fourth serosurvey finds over 67% in Punjab have antibodies||CHANDIGARH: The fourth serological survey conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in Punjab has shown a seroprevalence of 67.20%. Over 83 medical professionals and more than 63 from the general population out of every 100 have been found exposed to Covid-19. The presence of antibodies in such a large number of people is in sync with the state being among the worst-hit states in the country during the second wave. In a serosurvey, blood samples of participants are collected to determine the spread of the virus in the selected population. The latest survey was conducted in four districts — Gurdaspur, Patiala, Jalandhar and Ludhiana — for which samples were collected in June from a randomly selected population of 1,985, of which 1,334 were found exposed to Covid-19 and had developed antibodies. Out of 400 health workers included in the survey – 100 each from selected districts— 333 (83.25%) had contracted the virus and recovered. The highest of 87 were found to have contracted the virus and recovered in Gurdaspur, 85 in Ludhiana, 82 in Patiala and 79 in Jalandhar. Among the general public, 67.20% were found exposed in the four districts from where 1,585 samples were tested. Out of 397 samples, 282 (71%) were found positive in Ludhiana, 261 out of 398 (65.6%) in Jalandhar, 248 out of 391 (63.4%) in Gurdaspur and 210 out of 399 (52.6%) in Patiala. The percentage of people found exposed to the highly contagious virus in the latest survey is manifold higher than the findings of the third survey conducted by ICMR in January. During the third serosurvey, 19.45% were found to be exposed to the virus, in the second 11.26% and below 1% in the first in these four districts. With the third wave around the corner, the findings of the serosurvey assume significance as a large population is still vulnerable. To keep the infection rate under control, the government needs to step up containment and management measures. Principal health secretary Hussan Lal maintained that a comprehensive action plan has been drawn for tackling a possible third wave. "A major part of the plan has already been executed," he said. Experts have been calling for increasing the coverage of Covid vaccination. Punjab has so far managed to administer 90,81,574 doses of vaccine since the launch of the drive from January 16. Punjab has fully vaccinated 5.6% of its population and has administered the first dose to 24.8% of the eligible population. The count of fresh cases has been falling after peaking during May 6-12 when 60,030 people contracted the virus-- the highest weekly count since the start of the pandemic. The weekly caseload has been falling since and touched 592 during last week. The positivity rate in the last few weeks has remained below the limit of 1%. The weekly positivity rate till last week of January was at 0.90% and started to climb from mid-February and remained much above the 5% limit fixed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) till May-end. After the second wave subsided, the positivity rate fell below the 5% mark for the first time in the first week of June and dropped below 1% on July 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/fourth-serosurvey-finds-over-67-in-pb-have-antibodies/articleshow/84694537.cms||Vinod Kumar

---||Delhi||Delhi: After long fight, end in sight for seepage woes at GK-II||NEW DELHI: After the residents’ persuading the authorities to take steps to resolve the problem of seepage in basements in Greater Kailash II, Delhi Jal Board has at long last started installing borewells in some parks to draw out the excess groundwater and prevent flooding of houses. It was decided to install borewells in four South Delhi Municipal Corporation parks. “After a joint team of the agencies concerned visited the affected area, work has started on the installation of borewells at E Block, Sehgal Market 1 and 2 parks, M Block Tikona Park and M Block Market Park,” said Sanjay Rana, president, GKII RWA. “The two at Sehgal Market 2 and M Block market have been provided with electricity connections and so have become operational. The other two will get power connections soon.” The extracted underground water will be dumped into drains for the moment, but in the long term there is a plan to construct a separate system and use such water for drinking purposes. “Two more sites will be identified soon for a total of six extraction sites and pumps will be installed in a month’s time,” revealed a DJB official. “We will channel the extracted water to the underground reservoir in the area, but this proposal is being processed and will need technical and financial approvals.” The residents are a relieved lot. “In May, we were informed that the lieutenant governor had called a joint meeting with the CEO of DJB and commissioner of SDMC to look at the matter. Then deputy secretary, water, wrote to DJB for an update on the subject, notifying the RWA,” said Rana. Water is being extracted also from three other sites since last year. S R Sharma, treasurer, RWA, GK II, said “The pumping was halted in winter, but on expressing alarm in May and pursuing area councillor Subhash Bhadana, SDMC deputy commissioner Sonal Swaroop directed the 24x7 operation of the three borewells at parks in S Block, Sehgal Market 1 and Tikona Park.” In August 2020, the residents were alarmed by the flooding of their basements. Worried that the water would damage the foundations, they approached the Central Ground Water Board, SDMC, DJB, PWD and Delhi Metro Rail Corporation. In October, Delhi High Court directed SDMC to unclog the stormwater drains in the area. In its final report after investigations in March, CGWB asked DJB to pump out groundwater for supply in E, M and S blocks of the neighbourhood.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-long-fight-end-in-sight-for-seepage-woes-at-gk-ii/articleshow/84690082.cms||Vibha Sharma

River Tapi, which originates from Betul district in Madhya Pradesh, flows through Jalgaon and Nandurbar before entering Gujarat. “Although there has not been any significant rain in Jalgaon and Nandurbar in the last 48 hours, the water level of the river swelled considerably as there has been good rain in Madhya Pradesh,” said officials. The Jalgaon administration had initially opened 20 radial gates of the dam at 7 pm on Thursday and released 34,785 cusec of water. After three hours, the remaining 21 radial gates were also opened and 1,06,122 cusec of water was discharged. On Friday at 6 am, another 1,30,665 cusec of water was released. With the discharge of such a huge amount of water from the dam, the radial gates of the two barrages at Prakasha and Sarangkheda (both in Nandurbar) were also opened last night. In Jalgaon, there are 23 villages in three talukas, that are located near the river banks. Similarly, in Nandurbar there are about 20 villages in Shahada sub-division which are close to the river. “Though there is no fear of inundation in any of these villages at this juncture, the alert has been sounded so that the villagers refrain from going into the river,” the officials said. Chetan Girase. the sub divisional officer of Shahada in Nandurbar, said the field staff of the administration has been instructed to patrol the river banks to ensure villagers do not venture into the river at present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/43-villages-on-alert-in-jalgaon-nandurbar/articleshow/84687691.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Many other districts such as Adilabad, Rajanna Sircilla, Mahbubabad, Warangal (rural and urban), Adilabad, Karimnagar, Narayanpet, Nizamabad, Kamareddy and Komaram Bheem are inching closer to surpass their seasonal rainfall figures. As per the India Meteorological Department, Hyderabad figures, Hyderabad too has recorded double the amount of rainfall that it usually witnesses during this period. So far, Hyderabad has witnessed 98 percent of excess rains to the tune of 438.2 mm as against normal of 221.3 mm. Locals catch fish near the Osmansagar reservoir after the opening of floodgatesClimate change experts had earlier predicted that specific regions would have shorter but more intense rains, which could eventually hurt the sowing pattern of crops. GHMC workers demolish a dilapidated building in Abids on FridayTelangana State Development Planning Society (TSDPS) said its mandal-wise analysis and month-wise normal rainfall figures for the 30 years period (1989-90 to 2018-19) indicate that Nirmal records an average of 901.1 mm of rains during the southwest monsoon (from June to September). But even as the southwest monsoon is yet to peak, the district has already received 939.6 mm of rainfall, showing a change in the climatic pattern. “In the last 10 years, the number of heavy rainfall events have only increased over Telangana. Frequency of intra-seasonal activities can be attributed to this increasing in number of days witnessing intense spells. In addition to this, El-Nino (warming of the ocean waters) and urbanisation have also contributed to the monsoon wrath,” said YV Rama Rao, chief meteorologist, TSDPS. According to Skymet, an independent weather forecasting agency, the reasons for this excess rainfall can be attributed to the persistence of a north-south trough extending from eastern parts of the country to Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/monsoon-quota-full-t-dists-reel-under-deluge/articleshow/84692435.cms||Preeti Biswas

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Transport department issues beacon notification||KOLKATA: The state transport department on Friday issued a fresh notification on the use of multi-colour beacons on vehicles after their rampant misuse was reported. This has prompted the cops to remove beacons from the vehicles where those were used illegally. The multi-colour beacons are specifically used by police, fire brigade, disaster management group, defence forces for the maintenance of law and order, duties relating to control of fire and in controlling disasters like landslide, building collapse, flood, cyclone, tsunami or nuclear, chemical or biological catastrophes. Apart from the officers and personnel, the departmental ministers are for the first time included in the list. The chief secretary and departmental secretaries, divisional commissioners and district-level officers were also included in the list. The notification issued by the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) in 2017 specified the vehicles that can have multi-colour beacons. The notification also made it clear that the transport minister must issue stickers to the specific officers, on whose vehicles the beacon will be used on security printed water-mark paper with hologram. Immediately after the release of the notification, a misconstrued idea was floated, erupting a controversy on how the governor, the assembly speaker and the leader of the opposition are left out from the list of dignitaries entitled beacons.  However, the transport minister Firhad Hakim said that this multi-colour beacon has nothing to do with beacons of dignitaries. “The notification of the transport department is being misinterpreted. The said beacon is meant for only emergency services. However, we will be issuing a fresh list of dignitaries who can use beacons. After the Debanjan Deb (who used beacons on his car to dupe people) incident, we learnt a lesson,” said transport minister Firhad Hakim. The notification also said that when not on such duty relating to controlling fire, law and order or a disaster, the vehicles cannot use such beacons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/transport-dept-issues-beacon-notification/articleshow/84690056.cms||---

Talking to reporters, Saniya Anwar of Climate Agenda said that the People’s Manifesto demands full and time-bound implementation of UP’s Solar City programme in all cities, including Varanasi. The manifesto also demands to increase the number of cities under the programme, as per their cultural, tourism and geographical relevance. The manifesto focuses on increasing the solar energy consumption in the state in order to resolve UP’s climate crisis as well as to explore huge employment opportunities for the jobless youths of the state. She said that the temple and the mosque being built in Ayodhya have set an extraordinary example before the society and the religious communities in India by adopting solar energy as their main source of energy. “A large-scale increment in solar energy consumption will attract major investments towards UP and will resolve the climate as well as employment crisis of the state,” she said. She also urged all political parties to incorporate the demands of the People’s Manifesto on solar energy while contesting the upcoming assembly elections. Satish Singh of Sarvoday Vikas Samiti said that the manifesto strongly demands an increase in subsidy on solar panels. Presently, the cost of solar equipment prevents common people from utilizing solar energy as their main source of energy. If the government increases the subsidy up to at least 50%, the government may get rid of electricity requirements of the people as well as the employment and climate crisis will stand resolved in the long run.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/peoples-manifesto-seeks-boost-in-solar-city-plan/articleshow/84690240.cms||---

In 2016, PM Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of the plant which will be inaugurated in October. The fertilizer campus will also have a Sainik School to shape the future of younger generation and a skill development centre.” The CM said that the first Sainik School in the state was established in 1960 by then CM, Dr Sampurnanad and in 2017 the BJP-led government named the school after Paramvir Chakra award holder martyr Captain Manoj Pandey who took training from the same institute.

We have already deposited three instalments in the accounts of the children orphaned due to Covid,” he said. Yogi added that there is no alternative to the development and for the same reason the cycle of development continued even during the pandemic period. He blamed the previous governments for corruption in jobs recruitments and development projects. “Earlier jobs used to come with corruption and the money for developments was made alleged distribution of development project money without bringing any development but today jobs are given on the basis of capabilities.” On the infrastructure development, the CM said that industrial cluster will be develope along the Purvanchal Expressway, Bundelkhand Expressway, Ganga Expressway, Gorakhpur Link Expressway, Balia Expressway people get jobs in their native lands and the issue of migration is resolved. “During 4 years, around 4.5 lakh youth got government jobs including 1.2 lakh jobs in basic education department and more than 1 lakh jobs in police department,” said the CM. He added that earlier there was only one medical college in Gorakhpur-the BRD Medical College but there are medical colleges in Deoria, Kushinagar, Basti, Siddharthnagar. “We’ll make medical colleges in the rest of districts also in PPP mode and within five years of the state government we’ll have medical colleges in all 75 districts of the state,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/cm-laid-foundation-stone-of-16-projects-of-rs-187-51-crore-in-gorakhpur/articleshow/84690433.cms||---

This was the second such marriage ceremony reported from the district within a fortnight’s time. On July 12, a 60-year-old man and a 55-year-old woman, who have been living together for the past 20 years, tied the nuptial knot in Rasulpur Ruri of Ganj Moradabad of the district. The couple’s two minor daughters also attended the marriage function, which took place on July 21 night. The couple said that, peeved over the boycott by relatives, besides taunts from villagers, they decided to marry. Suman, daughter of Ram Autar Kashyap, resident of Kadilpur village of Thana Asiwan, was married on May 8, 2004. However, due to the constant harassment by her in-laws, her relationship with her first husband had turned sour and with the intervention of court, they decided to live separately. Thereafter, Suman returned to her ancestral house and started living with her parents. Ten years ago, Suman, however, came in contact with one Sunil of Gorimau village in Fatehpur Chaurasi and started living with him. Two daughters were born to them. Two months ago, following a ‘boycott’ by the relatives when they were not allowed to attend their niece’s marriage ceremony, besides being fed up with the constant taunts of people, Sunil married Suman on 21 July as per the customs in the village itself.

When she offered resistance, the goon threw the girl off the terrace and fled. She has suffered grievous injuries. The horrific incident took place in Bighapur Kotwali area of Unnao on Thursday evening. On the complaint of the victim’s brother, police swung into action, and after registering a case, arrested the accused. The girl is undergoing treatment at a private hospital in the city, where her condition is stated to be critical. The girl’s brother alleged that the incident took place on Thursday evening while his sister, who was alone and doing some household work on the terrace, a local goon Rajesh Singh, son of Suraj, who lives in the neighbourhood, barged into his house and tried to rape her. “When she raised the alarm, the goon threw her off the terrace. She suffered serious injuries on her head and got her four-five teeth broken. In the meantime, Suraj fled the spot. On hearing her screams, neighbours rushed to the spot and informed the girl’s family members. They arrived and took her to the hospital and informed the police,” police said. Police have registered an FIR under relevant sections of IPC on the complaint of her brother. Later, the police admitted the seriously injured girl to the district hospital, from where her family members shifted her to a private hospital in the city. Additional superintendent of police Shashi Shekhar Singh said that on the basis of the brother’s complaint, a case has been registered for molestation, attempt to rape and under the SC/ST Act. “The accused has also been arrested,” he added.

---||India||HC: Meat ban matter of fundamental rights, not of majority vs minority||NAINITAL: In a country where 70% of the population eats non-vegetarian food, the matter of banning meat is one that concerns the fundamental rights of citizens and isn’t a majority versus minority issue, the Uttarakhand high court said on Friday while hearing two petitions against a ban on slaughterhouses in Haridwar. The bench of Chief Justice R S Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma said, “The issue is not minority versus majority. The issue is very simple. What are the fundamental rights of the citizens of India?” The court has now asked the petitioners to amend their pleas in a week as none of them pleaded that such a ban violates the right to privacy of a citizen. The court remarked that the petitions have not been drafted with “whole-heartedness” that is required in challenging “seminal constitutional issues”. The pleas filed by some residents of Haridwar had alleged that a ban on slaughterhouses in Haridwar discriminated against minorities as many areas in the district had a substantial Muslim population. On Friday, the bench cited surveys on food habits of Indians from 2018 and 2019. “It’s very glaring data that in Uttarakhand 72.6% of the population is non-vegetarian. In totality, 70% of Indian population is non-vegetarian which busts the myth that the majority of the population is vegetarian,” the court said. In its previous hearing, the bench had said that a ban like the one in Haridwar calls into question the extent to which the state can determine a citizen’s choices. “The issue is whether a citizen has the right to decide his own diet or will that be decided by the state,” it had said. The court had also said that a civilisation is judged only by how it treats its minorities. “Democracy does not only mean rule by majority but, most importantly, democracy means the protection of the minority,” it had said. In March, Uttarakhand had declared all areas in Haridwar “slaughterhouse-free” and cancelled no objection certificates issued to slaughterhouses. The two petitions in the high court challenged this on two grounds — a blanket ban on meat of any type is unconstitutional, as was the section the Uttarakhand government had inserted into the UP Municipalities Act, 237A, to give itself power to declare an area under a municipal corporation, council or nagar panchayat a “slaughter-free” zone. The court has also asked the petitioners to amend the plea to challenge the constitutional validity of the amendment made to the UP Municipal Corporation Act. Like the municipalities Act, an amendment was made to the municipal corporation Act that gave the state government power to put a blanket ban on animal slaughter in any municipal corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-meat-ban-matter-of-fundamental-rights-not-of-majority-vs-minority/articleshow/84695675.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Delhi||The leak within: This underpass in Delhi doesn’t need rain to be flooded||NEW DELHI: While underpasses in the city naturally get inundated during heavy rains, the Mundka railway underpass is unique in remaining waterlogged at all times, thanks to its design flaws and shoddy construction. The result is vehicles have to pass through a curtain of falling water every time they have to use the underpass. The 652-metre Mundka-Rani Khera underpass was jointly built at a cost of Rs 51 crore by North Delhi Municipal Corporation and Northern Railway. But because the area around the structure has groundwater levels as high as 0.8m, it suffers from excess wetness, a problem the underpass has faced since its opening in 2013. Local residents allege that the project was too hastily inaugurated and the oozing moisture causes rusting, posing a threat to passing vehicles. Yet, even after nine years, no solution has been found and people now fear for the structural integrity of the facility. Pratap Singh Bhardwaj, resident of Rani Khera village, said that water earlier seeped through the walls of the underpass but had now started oozing from the roof. “Engineering teams have made several inspections in the last few years but no solution has been found,” he reported. The locals attribute the problem to not only the high groundwater levels, but also the poor drainage that causes stagnating. Mahaveer Dabas, a villager, said that the site should not have been approved for a railway bridge once it became clear that the groundwater level there was very high. Another villager and local activist, Mohit Prajapati, said, “The oozing wetness has increased over the years and now there is almost a waterfall from the roof of the underpass. The RCC structure is weakening and more than 30 accidents have occurred in recent years," claimed Prajapati. Prajapati said that a sumpwell of the underpass was constructed five years after the inauguration and water-proofing was also undertaken in 2016, but these haven’t helped. “Over 400 buses and thousands of vehicles use the underpass every day. Who will be responsible if some massive accident occurs?" he asked. Jayender Dabas, former leader of the House in the north corporation and councillor from the area, claimed to have been struggling for years to get the situation rectified. “Municipal commissioners have visited the site three times. Around 10 days ago, a joint meeting of railways and municipal officials was also held,” he said. Dabas said the design flaw lay in connecting the concrete boxes. “The connections between the boxes have not been done properly, resulting in continuous seepage of water from the walls and roof,” said Dabas. “It is as if the Ganga, Jamuna and Saraswati are all flowing together. The situation will not improve unless the space around the walls is dug up and another wall or insulating-waterproofing mechanism is installed.” The councillor added that he had written to the Union railways ministry about the structural problem and how it could lead to a big accident. “Only the railways can carry out the repair work. We can't touch it without their permission,” said Dabas. “And it is a cost-intensive exercise that the financially strapped municipal corporation cannot take on.” A Northern Railway official said the construction of the underbridge was the railway’s responsibility, while maintenance and drainage fell under the corporation’s jurisdiction. “There are problems with seepage and maintenance, which the north corporation has been trying to deal with for some time. For some reason, the solutions have not worked yet. We have not been contacted for overall maintenance work,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/the-leak-within-this-underpass-doesnt-need-rain-to-be-flooded/articleshow/84690183.cms||Paras Singh

---||Nashik||Train services resume in Mumbai-Bhusawal section||NASHIK: Train services in the Mumbai-Bhusawal section of the Central Railway resumed from early Friday morning as restoration work of the rail tracks at the ghat section in Igatpuri and Kasara was completed. Yuvaraj Patil, the senior divisional commissioner of the Bhusawal division, said the train services have resumed after two days of cancellation and short termination due to flooding in Mumbai. “The train services have resumed today and all diversions of the trains now remain cancelled. The trains will pick up their schedules gradually,” said Patil. The train services were badly affected due to the flooding on the railway tracks in Mumbai and due to the washout in the sections of tracks and the landslides at several areas in the Igatpuri – Kasara section of Mumbai division. So, the trains were cancelled from the point of origin towards and from Mumbai and those in the transit were terminated at Bhusawal, Manmad, Nashik and Igatpuri. “The services began during the midnight, but the trains started from Mumbai in the early hours of the day. They crossed Nashik at around 8 am. The services were rescheduled and hence their movement was delayed. However, they will gradually pick up their schedules by late evening,” said Rakesh Kuthar, station manager of Nashik Road railway station. Notably, these are special trains and only those with confirmed tickets are allowed to board the train. Hence, there is no rush at the stations. The regular rail commuters of Nashik heaved a sigh of relief on the resumption of the train services and appreciated the work done by the Railways. Naresh Poddar, travelling to Rourkela in Odisha, was happy to see his train Geetanjali Express coming just behind schedule. “I initially thought it would be cancelled but to my surprise, in the morning I learnt the train is running. The work done by the Railways during the heavy rain is commendable,” Poddar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/train-services-resume-in-mumbai-bhusawal-section/articleshow/84687738.cms||Abhilash Botekar

However, this time, it had been continuously raining for the past three days to add to which water from the Anjunem dam was released on Friday which badly affected our island,” Sao Mathias sarpanch Mohan Volvoikar said. Sources said that there are two breaches on the bunds in Malar, Divar, that also contributed to the inundation. “The water was almost overflowing into the mainland. This would not have been the case had the repair works been taken up responsibly,” a Divar-resident said. Even the ferry services were disrupted for a few hours following the rise in water level. Some of the Chorao residents who had left for work before 9am managed to leave safely while the rest were stuck on the island after the swollen river’s water rose the ferry ramp. “The roads in Chorao were so flooded that the access to the Chorao ferry pick up was blocked for a while,” said Chorao-resident, Joe Rodrigues. Captain of ports had deployed its services to help the disaster management force at all the rivers across Goa. Captain James Braganza said that the ferry services had to be temporarily shut off for safety reasons, especially during the high tide. “All the rivers were swollen. Neither the vehicles or commuters would be able to embark or disembark the vessel in such a situation.” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/divar-chorao-hit-by-rising-water-levels/articleshow/84694658.cms||---

---||Nashik||Residents around Ramkund rue stink in water after rains||NASHIK: Residents from low-lying areas near Ramkund complained of foul smell from water accumulated after huge downpour on Wednesday night. The residents said pungent odour from rain water was unbearable and blamed the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) for the same. They alleged at many places the stormwater drains and sewer drains are not separated due to which the rain water had started smelling. The residents also took up the issue with local NMC officials who visited the lowlying areas on Thursday. “The storm water lines laid by the civic body around 15 years ago are faulty as drainage lines have been connected to the storm water lines. Moreover, the width of nullahs is small,” Devang Jani, one of the residents, said. “Also,there are some nullahs that connects directly to river Godavari. Sewage is released into these nullahs that eventually reach Godavari,” he added. An NMC official said that the work to segregate the storm water drains and sewer lines are on and would be completed soon. “Some houses have connected their drainage lines to storm water lines. We have started closing the drainage lines and are connecting them to storm water lines,” S Vanjari, executive engineer (environment & Godavari conservation), said. “Moreover, we are also planning to divert the sewage being released to Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) directly through pipelines so that sewage does not get mixed with river water,” said Vanjari. “The Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (NMSCDCL) has undertaken development of 39-km roads in old city area. The road development project also includes separate sewer and storm water lines,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/residents-around-ramkund-rue-stink-in-water-after-rains/articleshow/84687762.cms||Tushar Pawar

"The charge-sheet has been framed after the police, during the investigation, collected strong evidence”, said a senior police official. To recall, NSA (National Security Act) has already been slapped on the leader of the gang. All the three accused are in jail. Fake Remdesivir injections were being sold at premium prices, when the corona epidemic was at its peak in Kanpur.

Districts with negligible positivity rate of 0.1% to 0.2% and low number of deaths may get some relaxations after considering the overall situation. The public health department will prepare a detailed report in this regard and submit it to the state task force and the chief minister for taking the final decision,” Tope told TOI. He said the districts having weekly positivity rate (WPR) around 5% would have to continue to follow the norms. The exceptions would be made only for the districts registering very low positivity rate, he clarified. Tope said the state was assessing several proposals sent from various sectors for allowing fully vaccinated people to operate in bio bubbles. The chief minister would take the final decision soon on it, he said. The minister did not rule out the possibility of reviewing the current Level 3 state trigger for districts reporting hardly one or two cases. “We shall be examining the level 3 restrictions and consider if we can give relaxations to such districts,” he said, iterating t the state did not report any deaths because of oxygen shortage. Tope said the per day vaccination capacity of the state was 10 lakh, but only 2-3 lakh beneficiaries were getting the shots each day because of intermittent supply. He said specific guidelines were expected from the ICMR regarding reopening of schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tope-hints-at-relaxations-in-districts-with-very-low-wpr/articleshow/84692521.cms||Nisha Nambiar

A tree was, meanwhile, uprooted on Trichy Road, blocking traffic for almost half an hour.While weather experts had forecast only light to moderate rainfall due to a trough that had formed along Maharashtra to Karnataka coast, heavy rain lashed the Western Ghats after the trough converged with a weather system that had formed over the Bay of Bengal. Hence, catchment areas of the dams located at the foothills of Western Ghats and hill stations, including Valparai, received 91mm rainfall.The water level in the Pillur Dam subsequently rose to 98ft around 2.30am on Friday from 95ft, forcing officials to open all the four sluice gates to release the water. An engineer with the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board said, “We had alerted Mettupalayam tahsildar office and obtained permission from the collectorate to release water from the dam. The water level has come down to 97ft and we are maintaining it at the same level.

Renovation works will be done in adherence to agama rules. All elements of temples, including geographical spread, shops, temple car sheds and holy tanks would be taken into account in the master plan,” Babu told reporters after inspecting renovation work of two temples in Salem. “The temples would be renovated in a way that they become cleaner than ever and beautiful with holy groves.”The department has identified 539 temples with annual revenue of more than 10 lakh. “We have classified these into three – temples where there is a delay in performing kumbabishekam, those which have been taken up for kumbabishekam and those that are nearing the 12-year deadline for kumbabishekam,” Babu said. “The department is also working on plans to prevent theft of temple idols. We have retrieved several idols. We have identified a few stolen idols abroad. The chief minister will make an announcement on retrieving the stolen idols and expediting the cases.”Wherever possible, wedding halls would be constructed on temple premises, the minister said. On steps to augment temple revenue, he said that the department is systematically retrieving encroached temple lands. Efforts would be taken to rent or lease the lands. “This would be done in a transparent manner, in adherence to law. An announcement in this regard would be made soon,”’ he said.Yet another measure to augment revenue would be to tap the gold reserves. Babu said that gold ornaments given as offerings to temples have not been melt in nine years. “If required, the gold can be made into bars and converted into fixed deposits, which will yield 2.5 % interest. Given the gold reserves, we will be able to get up to Rs 20 crore annual interest”On the persistent demand by BJP to handover administration of temples to trusts, Babu said it is not a practical demand. “Temples are not private property that can be handed over to private entities. The demand is only to create confusion,” he said.As far as HR&CE department is considered, efforts are being taken to prevent violations or faulty administration, the minister added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/hrce-preparing-master-plans-to-renovate-temples-says-minister/articleshow/84690136.cms||---

Nearly a thousand houses were damaged, many collapsed, at least two minor bridges were washed away and roads submerged, largely in Sattari, Bicholim and Ponda talukas, besides parts of Bardez, Pernem and Dharbandora. So far, one woman is feared dead. Landslides also disrupted railway traffic and interstate road connectivity at the Anmod and Chorla Ghats. “This is the worst flood since 1982. I myself have witnessed it,” said chief minister Pramod Sawant after inspecting the affected areas. “One suspected death of a woman has been reported in Dharbandora,” he said. “The state has suffered losses to the tune of crores.” The floods have left nearly 832 hectares of agricultural area severely damaged, and the preliminary losses are pegged at Rs 2.55 crore. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Sawant to inquire about the safety and well-being of the people in Goa’s flood affected areas. “The PM has assured full support and assistance to the state,” Sawant said. An engine and a coach of a Mangaluru to Mumbai train that was diverted along the SWR route derailed between Dudhsagar and Sonaulim stations, but there were no casualties reported. Personnel were roped in from the Navy, directorate of fire and emergency services, captain of ports and teams of the state disaster management authority for the rescue operations, where close to 200 persons trapped in their houses were evacuated. As per the authorities, the water level in rivers started rising post-midnight, and rescue operations began in the early hours of Friday in parts of Sattari. The rise in the water level in the Anjunem and the Tillari dams forced authorities to release the excess water, which further added to the problem. Sawant said that a Navy helicopter was roped in for the rescue operations. “A lot of mud houses have been damaged due to the flood,” he said. Sawant said that all primary schools across the state have been converted into shelter homes for flood-affected persons. Many parts of the state are expected to have restricted water supply after pumping at various water treatment plants has been affected. In Pernem taluka, 88 houses have been damaged, and after the River Chapora began overflowing, eight people were evacuated. Bardez too was severely affected, with 167 houses suffering minor damages and nine people being evacuated. “In Bicholim taluka, the River Valvanti was overflowing, which damaged 164 houses and more than 40 people were evacuated using rescue boats. In Sattari too, the Mhadei and the Valvanti were seen overflowing. Here, 130 houses have faced major damage. A bridge at Paikul has been washed away and 65 people have been evacuated from that village,” Sawant said. In Ponda, too, people were stuck in Usgao and Vaghurme village, and rescue operations were on till late evening. “In Salcete, because of the Kushawati river, some parts were flooded, but there was no damage to property. In Sanguem, 18 houses were damaged and 84 people have been evacuated,” Sawant said. In Dharbandora, the Dudhsagar and the Ragada breaching its banks resulted in 135 houses being damaged, and 150 people have been rescued. In Canacona taluka, 60 people have been evacuated. The chief minister has appealed to the people in the state not to venture into the water without knowledge of its depth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/worst-flood-in-40-yrs-destroys-rural-goa-woman-feared-dead/articleshow/84692593.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Hyderabad||More floodgates of twin reservoirs opened||Hyderabad: As heavy inflows into the twin reservoirs continued, water board officials were compelled to open more floodgates on Friday to discharge the surplus water. While the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) had already opened five floodgates at Himayatsagar, officials lifted two more on Friday afternoon to release 2,400 cusecs of water. Between July 20 and now, seven of the 17 floodgates of this reservoir have been opened. The inflows here stand at 1,400 cusecs. In the case of Osmansagar, the inflows have remained constant. Officials say they are continuing with discharging100 cusecs of water through its two floodgates for now. However, this for the first time after a decade that they have had to open the gates of Osmansagar. The gates were last lifted in 2010, a water board official said. Even last year, while authorities had to open as many as 13 floodgates of Himayatsagar they didn’t need to do so for Osmansagar. Authorities said that they are keeping a close watch on the inflows to decide their further course of action. Currently, the water board is drawing 13.8 million gallons of water — 9.8 from Osmansagar and 4 from Himayatsagar — in a day to distribute in certain areas of Old City, like Goshamahal, Bahadurpura, Azampura, Mogulpura, and some parts of Greater Hyderabad. While HMWS&SB had already opened five floodgates at Himayatsagar, officials lifted two more floodgates on Friday afternoon to release 2,400 cusecs of water||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/more-floodgates-of-twin-reservoirs-opened/articleshow/84692609.cms||Sunil Mungara

They have to navigate through JP Nagar and rejoin Mettupalayam Road again. “However, the roads marked by the traffic police through J P Nagar are very narrow. Even if one heavy vehicle comes through, other vehicles get stuck,” said V Ramesh, a shop owner. “Police have not even bothered to make the diversion one-way. Vehicles of local residents parked along the roads make matters worse,” said R Sivakumar of Thudiyalur.The other option given to commuters is Thadagam Road, from where they can take the Appanaickenpalayam route and reach Thudiyalur. The road, which has several speed breakers, has no street lights.“Authorities have allowed large vehicles like lorries to use the road and last Saturday, when two lorries came face to face with each other, they got stuck for a while. Since it was 9.30am, cars piled up on the route,” said R Rajasekharan, a domestic driver.The main Thadagam Road has also become a nightmare for residents, shopkeepers and daily commuters. The road, forced to bear the traffic of Mettupalayam Road, is narrow and has several protruding manholes. “As a result, with rising petrol costs, it costs us Rs 30-Rs 60 per journey from the city till Thudiyalur. It adds five to 10km to the drive and vehicles move at snail’s pace,” said R Anbazhagan, an autorickshaw driver.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/with-mettupalayam-road-blocked-traffic-chaos-reigns/articleshow/84690229.cms||---

Half asleep, she opened the door and in a fleeting second a man wearing a raincoat, gloves and face mask snatched her two gold chains weighing 11 sovereigns and fled.The city police have formed two special teams to nab the chain snatcher, whose identity is yet to be ascertained.An officer said Johara, her 71-year-old husband Bakruddin and son Ferozkhan were asleep when they heard the knock on the door. “The couple gave a brief chase, but in vain. We have collected CCTV footage from the opposite house. Visuals showed that the chain snatcher had sat outside the house for five minutes, before knocking on the main door. While there was a main gate earlier, Johara had removed the same to facilitate the underground drainage and road laying work in the area,” the officer said.Saleem, one of her four sons, said his mother was in deep grief over the death of her daughter, who succumbed to Covid-19, for the past two months. “My mother thought it was one of her sons who was knocking on the door. So, she opened it. Most of the people in the area are working in the fish market and they go to the market around 2.30am-3am. The fish market was not functioning on Friday. So, the chain snatcher knew all the details,” he said.Saleem alerted the Podanur police, who registered a case under Section 392 (robbery) of the Indian Penal Code and launched a probe. “We have formed two special teams to nab the chain snatcher. Our teams are working on various angles,” said E S Uma, city deputy commissioner of police (crime).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/man-snatches-2-gold-chains-from-woman-at-her-house/articleshow/84690225.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: Soon, rebuild old house into new one with just panchayat nod||PANAJI: The state cabinet on Friday approved an amendment that would enable persons living in panchayat areas to construct new houses by demolishing their old house with the permission of just the panchayat and no other authority. The state has also decided to collect house tax from illegal houses constructed in the state, and for this purpose only, the government will allot house numbers. “It will not be a regularised structure,” chief minister Pramod Sawant said. The amendment to the Goa Panchayat Raj Act also seeks to introduce a provision wherein a person can replace a tile roof with slab. This will be allowed for single-dwelling units that existed prior to the enactment of the 1994 Act, subject to production of certificate of stability by a registered structural engineer. Panchayats minister Mauvin Godinho said that most houses in Goa have tiled roofs. He also said that when people want to reconstruct their dwellings into larger one, they face harassment. Godinho said people had to approach different departments for permission, and because of this harassment, people used to construct illegally. “As we don’t want more illegal houses in the state, we have introduced an amendment to the Panchayat Act, so that people can construct their new house with one plus one or one plus two by demolishing the old house, with automatic permission from panchayats,” Godinho said, adding that this is a demand from the people. Sawant said that the permission will be given as per the rules that exist in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/soon-rebuild-old-house-into-new-one-with-just-panchayat-nod/articleshow/84692611.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Monsoon raga: Tanks, lakes filled to brim in Telangana||HYDERABAD: Thanks to the heavy rains in the last few days, as many as 13,000 tanks and lakes in Telangana are either overflowing or the water level has reached near 100 per cent of their capacity. “Generally, tanks and lakes get full water in August and September. But, 30 per cent of the lakes have already been filled to the brim. These inflows will ensure drinking water to thousands of villages in the catchment areas apart from meeting the water requirements for kharif and next rabi seasons also,” a chief engineer of irrigation department said. Minor irrigation wing officials said this was possible following huge inflows into the tanks and lakes due to rains and discharges from major and medium irrigation projects. Of the total 43,863 tanks and lakes, water level in 30 per cent of them is to the brim. Officials said the rest of the tanks and lakes are also likely to get filled if the heavy downpour continues in the state. “Of the total irrigation tanks, 4,698 tanks are overflowing and another 7,574 tanks are filled between 75% and 100% of their capacity. About 8,400 tanks have been flowing up to 75% of their full tank level. Among the districts, 677 tanks in Kothagudem and 453 tanks in Adilabad are overflowing,” an irrigation official said. Officials said a majority of the tanks were filled mainly due to heavy rains in Nizamabad, Kamareddy, Warangal, Kothagudem, Nagarkurnool and Nalgonda districts. In Mahbubnagar, Mulugu, Gajwel and Mancherial districts, the tanks reached their full capacity due to water releases from major and minor irrigation and lift irrigation projects and also rains. In Mulugu district, 202 tanks received huge inflows from Sriramsagar stage I project and Juvvadi Chokkarao Project. Similarly, many lakes received copious inflows after the lifts were opened and water released to the catchment areas and downstream. The government also lifted crestgates of major projects such as Sriramsagar and Lower Manair Dam.“Mission Kakatiya has helped in strengthening of the bunds, increase in water retention and storage capacity. Desilting and repairs to inlets and outlets also helped,” a superintending engineer of irrigation department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/monsoon-raga-tanks-lakes-filled-to-brim-in-t/articleshow/84692637.cms||Koride Mahesh

Traffic was affected for nearly eight hours as efforts were underway to clear the rubble amidst heavy rainfall. PWD officials said that the highway stretches were opened up for use again by late Friday evening. Also, due to flooding at the Khandepar junction, the Ponda-Karnataka national highway had to be temporarily closed for all types of vehicular traffic since Friday morning. Rainwater inundated the highway stretch at the Opa road junction at Khandepar forcing all traffic to halt at Khandepar on the Ponda side and at Tiska on the Usgao side. Several interstate vehicles were stuck at the Khandepar and attempts to divert them through other routes proved futile as almost all low lying areas were inundated. Many vehicles were seen queued up on the highway as they waited for the road to open up. Water levels were seen rising by early morning and the roads were submerged by afternoon, said a local. He said several motorists tried to pass through the inundated road stretch, but the rising water level forced them to retreat. This is for the first time that locals have witnessed the water rising so high, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/landslides-cut-off-ghat-roads-for-8-hours/articleshow/84694834.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

That comes as a relief. But we have skeletal revenue staff and the inflows are continuing to rise. There is also a forecast for more rains. So, we are slightly anxious,” said a mandal tahsildar. He, however, maintained that the administration is prepared to tackle any flood-like situation — if it was to arise. In fact, the Hyderabad district administration, officials said, has geared up with all precautionary measures to tackle complaints of inundation, particularly from areas along the River Musi where the water board has been alerting residents about opening of the floodgates, over the past five days. It has also restricted the entry of visitors within the premises of the reservoirs. On Friday, revenue wing officials, meanwhile, inspected the bund areas along River Musi — located around 30 km within the city — and set up a monitoring system to keep an eye on the discharge from the twin reservoirs. “At bridges in Chaderghat, Bapu Ghat and other areas we found that water was flowing at a normal level. There is no reason for locals here to panic. We also alerted people living in low-lying areas about opening of floodgates three days in advance,” said a revenue official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/with-limited-staff-at-their-disposal-officials-on-tenterhooks-as-more-rains-on-the-cards/articleshow/84692652.cms||---

A student’s hall ticket number is required for sending internal marks to the state education board for declaring results. Rao Education Trust’s junior college will pay Rs 27,000 to the board so that Atharva Thite’s name is included in the list of candidates who took the exam and a hall-ticket issued to him by Saturday. The trust’s petition said the college staff inadvertently did not send Atharva’s name along with other students to the board. Sincere efforts were made to rectify the error with the board and the management offered to pay full penalty but as per rules the board could not do it at that stage. Before a bench led by justice Ramesh Dhanuka on Thursday, the Trust’s advocate C R Sadasivan sought parity with a July 13 order in a similar case where P D Lions College, Malad, agreed to pay late fee of Rs 25,000 each in respect of two students. As urged by the HSC board’s advocate Kiran Gandhi, the judges clarified that the college shall not recover Rs 27,000 from Atharva.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-relief-for-hsc-student-who-failed-to-get-hall-ticket-in-mumbai/articleshow/84694711.cms||Rosy Sequeira

As they sought 14,000sqft of land in Kajahmalai campus of BDU, an agenda was tabled in the 244th syndicate meeting on Friday for the same. It was opposed by a section of syndicate members, who expressed reservation over giving land to a private organisation.Higher education secretary, D Karthikeyan, asked the university administration to form a committee to take a decision regarding the same. President of the society, S Ponnusamy, had written to chief minister M K Stalin a few months back and sent a representation to the BDU administration. The lecture hall will accommodate 120 students. They also planned to raise a library, which can be utilised by college and university students. At present, the books are housed in National College Trichy and University of Mysore campus. The society also plans to conduct periodical lectures for students from other institutions and continue the outreach programmes for PG students and research scholars to train them for NET and SET exams.The issue of BDU administration giving salary to the guest faculty members in the constituent colleges, which were converted to government colleges, was also raised during the meeting as staff members within the university were opposing it citing poor financial condition of the university.

Senior police inspector of the EOW Shrinivas Panhale wrote to Chahal earlier this month following a complaint by BJP corporator Vinod Mishra. “On scrutiny of the complaint, it is noticed that the matter...pertains to the jurisdiction of your office/department, and as per directions of the joint commissioner of police (EOW), the same is forwarded for necessary action,” stated the letter. When contacted by TOI, Chahal asked to check with additional municipal commissioner (eastern suburbs) Ashwini Bhide. When TOI called Bhide, she said she hadn’t seen the letter yet and would look into it next week. Mishra said: “Now that the EOW has asked the BMC to take action, a high-level departmental inquiry must be initiated against those fire officials who helped builders by not levying the fees. If this is not done, we will move the Bombay high court and the Lokayukta.” In May, Chahal had sanctioned the recovery of fire service fees, which is calculated at Rs 10-15 per sq m for all buildings. The annual charge is 1% per year of the total fire service fee amount. On June 7, the fire brigade issued a circular to recover around Rs 1,400 crore as one-time fire service fees from builders and annual fees from housing societies retrospectively since 2014. But the proposal for recovery of fees was stayed by the civic standing committee following protests by corporators. Mishra said: “Joint municipal commissioner Ramesh Pawar has himself, in an internal note, said that there must be an inquiry and responsibility should be fixed for the revenue loss to the BMC. So far, no enquiry has been started and no action has been taken, so we have approached the EOW.” In October 2020, Pawar had raised a red flag over non-collection of fire service fees and annual fees since 2014 and recommended an inquiry against fire brigade officials for causing a loss of “crores” in revenue to the BMC. His recommendation was ignored though.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/take-action-against-non-recovery-of-fire-service-fees-in-mumbai-eow-to-bmc/articleshow/84694821.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Accused Kashyap Bhesaniya (19) looted the car from just outside the building on Wednesday. The girl’s family had already lodged a missing person’s report in Varachha police station. Bhesaniya was produced in court on Friday by police and the court sent him into judicial custody. Bhesaniya, a student of first-year diploma IT engineering, invested money in stocks and was earning enough to live a comfortable life. His father is a diamond artisan and the family has financial limitations. However, his 19-year-old girlfriend’s father is a diamond unit owner and the family has four cars and lives a lavish life in a bungalow. Considering the differences in their financial positions, police suspect that the girl’s family did not accept their relationship because of which the duo eloped. “Both families knew about the friendship but were not agreeing for marriage, possibly for the economic disparity,” said a police officer in Umra police station. During interrogation, Bhesaniya told the police that he looted the car with a plan to go to Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh and stay away from their families’ reach. “They told the police that they planned to settle there as the lifestyle in UP seemed affordable,” said cops. Bhesaniya had an airgun with which he threatened the senior citizen inside the car forcing him to get down during the loot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/economic-disparity-leads-to-elopement-carjacking/articleshow/84690340.cms||---

Taking a serious view in the case, the court on Thursday stayed the proceedings which was issued for transfer of licence and directed the authorities to lock and seal the shops.The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by V P Ammavasai, an elected representative of the Usilampatti panchayat union challenging the resolution passed by Ranjani Sudanthiram.A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that the petitioner, who is an elected representative has filed this petition bringing to light certain startling facts. The judges observed that it is not clear on what basis such name transfer is done especially when the local bodies in various litigations have taken a consistent stand that licence or lease is not transferable to third parties. Since the counsel appearing for the chairperson questioned the locus standi of the petitioner, the judges observed that this court is very well empowered to examine the correctness proceedings initiated by the chairperson as well as to strike down the same if illegalities are found.The judges observed that this court is prima facie satisfied that the name transfer of the shops was illegal and without proper jurisdiction. In order to ensure the transparency is maintained and the assets of the panchayat union are preserved, the judges stayed all further proceedings until further orders.The judges directed the assistant director of rural development and panchayat raj department to lock and seal the shops and file a report before the court during the next hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-stays-shops-transfer-done-through-abuse-of-power/articleshow/84671465.cms||---
---||Allahabad||500 families selling kanwar and other puja items on Ganga ghats fear huge financial loss||Prayagraj: As the state government cancelled the kanwar yatra in view of the Covid pandemic, around 500 families in Sangam city selling kanwar, saffron attires, vermilion, garlands, puja utensils, and other puja items are left with no other option but to dispose of their stocks which they had stored 15 days prior to the beginning of Shravan month. The families alleged that the Varanasi-based traders from whom they had purchased the puja stock were not ready to take the items back, and now they fear bearing a huge loss. Shiv Babu Chaurasia, whose family has been selling kanwar and other puja items since the past four decades in Daraganj, told TOI, “We will have to face a massive financial loss this year since the state government has banned the kanwar yatra.” He added, “I have purchased kanwar, its decorative items and other puja articles worth Rs 3 lakh from a Varanasi-based trader, but the trader has now refused to take the material back.” He further said that there are around 500 families in the district who have been in the business of selling kanwar yatra-related items since four-five decades, and all of them are facing economic losses for the past two years due to the pandemic. “We used to earn Rs 40,000 to Rs 50,000 profit during every Shrawan month by selling kanwar, utensils of different shapes and sizes to carry the holy water, garlands, bells and special kanwar dresses. But this year and last year have been very difficult for us,” said Chaurasia. With the month of Shrawn beginning from July 25, there will be no kanwariyas on the ghats and a section of devotees will be seen only at local temples offering prayers. The devotees praying in temples do not purchase kanwar yatra-related items. Rajesh, another kanwar material seller, said “The state government should also understand our grievances and problems, and offer us economic assistance. We are registered sellers with the government and pay taxes for setting up our shops every year. Cancellation of kanwar yatra has dented our business to a major extent.” Several families selling kanwar items said that the ban on kanwar yatra has undoubtedly posed a major challenge to them, as they would have to dispose of all the puja materials. “Around 50,000 to 1 lakh kanwariyas used to arrive at Daraganj and other ghats to get the holy water every year,” said Anuradha, a seller, adding, “They used to purchase kanwar and other decorative items to adorn their kanwar and start their journey towards Varanasi to offer jalabhishek to Lord Shiva during the Shrawan month.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/500-families-selling-kanwar-and-other-puja-items-on-ganga-ghats-fear-huge-financial-loss/articleshow/84692799.cms||---

The proposal is estimated at Rs 475 crore.The corridor would come up between Cauvery-Odathurai bridges and Mallachipuram near Kudamurutti bridge. IT will bypass Anna statue junction in Melachinthamani and Chathiram bus stand intersection near Kamarajar statue and have four lanes.“The proposal is sent to the headquarters to obtain administrative sanction for a detailed project report (DPR) preparation. The elevated corridor is very much feasible, and the existing traffic warrants it,” a senior official with the state highways department said. More than 80,000 vehicles approach the Mainguard gate localities per day as per a study conducted by the state highways in 2017. However, the proposal for a flyover did not materialise. The last time the city had a bridge proposal was in 2014 for Thiruvanaikoil RoB. With the Kollidam bridge at the border of the Trichy-Thanjavur districts having been completed, vehicular movement is expected to increase further since vehicles bound for the western districts from Kumbakonam and Mayiladuthurai will access the corridor. Officials also indicated that private land may have to be acquired for the project, and a sum of Rs 30 crore was proposed for the same near the Cauvery bridge end. “The support of Southern Railway is pivotal to establish arms and connect Konakkarai road and Karur bypass road,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/elevated-corridor-project-proposed-to-decongest-trichy/articleshow/84690555.cms||Deepak Karthik

By Friday morning, several had to be rescued by disaster management authorities with the help of motorboats. Bicholim town had witnessed its worst floods in 2007, when water rose almost six feet in houses. On Thursday, the situation was under control up to 9pm despite days of incessant rainfall. But officials were forced to release excess water from the Tillari and Anjunem reservoirs late at night due to a heavy downpour. This prompted the Chapora river at Sal, the Valvanti river at Sakhali and the Bicholim river to swell, leading to a critical situation in areas lining their banks. Almost 40 persons stranded in their homes at Supachi Pud-Harvalem, Pale, Kudnem and Piligao had to be evacuated by the authorities. At least 50 houses in 15 villages were damaged and 778 persons were affected by the floods, the authorities said. Farmers also faced losses running into lakhs of rupees. Large parts remained submerged till late Friday night in Amona, Kudnem, Harvalem, Latambarcem, Mayem, Menkurem, Sal, Narvem, Navelim, Van-Maulinguem, Pale, Karapur, Piligao, Gauthan, Virdi and Surla, among others. Chief minister Pramod Sawant visited the flood affected areas and said that the emergency control room has been put on alert, even as several local residents blamed the administration for failing to take proper preventive measures. The Shri Mallikarjun temple at Pali was completely submerged. Power supply, too, was disrupted at many places due to trees falling and mobile networks were also severely affected. Meanwhile, all four gates of the Anjunem dam were opened to discharge water at a faster pace. The dam’s level rose to 90.9ms, just 2.2ms short of its maximum level. Engineer Rama Naik said that locals have been alerted not to venture near the river.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hundreds-left-stranded-in-houses-at-bicholim/articleshow/84694878.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Red alert along Musi, locals have nowhere to go||HYDERABAD: With the lifting of floodgates of Osmansagar and Himayatsagar reservoirs on Thursday, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) and the police have issued a high alert to low-lying areas, especially to those households located on the Musi riverbank, urging them to relocate. But residents say that they cannot leave their houses unless the government arranges for temporary shelters and carry out rehabilitation operations. “A few officials have visited our houses last night and asked us shift to safer areas, but we don’t know where exactly to go. Some of them who have relatives in the city went to stay with them but what about the rest of us?” asked Razia Begum, a resident of Chaderghat. Owing to the continuing rains over the last few days, floodgates of the Osmansagar were lifted up to one-foot level at a discharge rate of 200 cusecs, after a gap of 11 years. The HMWSSB has alerted the district administration of Hyderabad and Rangareddy districts, along with GHMC and police to secure any hutments, encroachments along the course of Musi river to avoid any unforeseen incidents. Officials also informed that the water levels of both Himayatsagar and Osmansagar reservoir are steadily increasing. “We have to shift with our children in case the water levels continue to increase. There is no place we can go to except for a mosque nearby but that was also occupied by several people last night. We request the GHMC officials to arrange for some temporary shelters which has some basic amenities for women and children,” said Mohammed Yasser, a resident of Shanker Nagar. On Thursday, the chief minister directed elected representatives and the officials concerned departments to take all precautionary measures on a war-footing and ensure that people residing in low-lying areas do not suffer. He also instructed them to focus on areas that were vulnerable to floods and carry out rescue and rehabilitation operations wherever required. G Rajnikanth, GHMC deputy commission of Charminar zone said, “We have visited a few downstream areas last night and gave instructions to the residents about the rehabilitation measures. We have a GHMC community hall in Afzal Nagar and some people also slept in a mosque nearby last night. The food will also be arranged from Annapurna canteens if needed. In cas someone needs information about where they can stay, they can consult the concerned GHMC area engineers, town planning staff or the local corporators for details.” “While currently about 100 families in downstream areas are vulnerable to floods, if all the gates of the reservoirs are opened, there could be about 200 families that will need rehabilitation,” said Rajnikanth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/red-alert-along-musi-locals-have-nowhere-to-go/articleshow/84692830.cms||Moulika.KV

A group of archaeology enthusiasts, Yaadhum Oore Yaavarum Kelir, has found a stone, which they said would have inspired people to name the Kallaanai theatre at Vandiyur.The famous theatre, which is more than 50 years old, gives people an opportunity to enjoy the famous MGR and Sivaji Ganeshan flicks of yesteryears and even the digitized versions of the films. V Madhan, owner of an elephant, Sumathy, who had seen the stone had noticed the stone and informed the archaeologists about it. V Parthiban, one of the members of the group, said that the stone is situated about 100m away from the theatre, and is two-and-a-half feet in height, three feet in length and about half a foot in width.“Usually, sculptures of elephants and a single man are those referring to wild elephants, but this one has decorations and bells on its neck,” he said. Based on palaeography, the two bells denote that the sculpture dates back to the Vijayanagara era in Madurai, which preceded the Nayak era around the 15th century AD. Multiple bells on elephants are characteristic of Vijayanagara era and during the Nayak era it was usually single bells, said Madhan.The man, a mahout for whom this memorial stone has supposedly been erected, is seen using the bullhook known as angusam in Tamil. From the sculpture it can be deciphered that the man died trying to tame the elephant, which may have been ‘musth’. The sculpture shows the man was gored by the elephant.The sculpture is still worshipped by local people, as it is painted and turmeric, kumkum and oil are seen smeared all over it. What is disheartening is that the inscriptions on the stone, only two lines seen below the sculpture, have been buried beneath the road level. If the entire stone is revealed, the story behind this memorial pillar, which will definitely have a place in the archaeological history of Tamil Nadu, would be better understood, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-city-home-to-memorial-stone-for-a-mahout-dating-back-to-nayak-era/articleshow/84671498.cms||---

Kishorchandra was freed four days after political activist Erendro Leichombam was released by the Manipur government on a Supreme Court order. Kishorchandra and Erendro were arrested from Imphal West on May 13 for similar Facebook posts, and detained under NSA on May 17. The court ordered Kishorchandra’s release by 5 pm of Friday upon his furnishing a personal release bond of Rs 1,000 if his further incarceration was not required in connection with any other case. The order followed a ‘letter petition’ filed by Kishorchandra’s wife that said both the men were arrested and detained on the same grounds, and that since Erendro has been released, Kishorchandra should be freed too. “As they stand identically situated, the continued incarceration of the petitioner’s husband would be as much a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution, as it was in the case of Erendro,” the HC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/manipur-journo-held-under-nsa-for-cow-dung-post-freed-by-hc/articleshow/84695761.cms||---

The existing hall inside the main office can accommodate only 65 councillors, and the expansion proposal would help add space in the wake of the proposed formation of new wards. Nehru inspected the hall on the first floor and discussed with officials over the possibilities of constructing a new council hall in the backyard of the main office. “The existing hall appeared cramped even to accommodate 65 councillors, officials and the journalists when the council was functioning,” an official source said. The minister also expressed his dissatisfaction over the unplanned development and utilisation of the vacant space behind the main office. Corporation recently had constructed an indoor badminton court and construction work for an integrated command centre is also underway, almost completely exhausting the land parcels. “New council hall is imminent as the city expansion proposal is on the cards. Site for the hall was checked, further study has to be made as the availability of land is low,” another source said. It is said that demolishing the old building such as the regional vaccine store and constructing the hall is one option.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/new-council-hall-with-eyes-on-expansion-on-cards/articleshow/84690643.cms||Deepak Karthik

It has partnered with an initiative to boost corporate adoption of electric vehicles. “We already have over 110 companies globally that have pledged 100% electric vehicles for its fleet by 2030,” said Divya Sharma, India Executive Director of Climate Group. “This includes 11 India-headquartered companies including Bounce, BSES Rajdhani and Yamuna, Dalmia Cement, Flipkart, JSW Cement, Mindspace Business Parks REIT, SBI, Shuttl, Wipro and Zomato which have made the EV100 commitment with a combined fleet size of over 2 lakh e-vehicles in next ten years,” she stated. Environment minister Aaditya Thackeray said, “The EV100 partnership aims to build a robust demand for green vehicles and will support faster uptake of the new policy in Maharashtra. As the first Indian state to partner with EV100, we want to take the lead in driving corporate EV demand and encourage other states towards catalysing pan India EV revolution.” Thackeray added that investing in a clean transport system was an essential part of the state climate action plan. “With the revised policy, we want to engage early on with businesses,” he said. Sharma said, “We urge businesses in Maharashtra to utilise the incentives offered by the state and join EV100 to drive 100% fleet transition by 2030.” Maharashtra’s new EV Policy 2021 aims to have 10% battery-operated electric vehicles in new registrations by 2025. The new policy is armed with economic incentives to enhance purchase of e-bikes, electric autos, e-cars/SUVs and electric commercial vehicles such as buses, trucks etc. The state has set targets for electrifying government vehicles and 15% of Maharashtra’s state-run road transport corporation’s existing bus fleet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-set-to-make-electric-transport-the-new-normal-for-corporate-world/articleshow/84694943.cms||Somit Sen
---||Dehradun||14 private universities in Uttarakhand took more students than permitted? May lose affiliation if found guilty||DEHRADUN: Fourteen private universities — 12 in Haridwar and the remaining in Dehradun — affiliated to the Sri Dev Suman University (SDSU) allegedly flouted norms by giving admissions to a total of 700 more students than the permissible limit. The issue came to light after SDSU officials found irregularities in the exam documents. The varsity officials have claimed that the private educational institutions carried out the 'scam' in connivance with each other and were conducting the exams of these 'extra' students without keeping the state university in the loop. A majority of these students are in the first year of undergraduate courses like BA, BCom and BSc. The results of these 700 students have been held by SDSU for the time being. The SDSU administration has said that if the private universities under the lens are found guilty of any wrongdoing, their affiliations will likely be cancelled. Citing a 2016 order of the state government, PP Dhyani, vice-chancellor, SDSU, pointed out that no affiliated college is allowed to enroll students beyond the permissible limit. “Due to such practices, the university's image gets tarnished. Strict action will be taken against the private universities if they are found guilty,” said Dhyani. Meanwhile, state higher education minister Dhan Singh Rawat has also taken cognisance of the matter and has assured that a probe will be initiated soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/14-pvt-varisities-took-more-students-than-permitted-may-lose-affiliation-if-found-guilty/articleshow/84688152.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Madurai||Evidences suggest conch industry may have existed in ancient Korkai||Tuticorin: The remnants of what might have been a large conch industry is emerging in Korkai in Tuticorin district, where the state archaeology department is carrying out excavations after about 52 years.Korkai is said to have been an ancient harbour in Tamil Nadu where most of the commercial activities with other countries was done in ancient Tamil Nadu. This is the site in which the Tamil Nadu state archaeology department conducted its first excavation, after it was established in 1969. However, it was put on hold soon. Now, the department is carrying out excavations once again. Just digging into about one meter deep, has helped archaeologists find several artefacts. They said numerous sawed or cut conches had been found on the site, and there were also uncut conches and pieces of bangles that had been made using shells or conches.They have also found a perforated terracotta pipeline in three stages and about 400m away, a brick structure has also been identified. Sources said that the pipeline may be the continuation of a structure that had existed here in the past. It is a perforated terracotta pipe, which may have been used to drain industrial effluence.One hindrance to the archaeologists working in this site is that water starts entering the quadrants when they dig to a depth of two meters due to its vicinity to the ocean, the presence of tanks and the perennial Tamirabarini river.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/evidences-suggest-conch-industry-may-have-existed-in-ancient-korkai/articleshow/84671526.cms||---
---||Delhi||‘N corpn trying to remove shops at Gaffar Market for fresh sale’||New Delhi: AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj on Saturday claimed that North Delhi Municipal Corporation had planned to demolish the municipal market in the famous Gaffar Market to reconstruct the complex and sell the shops afresh by evicting the existing shopkeepers. The BJP-led corporation wants to evict the shopkeepers, who were given a lease of 99 years in 1976, and reconstruct the complex by engaging a new builder, he alleged. A notice has been issued to the shopkeepers to vacate the place within three days, he added. At a press conference, Bharadwaj said surveys were being conducted to find loopholes and evict people from those buildings. “The civic body is proving that these buildings are ‘dangerous’ and forcing the shopkeepers to empty the market. They have also been told that they won’t get the shops back. Moreover, the corporation is bringing in a new builder who will sell the shops to new people as per convenience,” Bharadwaj claimed. He added that earlier this year, the corporation had got the market assessed by IIT Roorkee. The institute had stated that because of the use of bad quality cement, the condition of this building was not good. “There are other faults in the building because of which the corporation will now demolish and reconstruct it,” Bharadwaj said. The AAP member said, if the shops were made using poor quality cement, it was the fault of the civic body. “In the past 40 years, it did not check on its own building or spend even a single rupee on repair. Had the civic body given these shops on freehold, the shopkeeper could have spent their own money and repaired the building,” Bharadwaj said. There are about 39 such markets in Delhi. The AAP functionary claimed that the corporations were making a similar plan for all these markets before the 2022 municipal elections. Jai Prakash, former north corporation mayor, said, “AAP blames the corporation when a dangerous building falls and it is also complaining when notices are being issued to such buildings. Will it take responsibility if any mishap occurs?” Most of these properties have been sublet to other parties from original lease holders, he alleged. “The corporation is not getting any revenue. What is the harm in redevelopment?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/n-corpn-trying-to-remove-shops-at-gaffar-market-for-fresh-sale/articleshow/84718449.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The first case surfaced from the Vikas Nagar locality of Dehradun where a minor girl had eloped with a 19-year-old man, identified as Sunil Sahani, earlier this month.

The new fee will come into effect after the new lessee takes over the parking space.Similarly, the civic body has increased the entry fee for two-wheelers at the Mattuthavani vegetable market from Rs 6 to Rs 7. Officials said that it was initially proposed to increase the entry fee to Rs 10, however the commissioner has decided for a nominal increase of Rs 1 rupee as users would feel the pinch. An official from the revenue department said the increase was decided by the commissioner as private parking fees have soared. People running private parking spaces at Arapalayam have increased the fee already to Rs 10 for every 12 hours, he said.The process to go for tender for various corporation facilities including parking, parks and shanties is underway. Meanwhile, the increase in parking fee has evoked sharp responses from the users. They say that this is not the time to increase the fee as many have already been affected by Covid-19. They urged the civic body to increase the fee after some time, when things become normal. V Rajesh, a regular user said people who are using it rarely will not find it difficult because of the increase, but those who use it regularly and extensively, will be affected. “I used to go for money collection to various southern districts. I used to park at the terminal. At times I had to stay overnight. At a time when petrol price and prices of vehicle spares have increased, this will certainly pinch me,” he said. “The increase could be done from next year as normalcy would have returned. The Covid-19 has rendered many jobless for months together. People are starting to go to work only now. It will hit them however small the increase is,” J Selvakumar, another user from Anna Nagar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/parking-fee-hiked-in-madurai-bus-stands/articleshow/84671568.cms||V Devanathan

Prolonged overflow from the Selaulim reservoir due to incessant rain saw both the taluka’s rivers swell. Large parts of the town went under water and in many villages residents were stranded inside their homes throughout the day. In some areas, fearing that the floods would worsen, villagers left their homes in the morning, wading through the flood water. Several houses within municipal limits and nearby Uguem panchayat were submerged and residents reported loss of several electronic household items. A small bridge at Orcotto that connects to Sanguem town went under water from Thursday night till Friday evening. Many vehicles parked near the bridge also went under. The distance between Orcotto and Sanguem town is just two kilometres, but residents of Dabamoll and surrounding areas had to take a 8km detour to the town. “A local, Francisco Barreto, would ferry residents across in his canoe whenever Orcotto went under water during monsoon. But, this year, he has tested Covid-19 positive,” said Suzy Fernandes, resident of Dando. Another small bridge at Tarimoll also went under water, forcing residents to take a long diversion to the main road, said Cavin Mascarenhas, a local. Residents of Amdai, around two kilometres from Sanguem town, remained indoors throughout the day, as the only road connecting them to Sanguem was submerged. Many families with their belongings and carrying their children on shoulders moved out from their houses to a safer location in the morning due to the flooding at Valdev, Kalem. At Kottapur, houses located on the edge of the river were fully submerged. Meanwhile, the 1km Margao-Quepem-Curchorem road at Paroda remained underwater for the second consecutive day ue to heavy rainfall and rise in the water levels of the Kushawati. Water rose almost a meter above the road, making vehicular movement impossible on this stretch. Some locals were seen crossing the submerged stretch by foot, risking their life. Traffic movement could resume only around 2pm on Friday, after the water subsided. Locals said that this is the longest period they recollect that Paroda area has remained flooded. Farmers from the area reported heavy loss to their crops. The Paroda bridge and the area from Parvat junction till Paroda church were seen submerged for the second time within a week. Paroda bridge links the villagers of Avedem to Margao-Quepem. Quepem police erected a barricade in Quepem town and at Guddi junction diverting the entire traffic moving from Margao and Quepem through the Chandor-Assolda route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sanguem-locals-flee-as-water-engulfs-homes/articleshow/84695027.cms||Johnny M

He went past the chief minister, seated next to him, then touched party leaders Rajinder Kaur Bhattal and Lal Singh’s feet at the end of the first row of dignitaries on the dais. Earlier, fuelling speculation, Sidhu left the get together at tea before Amarinder’s arrival, only to return soon after. The event was scheduled for 10am but the CM was running late. On his return, Sidhu said he had gone for ardas and tried to sit at the other end of the table but was asked by other party leaders to sit next to Amarinder. Even though the party high command may have intervened to paper over the cracks, many Congress leaders remain uncertain of the united face of the state unit lasting till the assembly elections due in early 2022. “One could sense a cold vibe when Amarinder and Sidhu posed with the large garland, along with outgoing PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar and AICC incharge of Punjab affairs Sunil Jakhar,” said a party leader. Amarinder’s one-time bête noire, Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa, besides Ludhiana MP Manish Tewari, considered to be a CM loyalist, also attended the tea hosted for party leaders and then the installation ceremony, in what is being seen as an attempt to portray unity in the party. “The party managed to pull off the ceremony as a result of the intervention by Congress’s central leadership. There are reports of calls to party leaders in the state to put up a united face. AICC incharge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat too has been at it,” said a party MLA. Meanwhile, a section of party MLAs tried to convey that the party has resolved its internal turmoil. After the get together at Punjab Bhawan, Bhattal said, “The entire Congress leadership is elated over the taking over of the new team. One of them is my brother (Capt), the other my son (Sidhu).” “Both leaders sat together, spoke to each other over tea,” added Sidhu loyalist MLA Pargat Singh, while MLA Navtej Singh Cheema said, “Fit and hit in the same frame, CM and Sidhu met warmly.” However, another MLA said, “Sidhu indulged in aggressive posturing in his speech on various issues, but it will be closely watched if there is coordination between the state government and the party. He has also been repeatedly referring to the 18-point agenda of people’s issues given by the party high command but most of it has to be implemented by the chief minister.” Another indication of tension between the two leaders was that Sidhu referred to Amarinder only once in his 18-minute speech, that too while referring to the issues facing the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/fragile-peace-congs-united-face-in-punjab-for-real/articleshow/84692938.cms||Vibhor Mohan

Vehicles coming on to the Sivaganga road have to do a steep climb. The encroachments led to accidents. At the junction of the Sixth Main Road and Sivaganga Road, the centre median caused trouble for motorists. After a lot of representations by the Gomathypuram-Thendral Nagar Residents Welfare Association, a speed breaker was constructed at the junction. However, it was removed in early January and many accidents were reported soon after. TOI has published the issue in its columns recently. This was also represented to the candidates of the political parties who contested the elections in Madurai North constituency. Representations to the district administration, former collector T Anbazhagan and the state highways department did not find any solution. Now, the speed breaker has been reinstated much to the relief of the residents. President of the residents’ welfare association D Raghavan said that he would like to thank TOI for taking up the cause on their behalf.

While the education department is yet to issue an official order in this regard, the state Congress has accused the incumbent BJP government of 'stooping to a new low'. Garima Mehra Dasauni, Uttarakhand Congress spokesperson, said, "Instead of taking measures to improve the quality of education, the state government is indulging in politics. The proposed merger is unacceptable." She added, "The contribution of Rajiv Gandhi Ji in the development of our country is immense and should not be forgotten. However, the BJP government is reversing all our good decisions."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/congress-slams-proposed-merger-of-rajiv-abhinav-vidyalayas-atal-utkrisht-schools/articleshow/84688192.cms||Mohammad Anab

The bus was going to Chandigarh as the passengers were to participate in the induction ceremony of the new president of Punjab Congress, Navjot Singh Sidhu. Over 20 persons in both buses were injured, with some of them suffering serious injuries. The driver of the private bus is among the three people who died in the accident.

---||Dehradun||Meat ban matter of fundamental rights, says Uttarakhand high court||NAINITAL: In a country where 70% of the population eats non-vegetarian food, the matter of banning meat is one that concerns the fundamental rights of citizens and isn’t a majority versus minority issue, the Uttarakhand high court said on Friday while hearing two petitions against a ban on slaughterhouses in Haridwar. The bench of chief justice R S Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma said, “The issue is not minority versus majority. The issue is very simple. What are the fundamental rights of the citizens of India?” The court has now asked the petitioners to amend their pleas in a week as none of them pleaded that such a ban violates the right to privacy of a citizen. The court remarked that the petitions have not been drafted with “whole-heartedness” that is required in challenging “seminal constitutional issues”. The pleas filed by some residents of Haridwar had alleged that a ban on slaughterhouses in Haridwar discriminated against minorities as many areas in the district had a substantial Muslim population. On Friday, the bench cited surveys on food habits of Indians from 2018 and 2019. “It’s very glaring data that in Uttarakhand 72.6% of the population is non-vegetarian. In totality, 70% of Indian population is non-vegetarian which busts the myth that the majority of the population is vegetarian,” the court said. In its previous hearing, the bench had said that a ban like the one in Haridwar calls into question the extent to which the state can determine a citizen’s choices. “The issue is whether a citizen has the right to decide his own diet or will that be decided by the state,” it had said. The court had also said that a civilisation is judged only by how it treats its minorities. “Democracy does not only mean rule by majority but, most importantly, democracy means the protection of the minority,” it had said. In March, Uttarakhand had declared all areas in Haridwar “slaughterhouse-free” and cancelled no objection certificates issued to slaughterhouses. The two petitions in the high court challenged this on two grounds — a blanket ban on meat of any type is unconstitutional, as was the section the Uttarakhand government had inserted into the UP Municipalities Act, 237A, to give itself power to declare an area under a municipal corporation, council or nagar panchayat a “slaughter-free” zone. The court has also asked the petitioners to amend the plea to challenge the constitutional validity of the amendment made to the UP Municipal Corporation Act. Like the municipalities Act, an amendment was made to the municipal corporation Act that gave the state government power to put a blanket ban on animal slaughter in any municipal corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/meat-ban-matter-of-fundamental-rights-not-majority-vs-minority-issue-ukhand-hc/articleshow/84688267.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Dehradun||Custodial death in Uttarakhand: Autopsy showed 10 injuries on body, but doctor statement not taken||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court has slammed the police inquiry into the death of a 35-year-old man in judicial custody who was allegedly thrashed by prison guards while observing that the autopsy report showed as many as 10 injuries on his body and yet the statement of the doctor who performed the procedure was not recorded. The court asked police whether “ties of brotherhood” had led their probe to find no evidence of beating by prison guards. On Thursday, the bench had ordered a CBI probe into the case and asked the government to consider transfer of Nainital SSP and Haldwani circle officer. It had also directed transfer of four prison guards at Haldwani sub-district jail. The court order, which was released on Friday, pointed out that instead of taking the statement of the doctor who performed the postmortem, the Haldwani CO’s inquiry report had relied upon a witness statement that “the man was running here and there and died after hitting a prison gate”. The single judge bench of Justice Ravindra Maithani was hearing a petition filed by Pravesh Kumar’s wife which alleged that Kumar was sent to prison on March 5 and was found dead the next day. It alleged that Kumar died after he was thrashed by prison guards. He was in judicial custody under the Pocso Act after his wife had complained that he had allegedly assaulted their minor daughter in an inebriated state. After Kumar’s death, his wife had sought an FIR in the case, but no action was taken. She had also approached Nainital SSP who handed over the inquiry to Haldwani CO. The woman then filed a plea in high court The court noted that despite a legal obligation to lodge an FIR promptly, the SSP did not lodge the FIR and without any authority under law directed an inquiry by CO Haldwani in a case of custodial death. The FIR was registered a month after the incident following the orders of the chief judicial magistrate. In its order, the court said, “Is it ties of brotherhood that instead of lodging FIR, SSP Nainital ordered for inquiry by CO Haldwani? Is it ties of brotherhood that CO Haldwani, while recording its conclusion, did not even examine the doctor who conducted the post mortem and noted the injury?” The court also asked whether “ties of brotherhood” led Haldwani CO to conclude that the statement of another eyewitness — who was in jail alongside Kumar and had informed his wife that the latter was beaten up by prison guards before his death — could not be corroborated. The court also observed that seeing the way police have proceeded in the matter, it is a case whose investigation should definitely be transferred to CBI. “This is a case where accountability of the senior police officer may also be required to be fixed administratively. The written words in the judgments of the courts and the provisions of right to life, as enshrined in the Indian Constitution, will remain dead letter, if action against erring police officers is not taken by the administration.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/custodial-death-autopsy-showed-10-injuries-on-body-but-doc-statement-not-taken/articleshow/84688247.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Trichy||No single window system for arts and science colleges admission this yr too||Trichy: Arts and science colleges in the state will admit students by individually conducting admission this year as there are no plans from the state government to introduce the much-needed single window system for college admissions.The single window system is in place for medical and engineering colleges. But arts and science colleges in the state make admissions independently by inviting applications to various undergraduate and postgraduate courses.Educationists point out that aided arts and science colleges manipulate the availability of seats to various courses to mint money. Further, students too are put to hardship by not getting suitable courses based on their marks in colleges of their choice in the absence of a centralised system.“The state government is considering the option of introducing the single window system of admission in 105 government arts and science colleges this year. But it should have been ideally introduced in aided and self-financing arts and science colleges,” said T Nedunchezhian, a retired Tamil professor.Director of collegiate education, which governs arts and science colleges in the state, had sought opinion from the colleges three years ago on the same following public demand, but there wasn’t any progress.“When neighbouring states such as Kerala and Andhra Pradesh could successfully implement SWS for arts and science colleges, Tamil Nadu should implement it considering the welfare of students,” said MDMK state youth wing secretary V Eswaran.“Close to three lakh students join these colleges every year. Colleges have been earning a huge sum by selling applications. Colleges should scrutinise all the applications received from students before admitting them. But colleges are indulging in first come first serve basis to prevent students from considering other options. Students are put to stress in selecting a college of their convenience if they receive calls from more than one college,” he said.“Without making an amendment to the rule number 9 (5) of the Tamil Nadu Private College Regulations Act 1976 - which says admission of the students is the exclusive responsibility of the college principal – the state government cannot implement the single window system,” said president of AUT K Pandiyan. Pandiyan also insisted on determining the fee structure of the courses offered by aided and self-financing colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/no-single-window-system-for-arts-and-science-colleges-admission-this-yr-too/articleshow/84671644.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Ganesh Godiyal to boost Congress prospects in Garhwal||DEHRADUN: While former chief minister Harish Rawat and his team has remained active in Kumaon region, Garhwal remained a major concern for the Congress. In the 2017 assembly polls, it managed to win a mere six out of 41 assembly seats. The region was swept by the BJP. With priests upset over the Devasthanam Board, naming a Brahmin as state chief is likely to work in favour of the opposition party. Besides, Pauri is an important district – which has given as many as five CMs to Uttarakhand – and Congress could not win even one out of the six assembly seats. Ganesh Godiyal, the state chief, is a prominent Brahmin face, two-time MLA and comes from Pauri district. His presence on top post can help the party revive its prospects in the Garhwal region. Besides, sharing the top posts between a Thakur and Brahmin has been the most “effective and important” equation in the Himalayan state. Political analyst Jay Singh Rawat said, “Though Harish has an upper hand in the new team, it will not be right to say that Pritam Singh has been ignored. The party has given charge to Bhuvan Kapri, Ranjit Rawat and Aarendra Sharma. Therefore, it is visible that an attempt has been made to strike a balance among the seniors.” On Godiyal being named as state chief, he said that it would definitely help the party in Garhwal. “While it was a clean sweep for BJP in 2017, things may be different this time. Firstly, Godiyal is a strong contender from Srinagar in Pauri and has good control in the district. Then issues like Devasthanam Board and Gairsain will play a crucial role,” he said. Rawat further said that "the Congress appears slightly weak in Garhwal, and taking the fact into account the party may have gone for a state chief from this region”. Godiyal, who hails from Bahedi village of Pauri district, won the Thalisain assembly constituency in 2002. In 2012, the 55-year-old won from Srinagar and lost the seat to BJP candidate Dhan Singh Rawat in 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ganesh-godiyal-to-boost-cong-prospects-in-garhwal/articleshow/84688291.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ED probing if seller of flat to ex-babu linked to businessman||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is probing if Anamitra Properties Pvt Ltd is connected with Pune businessman Avinash Bhosale in a money laundering case the agency is investigating against him. One of the directors in Anamitra Properties, Nikhil Gokhale, is also a director in Bhosale’s company Avinash Bhosale Infrastructure Pvt Ltd (ABIL). Gokhale is also a director in many other companies controlled by Bhosale. Anamitra Properties is being investigated by the income-tax (I-T) department for the sale of a Rs 5.3 crore flat to former state chief secretary Ajoy Mehta. Sources stated that the ED is examining Anamitra Properties, Gokhale and their financial connection with Avinash Bhosale after recent I-T findings. The I-T is probing ownership details of a Rs 5.3 crore flat at Nariman Point that was purchased by Gokhale, director of Anamitra Properties, in 2009 for Rs 4 crore reportedly from the son of a late judge. Gokhale sold the flat to Mehta last October for Rs 5.3 crore. Mehta said, “I paid all the payment through my savings to purchase the flat after ensuring there was no loan-legal issue related with the flat.

---||Delhi||Tahir Hussain challenges charges under UAPA in Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Friday sought the stand of Delhi Police on a plea by former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, arrested for his alleged role in the northeast Delhi riots last year, challenging the anti-terror provisions of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act slapped against him. Justice Mukta Gupta issued notice to the Centre, Delhi government and Delhi Police on the petition, which has also challenged the grant of sanction to prosecute him in the case lodged under the UAPA. The court said a reply affidavit status report has to be filed by the prosecution within four weeks and listed the matter for further hearing on September 28. Senior advocate Mohit Mathur, appearing for Hussain, submitted that although the provisions relating to terrorist activities have been invoked against him in the chargesheet, there is nothing to show that he was involved in any terrorist activity. “Mere road blocks, chakka jam and expression of dissent has been taken as terrorist activities,” he contended. Hussain has sought to set aside UAPA provisions like sections 13 (punishment for unlawful activities), 15 (terrorist act), 16 (punishment for terrorist act) and 18 (punishment for conspiracy) invoked in the chargesheet filed by the Crime Branch. The chargesheet in the UAPA case relates to an alleged larger conspiracy that led to the northeast Delhi riots during the anti-Citizenship Amenment Act protests. Special Public Prosecutor Amit Mahajan, representing Delhi Police and the Centre, said the trial court had already taken cognisance of the chargesheet in September last year. He informed the court that the accused has challenged the sanction granted by the authorities to prosecute him on merits, which should have been filed before the trial court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tahir-hussain-challenges-charges-under-uapa-in-hc/articleshow/84693062.cms||---

Parents in Trichy can send their complaints to ceotrichy.compaints@gmail.com. Schools in Tamil Nadu remain closed since April 24, 2021 following the second wave of Covid -19. While physical classes for the new academic year 2021-22 have not yet commenced, the school education department has been receiving representations over collection of fees for this academic year by the schools.To prevent parents from coming in person to the school education department offices, an exclusive email id has been issued in every district to lodge complaints against erring schools. As per the directions of the school education department, all unaided private schools in Tamil Nadu were directed to collect 75% of the tuition fee considering the pandemic last year. Same norm is applicable for the academic year 2020-21 too. “The first instalment of 40% of fee may be collected by August 31, 2021 and the remaining 35% within a period of two months from the commencement of the physical classes. The remaining 25% of fee may be decided in due course considering the pandemic situation,” said Trichy district chief education officer R Arivalagan.“While we have been receiving complaints as the academic year started a few days back, schools should not collect fees beyond the permissible limit to avoid action from the CEO office,” he said.A committee of staff will look into the complaints in each district, and asked to submit the status report on the progress made on those complaints every fortnight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/email-id-issued-for-parents-to-lodge-plaints-of-excess-fee-collection-by-private-schools/articleshow/84671669.cms||Sampath Kumar

The scenic hill town has a proud history of giving a number of Olympic gold-winning men’s hockey players to the country over the years. As many as 10 Anglo-Indian players from the schools of this hill town have made it to multiple Olympics Games and also won gold. All of them played during the era when Indian hockey team was dominating the world stage, winning successive Olympic medals under the leadership of “The wizard” Major Dhyan Chand (1928 to 1936). The 1928 (Amsterdam) team had six players, the 1932 (Los Angeles) team five players and the 1936 (Berlin) team had four players who had studied in Mussoorie. A student from St George’s even played for the bronze-winning team of Great Britain at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics. “Mussoorie players dominated the national and international hockey during this golden era of India hockey,” said historian Gopal Bhardwaj. The Patrician Brothers-run St George’s College (estd 1853) -- among the oldest schools of Mussoorie – nurtured seven champions, six of whom represented India while one played for England. According to Brother Joseph M Joseph, principal of St George’s College, George Marthins (1928), Maurice A Gateley (1928), William James Goodsir Cullen (1928), Carlyle Carroll Tapsell (1932 and 1936), Ernest John Goodsir Cullen (1936) and Lionel C Emmett (1936) were alumnus of the school who were part of the gold-medal-winning Indian hockey teams. “Mussoorieites cherish the moments when students from our schools brought successive Olympic golds for the country. We convey our best wishes to the current team and hope and pray that they bring the Olympic gold home,” said Brother Joseph. Oak Grove School also has the honour of its alumni representing India at the Olympics -- Richard James Allen (1928 and 1936) Eric Pinniger (1928 and 1932), Leslie Charles Hammond (1928 and 1932) and Richard John Carr (1932).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/mussoorie-schools-have-produced-10-olympic-hockey-gold-medallists-in-the-past/articleshow/84688342.cms||Anmol Jain

The unit, Kanmani Polybag Private Limited situated at Vishwanatham near Sivakasi is owned by Dhanapal. Based on a tip-off, a team of officials headed by Sivakasi sub-collector M Birathiviraj carried out an inspection and rescued the 14. Speaking to TOI, Sivakasi sub-collector Birathiviraj said of the 14, 12 are adolescent and below the age of 18. All the 14 - seven of them, including three girls from Chhattisgarh, six from Bihar and one from Odisha - were brought to the unit by an agent Naveen. They were made to work for nearly 12 hours every day and were working without any salary for the past six months. “Their living condition was worse as they were made to stay in a small shed inside a unit,” he said. Birathivaraj said steps are taken to issue release certificates and also to provide financial assistance of Rs 20,000 after which they would be sent to their native places. Legal action will be initiated against Naveen and Dhanapal under the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, added Birathiviraj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/14-children-held-captive-as-labourers-rescued/articleshow/84693107.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The award for compensation was recently sanctioned to acquire the required land.The NHAI in 2011 had realigned the road proposal made in 2006-07 as a group of farmers alleged that waterbodies will be disturbed and protested against the project. But, the civil work for interlinking Panjappur (Trichy-Madurai NH) with Jeeyapuram (Trichy-Karur) NH via Thayanur (Trichy-Dindigul NH) did not commence so far. As per the realigned proposal, NHAI estimated that 46 hectares of land in four villages will be required for the revised project. Reliable sources said that the district administration has passed an award for compensation to the landowners in Panjappur, Pirattiyur and Kallikudi villages mentioning the extent of land needed, compensation and identifying the owner of the land. “The passing of award for compensation despite the pandemic is itself a significant development. The project cost estimation is underway,” a senior official with the NHAI said. “The realigned road between Panjappur and Jeeyapuram will have a lot of culverts. DPR preparation is nearing completion, civil work may start by this year-end or at least by 2022,” a source in the NHAI said. In April 2018, villagers had agreed to cede their land for the 18km long stretch. In October, 2020, the NHAI published a 3D notification under the NH Act, 1956, and officials said that land acquisition will conclude smoothly. Meanwhile, the stage-II of the semi ring road to interlink Trichy-Thanjavur NH (Thuvakudi) with Trichy-Madurai NH (Panjappur) via Trichy-Pudukkottai NH (Mathur) is progressing too, with the civil work for bridges underway between Mathur and Panjappur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/work-on-stage-i-of-semi-ring-road-in-trichy-to-commence-soon/articleshow/84671686.cms||Deepak Karthik

Officials, however, said that there were multiple challenges in executing the plan as people demanding the first dose had approached the centres and even entered into an argument with the officials.Vaccination camps in the city are set up at 12 locations, of which four are exclusively for those awaiting their second dose of Covishield. The facility has helped the people who are waiting for the second dose to take the shots without much waiting. The beneficiaries said that the facility helped prevent crowding. “The second dose camps were properly arranged and it took only a few minutes to take the jab,” Pushpak Jain, a beneficiary from Diamond Bazaar, said. However, corporation officials claimed that they had come across residents forcing the authorities to administer them the first dose at the camps. “People even threatened to protest. They said that the option is theirs to get the vaccine at the place they prefer,” a senior corporation official said.The civic body was requested to continue the camps by employing police personnel to regulate the crowd. On Thursday, around 3,500 people were vaccinated, but the patronage was comparatively poor considering the reception at the camps so far. Each centre returned 2-5 vials each on Thursday. On Friday, corporation has planned to utilise the remaining vials to vaccinate young mothers and comorbid residents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichiites-hail-exclusive-vaccine-centres-for-2nd-dose-of-covishield/articleshow/84671727.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Madurai||Is witness protection scheme notified in Tamil Nadu? Madras HC seeks report||MADURAI: Does Tamil Nadu have a witness protection law? Madras high court has given four days for its own registry to ascertain this, and inform the court whether or not the Supreme Court-piloted Witness Protection Scheme, 2018 has been notified in the state. As per the witness protection scheme, each district should have a standing committee chaired by district and sessions judge with the head of the police in the district as member and head of the prosecution in the district as its member secretary. Noting that there is nothing available to show whether this scheme is notified and these clauses have been complied with, justice G Chandrasekharan directed the registry to file a report by July 27. The judge issued the order, after a main witness in a murder case was threatened. The case relates to the bail plea of an advocate, Chokkar, arrested by Uthamapalayam police in Theni district in connection with a murder of another advocate Ranjith Kumar over a property dispute in March 2020. The witness was granted for a witness from February 8, 2021 to April 7, 2021 by the Theni principal sessions court. Thereafter, there is no specific order for extension of witness protection. “This is the case of murder of an advocate. Some of the accused were also advocates. It is alleged that the main witness in this case had been threatened by the accused,” said justice Chandrasekharan. Noting that the witness protection fund has to be created, he said a witness protection cell has to be established for duly implementing the witness protection order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/is-witness-protection-scheme-notified-court-seeks-report/articleshow/84693138.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: PCCF reopens tree felling case, seeks report in 15 days||NAGPUR: Adding a twist to claims regarding tree felling inside the Umred-Karhandla-Paoni Wildlife Sanctuary compartments in South Umred forest range, PCCF (wildlife) Sunil Limaye has reopened the case and sought a fresh report. In March 2021, a nine-member joint committee of wildlife and territorial forest staff had concluded that the tree felling had taken place on railway land and not in the sanctuary compartments. In a letter addressed to complainant honorary wildlife warden Roheet Karoo on July 17, Limaye said, “As the report of the committee set up to probe tree felling in sanctuary compartments is not clear, a fresh report has been sought.” Karoo, who is also secretary of Wildlife Conservation & Development Center (WCDC), had in December last lodged a complaint alleging felling of nearly 450 trees in compartments number 1439, 1417, and 1418. The felling was done after South Umred RFO granted permission to Maharashtra Rail Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (Maharail) for Itwari-Nagbhid gauge conversion work. Karoo had even issued composite notice to the forest department under Section 55(C) of the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972, and Section 19 of the Environment Protection Act (EPA) 1986, alleging that Maharail felled trees inside the sanctuary compartments and notified tiger corridor. “We will take action if it is found that trees were felled inside the sanctuary. I have issued directions to APCCF (wildlife) HS Hooda and sought a report in 15 days,” Limaye said on Friday. However, P Kalyan Kumar, CCF (Nagpur), was not aware of the decision. He said, “Over two months after the probe, the nine-member committee has concluded that tree felling did not take place either on sanctuary or territorial forest land but on an area owned by the railways. There is no ambiguity in the report.” According to Kumar, the basic controversy was that whether felling was done inside the sanctuary. “This happened as boundaries near the disputed area were not demarcated when the sanctuary was notified on June 29, 2012. Now, I don’t see any issue in felling,” he said. CCF & field director of Pench Ravikiran Govekar too said that felling was done on land belonging to the railways as per the saat-bara land extract document, and it is not a sanctuary compartment. “However, it is true that felling has been done in tiger corridor,” said Govekar. Countering claims of the committee, Karoo said, “Railways has no papers to show either the felled trees or land belonged to them. If it’s the right decision, why the timber is not being allowed to be lifted?” According to Karoo, tree felling has taken place not only in the eco-sensitive zone but also in the tiger corridor between Umred-Karhandla and Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR). “For such cases, PCCF is the competent authority. Wildlife officials were not taken into confidence by the South Umred RFO before issuing tree felling permission,” he said. As per information received under RTI, no proper procedure like gram panchayat NOC, Maharashtra Right to Public Service Act, 2015 (Seva Hami Kayda), verification of documents if the land or trees belonged to the railways etc was followed while granting felling permission by the territorial officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pccf-reopens-tree-felling-case-seeks-report-in-15-days/articleshow/84690897.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Dehradun||PAC deployed for a week now in Haridwar village over communal tensions||HARIDWAR: PAC and civil police personnel have been deployed for a week now (since July 15) at Haridwar’s Bahadarpur Jat village, where a Facebook post by a resident threatening to kill his neighbour had triggered a communal flare-up. Pamphlets asking families of one community of the village to leave within five days ‘or face consequences’ had appeared in front of homes and a 38-year-old Dalit woman from the village ‘eloping’ with an 18-year-old Muslim boy had made matters worse. The man against whom an FIR had been lodged at Pathri police station under section 295 A (Deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the IPC earlier this month, over a provocative Facebook post, is absconding. Anuj Walia, state convener of Bajrang Dal told TOI that hundreds of families from the village had gathered at Pathri to protest the delay in the man's arrest. Meanwhile, the missing Dalit woman has returned, even as the boy continues to be missing. She had claimed that she was kidnapped by three men from the village but now in her statement to police, has said she went willingly. She said she had left Bahadarpur Jat village in Pathri to stay at her sister’s place in Beladi Sadabad village in Jhabrera for a couple of days and from here, had set out again, all voluntarily. “Her statement before a magistrate will be recorded in a couple of days,” said Jhabrera police station in-charge Ravindra Kumar. She had initially claimed that she was kidnapped by three men from the village. Meanwhile, village pradhan Vikas Kumar said there was no tension in the village, just “resentment among families, who demand stringent action against those who disrupted communal harmony in the village”. SP (rural) Parmindra Dobhal also said that there was no tension in the village and things were moving towards a resolution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pac-deployed-for-a-week-now-in-haridwar-village-over-communal-tensions/articleshow/84688388.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal
---||Delhi||Delhi riots: ‘Inciting communal hatred won’t help me’||NEW DELHI: Former Congress councillor Ishrat Jahan, arrested under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in a conspiracy case related to the northeast Delhi riots, on Friday told a city court that the allegation that she incited Muslims against Hindus would not suit her politically as she had won from a seat where both the communities had voted for her. Jahan, through her counsel, told Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat that police had projected her as a “kattar” (hardline) person, but she had won from a seat where Muslims were a minority. She further claimed that no Muslim had ever won from that seat and her victory was due to her secular credentials. Advocate Pradeep Teotia, appearing for Jahan, told the court, “She was the only woman who contested for the seat where a Muslim had never won before. Both communities voted for her. It would have been dangerous for her to pit Muslims against the other community. Because of her secular credentials, she was victorious. It would not suit her politically.” Showing pictures of Jahan participating in Hindu and Sikh processions, the lawyer said she didn’t carry the “hardliner” image that police had tried to project. “Why would she do it? There is not an iota of evidence that connects her directly or indirectly to the conspiracy. She wants just one single proof from the prosecution based on which they can justify their action to book her under UAPA,” he added. Teotia argued that there was a wrongful intent to falsely implicate her in the case and the prosecution showed evidence in piecemeal and not in totality. “Ishrat has been a lawyer and a young political leader representing India in Singapore, Malaysia, Myanmar, etc at political conferences of Asian leaders… All witnesses shown against her in this case are planted… The pattern of financial withdrawals and deposits has always been the same. Police do not have any qualitative evidence against her,” said the lawyer. Referring to a recent order by which student activists Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and Asif Iqbal Tanha were granted bail by Delhi High Court, Teotia said if Jahan was indeed such a good conspirator, she could have asked them to influence witnesses on her behalf as they were out of jail. “She has a better footing than those who got bail from the high court. I challenge the prosecution to show evidence that qualifies her to be prosecuted under UAPA,” said Teotia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/inciting-communal-hatred-wont-help-me/articleshow/84693111.cms||Usha Das
---||Madurai||‘SC upholding NGT order won’t affect industry’||Madurai: Firework manufacturers have said that the Supreme Court upholding the order of the NGT imposing a ban on the sale and use of fireworks during Covid-19 pandemic in areas where the ambient air quality falls under the ‘poor’ category, will not affect their industry to a large extent. President of Tamil Nadu Fireworks and Amorces Manufacturers Association (TANFAMA) P Ganesan said that the NGT had only imposed a ban on sale and usage of firecrackers in Delhi-NCR region and other cities where the ambient quality is poor and categories below. However, the sale of crackers is permitted in other parts of the country. He explained that since this ban is only in a few cities it would only affect nearly 5% of the consumption. “The government is taking several effective steps to control the spread of Covid-19. If the people adhere to the safety protocols and get vaccinated, then it would avoid any further lockdowns and Diwali, which is one of the biggest festivals, could be celebrated by the people in a good manner without any restrictions,” said Ganesan. If yet another lockdown is imposed close to Diwali, it would not only affect the fireworks industry but all the industries in the country would be affected, he added. General secretary of The Indian Fireworks Manufacturers Association (TIFMA) T Kannan said that the Supreme Court upholding NGT order would have a slight impact on the industry as consumption would come down by nearly 15%. It may be recalled that the NGT on December 2, 2020, had directed the ban on sale and use of crackers in some places till the pandemic comes to an end. It stated that green crackers can be used for a duration of not more than two hours, only at places where air quality is at ‘moderate’ or below category. NGT order also said that any victim of pollution can approach the district magistrate (collectors) for compensation by showing evidence of individual damage and the person responsible for it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sc-upholding-ngt-order-wont-affect-industry/articleshow/84693146.cms||Kaushik Kannan

He somehow escaped from there to bring more police force. Meanwhile, the accused dragged me inside the house and bolted the gate.

While major showrooms are guarded by multiple security personnel, small shops have been a target of the burglars for the past few months.Even during the lockdown, the burglars broke into a few outlets on Babu Road in ward 11. In another incident, a two-wheeler parked outside a house in Chinna Setti street was stolen last month. In the most recent incident, a mobile phone and silver items were reported to have been stolen from a house situated on the first floor near Jaffershah street. CCTV footage of the burglar jumping off the residential complex had surfaced on Thursday.Residents said that burglars have now started targeting the houses as traders have become vigil. “Night patrolling has to be intensified. The narrow streets are such that multiple houses can be accessed through the terraces.

The opposition party alleged the Congress had acted as per a script to divert attention from its failures and befool Punjabis. They also condemned outgoing state Congress president Sunil Jakhar for stating that the road to re-election of the Congress in Punjab ran through Bargari and Behbal Kalan, the places associated with the heinous cases of sacrilege. There could be no stronger proof of the party’s contention that the Congress had played politics on this issue in conjunction with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in 2017 and was going on the same dangerous road again on the eve of the 2022 assembly elections, it claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-asks-new-cong-chief-to-give-timelines-to-fulfil-promises/articleshow/84693126.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Four years on, Vellayani farmers continue wait for compensation||Thiruvananthapuram: Four years have passed since the government promised to speed up the compensation process for farmers at Vellayani, whose 217 acres of land had been submerged by the lake for the past three decades. The promise was given at a meeting held in 2017. Till 1991, the farmers used to dewater their land near the lake to sow paddy (puncha krishi) with the support of a committee lead by the district RDO. The land was awarded to the farmers for agriculture purposes, with title deeds. But with the government deciding to stop further cultivation as part of efforts to conserve lake, the farmers lost their main source of income. However, following protests, the government gave the nod to continue farming. Meanwhile, the state human rights commission ruled against the decision stating that it would pollute the lake which is a drinking water source for areas like Kovalam, Vizhinjam, Veganoor, and Kaliyoor. It was in this backdrop that the government decided to take over the land for conserving Vellayani as a freshwater lake. Besides paddy cultivation, cattle rearing here also added to the income of these farmers. The 217 acres belong to nearly 700 farmers in the 4km-stretch from Palapoor in Vellayani to Panangode in Veganoor. Interestingly, the farmers are still paying the land tax. “We have incurred a loss of Rs 500 crore in the past three decades. When farming ended, associated activities like cattle rearing also ended. The government has fixed a land value based on 1991 statistics, but we demand a fair value to compensate the farming loss incurred since 1992. The government usually gives decent compensations based on fair value for lands acquired for development projects. But in our case, we are facing a biased approach from the government,” said Padashekara Kayal Samrakshana Samithi convenor Koliyoor Gopi, who owns 54 cents of land. According to former MLA Jameela Prakasam, 240 lakh litres of water is taken for drinking water schemes by the government for areas including the Vizhinjam International Seaport. “As per the current evaluation, the government has to raise at least Rs 105 crore to provide compensation to the farmers,” she said. “During 2016-17, some real estate groups had expressed interest in buying the land but the officials then strongly opposed that move. The farmers neither have the permission to sell their land nor do farming,” said Jameela who is also the patron of the Samithi. “So, as decided in the meeting held in 2017, the government must avoid further delay in providing fair compensation to these farmers,” she said. She added that encroachment, sewage pollution and sand mining are posing a great threat to the land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/four-years-on-vellayani-farmers-continue-wait-for-compensation/articleshow/84688475.cms||---

Additional deputy commissioner of police-IV Rupinder Kaur Sra has come up with this initiative to help rape survivors overcome the trauma and named it ‘Sawera-Ek Nayee Subah, Ek Nayee Shuruat’. She has roped in Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Ludhiana, for the project. Sra heads zone-IV of Ludhiana police, where there is more migrant population and higher instances of rape of minors.Sra said, “Whenever I meet a rape survivor, be it adult or minor, I feel their pain. I certainly help them get justice, but feel that we need to do more than this. The rape survivors, especially the minor girls, need compassion and support to overcome the trauma. At times, it is seen that they don’t get acceptance in the family and society.”The ADCP, who has been working on the idea for the past two months, said, “I am glad that CII has agreed to be a part of this project, under which survivors will be provided free education and counselling by professionals to support them mentally, emotionally and medically. Free education will be provided to survivors’ children and CII is committed to provide them employment too.”“We will initiate this project for the survivors of zone-IV of Ludhiana. They will be registered with the help of a mobile application for a faster and a macro reachout. Thereafter, I may cover the entire commissionerate,” she added. Commissioner of police Rakesh Aggarwal inaugurated the project on Friday. The team comprises Amit Juneja, former chairman of Ludhiana CII, Ashpreet Singh Sahni, chairman of CII-Ludhiana, Ashwin Nagpal, vice-chairman of CII-Ludhiana, Dr Mehak Bansal, consultant and paediatrician, Dr Venus Bansal, obstetrician and gynaecologist and Dr Rashi, psychologist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/police-start-handholding-project-for-rape-survivors/articleshow/84688426.cms||Payal Dhawan

---||Nagpur||Cops reshaping tribals’ agri future in Maoist-hit G’chiroli||Nagpur: Police have turned to agriculture and farm techniques to strike a rapport with the tribal population in Gadchiroli. In the backdrop of ebbing Maoist influence, police are now trying to empower the tribals through agriculture for bettering their economic condition, which has been in doldrums since the last 30 years due to rebel violence. A bunch of police personnel, with either family background of farming or education in agriculture, have started reshaping their department’s equation with the tribals. Launching a composite programme ‘Krishi Samridhhi Yojana’, police have started offering various agriculture-based benefits and services to the villagers since last year. Apart from coordinating with the government’s agriculture department for various schemes, including discounted and free seeds and saplings, cops have started training and guiding the tribal population, encouraging them to replace their primitive farming techniques with modern methods and do away with over dependency on paddy crop. Police have also gone to the extent of developing nurseries to train the villagers in farming techniques and giving them away free saplings. Constables, who are either trained or being guided by the officers having agricultural knowledge, are engaged in maintaining the nurseries and guide the locals visiting the place. Sub-inspector Dhananjay Patil, posted at Perimili police outpost who hails from a farmer’s family in Sangli, had written a book in Marathi about easy farming techniques and used his own salary to print, publish and distribute it among the locals. “During our gram bhets (village visits), I try to encourage the villagers to take up modern and scientific methods of farming instead of their traditional practices which is leading them nowhere,” said Patil, whose family owned substantial farmland in Meraj in Sangli. “The villagers are dependent only on one crop which, if fails, leaves them empty handed at the end of the cycle,” he said. Patil said a successful experimentation last year to create a small farm of drumsticks and distribution of 3,000 saplings to villagers had paved way for a bigger one this year. Around 15,000 saplings were produced and distributed to 500 farmers (30 each). “We are also helping the locals engage in fisheries and extending every possible help to them. Our work with the locals over fishery is already on at Perimili,” he said. SP Ankit Goyal said police is the nodal agency for distributing government schemes and benefits arising out of them. “Our Krishi Samriddhi Yojana is part of the bigger project ‘Dadalora yojana’ (single window system). We created our own nursery of drumsticks which is considered a superfood,” he said. “A custard apple nursery at Yelchil and another one of papaya at Bamni in Sironcha is already under way from where we shall train the locals on how to grow these fruits and also distribute saplings and seeds,” he said. DIG (Naxal range) Sandip Patil said the tribal population can themselves adjudge who is their real friend and who is misleading them. “If the Maoists are running a parallel government, how much help have they extended like police to empower the tribals and help them grow economically? From seeds to saplings and training to support, police are extending various helps to the local population to ensure their farming improves,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-reshaping-tribals-agri-future-in-maoist-hit-gchiroli/articleshow/84713365.cms||Soumitra Bose

The BJP and Hindu outfits pressed for his arrest and detention under the National Security Act. The BJP would stage a protest on July 28. The Panavilai parish priest was speaking at a meeting organised at Arumanai on Sunday evening. Videos of his speech were circulated in social media. In the videos, the priest is heard saying, “Ministers P K Sekar Babu (Hindu religious and charitable endowments) and T Mano Thangaraj (information technology and Padmanabhapuram MLA) should not forget that they did not get any Hindu votes. They should not forget that their victory was the alms given by Christians and Muslims by casting their votes.” The priest also charged Nagercoil MLA M R Gandhi (BJP) as the prime accused in the 1982 Mandaikadu religious riots that claimed seven lives. He attacked the Prime Minister and Union home minister and went on to say that even BJP and RSS loyalists were ashamed to name their children after those two leaders. Ponnaiah was booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He was also booked under Section 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 143 (punishment for unlawful assembly) of the IPC and Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act for conducting the meeting in violation of Covid-19 norms. On Friday, the priest released a video alleging that his “speech was edited and circulated in the social media. My words were twisted as if I hurt and degraded the sentiments of Hindu brothers and sisters. In case our speech had been that way, I wholeheartedly apologise on behalf of the meeting.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/parish-priest-booked-for-hate-speech-against-pm-hm-and-others/articleshow/84693203.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Internal bickering in Congress after new team announcement||DEHRADUN: Ganesh Godiyal was named Congress state chief and a new team was announced on Thursday night. But, within hours there were signs of discontent. While Dharchula MLA Harish Dhami threatened to quit the party, former minister Nav Prabhat has refused to take charge of the election manifesto. Former state chief and senior party member Kishore Upadhyay, too, was denied any major responsibility for the polls. Later, after senior leaders' intervention, Dhami agreed to the changes. However, Nav Prabhat remained adamant. “I've been in-charge of the election manifesto committee thrice and now if a new team has been finalised, the responsibility for manifesto should go to it,” Prabhat, who was regarded as a frontrunner for the post of state chief, told TOI. A former transport minister in the Harish Rawat government, Prabhat is a prominent Brahmin leader of the region. He mentioned that "last minute changes had been made in the manifesto prepared by me, therefore, the new team and their members should help the manifesto and I have informed about my decision to party seniors.” The naming of a few members in the working president committee and party treasurer apparently did not go well with the two-time Dharchula MLA Dhami. Regarded close to Harish Rawat, Dhami threatened to leave the party as he believed that there were more capable persons within the party to be named for these positions. The new list announced is likely to come as a setback to Kishore Upadhyay, who had to give up his traditional assembly seat in Tehri district to contest from Sahaspur constituency of Dehradun in 2017. The senior Congress member was not given any key charge. Interestingly, barely a few hours before the change in state leadership, Pritam Singh appointed members for different posts in the party. Singh issued appointment letters making them general secretary and secretary in the state unit hours before his removal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/internal-bickering-in-congress-after-new-team-announcement/articleshow/84688456.cms||Kautilya Singh

The step will not only make the offices clutter-free, but also help preserve trees as these papers will be recycled. Saanjh Kendra nodal officer Pragya Jain said, “During my visits to Saanjh Kendras, I noticed papers piled up. As the focus is to digitalise, the record of the work being done at Saanjh Kendras is maintained in computers also. Therefore, I thought of making the offices clutter-free.”“We approached a paper mill in the city to dispose of the papers. The staff of Saanjh Kendras worked for two days and made bundles of the papers. Those were loaded on a truck and sent to the mill. The old records of up to 2016-2017 have been destroyed. The total weight of the papers was 10,510kg. We have also managed to generate a revenue of Rs 1,47,140 which will go to the treasury,” she added. The official said, “These papers will be recycled and this will help in saving trees and the environment.” Additional director general of police (community affairs) Gurpeeet Kaur Deo shared a video of it on her official Twitter handle, appreciating the officer. Deo wrote, “Making offices clutter-free is also an important task, often ignored. Young IPS officer Pragya Jain ADCP Ludhiana’s initiative is commendable and worth emulating by others… 10,000kg of papers were disposed of in an ecofriendly manner.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/10000kg-of-saanjh-kendras-papers-disposed-of/articleshow/84688480.cms||Payal Dhawan

The skywalk proposal was cleared early this year. It will connect Borivali station in the east to Omkareshwar Temple on MG Road. Local residents have opposed the plan saying the skywalk will not only be a waste of money, but will further congest the area. Local BJP MLA Sunil Rane said this skywalk too will be a white elephant. “The existing skywalks in Borivali (east) are in a bad condition and none of them are used by pedestrians. These ghost skywalks have become a haven for drug addicts and hawkers,” he said. TimesViewSeveral skywalks in Mumbai have been declared dilapidated and dismantled. Many of those that are still standing are hardly used by pedestrians. The BMC knows that most skywalks have turned into white elephants. Given the Rs 91 crore cost of the Borivli skywalk, it must rethink and scrap the idea.“The skywalk will be around 1.4 km long and 3.75m wide. To ensure pedestrians use it, we will have two escalators on both sides and six elevators in total. Some changes were made to the design to ensure fewer shops are demolished,” said an official. “We don’t need a skywalk here. The BMC recently came to carry out soil testing. Residents and shopkeepers have opposed the project as it will neither be used nor will it help pedestrians in any way,” said local resident Kaiyum Shaikh. TOI had on Thursday reported that despite several skywalks in Mumbai turning into white elephants, and many being dismantled due to their dilapidated condition, the BMC had plans to build one in Kurla. The move comes soon after the civic body cited financial constraints to put on hold reconstruction of the city’s first skywalk in Bandra (east), which was closed down in 2019 after being declared unsafe. “The BMC must use the money to provide better civic amenities instead of constructing skywalks. It must first repair and upgrade the existing ones. This will be wasteful expenditure at a time when there is shortage of funds,” Rane said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-borivli-residents-pan-bmc-plan-for-rs-91-crore-skywalk/articleshow/84695043.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Nagpur||Witness cannot produce additional documents during trial: Bombay high court||NAGPUR: Can witnesses be allowed to directly submit additional documents, which are not part of the charge-sheet, midway during the sessions court trial? “No”, says the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court. According to the high court, the purpose of filing a charge-sheet after completion of investigation, along with documents on which the prosecution desires to place reliance, would be defeated if witnesses are allowed such a liberty. “A perusal of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) provisions demonstrates there is no provision for a witness to directly produce additional documents during the sessions trial and at the time of recording of his/her evidence,” ruled justice Manish Pitale. While hearing a plea by Bhagyashree Wasankar, through counsels Deven Chauhan and CB Barve, the judge made it clear that it would be a public prosecutor (PP), who makes the strategic call as to which of the witnesses are to be examined or dropped. “It is for the PP to take a call regarding the documents on which reliance is to be placed during the trial and hence all such documents are placed on record along with the charge-sheet and its copies furnished to the accused.” The petitioner, one of the accused in trial pending before the sessions court, faces charges of running ponzi schemes and duping thousands of investors. She has been booked under sections 420, 406, 409, 506 and 120-B of the IPC along with sections 45(1)(a) and 45(s) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act, 1949, Section 24(1) and Section 27 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) Act, 1992. An offence under Section 3 of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) (In Financial Establishments) Act, 1999, has been added later. A witness Ashok Lanjewar sought permission from the sessions court to produce additional documents contending that those were earlier misplaced. The documents included receipts and vouchers of amounts invested with Wasankar Wealth Management Limited. While allowing his application on December 11, 2020, the judge had rejected contentions raised by Wasankar’s lawyers and other accused. The petitioner challenged the decision in the HC contending that the witness’s move was unknown to CrPC and it would be a grave prejudice to all accused if additional documents were allowed to be submitted. Stating that the trial court had failed to appreciate the petitioner’s contentions, justice Pitale said the trial court didn’t take into consideration that permitting such production of additional documents by witnesses would prejudice the accused by depriving them of a fair opportunity to prepare their defence. “The CrPC doesn’t contemplate any procedure for a witness to directly produce documents during the trial. The procedure known to law is through a channel of further investigation under Section 173(8) of CrPC, as held by the Supreme Court,” said the judge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/witness-cant-produce-addl-documents-during-trial-hc/articleshow/84691006.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The seven-kilometre-long roadshow from Gandhi Park to the BJP district office in Rudrapur received a rousing welcome from the locals and BJP functionaries. The CM — a two-time MLA from the Khatima town — was accompanied by cabinet ministers Swami Yarishwaranand, Yashpal Arya, Arvind Pandey, and BJP MLAs from the district. Amid chants of Bharat Mata Ki Jai and Vande Mataram, the CM addressed a gathering where he promised employment opportunities to youths. “We understand that the cancellation of Char Dham Yatra has affected the livelihood of several people and are trying to bring the situation back on track. We will make appointments on vacant positions in government departments and also create other employment opportunities for youths,” the CM said. He added, “The pace of road construction has increased in the state. Soon, the travel time between Delhi and Dehradun would be reduced to just two hours.” CM Dhami also announced plans to construct bypass roads in Udham Singh Nagar. Earlier in the day, CM Dhami was given the guard of honour at the Pantnagar airport. Dhami is expected to conduct a roadshow in the Kichha town on Saturday and then move to his home town Khatima.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cm-dhamis-roadshow-gets-a-rousing-welcome-on-his-first-visit-to-home-district/articleshow/84688477.cms||Aakash Ahuja

To address this, the fire department has launched a fire audit in all hospitals in the district. According to the fire department authorities, nearly half the hospitals they examined in the district were lacking proper fire fighting systems. The first round of the audit conducted two months ago in nearly 70 hospitals found that close to 30 lacked properly functional fire fighting systems. As the next round of this audit, the department will soon be launching a review inspection to check whether they have made necessary changes by updating their equipment. Speaking to TOI, Fire Director (Technical) M Noushad said that under the current circumstances, more volumes of materials are being used in hospitals now. Almost all people are carrying alcohol based hand sanitizers with them and hospitals are stocking medical oxygen in excess to meet any exigencies. Alcohol vapour and oxygen-rich environments are highly vulnerable to a fire outbreak. He added that such inspections were conducted in hospitals in other districts too. So far a total of 400 hospitals were covered out of which almost half of them were identified to be lacking in safety measures. The audit reports were also forwarded to local body offices concerned to ensure that the hospital management complied with the instructions, he said. In addition to these, are other factors such as increased electrical load on life saving electrical equipment, compartments of beds with combustible curtains and frequent sanitation of beds and equipment which may contribute to the quick spread of fire in case of an outbreak. Fire department officials have also advised hospital managements to ensure all emergency fire exits are left clear of any blocks. This is because the officers who visited the hospitals could see stairways and corridors being used to store various materials. “At many hospitals we could even see a lack of sufficient ventilations,” said an officer attached to one of the fire stations in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/fire-dept-launches-safety-audit-at-district-hospitals/articleshow/84688511.cms||Rejith Balakrishnan

A survey going on in all zones will be completed in about a week, but the one in zone C is already through. Recently, an RTI application filed by an activist had revealed that the civic body had given permission for gates in only eight colonies of the city and it had no compiled data about others because no survey has ever been conducted. In zone A, an RWA was given permission and in zone D, seven. The officials are now conducting the survey in the city. In the report submitted by officials of zone C, 27 gates were identified. Assistant town planner Madanjit Bedi said most of the residential colonies fall in zone D, so it was taking time to cover them. “We are also issuing notices and survey data is being compiled. It will take seven to 10 days to complete the report and submit it to the authorities,” he said.As per the Punjab Municipal Corporation Act of 1976, an MC can develop only those streets / roads that are declared as “public streets” and nobody has the right to stop any person from using a “public street” at any given time. The MC general house had in 2014 passed a resolution allowing installation of gates from the security point of view. But some conditions were imposed, as per which all RWAs had to apply for permission after taking consent from residents. The colony will designate three persons to sign an agreement with MC, which will allow gates only in areas recommended by the police department. The association of that area will ensure that gates remain open from 5am to 11pm and when they close, a gatekeeper is deployed for emergency situations. While passing the resolution, the MC house had also said that gates could be installed only at outer roads and not at inner lanes. But in the city, these can be seen in inner streets as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/mc-knocks-at-illegal-gates-in-city-localities-with-notices/articleshow/84688512.cms||---

The results were published in a series of papers in ‘Astronomy & Astrophysics’ by the team, which includes scientists from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST) in Thiruvananthapuram. The data for the survey, which spanned a large part of the Milky Way, was gathered using two powerful radio telescopes: the Karl G Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, USA, and the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope operated by the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, Germany, as part of the GLOSTAR (Global View on Star formation in the Milky Way) project. Nirupam Roy, assistant professor at the Department of Physics, and Rohit Dokara, his former undergraduate student from IISc, as well as Jagadheep D Pandian, associate professor at the Department of Earth & Space Sciences at IIST, Thiruvananthapuram are among the Indian scientists who are part of the project. Previous surveys have detected only about one-third of the expected supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Milky Way (which is nearly 1,000). The GLOSTAR team has now discovered 80 new SNR candidates, with more expected to be identified. They were also able to confirm the presence of 77 previously discovered SNR candidates and reclassify a few that were misidentified. “This is an important step to solve this long-standing mystery of the missing supernova remnants,” says Dokara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/city-astronomers-in-team-studying-star-formation/articleshow/84688525.cms||---

Around five lakh saplings are being planted in the first phase in the district. This scheme was launched by minister for food and civil supplies, R Sakkarapani recently. He said the aim is to enhance green cover of Tamil Nadu by planting trees. Minister for public works department (PWD), E V Velu, who conducted a review meeting in Madurai on Friday, said it is a scheme implemented on a priority basis. Dindigul district collector, S Visakan, said that 1.56 lakh saplings had already been cultivated by the district rural development agency under the MGNREGA Act at a cost of Rs 6.72 crore. “We want to ensure that all trees are grown well by constant monitoring for at least a year, and NGOs in Dindigul have been roped in for the purpose,’’ he said. On Friday, the collector convened a meeting of local industrialists, including owners of spinning mills and sought their corporation to enhance the green cover in the district. “The purpose is that they take ownership of the trees and ensure that they grow,” he said. On Saturday, a meeting of all the local body representatives in Oddanchathram, is to be held for the purpose. A nodal officer has been appointed in the district for this tree planting project, the collector added. Managing director of Anitha Texcot, A Chandrasekharan, said they had joined the programme with an assurance of planting one lakh trees in the district. “We are committed to ensuring that these trees grow well. Five tractors and 10 employees will be dedicated for this cause,” he said. The remaining trees are to be planted in all available government land including temple land parcels for which the district administration has given permission. Meanwhile, facilitator of Dindi Mavanam, Balaji Renga Ramanujam, a group that has planted over 68,000 trees in Dindigul, said they now have about 22,000 well grown trees, in the Dindigul city limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/green-tn-scheme-kicks-off-in-dindigul/articleshow/84693236.cms||---

The arrested has been identified as Lukman Hakim, a resident of Beema Palli. He was caught from Kulathupuzha in Kollam in connection with the theft of an MUV two years ago. The car owner, Rejin of Amaravila, in his complaint had stated that Hakim approached him seeking the vehicle on rental for the purpose of a marriage. The vehicle was handed over at Karamana. But Hakim disappeared with the vehicle. Karamana SHO B Aneesh said that Hakim sold the car to a person in Tamil Nadu who deals with the trade of stolen vehicles. He then abandoned his old phone and SIM card to avoid being traced and got settled in Kulathupuzha. The SHO said that there were strong reasons to suspect that Hakim was part of a bigger gang. Following the arrest, he admitted to smuggling another MUV two years ago from the Museum police station limits using the same modus operandi. Meanwhile, Karamana police received a call from a rental car dealer from Pozhiyoor claiming that he had lost two of his cars through the same modus operandi and Hakim could be involved with the perpetrators of that crime too.  He told the police that he lost a Hyundai i10 and a Hyundai Grand i10 which were rented out by the accused for marriage purposes. Efforts are also on to arrest the buyer of stolen vehicles in Tamil Nadu, he said. Police have booked the accused under relevant sections of theft and cheating. He was produced before the court and was remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/man-suspected-to-be-part-of-vehicle-theft-gang-held/articleshow/84688537.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Western Railway’s heritage tour: Monumental misses||AHMEDABAD: India’s first Unesco World Heritage site — the Walled City of Ahmedabad — has been shunted out from the Western Railway’s latest branded tour called ‘Tejas’. The tour is organized by the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC). The IRCTC’s Ahmedabad Heritage Tour, a package of three nights and four days, covers Akshardham (Gandhinagar), Sabarmati Gandhi Ashram and Kankaria lake (Ahmedabad), Modhera’s Sun Temple, and Rani ki Vav (Patan). The IRCTC has also launched Kevadia with Ahmedabad and Ahmedabad with Ambaji Darshan tours. Officials said that the only Walled City element which is part of an organized package is the Swaminarayan Temple. It is covered by the Dwarka-Somnath tour featuring the Statute of Unity. Other sites in this tour are Adalaj Stepwell, Sabarmati Ashram, Kankaria lake, and Akshardham. This tour also intends to incorporate Modhera Sun temple. So much so, sources said that even in the Ahmedabad-specific package, the IRCTC has not included Sidi Saiyyed Mosque, Jama Masjid, or Swaminarayan Temple. Ahmedabad includes 28 monuments listed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), one monument listed by the state department of archaeology, and 2,696 important buildings protected by the heritage department of the AMC. Not a single monument of the Walled City is included in the tour despite the IRCTC invoking the heritage aspect of the journey. IRCTC officials said that the heritage walk is a significant part of the legacy experience for tourists, spanning the most prominent icons of the Walled City. However, the officials said, the walk cannot be brought into the itinerary since its early morning schedule will not fit in. The Ahmedabad Heritage tour’s description talks in length about Modhera’s Sun Temple and Rani ki Vav. But Ahmedabad’s heritage is glossed over. “Sabarmati Ashram, one of the many residences of Mahatma Gandhi, [exhibits] vivid and historic events of Gandhi’s life,” the description says. “Akshardham Temple [is] a dwelling place for God, and a spiritual and cultural campus dedicated to devotion, education and unification.” The Ahmedabad IRCTC said that Tejas Exclusive Rail tour packages were designed by the Mumbai office. The Mumbai office had apparently said that such packages are to be crafted by local units. But in the end, in the absence of coordination, the Mumbai office appears to have designed the packages with whatever information and insights it had.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/western-railways-heritage-tour-monumental-misses/articleshow/84691082.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
---||Ahmedabad||Accelerate vaccination for children: Gujarat HC||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Friday recommended the government authorities to “accelerate” Covid-19 vaccination even among children below 18 years. At present, the vaccination drive only cover people above the age of 18 years. The high court made 14-odd strong recommendations to avoid the possible third wave of Covid-19. For this, it asked the authorities to procure sufficient stock of vaccines and boost vaccination coverage. It also insisted on door-to-door service for vaccination of the underprivileged, disabled, and aged persons. The high court further said that it apprehends that the possible third wave of Covid-19 may affect the children the most. Hence paediatric care must be pursued vigorously and “the vaccination drive must be accelerated for the children below 18 years”. The high court acknowledged that short-term measures by the central and state authorities “coupled with the vaccination programmes have definitely flattened the curve of Covid-19”. The bench of Justice Bela Trivedi and Justice Bhargav Karia opined that the decline in the number of Covid cases and in the death rate has inspired a hope that the Covid seems to have run its course in the state. The high court further observed, “We all need to gradually limp back to our normal routine. The lessons learnt the hard way from the second wave will have to be put in practice at the individual level and at the State level to combat the third wave, in case it is witnessed.” The high court appreciated the state government’s preparedness plan to deal with the third wave of Covid-19 but refused to delve further in the subject since it is a policy matter. The high court also appreciated efforts by the state government and the Centre in implementing the court’s directions. “…the cordial and collaborative approach of the Central and the State authorities, in the compliance of the directions issued by the court from time to time, have brought very positive results, and to an extent, have brought constructive reforms in the health-related services of the State,” the order reads. The high court has disposed various public interest litigations (PILs) including two suo motu PILs on Covid-19 saying that the extraordinary circumstances required extraordinary measures, but the cases have now reduced considerably.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/accelerate-vaccination-for-children-hc/articleshow/84691068.cms||---

The route will connect Mumbai (Mhatardi in Diva, Thane) and cut through 10 districts to connect Nagpur at Ajni. Officials who arranged an orientation session for land-owners and environment activists from Thane district said the 739km corridor will slash travel time between the state’s financial capital and orange city to barely three hours, from 10-15 hours it takes presently by road or rail. A series of studies, including ones on challenges in land acquisition, ahead of preparing the detailed project report, is being conducted across the districts. An NHSRCL team and few agencies were in Thane on Friday to interact with land-owners and activists. Officials said there would be minimal requirement of land in Thane district as most of the route is at a height of 10-15m above ground level. A rough estimate by officials reveals that 144 hectares land spread over 846 plots is required in Thane district, of which 708 plots spread over 123ha is on private land. Some land-owners at the interaction at the collector’s office on Friday expressed concern, saying the administration must invite more affected people to get a realistic view of the situation, and the project’s implications. The halts may include Shahpur, Ghoti, Nashik, Shirdi, Aurangabad, Jalna, Mehkar, Malegaon, Karanja Lad, Pulgaon, Wardha, Khapri and Ajani. The Mumbai-Ahmedabad HSR route has a station at Mhatardi too. The average speed will be 250kmph, as against a designed speed of 350kmph, officials said; 750 passengers can be ferried per trip. An NHSRCL spokesperson said they were wrapping up the project feasibility studies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/feasibility-study-of-nagpur-rail-project-likely-by-2022/articleshow/84693268.cms||Manoj Badgeri

The GO for this project was passed on February 18, 2011. Corporation has a total of 900 permanent sanitary workers, 1,500 on contract and 700 on a daily wage basis. They live in Subramaniapuram, Melavasal, Puttuthoppu, Simmakkal Colony, Karumbalai Colony, Obula Padithurai Colony and Moolakarai Colony. Only people in Melavasal have got comparatively new houses, while the condition of many of the old houses are in dilapidated condition and are in need of renovation. In 2011, a GO was released for the construction of houses under the slum clearance board for the workers residing in Subramaniapuram, in ward number 87, in the fourth zone of the corporation. Corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan handed over 1.30 acres of land for the construction of houses. Beneficiaries of the scheme said that they were confident that they would be finally getting the houses that were promised 10 years ago. Earlier, the corporation under former commissioner S Visakan, along with the authorities of the slum clearance board had identified the beneficiaries and put up a list a few months ago. However, there were some issues when people who claimed to be beneficiaries also staked claim for the houses. Sources said that the houses would be constructed with a Rs 8.5 lakh grant, which would include Rs 1.5 lakh from the central government and Rs 7 lakh as subsidy from the Tamil Nadu government. With the land being handed over now they would have to prepare a detailed project report and then start the construction. If the land has a rocky ground, the cost of construction would be less and the cost of construction minus the grant, would be what the beneficiaries would have to pay for their houses. Executive president of corporation sanitary workers ssociation, CITU, S Vijayan said that houses was something they had always been demanding. Some of the houses are in very bad condition, now 269 permanent workers would benefit from this new housing project, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/269-new-houses-for-sanitary-workers/articleshow/84693261.cms||---

Raigad, the worst affected district, reported 60 deaths in three landslide incidents, including the worst at Taliye village in Mahad taluka that has claimed 49 lives. Another 47 people were feared trapped under the debris. While rescue teams were delayed in their bid to access the site, villagers claimed they had got no advance alert. However, the government said the villagers had been shifted to safety but had come back.  PM Modi announced Rs 2 lakh for the families of the victims of the Raigad landslips, and Rs 50,000 as compensation tothe injured. The Maharashtra government had sought additional assistance of defence forces to carry out relief and rescue operations in the flood-hit districts. Deputy CM Ajit Pawar spoke to Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and sought the help of defence forces. Home minister Amit Shah also spoke to CM Uddhav Thackeray and assured of all the required help. The CM also announced an ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh for the families of victims of all the 11 landslides since Thursday. Rain and flooding due to raging rivers both began receding in the Konkan districts, especially Ratnagiri and Raigad, but the administration said they will remain on alert. The rescuers’ focus is turning to Satara and Sangli, where an IMD red alert for heavy rain is in place. Satara and Kolhapur reported 13 deaths due to landslides and other rain accidents and 26 people were missing, while nearly 85,000 people have been shifted to safer places, largely from Sangli and Kolhapur, as levels of the Krishna are rising. Eleven passengers had a lucky escape as their bus was almost swept into the swollen Chikotra river in Kolhapur early on Friday when the driver ignored warnings and drove on to a flooded bridge. He has been booked. Ratnagiri district reported 17 deaths, nine due to landslides. The state reported over 11 landslides in 48 hours across five districts.

The driver and conductor, who were asleep in the bus at night, escaped unharmed. “The water level on the road quickly rose to such an extent that the driver couldn’t move the vehicle. The vehicle was trapped and within no time, the water filled it, and reached above the bus,” KTC general manager, Sanjay Ghate said. The driver and bus conductor called up the KTC head office to inform them about the incident. However, the bus was still stuck in the water throughout the day on Friday. KTC cancelled most of its trips to Valpoi, Pernem and Canacona due to heavy rain and prevailing weather conditions. Of the 20 buses that operate on these routes, only three were operational. “It is dangerous to send vehicles in such floods. The drivers couldn’t even manoeuvre the vehicles to take them to the bus stands,” Ghate said. The Valpoi bus stand was reportedly flooded with almost a metre of water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bus-submerged-at-valpoi-ktc-cancels-most-trips/articleshow/84695081.cms||---

While one can’t call it scarcity, officials in various blood banks and coordinators of blood donor groups say that for the first time in several years, the voluntary donations and replacements are almost on par, if not tilting towards the latter. If in the pre-Covid years, more than 80% of the bleeds were from voluntary donations and camps, that arrangement has turned turtle. “We have not been conducting any outdoor camps for donations. People come in and donate. As of now, it is meeting our needs. One of the reasons is that we have postponed our elective surgeries because we are having both Covid and non-Covid treatment,” said Dr Meena Beebi, nodal officer of Ernakulam General Hospital blood bank. She said that the hospital used to get regular donations through camps organized by the NSS students’ wing of more than 10 colleges in the district. It was fixed for certain days in a month and hence the contributions were regular. “Police, auto driver unions and the two major blood donor groups have been donating blood when we send out a request,” Dr Beebi said. There are 26 blood banks in the district with three in the government sector, 22 in private, including hospitals, and a standalone unit of Indian Medical Association (IMA). In the last three months from April to June, the total number of donations were just 14,982. On an average, major blood banks need at least 30 units of blood per day when they get about 7,500-8,000 units per year. This is apart from the blood used by hospitals for surgery from their own storage units. “Hospitals have started transplant surgeries, which had been put off for a long time. When 3-4 transplants, especially like liver, are being done, we must look at additional back-up because this is aside from the usual requirements,” said Jishnu Raj, district coordinator of Blood Donors Kerala-Ernakulam. He said that unlike other districts, Ernakulam has several super-specialty hospitals and people come from far for treatment. “Till now, only IMA and Aluva blood bank were organizing indoor camps. Now, we would like organizations to coordinate with us to conduct camps. If there were doubts about donating between vaccinations , that has been made clear by the national blood transfusion council permitting a person to donate blood 14 days after taking even the first vaccination,” said Jishnu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/voluntary-blood-donation-hit-in-dist/articleshow/84688611.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

---||Thane||Maharashtra: FIR says Param Bir Singh and others kept abducted man in crime branch||THANE: The Thane police on Friday registered a case of extortion and abduction against former city police commissioner Param Bir Singh, a serving deputy police commissioner and three others at Kopri police station. Developer Sanjay Punamia, businessman Sunil Jain, named in this case, were arrested in the Marine Drive case and are in police custody. Manoj Ghotkar’s name had also featured in the first case. The complaint was lodged by Sharad Agrawal, nephew of developer Shyam Sunder Agrawal, the complainant in the Marine Drive case. Both the complaints are on similar lines. According to the complainant, between November 2016 and May 2018, Punmiya, Jain, Ghotkar, Manere and Singh, in connivance with each other, initially “extorted” Rs 2 crore from him. A police officer said the demands were made at Singh’s official residence in Kopri’s Bara Bangla area and Punamiya’s Marine Drive flat. Punmiya and Agrawal were business partners and after the latter’s arrest in the Urban Land Ceiling Regulation (Act) scam, police demanded money for his release, it is alleged. The complainant further said the accused forcibly made him sign documents to grab his land located in Bhayander township, which was in the name of his mother Draupadi Devi. Its market rate was Rs 8 crore, but the accused threatened and made a purchase deed of Rs 1 crore. The complainant further alleged that the accused threatened to book Shyam Sunder Agrawal under MCOCA and grabbed his land in Nashik and Sinnar, a police officer said. Besides, the accused collectively extorted Rs 4.68 crore along with two land parcels of varying sizes. The complainant was “abducted” and kept at a crime branch unit near the commissioner’s office in a bid to pressure him and pay up the money, it is alleged. Singh was police commissioner of Thane during this period. Jaijit Singh, the Thane police commissioner said, “At present, two accused have been arrested by the Mumbai police. Once their police custody gets over, we shall seek their custody for further investigation. If required, we shall call everybody mentioned in the offence registered. The evidence pertaining to the case will be collected as it is just a day that the case is registered. I shall go by the law and there is no pressure.” Singh and Manere were not available for their comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-fir-says-singh-and-others-kept-abducted-man-in-crime-branch/articleshow/84693419.cms||Nishikant Karlikar
---||Hyderabad||40 officers vie for 4 non-cadre IAS posts from Telangana civil services||HYDERABAD: Hectic lobbying is on for non-state civil services (NSCS) to IAS posts in the state with over 40 officers applying for four vacancies. Since it is first NSCS recruitment after Telangana state was formed, many officers are trying to secure the IAS cadre. The aspirants include officers working in the peshis of ministers, those in Raj Bhavan and some heading important corporations. With pressure from ministers, MPs, chief minister’s office (CMO) and other elected representatives mounting, the government has not shortlisted the names till now. Though technically, a committee that will be constituted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) will select the candidates, the state government will short-list the names and recommend them. Officers from the state government will also be part of the UPSC committee. According to sources, some officers working with municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao, finance minister T Harish Rao, Union tourism minister G Kishan Reddy, GHMC, industries, cooperation, municipal administration and marketing departments are in the race for the non-cadre IAS posts. The state government had last filled six vacancies in unified AP in 2013 when about 30 officers were shortlisted. Now, the government is likely to shortlist 20 officers (1:5) for filling up four vacancies. Though there were two vacancies earlier, the government did not fill the vacancies. The general administration department (GAD) had notified four vacancies of non-cadre IAS for 2020 on June 15 this year and asked the departmental heads to recommend the names of officers having a clean record and outstanding ratings in their service by the end of June. The GAD said the officers should not exceed the age of 56, hold a gazetted post, not be a member of state civil services (deputy collector) and should have completed eight years of continued service in the state government. “Officers with adverse remarks in the annual confidential report (ACR) cannot be recommended. No disciplinary cases should be pending against them while sending the proposals and gradings for the last 10 years should be sent along with them and dossier,” the GAD said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/40-officers-vie-for-4-non-cadre-ias-posts-from-t-civil-services/articleshow/84691116.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Mumbai||After Maharashtra govt’s request, defence forces deployed for rescue operation||MUMBAI: With large-scale rain-related tragedies being reported from the state due to very heavy rainfall, the Maharashtra government sought additional assistance of defence forces to carry out relief and rescue operations in the flood-hit districts. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar spoke to Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and sought the help of defence forces. Home minister Amit Shah also spoke to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray regarding the situation in the state and assured of all the required help. Army, Navy and NDRF teams have already been deployed in the state. Maharashtra relief and rehabilitation secretary Aseem Gupta has been appointed as the nodal officer for coordination with the defence ministry. Thackeray, who reviewed the situation from the control room in Mantralaya, said the rainfall in some of the districts is unprecedented. “Our topmost priority at the moment is to ensure that lives are saved. We will carry out site inspections to access the losses once the situation normalizes,” said Vijay Wadettiwar, relief and rehabilitation minister. Thackeray is likely to visit the Chiplun landslide site on Saturday, if the weather is favourable for an aerial survey. A state disaster management cell official told TOI 14 of the total 18 NDRF teams working in the state, 4 of SDRF, 2 each of Coast Guard and the Indian Navy have been deployed for rescue operation in Ratnagiri (Chiplun), Raigad (Mahad) and Satara landslide sites and Kolhapur. He said 8 additional NDRF teams from Odisha will arrive too. As a long-term solution, the state plans a mini-disaster management cell for Konkan region so that the reaction time is much faster and forecast and warnings can be real-time and updated sooner, said Wadettiwar. “As part of the disaster mitigation plan, the state government will undertake several projects like setting up underground electricity wires and a mini-disaster management cell in Konkan.” The state has dispatched food and essentials to affected areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-states-request-defence-forces-deployed-for-rescue-op/articleshow/84687453.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Four of family die in sleep in Govandi house crash||MUMBAI: Four members of a family, including a senior citizen, died in their sleep after their ground-plus-two-storey house at Shivaji Nagar in Govandi crashed early on Friday. Seven other people from a neighbouring structure were injured in the mishap too. The dead include Neha Shaikh (35), Shamshad Shaikh (45), Mokar Shaikh (80) and Farin Shaikh (22). The Shaikhs owned a furniture shop on the ground floor of the structure and they lived upstairs. They had moved in around a year ago. Officials said while Neha and Mokar were declared brought dead at Rajawadi Hospital, Shamshad was brought in, in a critical condition and died a few hours later. Farin’s body was removed from the debris some hours after the crash. Fire brigade officials said they found her body after first spotting her dress under the debris. Meanwhile, four of the seven injured neighbours were admitted to Rajawadi Hospital while three were taken to Sion Hospital. Irfan Khan, a local, said, “The Shaikhs lived in a smaller plot opposite the site of the tragedy and had moved there only around a year ago.” Some other locals said the family had decided to shift to a bigger home due to Farin’s impending marriage. Civic officials said following the tragedy, which occurred around 4.58am on Friday, seven fire engines, one rescue van, one ambulance and two JCB machines were rushed to the site. Officials said the house which collapsed was taller than the maximum height of 14 feet permitted for the category of “tolerated and protected structures”. Senior civic official Mahindra Ubale from the M-East Ward said a notice had been already served to the owners of the property for having extended the height without the requisite permission. “The structure was authorized up to 14 feet. However, the owners had constructed a shed above it and hence we had served them a notice,” said Ubale. BMC officials said they had sent notices to owners of 300 structures in the area, including the house that crashed on Friday.  Civic sources said the residents had done some repair work before shifting into the house and while doing so, they had added a floor. This, said the civic sources, had “overloaded” the structure. “A huge water tank was also placed on the terrace by constructing a room there,” said a civic official. The house was originally constructed some 10 years ago. According to locals, the Shaikh family had celebrated Eid till Thursday with more than a dozen of their relatives who had visited their residence.

It has already identified 400 beds in the city where children can be admitted during a possible third wave of the pandemic, said sources. These include 200 beds in the government hospitals and an equal number in private hospitals. Many experts have predicted that a higher number of children may get infected in the third wave. During the first two waves, the number of cases amongst children was much lower as compared to the adults. “We are taking stock of the total beds available as well as the number of beds available in paediatric ICUs and neonatal ICUs. The data is being collected,” said VMC’s medical officer (health), Dr Devesh Patel. Sources said that 100 ICU beds are also available for paediatric Covid-19 cases. These beds include around 30 with ventilators or BIPAP machines. Around 20 of these are available in government hospitals while the remaining are in private hospitals. Officials said that the ventilators or BIPAP machines used for treating children are different from those used for treatment of adults. A meeting of the Vadodara-based paediatricians was held online in the city. The preparedness of private hospitals was checked during the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vadodara-readies-for-possible-surge-with-eye-on-children/articleshow/84690105.cms||---

---||Delhi||Two businessmen friends killed by aide in northwest Delhi over Rs 20 lakh loan||NEW DELHI: Two businessmen friends were murdered by their associate in northwest Delhi on Thursday night. Surendra Gupta and Amit Goel were residents of Sector 3, Rohini. Police have arrested Gupta's relative, Sandeep Jain, also a businessman, and two of his employees, Sanjay and Sunil, for the killings. Jain had allegedly taken a Rs 20 lakh loan from Gupta, 36, during the Covid-19 lockdown last year. He had partly repaid the dues, but when Gupta became persistent, Jain hatched a plot to kill him, according to the cops. On Thursday night, police were alerted about a body in a Fortuner SUV in Wazirabad. Tracing the car's registration, they reached Gupta's house. The body, which was stuffed in a sack, was identified as that of Goel, 35, son of Gupta’s brother-in-law. The family told the cops that the two had gone to Jain's factory in Wazirpur to collect some money due to Gupta. The cops obtained Jain's number and tracked him down. During questioning, he claimed ignorance about the incident but his contradictory answers nailed him. He finally broke down and told the cops that he and his employees had murdered both the men and that Gupta’s body was in a sack at his factory. Police recovered the body and sent both for autopsy and placed Jain and his two employees under arrest. Jain confessed that his and Gupta’s business relationship had soured after the latter began pressuring him to repay the loan. He claimed he had returned Rs 10 lakh of the borrowed sum, but was irked by Gupta insisting on the repayment of the full amount. On Thursday evening, Gupta received a call from Jain around 7pm asking him to reach the factory around 9pm and take the money. Gupta picked up Goel and they went to the factory. While Goel remained in the car to make some phone calls, Gupta went in. Apparently, an argument broke out between the two businessmen, upon which Jain and his two employees attacked Gupta with rods and knives before slitting his throat. After waiting awhile, Goel went into the factory to check on Gupta. He was also killed to conceal Gupta’s murder. The three assailants stuffed their bodies in sacks and drove the Fortuner with Goel’s body in it. They were planning to get rid of Gupta's body in the early hours, but were busted by the cops. The families, however, remained sceptical of the police claims and suspected a conspiracy and have demanded a thorough probe. Gupta had a chemical warehouse in Bawana and ran a utensils business in Wazirpur, which he started three years ago with Goel. They were referred to as Jai and Veeru in the locality for their close friendship, a neighbour revealed. According to the family, Gupta was married and had two daughters and a son. The godown in Bawana was registered in his son's name. Goel's father, Naresh, said his son too was married but was childless. Goel had called his mother on his cell phone on Thursday night to inform her that he would return late as he was at Jain's factory. He, however, asked to prepare dinner for him. The family later shared the content of this call with police, which helped cops locate the two men to Jain’s factory, helping crack the case in a short time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-bizmen-friends-killed-by-aide-over-rs-20l-loan/articleshow/84691160.cms||---

Maalpekar, who lives in the locality, was out for a stroll when a man walked up to her and asked to know the time. Before she realised it, he had snatched her chain worth Rs 65,000 and fled. The police said that she put up resistance, but sustained minor injuries and her clothes were ripped off. Officials of Shivaji Park police station claimed to have arrested the chain-snatcher after he came to the same spot to target others.

Students can access their results on www.cisce.org or www.results.cisce.org; they can also receive their individual results through SMS on 09248082883. As the exams were cancelled due to the pandemic, students have been evaluated on the basis of their past performance. While a recheck of answer scripts is not applicable this year as students will be awarded imputed marks, a dispute resolution mechanism only for correction of calculation errors has been made available for students. It has to be routed through the school head and the last date is August 1. The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) will review the dispute and convey its decision to the schools. Last year, CISCE did not publish the merit list as a few question papers were cancelled due to the pandemic. The success rate was 99.3%. A total of 2,07,902 students across 2,341 schools in India and abroad had taken the exams last year. This year, with no exams conducted, Class X students have been evaluated on average marks scored in Class IX and X through the academic years 2019-20 and 2020-21, along with projects and practicals of 2021. In case of Class XII students, their performance in Class X, XI and XII has been taken into account.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-icse-isc-results-to-be-announced-online-today/articleshow/84686328.cms||---

Het’s pride in his mother, underlined by his reverence for her, recalls the famous line from the 1975 blockbuster Deewar: “Mere paas maa hai”. Growing up in Bopal, where he lived in a rented house till 2015, Het never went to any coaching institute till he was in Class 11. “My mother always helped me with my studies. She holds a diploma in mechanical engineering,” Het said. “During the early stages of my life, she worked as a tuition teacher to take care of our household and other expenses.” The hard work and persistence paid off. Het was placed in the 97.53rd percentile in CAT and was recently offered admission at IIM-A in the PGP FABM (food and agribusiness management) programme for the 2021-23 batch. As a child, Het often passed by the IIM-A main campus, known for its iconic red-brick buildings. He was always eager to find out what was inside the gates. “I got to know more about the institute by reading books authored by Chetan Bhagat and Rashmi Bansal,” Het said. He got through IIM-A on his second attempt. He completed his Bachelor of Science (Hons) course in horticulture from Anand Agricultural University. He has worked at a private firm as a sales and purchase executive for agricultural commodities. While pursuing his undergraduate course, he visited several farms and food processing units. During his interactions with farmers, he learnt of the critical problem of post-harvest loss. “It seems that due to improper post-harvest management, India loses about 25-30% of harvested horticultural crops,” Het said. “Apart from that, only 2% of the total harvest is processed.” Processing of horticultural crops is important because it adds value to products and farmers can increase their incomes. “I saw the problem of post-harvest loss as an opportunity to help the farmers. But to achieve that I needed to know the basic concepts required for effective management,” Het said. “All this ignited a passion in me to pursue a master’s degree in business administration.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/for-iim-a-student-maa-spells-success/articleshow/84691145.cms||Bharat Yagnik

The school - Infini fly aviation — approached Rajkot airport to start a flying school in the city and allow use of the runway to provide practical training to its students. Wanting to cater to students in Saurashtra, the school sought Rajkot airport authority’s permission to start a training school in Rajkot. Founder Pratik Singal told TOI, “There is a lot of inquiry from interested students in Saurashtra region and to cater to them, we are planning to start a training school here. If we get a green signal we are planning to provide practical training to the students at Rajkot airport. Since, Ahmedabad is an international airport, it has a high flight frequency making it difficult to get a training schedule.” The training school has asked Rajkot airport for space to park a small aircraft for training and some other space too. They can do theoretical training anywhere in the city. Rajkot airport director, Diganta Borah said, “They sought an NOC to start flying school here and also want some space at the airport which we can provide. But first, they will have to get permission of DGCA which may take a few months.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rajkot-may-get-flying-school-of-its-own/articleshow/84690602.cms||---

There will be no water supply from the plant at Opa-Khandepar, which caters to the Ponda and Tiswadi talukas, including the GMC, Goa Dental College and defence establishments. The level of the Khandepar river, on whose bank the treatment plants are situated, rose above 9m, submerging the entire complex. The 33kVA electrical sub-station that electrifies the plants was also hit, forcing the authorities to shut it down. Similarly, the 15MLD Dabose water treatment plant at Sattari stopped operations due to a sudden rise in the Mhadei river. Water also entered the plant and damaged machinery. The PWD has also said that the 15MLD water treatment plant at Pernem has suspended operations due to rise in water levels in the Kalna river.

Sonali of Pudur was doing her BSc (allied health sciences) at Saveetha Medical College and Hospital in Thandalam near Sriperumbudur. Police said she was among 18 students writing their second semester physics exam in a hall on the seventh floor. At 10.20am, an invigilator found Sonali using a cellphone, probably looking for answers, police said. He seized the phone, as rules prohibit students from bringing any electronic gadgets into the exam hall, police said. Sonali was then disallowed from writing the exam and was sent out. She first told the authorities that she was just messaging someone. As it went unheeded, she stood outside the hall for a while and went away. Police said that at around 11am, she took the stairs to reach the third floor from the seventh floor and jumped from the parapet wall. She suffered head injuries and died on the spot. “We are probing whether she was caught two days back in a similar issue and was let off with a warning,” said a police officer. However, her father has lodged a complaint at the Sriperumbudur police station seeking action against those responsible for her death. (Assistance for those having suicidal thoughts is available on Tamil Nadu’s health helpline 104 and Sneha’s suicide prevention helpline 044-24640050).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/caught-with-phone-in-exam-hall-girl-ends-life/articleshow/84693363.cms||---

If well-placed sources are to be believed, a complete runway recarpeting project is on the cards in November this year. Earlier this April, the city airport authorities undertook the runway resurfacing project and the runway remained closed for about eight hours a day for about ten days. “Recarpeting of the entire runway is very much in the offing,” said a source. “This is being undertaken to build a runway which is at par with international standards, keeping future safety and maintenance concerns in mind.” Officials of the Airports Authority of India as well as those from Adani Airports held high-level meetings to discuss the nitty-gritty of the proposed project earlier this month. A formal proposal will soon be sent to the aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). “The runway will have to be closed completely for a few hours during the day so that the resurfacing work can be safely carried out,” said the source. “During this time, no aircraft movement will take place at the city airport.” The movement of flights will be changed during the period of maintenance. “The winter schedule will be announced effective October-end if everything goes as planned,” the source said. The source added that once the project details are finalized, all the airlines concerned will be informed to time their flights in accordance with the maintenance schedule. The first major maintenance project undertaken at the airport after its operations were taken over by Adani Ahmedabad International Airport Limited was the runway maintenance from April 20 to 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/total-runway-recarpeting-at-airport-in-nov/articleshow/84691206.cms||Niyati Parikh

Situated around seven km away from Muvattupuzha, the panchayat got the attention of chief secretary V P Joy during the Covid review meeting on Friday. With health workers feeling the heat from many LSGDs to bring down TPR, Marady panchayat takes a different approach in vaccination procedures and testing to detect cases before it spreads in the society. Despite a small population, the panchayat conducts nearly 1,000 tests per week. The local body resorts to awareness, testing, isolation and vaccination to achieve excellence. Rapid response teams constituted in each ward are also doing their part to identify symptomatic people . “When a person is tested positive we would shift him or her to domiciliary care centre to prevent further spread and allow primary contacts to undergo home quarantine. Besides, we used to conduct RT-PCR test of the person three days prior to vaccination or antigen test at the spot of the vaccination,” said Dr Amarlal, medical officer of the panchayat. The local body also tests all those who step out of their houses to make a livelihood once in a week by giving them a particular time slot for undergoing testing. The population above 18 years old comes to around 13,000 and 90% of them have already been vaccinated at least with the first dose. Panchayat president O P Baby said it was testing and vaccination that helped the panchayat to prevent the spread of the infection in its limit. Currently there are 57 active cases. It has witnessed four Covid deaths and 1,570 total cases so far. During the second save, the panchayat’s TPR went up to 15% and now, the TPR stands below 4%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/marady-panchayat-shows-the-way-in-testing-vax/articleshow/84688653.cms||T C Sreemol

They demanded that all the employees in Telangana Bhavan should be from the new state (Telangana). Of the total 74 employees working on outsourcing basis, only four of them are from Telangana and the remaining from other states mainly north India. All the posts in Telangana Bhavan should be filled up with locals from the state, they demanded. Telangana Students Association of Delhi president Vivek Reddy told TOI that a majority of the people working in Kerala and bhavans of other states in New Delhi are from their respective states. “It is only in Telangana Bhavan that injustice has been meted out to the locals. The purpose for which Telangana state was achieved gets defeated if locals don’t get even outsourcing jobs in Telangana Bhavan, New Delhi,” he said. Former MP Konda Vishweshwar Reddy extended his support to the students. Telangana Bhavan resident commissioner Gaurav Uppal told TOI that the students were under the wrong impression that all the employees were hired after the formation of Telangana State. “These employees working on an outsourcing basis were hired from time to time spread over several years in the past. While a majority of regular employees in the Bhavan are from Telangana, those working on outsourcing basis are mostly from Hindi speaking states,” he said. Gaurav Uppal said they could have been hired over the years because liaising with officials in various departments of Government of India requires Hindi speaking skills too. However, they were sending the representation and demands submitted by the students to the Telangana government to take a decision on the issue, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/students-stage-dharna-want-local-staff-in-t-bhavan/articleshow/84691172.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Goa||Goa: Telecom networks knocked out, emergency helplines down||PANAJI: The heavy rain and floods brought down part of Goa’s telecom network, particularly BSNL. The damage knocked out the 108 emergency ambulance service and disaster helplines, making it difficult for those stranded to get in touch with authorities. Many BSNL users complained that their network, both cellular and landlines, went down around midnight as the floods and rain destroyed telecom infrastructure. GVK-EMRI, which operates the emergency ambulance service, said that the 108 helpline is not functional. Patients and family members have been asked to use 0832-6656969 for emergencies. “Due to heavy rain, the BSNL lines are down and hence 108 can not be connected,” said GVK-EMRI in a public statement. Given that most government offices use BSNL lines, many disaster relief organisations faced difficulties in coordinating with other agencies. TOI tried contacting the North Goa district disaster management control room and the citizen’s helpline, but the numbers were not reachable. “The very incompetent BSNL’s whole network is down. All landlines and mobile phones are not working in and around Vasco da Gama,” said citizen Vishalanand Kambli. Residents also faced 3G and 2G network outage in Margao, Bicholim, Ponda, Valpoi and other places. BSNL put out a post on social media acknowledging the network outage and said that the field units were already working to address the complaints and find a solution. TOI attempted to contact the BSNL general manager for Goa but could not get in touch with him. The other major telecommunications service providers also reported network outages while internet services were also affected in the state. In May, Goa faced a mobile network disruption because of cyclone Tauktae.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/telecom-networks-knocked-out-emergency-helplines-down/articleshow/84693518.cms||Newton Sequeira

All roads around the locality were submerged following incessant rainfall all through Thursday and Friday. For the residents of around 25 houses, it was worse, as flood water entered their homes. Locals, however, said they were not as surprised by the flooding as it is the third year that they are experiencing it. “This has become a recurrent situation now. It is the third year we are suffering. After heavy rainfall when excess water is released from the Tillari reservoir, the water levels in the Chapora rises and we experience flooding. The entire area is left waterlogged. Water has started entering Our houses are made of mud and we are afraid that they may develop cracks due to the yearly flooding,” Vishnu Bhatekar from Bharvan vaddo, Camurlim, said.  Besides Camurlim, Revora, Nadora and Colvale were also affected by the flooding. Camurlim villagers said they had to wade through the water or use makeshift boats to navigate the waterlogged roads.  “The flooding is so bad that it has made it difficult to use the roads. Last year, residents had to be evacuated and had to seek shelter in a nearby temple as the water entered the houses making them unlivable,” said a senior citizen Jayram Bhatekar.  ZP member Kavita Kandolkar, who visited Bharvan waddo, has demanded with the authorities that the residents be relocated.  “The authorities should try and find a solution to this problem, which is recurrent every year. They should try and relocate the people to some other place,” said Kandolkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/flooding-disrupts-life-at-camurlim-water-enters-homes/articleshow/84695118.cms||---

The NGT asked the KRMB to submit its inspection report by August 9. The NGT had earlier directed the KRMB to constitute a committee and visit the RLIS site and submit a report following a complaint that the AP government was going ahead with the project works without seeking clearances. Though the committee was set up in February 2021 by the KRMB, it could not inspect the site. The board alleged that the AP government was not cooperating with it in carrying out an inspection. “The NGT has directed the KRMB to inspect the RLIS site on its own. The Telangana government came forward to provide a helicopter for the KRMB to reach the project site and inspect the site. This was informed to the NGT on Friday,” a senior official of the Telangana irrigation department said. A week ago, KRMB member HK Meena wrote a letter to secretary of water resources department of AP after the Telangana government asked the board to intervene and stop the works of RLIS by the AP government. “To implement the directives of the NGT, Chennai, a team was constituted. It was supposed to visit the site on February 26 to find out if there were any violations. The KRMB had urged AP several times to nominate a nodal officer and facilitate the visit of the team of the project site. AP so far has not facilitated the visit of the team to the project site citing various reasons.” Meena said. Telangana irrigation officials said the NGT order would help get the actual status of RLIS works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ngt-tells-krmb-to-file-report-on-seema-project-by-august-9/articleshow/84691199.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Kochi||Dip in sale of banned tobacco products||Kochi: The sale of banned chewable tobacco products sees a decline during the second wave of the pandemic in Ernakulam excise division as the number of cases under the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) decreased between March and June. Surprisingly, the quantity of contraband seized during this period too saw a huge decrease. Also, the amount of money collected as fine in COTPA cases decreased by more than half over the last four months. According to figures from the excise department, the number of cases has reduced to 301 in June compared to 770 in March. Compared to 218kg and 4,631 packets of banned chewable tobacco products seized in March, only 31.4kg and 179 packets were seized in June. While the fine collected in COTPA cases as punishment amounted to Rs 1.54 lakh in March, it was only Rs 602,00 in June. Excise officials said that it is the first time COTPA cases saw such a decline in the recent times. “The pandemic has led to a steady decline in the illegal business of banned tobacco products in Ernakulam. Though there was a decline during the lockdown last year, it was not that big. We think the demand for the products dipped as thousands of migrant workers, who are the main consumers, went back to their native during the lockdown,” said an excise officer. Many of the old Abkari Act violators have ventured into the sales of banned chewable products as it is a highly lucrative business. The products, which are bought at cheap price from other states, are smuggled into the state to sell them at prices up to 20 or 30 times higher. “The only punishment for COTPA violation is imposition of fine, which is very cheap.

Excise officials said that NDPS cases saw a steady fall since January this year and it continued to fall further during the second wave of the pandemic. However, the quantity of contrabands seized, especially ganja, arrack, wash and ‘arishtam’ during the second wave saw an increase compared to pre-lockdown months. With the lockdown restrictions having relaxed, the cases are starting to pick up as June reported a slight increase in both NDPS and Abkari violations. The month also saw the largest ever seizure of arrack, ‘arishtam’ and wash this year in terms of quantity. Excise officials said that the lockdown during the first wave last year had seen similar decline in the number of cases. They said while stricter restrictions could be one reason; the dip in enforcement activities also might have led to lesser reporting of cases. They said Abkari violator and ganja smugglers have tried to take advantage of pandemic to boost their business. “Though the figures say number of cases declined, it does not mean the demand or use of contrabands decreased. Because the quantity of contrabands seized in lesser number of cases during the second wave is much higher than that seized in the pre-lockdown time, when cases were comparatively high. The increase in quantity of seized items shows that violators have tried to take advantage of the lockdown restrictions and the resultant dip in number of raids or inspections,” said a senior excise source in Ernakulam. Officers also said that the closure of bars and Bevco outlets was a main reason for the rise in illicit arrack brewing. “The demand for arrack is still high and many have now started brewing arrack in small quantities to serve to small parties and functions. Such small-scale players are hard to find unless some of their customers inform us,” said an excise inspector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ndps-cases-see-decline-since-jan-in-ernakulam/articleshow/84688679.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

---||Ahmedabad||Traditional last rites: Parsi body’s plea nixed||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Friday dismissed a petition filed by a religious body of the Parsi community objecting to the authorities mandating the cremation of bodies of members of the community who died from Covid-19. The court observed that fundamental rights to practice religion is subject to public order, morality and health. The Surat Parsi Panchayat Board had sought court directions to authorities to allow them to follow the last rites of their 3,000-year-old religious tradition, Dokhmenashini, or the leaving of bodies at the Tower of Silence. It had challenged the March 15, 2020, guidelines issued by the Centre in which burial and cremation are stipulated as means of disposal of bodies in case of Covid-19 deaths. It was argued that cremation is sacrilegious for Parsis. The bench of Justice Bela Trivedi and Justice Bhargav Karia junked the petition with observation, “The safety and welfare of the state is the supreme law as comprehended in the legal maxim – ‘salus populi suprema lex’. Even the fundamental rights to profess, practice or propagate religion, and the right to manage religious affairs, as enshrined under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India, are subject to public order, morality and health.” The HC said that since the Covid-19 situation has eased and the petitioner could not give details on deaths of Parsis in this pandemic, the issue became an academic one and the HC would not engage itself in deciding it. The HC observed that the issuance of the guidelines in larger public interest for the disposal of dead bodies by cremation or burial could not be said to be violative of any fundamental rights of the Parsis, more particularly when it is not anathematic and sacrilegious to the religious practices being followed by Parsis. “Such guidelines issued in the larger public interest considering extraordinary circumstances prevailing in the country, would take precedence over the individual interest as also over religious faith and belief of a particular class of community,” the court observed. The high court also cited the Supreme Court’s observation in the case related to the Kanwar Yatra in the pandemic situation. It said, “The health of the citizenry of India and their right to “life” are paramount. All other sentiments, albeit religious, are subservient to this most basic fundamental right.” The high court also took into consideration the submission by senior advocate Percy Kavina that for the last 100 years, the means of disposal of dead bodies of Parsis is burial only in places except the belt from Ahmedabad to Bhilad, where Towers of Silence are available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/traditional-last-rites-parsi-bodys-plea-nixed/articleshow/84691234.cms||---

The next hearing in which the report was to be presented was expected to be held soon after the submission, he added. The committee members are concerned over the delay, said Ghanavat. “The committee was supposed to submit its report within two months of the first sitting. The job was done one day before the deadline,” he said. The court direction on the committee speaks of the matter to be listed after eight weeks. The scheduled hearing coincided with the deadline for the committee to submit the report, said Ghanavat. Recommendations of the committee can only be made public when the next hearing is held in the public interest litigation (PIL) which challenged the laws. Ideally, the hearing should also have been held within two months, he said. “The report will be presented before the court in next hearing, which has been not held so far,” said Ghanavat. The entire purpose for forming the committee can fail due to the delay, he added. The delay may also give chance to state governments to enact their own laws on these lines. This may further lead to litigations form the states’ side, said the farmers leader. Maharashtra has already introduced three new bills to counter the Centre’s farm laws. The contents of the report can only be revealed before the court, said Ghanavat. The committee had talked to representatives of various farm organizations to get their views on the central laws. Implementation of the three laws has also been stayed after the PIL was filed. Other members of the committee include Pramod Kumar Joshi, director of South Asia International Food Policy Research Institute and Ashok Gulati, former chairman of committee on agriculture costs and practices. In a nutshell * A PIL has challenged constitutional validity of the three farm laws against which protests are being held * Supreme Court appointed 3-member panel to submit report, after getting views of farmers’ organizations * Committee was asked to submit report in two months of its formation * Report was submitted to the apex court on March 19, a day before the deadline * Recommendations were to be revealed in next hearing, which has been delayed, says Ghanavat||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/panel-report-on-farm-laws-be-made-public-ghanavat/articleshow/84687839.cms||Shishir Arya

In the 5-day remand, the accused continued to mislead the interrogating officials on the unaccounted amount of Rs 16.32 lakh recovered from his possession, saying that it belonged to his father, who had borrowed it around 6 months ago from one Raghevendra Singh of UP for purchasing agriculture land, the ACB official said. He was going to hand over the same money to his father as he could not purchase a suitable land, he stated to ACB. “The accused kept changing his statements on the source and the ACB has taken each of the statement on its record. However, it is certain that the amount was extorted from the farmers,” he said.Now, ACB would hold camps within next few days in opium farming areas of Pratapgarh, Chittorgarh, Baran, Kota, Jhalawar, from where the accused was alleged to have collected the money for approval of quality of farmers’ produce and sanction bigger plot of land for cultivation, he said.

Narasimhulu, a former Telangana TDP leader belong to dalit community, is likely to join the ruling TRS. At a press conference, he said chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is the only true heir of social reformer Dr BR Ambdekar as he lauded the CM’s Dalita Bandhu scheme. In a letter to BJP state chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar, Narasimhulu said his vast political experience was never considered by the party. He said he was also upset that his opinion was not taken before taking former health minister Eatala Rajender into the party. Speculation of Narasimhulu joining the TRS began after he attended an all-party meeting convened by KCR on SC community issues. “I attended the meeting after informing the state party chief. It is surprising that many in the party objected to this,” Narasimhulu said. He gave a call to those who joined the BJP to quit the party. Meanwhile, sensing trouble, Sanjay initiated a dialogue with disgruntled leaders, mainly those who joined the BJP from the TDP. Narasimhulu, Erra Sekhar and Gandra Satyanarayana Rao have all resigned from the party in a span of a week ahead of Huzurabad bypoll. Former minister E Peddi Reddy, who joined the BJP after quitting the TDP, openly questioned the decision of roping in Eatala into the party. Peddi Reddy was upset as he would miss the opportunity to contest the byelection after Eatala had joined the BJP. Till then, he was touted as the BJP candidate from Huzurabad. Sources said senior leaders were pacifying Reddy by telling him that he should consider fighting from Husnabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/motkupalli-quits-bjp-to-join-trs/articleshow/84691289.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Experts attributed possible reasons of the spike to developments such as Fee Regulatory Committee set up by the state government and several court directives for probe. According to a data tabled in Rajya Sabha, in the past five years, SCPCR received 1,663 complaints, out of which 422 or one-fourth of the complaints have been disposed of. Experts said that the commission gets complaints ranging from child labour to underage marriage. “The drop in cases in 2020-21 is not directly linked with Covid-19. Except the months of lockdown when everything was closed, the frequency of children-related cases has remained the same. In fact, several of the cases came to fore after the situation got normal. Awareness about such tools available to the aggrieved is very important,” said a city-based child rights activist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/child-rights-frc-probes-spiked-cases/articleshow/84691292.cms||---

BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said fewer footfalls at public places due to the rains were resulting in fewer tests. Maharashtra too reported just 1.8 lakh Covid tests and the number is expected to drop further over the next few days due to heavy flooding in some of the districts. State health minister Rajesh Tope said that he will soon meet newly appointed Union health minister Mansukh Mandviya to press for more vaccine quota for Maharashtra. Tope said: “Maharashtra has the highest number of cases and vaccine allotment should be done keeping that in mind.

As per their investigation and study, 88% were Delta variant, while no Delta plus variant has been found so far. TOI on Friday spoke to the doctors and authorities to know how the genome sequencing centre at the SMS is facilitating in studying the various variants of the Covid-19. “We have so far examined 240 samples which were also from various other parts of the state. Out of these, 88% of our samples were Delta variant, while no Delta plus have been found so far, “said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College. Elaborating more on various other variants, Bhandari, said, “Out of these, we have found 7 of B.1 variant, one was of Alpha variant, two were Kappa variant, 213 were Delta variant and 17 were no variant of concern.” He added that the genome sequencing centre is presently taking 60 samples per week and in later stage the number of samples per week would be increased. “We are targeting to have genome sequencing of at least 80 samples per week in the coming days with the enhanced infrastructure,” he added.

---||Goa||First time in decades, ryots see high quantum of water||Panaji: It was 60 years ago that Sattari farmer, Ashok Joshi’s father had seen a flash flood that ravaged his fields due to heavy rain. The ongoing weather situation led to a Déjà vu of sorts for him after he found his arecanut plantation inundated in knee-deep water while the palms growing close to the Velsai tributary (connected to River Mhadei) were submerged in two meters of water. “The Mhadei river swells every monsoon and inundates the Sonal village in Sattari one to two times a year. This year, there has been tremendous rain leading to such deep floods, which is alarming. This is the biggest current we have seen in 60 years,” Joshi told TOI. While the farmers there are bound to lose their arecanut crop due to this, soil erosion is threatening to wash away the top soil, further destroying their fertile land. Valpoi-based Nestor Rangel has already experienced this. The freshly planted paddy seeds were washed out along with the soil due to the torrential rain. “In the 14 years that I’ve been farming in Valpoi, I have never seen floods of such magnitude,” he told TOI. Vinod Barve’s banana plantation situated in Bicholim is under the threat of being destroyed due to prolonged inundation, if the water does not recede. “A total of 6000 banana trees in our farm and 6000 arecanut trees that have been intercropped along with them stood fully submerged on Friday. Since the flood water is not stagnant and often brings debris with it, there are chances of the fruits on these trees getting washed off along with the floods,” Barve said. Agricultural areas were affected due to the heavy rain and prevailing weather conditions causing damage to 832 hectares of land across talukas. Preliminary reports show losses pegged at approximately Rs 2.55 cr in Goa in these agricultural areas due to damage to paddy, arecanut and horticulture crops. “It is for the first time that we have seen this quantum of flooding in Valpoi, Bicholim and parts of Ponda. Some places had at least five feet of water. Paddy crops and banana plantations especially will be badly affected but the damage will be less if the water recedes,” agriculture director, Nevil Alphonso said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/first-time-in-decades-ryots-see-high-quantum-of-water/articleshow/84693560.cms||Nida Sayed

The civic body is set to save about Rs 43 crore by these cancellations. About 3,200 city roads, small and big, were awarded to contractors in February 2021, beating the model code of conduct, which kicked in on March 1, 2011. In their hurry to call for and award contracts ahead of the April 2021 elections, the GCC engineers at zonal level had added several roads that were in good condition for works. Recently, corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi had asked all executive engineers and regional deputy commissioners to inspect the roads to find if should be laid afresh. After the two-week inspection, the RDCs of south, north and central regions sent a list of 660 roads, saying they are in good shape and don’t have to be laid. While most of them are interior roads measuring not more than 300-500m, a few were bus route roads. At a meeting scheduled at Ripon Buildings on Saturday, the issue will be discussed and a detailed list of roads, along with reasons why they do not require relaying, will be tabled before the corporation commissioner. On its part, the civic body has also recently issued notices to two project management consultants who were in-charge of quality control of most of these roads, calling upon them to explain why action should not be taken against them as they failed to issue notice to errant contractors who are guilty of laying poor quality road or laid roads over good quality ones. For instance, Kambar Salai in Mogappair that comes in Ambattur and Anna Nagar Fifth Avenue in Anna Nagar have been removed from the list. As per an official, the road was in good condition and required only patch work. Most of the roads tendered out before the polls fell in Valasaravakkam, Perungudi and Sholinganallur zones, and all have been found to be in good condition, said an official. A few of these roads have been identified for laying sewage line or a telecommunication line. These roads were patched up as these agencies pay the civic body money for road restoration. “There is one layer of bitumen still left on these roads, and they would withstand for one more year.

No death was reported due to Covid. State’s overall death toll stands at 8,952. Also, detection of fresh cases from the border districts like Banswara and Udaipur is a concern while Jaipur, too, reported slight increase in daily infections. Till last week, Banswara was not getting any fresh infection, but in the past three days it has seen 3 to 4 fresh infections daily. Likewise, rise in infections in Udaipur and Jaipur have also been reported. Banswara had just one active case till July 20, but now has nine active cases. Rajasthan has its border with Haryana from Alwar, Uttar Pradesh from Dholpur and Bharatpur, Madhya Pradesh from Kota and Jhalawar, Gujarat from Udaipur and Banswara, thus border districts must remain alert. “During the second wave, too, spike in cases were seen from districts like Alwar, Jhalawar, Jalore, Udaipur and Banswara. Authorities in these districts have been asked to remain vigilant,” said an officer with health department. Districts which reported new cases are Jaipur (15), Udaipur (6), Banswara (5), Jodhpur (2), Sriganganagar (2), Ajmer (1), Chittorgarh (1) and Hanumangarh (1). “We have to be careful as many of us are involved in attending marriages and other functions. The way cases are rising in Kerala and Maharashtra is a big concern and people should continue following Covid-appropriate behaviour. I think increase in the cases in these states is an indication of third wave so the next fortnight would be very crucial,” Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College told TOI on Friday.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra probe does not survive after court orders: Param Bir Singh||MUMBAI: Former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh has submitted an affidavit before the state-appointed one-man commission of Justice K U Chandiwal, saying that the purpose of constitution of the committee has ended in view of issues adjudicated by the Bombay high court and Supreme Court and that its continuation “is now merely an attempt to interfere with the investigation being conducted by the CBI.” “Issues raised by the commission have already been adjudicated by the High Court and Supreme Court, as such the present inquiry does not survive,” Singh said in his affidavit filed through his advocate Anukul B Seth. More than a week after Singh alleged in his March 20 letter to the CM that the then home minister Anil Deshmukh had set a “collection” target of Rs 100 crore from bar and restaurant owners, the MVA government had set up a one-man commission of inquiry headed by Justice K U Chandiwal, a former judge of the Bombay high court, to probe into the issues raised by Singh. According to the March 30 notification, the commission was asked to probe if Singh had submitted any evidence to reveal irregularities/offence committed by the minister and whether any commission of offence by the minister or employees working in his office was made out. Seth pointed out that the high court had observed that the allegations contained in Singh’s letter of March 20 were serious in nature. It had said that the allegations had been made against the highest authority of the state government and they could not remain unattended and were “required to be looked into in a manner known to law, when they indicate commission of a cognizable offence.” The HC had said the probe should be entrusted to an independent agency. Further, on April 5, the HC asked the CBI director to initiate a preliminary inquiry into the complaint, conclude the probe within 15 days and after that, the CBI would be at liberty to decide the future course of action. “It is thus clear that the scope entrusted to the commission has already been adjudicated upon by the High Court by its order of April 5. It has been clearly found by the highest judicial forum that an inquiry into the allegations made by Param Bir Singh in his March 20 letter is required by an independent investigating agency. Even the Supreme Court order of April 8 leaves no scope for any doubt, thus nothing survives for being inquired into now by this commission,” Seth submitted. Further, Seth urged the commission to dispense with Singh’s presence before it. He said Singh has been advised surgery and has submitted all relevant documents to the additional chief secretary (home).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-probe-does-not-survive-after-court-orders-says-singh/articleshow/84693628.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar

When probed about the number of vaccination centres that will remain inactive till the rehab work of the affected was over, Patil said, “We are taking stock of the situation. In some districts, normalcy is likely to be restored faster.

Farmers are now expecting bumper production of maize. With standing water in fields, sowing of paddy and bajra has also been initiated. This year, maize has been sown in 28,000 hectares of land in the two districts. The total land under maize cultivation in UP has increased to seven lakh hectare this year. Following abundant rainfall, the agriculture department officials are expecting a crop yield of 45 quintal per hectare. Last year, maize was sown in 20,000 hectares of land in the two districts and the crop yield was around 30 quintals per hectare. Deputy director agriculture KP Singh said, “Heavy rainfall in the last one week came as a blessing for the farmers. Besides maize, the rainfall will be highly beneficial for the bajra and paddy crop in Etah and Kasganj districts." According to the meteorological department records, 160 mm rainfall was recorded in Kasganj and Etah districts in July 2020. However, this year, 230 mm rainfall has occurred in the past one week. Kasganj and Etah districts Etah based farmer Kaushal Kumar said, “My brother and I had sown maize in eight hectare of land in the first week of July. We were worried as no rainfall occurred in the first 15 days of July. But in the last one week, abundant rainfall has taken place. We are hopeful of getting good produce this year. Last year, the crop yield was not good due to low rainfall during the monsoon season.” Kasganj based farmer Santosh Sikarwar said, “This year the sowing of bajra has been delayed due to late monsoon. Thankfully, a lot of rainfall has occurred in the last one week. We are sowing bajra in 10 hectares of land. Now, for the next few weeks, we won't need to worry about irrigation.” Bajra and paddy are major crops of Kasganj and Etah districts. Bajra is sown in 70,000 hectares of land and paddy in 35,000 hectares. Agra district agriculture officer Rampravesh Verma said, “Mild sunshine and rainfall in the last few days will prove to be highly beneficial for the crops in Agra region. We are expecting bumper production of maize, paddy and bajra during this Kharif season. The recent rainfall is also good for the vegetables."

Bujbal, who reviewed the Covid situation with district collector, NMC commissioner, ZP CEO, commissioner of police and superintendent of police along with health officials, observed though decline in active cases was a bit sluggish, the Covid situation was under control. The weekly positivity rate of Nashik district is 2.3% and oxygen bed occupancy is 1.96 % only. Speaking to reporters Bhujbal said, “Considering the situation I have instructed the administration to write to the state government requesting it to allow greater ease of restrictions. Any decision about the ease of restrictions will be taken only after the guidelines and direction by the task force of the state government.” He added, “The district administration is optimistic over the favourable response from the task force. They will write to the task force and seek opinion if shops and establishments could be allowed to run for restricted hours on weekdays. Also if shops and establishments can be allowed to extend their daily business hours by one hour.” Currently, commercial establishments can function from 7 am to 4 pm. And on weekends all non-essential shops and establishments remain close as per the restrictions under Level-3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bhujbal-for-more-relaxation-in-covid-norms/articleshow/84686621.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Goa||Goa: Deforestation intensified floods in Bicholim, Sattari, say experts||KERI: For the third time in the past two decades, large parts of Bicholim and Sattari talukas were submerged in water following intense rainfall. Environmentalists said that failure to protect tree cover in the watershed areas of the tributaries of the Mandovi and Tillari rivers has exposed Bicholim and Sattari to flooding during monsoons. Villagers have also encroached on the floodplains of the rivers to raise horticultural and agricultural crops, which had added to the problem, environmentalists said. “Massive deforestation has been taking place for a quarter of the century in various basins of the Mandovi and the Tillari. This has resulted in increasing sediment load. Also, encroachment carried in the floodplains of the rivers, heavy runoff from mining dumps and stone quarries have worsened the situation,” said Madhu Gaonkar, an environment activist from Khandola. In many villages of Sattari and Bicholim, locals have reclaimed land from the floodplains for cultivation. Also, mining of sand, pebbles and stones have resulted in changing the hydrodynamics of rivers, experts said. In the watershed of the Mhadei, in the rivulets of Kotrachi, Ragado, Zarme, Velus and Nanoda, forest cover has been cleared illegally to carry out cashew plantation. In Virdi in Dodamarg taluka of Maharashtra, across the border, deforestation have been carried out to set up plantations and to accommodate farm houses, leading to soil erosion and siltation in the Valvonti. Stone quarries in Talekhol and Dodamarg have led to increased siltation of Bicholim river. “The havoc caused due to the floods is not only on account of natural factors but various anthropogenic activities,” said Siddhesh Gawas from Shiroli-Sattari. To add to the problem, the water resources department has undertaken work of anti-flooding embankments without understanding vulnerability and ecology of the rivers. These have increased the erosion. Also, work of desiltation has been done through unscientific dredging that has been posing threat to the natural vegetation inside the river, said experts. “During dredging and desiltation, the species of Sherni plants that protect the riverine coarse as well as beds have been degraded. Sherni plays an important role in minimising the destructive role of the floods and in enriching freshwater ecosystems,” Assavari Kulkarni, a botanist from Honda-Sattari. In the watershed of the Tillari, largescale rubber plantations have been undertaken and this has caused soil erosion leading to rapid siltation and affecting the water storage capacity of the river.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/flooding-due-to-absence-of-tree-cover-protection-in-watershed-areas-experts/articleshow/84693664.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar
---||Pune||Disease outbreak fear looms large in over 1,400 villages||Pune: Outbreak of water- and vector-borne diseases looms large in Maharashtra’s 1,426 flood-affected villages in 10 districts, experts involved in the disease surveillance have said. Water-borne diseases like diarrhoea, gastroenteritis, typhoid, leptospirosis and certain types of viral hepatitis (liver swelling) usually start showing in flood-affected areas within a week, following contamination of the drinking water sources, and water purification units develop snags and stop functioning. Besides, puddles left out in the wake of the receding floods provide fitting grounds for mosquitoes to breed and spread diseases like malaria, dengue and chikungunya within 15 days to three weeks. “The major risk factor for outbreaks associated with flooding is the contamination of drinking water facilities, resulting in water-borne diseases like typhoid fever, cholera, leptospirosis and hepatitis A,” state surveillance officer Pradip Awate said. In worst-hit districts like Raigad and Ratnagiri, urban parts like Mahad and Chiplun have been widely affected by floods and subsequent waterlogging. “In addition to contaminating the drinking water sources, there are chances that the floods have also left the purification units in flood-hit districts out of gear. Hence, the priority is to first ensure that citizens living in these villages drink chlorinated water to prevent water-borne diseases,” Awate said. House-to-house distribution of chlorine tablets to purify drinking water and spraying bleaching powder in drinking water sources like wells are being carried out in the affected villages and towns on priority, Awate said. Speaking on the risk of mosquito-borne diseases in the flood-affected areas, internal medicine expert Kapil Borawake said, “Flooding may initially flush out mosquito breeding, but it comes back when the waters recede. The lag time is usually around 3-4 weeks before dengue onset and 6-8 weeks before the onset of a malaria outbreak.” The other outbreak-prone infection which can be transmitted directly from contaminated water is leptospirosis. Its transmission occurs via contact of the skin and mucous membranes with water, damp soil or mud contaminated with rodent urine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/disease-outbreak-fear-looms-large-in-over-1400-villages/articleshow/84693673.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Delhi||2 hold family captive at gunpoint in northeast Delhi, nabbed after shootout||NEW DELHI: Two armed criminals held a family captive at gunpoint after being trapped in their house in northeast Delhi’s Seelampur while escaping from a police team early on Friday. Police had conducted a raid to nab the two wanted men. In a brief exchange of fire, both men were shot in the leg and the victims were rescued by police. The arrested men have been identified as 25-year-old Shahwaj alias Shahbej Qureshi, a resident of Jafrabad, and 25-year-old Arbaj, who was recently released from jail on parole. Two loaded pistols and a magazine were seized from them. The encounter took place at 12.35am after cops raided a house in Nand Ram Mohalla at Brahmpuri in Jafrabad following a tip-off that the two wanted criminals were hiding on the first floor of the building. However, as soon as the police team headed to the first floor, the two criminals ran towards the terrace so that they would not get trapped. DCP (Northeast) Sanjay Kumar Sain said when the police team chased them, the duo jumped onto the terrace of the adjoining building and entered a house. “Our men combed the area and searched all nearby houses. One house was found locked from inside and the owner did not open the gate despite repeated attempts. The cops got suspicious and kept knocking. Soon, the owner of the house opened the gate. He seemed scared and requested the team to save his family. He said that the two men were hiding in his house and holding his family hostage at gunpoint,” added Sain. When Arbaj and Shawaj heard the cops approaching and realised that they were trapped, they opened fire. “They fired three rounds. In retaliation, the police team shot them in their legs. They were overpowered and their weapons were seized. The family members were rescued safely,” said the DCP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-hold-family-captive-at-gunpoint-in-ne-delhi-nabbed-after-shootout/articleshow/84691422.cms||---

The exam, for admissions to undergraduate and postgraduate courses in National Law Universities (NLUs), was being held at nine centres in the state, including three from Mumbai, two from Nagpur and one each in Navi Mumbai, Thane, Amravati and Aurangabad. Parth Agrawal, a student from Solapur, could not reach his centre in Bhandup, Mumbai. “I was supposed to take a train to Mumbai at 11pm on Thursday, but it was rescheduled for 4am. This would have in no way reached Mumbai at 2pm with the heavy rains. The roads were blocked too,” he said. His father said he has lost his attempt this time for no reason. In case of such natural calamity, a second attempt should be given, he added. An official from one of the NLUs said that they had increased the total number centres to 147 this year taking into account the pandemic. The exams were held in 82 cities instead of 67.

After reviewing the presentation, Nitish asked the department officials to promote agricultural produce exports in the state at a faster pace. He said growth in the volume of agricultural produce exports would lead to increase in the income of state farmers. Nitish also asked the officials to organize and develop the agriculture market in a more planned way. “Take all necessary steps to develop infrastructure at all marketing yards,” he said. The CM further said contract farming ecosystem was developing fast in Bihar. “I went to Motihari and observed a contract farming model on potatoes. I was highly impressed by the information provided by the farmers linked to the contract farming,” Nitish said. He also pointed out that his government has taken several initiatives in the area of agriculture education since 2006. “A new agriculture university, a new veterinary university and several agricultural colleges were opened in the state, which increased the attraction towards agriculture education,” Nitish said. The CM also said works were continuously being done in the interest of farmers in Bihar. “So far, we have prepared three agriculture road maps. “Advice and suggestions from a large number of farmers are gathered before preparation of each agriculture road map,” he said. Nitish further pointed out that both production and the productivity of crops have increased in the state. Production of crops like makhana, rice, wheat and maize has increased. “Our main target is to increase the income of farmers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/800-times-jump-in-states-agri-produce-exports-in-last-15-yrs/articleshow/84691465.cms||Madan Kumar

---||Goa||From July 10-23, Goa receive 122% more rain than normal||PANAJI: In the past 14 days — from July 10 to 23 — the state has recorded an average rainfall of 1,047.3mm against a normal of 471mm owing to the increased rainfall activity during this period. This is a departure of 122% from the normal, experts from the India meteorological department (IMD) said. The state’s average rainfall on July 23 was 168cm, which is 28% higher than the normal average. Last year, the departure from normal was 26% on the same date. The state’s seasonal average rainfall till date is 2130mm (213cm). In the past 24 hours, Valpoi recorded the highest rainfall with 29cm followed by other stations like Sanguem (21cm), Quepem (15cm) and Panaji (6cm). Despite the heavy downpour, IMD data revealed that it wasn’t the highest recorded rainfall till date. Prior to this, extreme and intense rainfall was recorded in Valpoi on August 20, 1952 when the highest recorded single day rainfall of 40cm was experienced. Similarly, in Sanguem, 43cm of rainfall was recorded in June 2009. The low pressure area over North West Bay of Bengal has intensified into a well-marked low pressure area resulting in the extremely heavy rainfall at one or two places over Goa. Fishermen are advised not to venture out to sea for 5 days starting from July 23. The prevalence of an offshore trough at mean sea level from Maharashtra coast to north Kerala coast, also contributed to the increase in rainfall. IMD had extended its red alert by another day to July 23, owing to the impact of continued active monsoon. The IMD warned that ghat and hilly areas are likely to receive rainfall exceeding 20cm in 24 hours while parts of Goa are likely to receive very heavy rainfall for three days with scattered and isolated spatial distributions. Fishermen are advised not to venture into sea for five days starting from July 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/from-july-10-23-state-receive-122-more-rain-than-normal/articleshow/84693889.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Most schools waive off entire fees, others give counselling||MEERUT: The phone in Priyanka Yadav’s hand crackled to life. A baritone and soothing voice on the other end suddenly allayed her concerns -- both financial and emotional. With her husband falling prey to Covid-19, she was quite worried about the future of her two children. The caller, a counsellor from her children’s school, told her that the institution will bear the entire cost of their education. Several private schools in Uttar Pradesh have waived off the entire or a big chunk of fees of students who have lost both or either of the parents to Covid-19. “This is the least we can do,” the owner of a prominent school in Lucknow said. The schools are also providing counselling sessions to such students and also to their family members to help them cope with the tragic loss. It comes even as most of the schools are reeling under financial crisis as families are finding it difficult to pay fees for their children. Meerut’s MPS Group of Schools, which has strength of 10,000 students in various branches, has decided to waive off full fees of the students who have lost any of their parents due to Covid-19. “We have already waived off full fees of 25 students for the ongoing academic year,” said Vikram Singh from MPS school. Priyanka is one of the beneficiaries. She lost all her savings in the treatment of her husband, Devendra Kumar, a government teacher. He died battling Covid-19 in May this year. “The MPS group has waived off the entire fees of my children, one three and other eight-year-old. I had no money to pay for their education,” said Priyanka, who is hopeful that she may land a government job on compassionate ground. Shimona Jain, officiating principal of St John’s Senior Secondary School in Meerut Cantonment, who has lost her mother to Covid-19, has also waived off fees of five students for the ongoing academic year. She has given a concession of 50% in fees to families where fathers of the children died in a pandemic but mothers are working. Sushmita Kanungo, principal of Maharishi Patanjali Vidya Mandir, Prayagraj has also waived off the entire fees of five students who lost single or both parents to Covid-19. “We are planning to continue with the same initiative in the coming years as well,” she added. Pushpalata Agarwal, founder of St Joseph Group of Institutions, in Lucknow has gone a little further. She has given financial assistance to children who lost both their parents to Covid-19. The group has seven schools in Lucknow. “We are giving financial assistance to five of our students who lost both parents to Covid-19. We will give these students free education till Class 12th apart from free books and stationery. In eight other cases, where students have lost one parent, we have waived off 50% fees,” said Anil Agarwal, Managing director of St Joseph School. Dr SP Singh, founder manager of LPS Group of Schools, which has branches in Delhi, Sitapur, Lakhimpur, Lucknow and in some other cities, has waived off 50 to 60% fees of 50 students in 12 branches. The school is also organising counselling sessions for such students who are under-going any kind of mental trauma after death in the family. In another unique initiative, Ved International School in Meerut has decided to give 40 to 60% discounts in fees, depending upon the Class, to students whose both parents are vaccinated. “The aim of this initiative is to motivate people for vaccination,” said Ajit Singh from Ved international.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/schools-in-up-do-their-bit-to-help-kids-coping-with-loss-most-waive-off-entire-fees-others-give-counselling/articleshow/84686680.cms||Ishita Mishra

Amid allegations and counter-allegations made by Delhi and Haryana accusing each other for the water crisis, the Supreme Court said there was no need for the court to interfere and asked Delhi government to negotiate with its neighbouring state. A bench of justices L Nageswara Rao, A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian also raised objection over Delhi government rushing to the court to file the contempt petition. Pressing for contempt, senior advocate Vikas Singh contended that the apex court had directed that water level at Wazirabad reservoir be maintained at full capacity to serve the drinking water needs of the national capital, which Haryana was not complying with. He said the water was used for drinking purposes in Delhi and should be given priority over water used for agriculture in Haryana. DJB had alleged that the Wazirabad reservoir was only 31% full. Countering the allegation of Delhi, senior advocate Shyam Divan for Haryana said more than 1,000 cusecs of water, and sometimes even more, is being released consistently and filing the contempt petition was abuse of process of law. He said huge water infrastructure had come up in Delhi after the 1996 verdict and three additional water treatment plants had been set up. Haryana contended that transmission of water was not only through the Yamuna, and a pipeline allowed Delhi to take water even before the Yamuna water reaching the Wazirabad reservoir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-rejects-plea-on-water-tells-delhi-to-talk-with-haryana/articleshow/84688968.cms||---

These hospitals are keen to be part of the vaccination drive so that greater number of beneficiaries can get the vaccine and also ease the pressure on government vaccination centres. But they are not being made vaccines available even through the private pharma agencies. Owner of one such private hospital in Sinnar, Dr Mahesh Khairnar, said his hospital has been getting queries from many beneficiaries about the availability of the vaccine on a daily basis. “We contacted both the vaccine producers with our orders through the respective modes and fulfilling all the conditions. Naturally we are ready to make payments as well. But the problem is that we were told that we could get the vaccine from the local pharma agencies,” he said.

---||Chandigarh||HC notice to Haryana chief secretary, DGP after minor allege shoddy rape probe||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday issued notice to the chief secretary of Haryana, DGP and Ambala SP on a plea filed by a minor rape survivor who is seeking the constitution of a special investigation team (SIT) to probe her complaint. Directions have also been sought to probe the role of personnel at the women’s police station in Naraingarh, including the SHO, for alleged attempts to protect the accused men. According to the petitioner, she was raped by the accused several times and even forced to abort her pregnancy, but the women’s police station had not mentioned the facts given by her in her complaint to reduce the gravity of the charges and to save the accused. Petitioner submitted that although the SHO had been booked for her role in the case, the entire matter needed to be probed by SIT. Her main grouse was that during the investigation of the case, she was threatened and pressured by police officials of women police station in Naraingarh. She was even forced to change her statement, but she did not, it has been submitted. When police officials failed to convince the petitioner to change her statement, they forged the signature of the petitioner on a falsed complaint and even lodged an FIR with different facts, it has been claimed. The matter was enquired by a senior police officer and only thereafter an FIR was lodged against the official. In her plea before the HC, she sought directions to constitute SIT comprising officers not below the rank of deputy superintendent of police (DSP) under the direct supervision of a senior police officer to investigate FIR No. 14 registered on June 27 under Section 6 of POCSO Act at women police station, Naraingarh, Ambala and to investigate FIR No 246 dated July 9, 2021, registered under sections 166-A, 167, 201 and 218 IPC by the same SIT being the part and in continuance of the same transaction of the FIR and also with the motive to abet the offence described in FIR in the fair and expedite manner. After hearing the plea, Justice Arun Monga of the HC has issued notice to state authorities seeking reply on petitioner’s contentions by September 2. In her petition, the rape survivor stated she moved a complaint through e-mail to Ambala SP, Naraingarh DSP, and SHOs of women police station in Naraingarh and police station in Naraingarh on June 26. The complainant alleged that one Navneet, a resident of Naraingarh, had been raping her regularly for two years, from the time she was studying in Class X. She also gave details of places where she was being raped by the accused. Complainant got pregnant four times during this period and every time her pregnancy was terminated, she claimed. She alleged that police officials, in the FIR dated June 27, did not mention all facts, as stated in the original complaint, to save the accused. Even the SHO had not conducted her ultrasound and medical examination from a senior gynaecologist, as suggested by the medical officer. It was only on the intervention of the local court her proper medical examination was conducted, she said. According to the complainant, her statement under section 164 of the CrPc has also been recorded before the magistrate at Naraingarh court and in her statement she had deposed all the facts before the local judge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-notice-to-haryana-chief-secy-dgp-after-minor-allege-shoddy-rape-probe/articleshow/84691458.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Shutki becomes recipe for intolerance debate||KOLKATA: Sharing a Bengali hot-garlic dried fish recipe on a popular YouTube channel has opened a culinary intolerance debate in Kolkata. Two years after the Kolkata beef festival’s name had to be changed following threats, a popular food blogger was recently forced to delete at least 50 vile comments for sharing a harmless ‘shutki machh bata’ recipe. Saptarshi Chakraborty, who along with Insiya Poonawalla, runs the Bong Eats channel on YouTube, had earlier been subjected to “hate comments on beef recipes”. But he was surprised with the spiteful comments that a shutki recipe could throw up. “I have had to delete at least 50 vile comments in the past one week. It was a reality check in some ways—shocking, yet strangely familiar,” Chakraborty posted. Such instances of micro-aggressions are not new in Bengal. Poet Subodh Sarkar, who in 2015 had participated at a token beef party to protest against the controversy over the death of Mohammad Akhlaq, believed the rhetoric of hatred was getting more aggressive. “It’s alarming to see vile comments for sharing recipes of beef and shutki machh. This is dangerous for free-thinkers to see this rise of fascist forces who are objecting to anything that doesn’t suit their agenda,” Sarkar said. Arjun Kar, who has an event management firm that conceived the idea of the Kolkata Beef Festival in 2019, said he had to change its name twice because of protests. “First, we called it the Kolkata Beep Festival and then, Little Zakaria. We have had six editions of the festival. Every time I was abused online, I sent back music and made light of the situation. Now, anything random becomes an issue,” Kar said. Food blogger Poorna Banerjee has faced multiple occasions of “bias” and even been made to feel like an “untouchable” for her culinary choices. In 2012, she got rape threats for promoting beef delicacies served at Baruipur’s Asma hotel. In 2016, she had lodged a cyber complaint when someone threatened her with acid attack “for being a beef khanewali”. “A month ago, we had a clubhouse debate over rice and wheat. Out of nowhere, a boy accused me of being a ‘Bangal who is kangal (penniless)’ and hence can afford rice and not wheat,” Banerjee said. Prasanta Ray, Professor Emeritus, sociology, Presidency University, said food was an important marker of group identity. According to him, there are many small indicators that “coalesce together” to express the “antipathy towards outsiders/strangers” deriving their sustenance from here. “One ethnic community of Bengalis, who are territorially placed differently, have this strong antipathy. Both in cinema and conversation, the divide between Ghati and Bangal has often been underlined. But the shukti machh debate is just a trigger or a case in point. The main point is a prejudice towards the outgroup,” he said. Expecting people to get rid of prejudices is not always realistic. “From time to time, they hibernate and resurge,” Ray said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shutki-becomes-recipe-for-intolerance-debate/articleshow/84691596.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Raising the issue while seeking a leave for adjournment motion, MLA Shafi Parambil said that the matter is very serious as several people have been duped by a group of bank officials and director board members, to swindle more than Rs 100 crore. Opposition leader V D Satheesan said that ever since the fraud came out in 2018, the probe was conducted at the party level, and the government has taken action to dissolve the administrative board of the bank only now, after the media reported the matter. He said that even when the CPM area and district committees and former MP P Biju probed the matter, they all had become aware of the huge financial fraud running into crores of rupees on which no action was taken. Is swindling public money a party affair, Satheesan asked. He said that the bank’s fraud is not limited to what has already come out but runs into more than Rs 350 crore, and a recommendation for a vigilance probe is with the government on which no action has been taken yet. At the same time, in another case of an UDF-controlled cooperative bank, a probe was undertaken and after finding that there was a mismatch of Rs 2lakh, the bank administrative committee was instantly dissolved; this clearly shows the government attitude towards the fraudsters in own party, Satheesan said. Cooperation and registration minister V N Vasavan said that the government has taken all necessary steps in the matter, including civil, criminal and departmental action. He said that cases have been registered against five bank officials, including bank secretary T R Sunil, manager Biju Kareem and senior accountant Jils C K, and they have been suspended from service. He said that irregularities to the tune of Rs 104.37 crore have been found, and the case has been handed over to the crime branch and is now being probed by the Thrissur unit of the agency. He said that the government has nothing to hide, and there are certain procedures for dissolving the bank administrative committee, and they are being processed. The opposition staged a walkout after speaker M B Rajesh refused to permit the adjournment motion on the basis of the explanation by the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/karuvannur-cooperative-bank-scam-rocks-assembly/articleshow/84689031.cms||---

The clash erupted late Thursday night and continued till the early hours of Friday. Matters got worse after an idol was vandalized in a nearby temple. Police from several police stations had to be rushed to the spot as the Kashyaps allegedly threw stones at the teams initially sent from Charthawal police station. Police used force to disperse the mob. On Friday evening, Union minister and MP from Muzaffarnagar Sanjeev Balyan visited the village and met members of both groups. He said, “The matter will be soon be sorted out and whosoever has vandalized the idol will be identified, and action taken against him.” According to sources, the two groups have been at loggerheads over the plot for years. On Thursday night, the Kashyaps allegedly started building a wall on the disputed land and this led to a clash with the Dalits. After a police team from Charthawal police station rushed to the spot, the Kashyaps allegedly pelted stones at it, forcing the policemen to retreat. Another team, led by the SHO of Charthawal police station, also had to turn back. After getting information about the clash, Abhishek Yadav, the senior superintendent of police, along with a heavy police force rushed to spot and controlled the situation. Later, based on a complaint filed by a sub-inspector at Charthawal police station, a case under various IPC sections, including section 307 (attempt to murder) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), was registered against 27 named and several unidentified persons for allegedly pelting stones at policemen. So far, several suspects have been detained for questioning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/force-deployed-at-mngr-village-after-dalits-kashyaps-clash-over-land/articleshow/84686719.cms||Mohd Dilshad

The MIDC is also planning to set a deadline for cent per cent vaccination in industries. For essential industries as well as those units employing more than 500 employees, the MIDC has asked if 100% vaccination is possible by the first week of August. For industries employing between 200 to 500 employees, the MIDC has asked if 100% vaccination can be carried out by August 15, while for industries employing between 50 to 200 employees, MIDC wants to check if 100% vaccination can be done by August-end. The authorities have also been asked to check if larger industrial houses can take responsibility for ensuring vaccination of MSMEs in their vicinity. Though the bodies and organizations representing industrial houses have welcome the move, they have cited inadequate supply of vaccine by the central government and expressed apprehensions on meeting the given deadlines. In case of emergency, wherein positivity rate exceeds 5%, essential industries should also operate through bio-bubble.  When contacted, MIDC regional officer Rajesh Joshi said, “The MIDC is coordinating between the health department, state government and the industrial bodies to ensure cent per cent vaccination of all the industrial staffers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/future-restrictions-to-be-based-on-vax-percentage-midc/articleshow/84686681.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Nearly 100 people were evacuated from their homes to higher grounds as all tributaries of River Mhadei breached their banks in the early hours of Friday. Several villages were submerged in the taluka, and locals stuck in their houses in areas like Padeli were rescued and evacuated using ropes by disaster management personnel. As the river began swelling, the bridge at Paikul was washed away, cutting off access for several villagers. Roads caved in at Kelawade and Sawantwada-Keri. Leonard Fernandes, a resident of Valpoi, said that his house was submerged in water in the early hours of Friday and later the entire house collapsed. “No one came to rescue us and with the help of neighbours, we managed to come out of the water,” Fernandes said. A woman from Massordem said that during the wee hours, water started entering her house and gradually the entire house was submerged in water. “All the clothes, utensils and books of my children were washed away in the water,” she said. Councillor of Valpoi municipal council Vinod Haldankar said that two houses in his ward belonging to Vincent D’Souza and Robert Fernandes collapsed. “The scene is horrible in Sattari. The disaster management team must help all those affected. It is a very serious and risky situation,” said chairperson of Valpoi Municipal Council, Shaizin Shaikh. Velus, Sonal, Sanvordem, Padeli, Bhironda and Advoi villages in Sattari were completely submerged in water. Disaster management officials said that the overflowing rivers had led to the flooding in areas along the banks. However, no casualties have been reported. Sonal village was completely submerged in water. It has been a regular affair for the villagers who find themselves stuck in their locality every year as the roads in the village go under water. “We have demanded with the government earlier to correct the height of the roads, as Sonal is situated in a low-lying area due to which water get accumulated on roads, but our demands were never fulfilled,” a resident said. Traffic movement on the Valpoi-Ponda road was hit as the Savorshe-Khadki bridge was submerged due to the Mhadei overflowing. Plantations of several villagers across Sattari were left destroyed in the flood. A businessman from Valpoi, Kapil Teli, said that his godown and trucks loaded with cement were completely submerged in water and he claimed loss of Rs 20 lakh. “If there was a retaining wall constructed for the river then this situation would not have arisen,” Teli said. The house of VMC councillor Vassiyudin Sayed was damaged due to the flood. Panch of Bhironda panchayat Udaysingh Rane said that houses of the Sawaikar family at Bhatwadi-Advoi have collapsedand the family have suffered major loss. “I request health minister Vishwajit Rane to look into the matter as there is no other home where this family can stay,” Udaysingh said. Valpoi resident Mashruf Shah said that many cattles were washed away in the water. “Youth from Valpoi and Nanus risked their lives and managed to save one cattle which was trapped in the water,” Shah said. Ramdas Gaonkar, from Velus, said that 13 people reside in his house and suddenly at 4 am water started entering the house, sending the family panicking. “Sofa, refrigerator, cupboards were damaged and few things were even washed away in the flood,” she said. She said that no government officials came to rescue them. An elderly woman Gokde Gaonkar from Kudshe said that her house was submerged in the water and she has suffered a major loss. “I had also suffered similar loss during the last flood and government had assured to help, but till date the government has not given me compensation or any assistance” Gaonkar said. Four houses belonging to Mahajan community at Shivaji nagar Khadki completely collapsed. Most of the villagers have retaining walls constructed on river banks could have prevented the flooding, but their pleas over it in the past have gone unheard. North Goa collector IAS Ajit Roy visited Valpoi and took stock of the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/houses-collapse-bridges-washed-away-in-sattari/articleshow/84693713.cms||Afaq Khan

The work has been taken up by 88-year-old Vedkumar Vedalankar, a prominent Hindi author from Osmanabad, having the credit of penning around two dozen books. The senior author, currently residing in an Omerga-based Asharam, has already completed translating over 4,000 of the 9,000 verses and expects to complete the work within a few months. Vedalankar began the daunting task of translating Dnyaneshwari, which is revered by Varkari community members, after he realised that some of the greatest works in Marathi language have remained limited only to Marathi readers. When contacted, Vedalankar said, “Despite translating 40 books into Hindi, the work of translating Dnyaneshwari is not only challenging, but also giving me joy. Dnyaneshwari is basically part of contemplation and makes you think the depth of the thought involved in penning it way back in 12th century.” After retiring as principal from Ramakrishna Paramahansa College, Vedalankar has immensely contributed in the field of translating literature into Hindi and Marathi. Vedalankar, who did his higher education from Benaras Hindu University, is known for his command over Hindi, Sanskrit and Marathi languages. His translation of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule’s Akhanda is being published by the state. His work also includes translation of 650 abhangas of nine saints, including Sant Gora Kumbhar, Sant Chokha Mela.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/dnyaneshwari-being-translated-into-hindi/articleshow/84686759.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Delhi||Illegal farmhouses in Khori village shouldn’t be spared: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday ordered the Faridabad Municipal Corporation not to spare illegal farmhouses, commercial establishments including hotels and religious structures in the Aravali forest area during the ongoing drive to remove all encroachments including settlements in and around Khori village area. Faridabad Municipal Corporation (FMC) through additional advocate general Arun Bhardwaj informed a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari that the six week deadline given by the SC on June 7 to complete removal of all illegal structures in the forest land has proceeded smoothly and 75 acres of the 150 acres of encroached forest land has been vacated of all encroachments. However, he said that the six week deadline is required to be extended because of the peculiar nature of the task and the complexities involved. The bench agreed to give four more weeks to the FMC to complete the task. At this juncture, senior advocate Colin Gonsalves drew the court’s attention to RTI information obtained by IAS officer Ashok Khemka relating to the existence of a large number of farm houses, commercial establishments including hotels and religious structures inside the forest land around Khori village. “The eviction law should apply equally to the poor and rich and an impression should not go to the public that while the poor settlers were evicted, the rich continue to live in luxurious farmhouses,” he said. The bench said that the order applied with equal rigour to all kinds of encroachments on the forest land. "Needless to observe that order for removal of all unauthorised structures will apply to all illegal structures without exception, including the structures already identified by the Haryana forest minister Kanwar Pal. It (removal) shall be done within the extended time (of four weeks),” the bench said. Importantly, the court allowed the Khori village residents to give representation for modifications in the draft Rehabilitation Policy 2021 framed by the FMC. The earlier rehabilitation policy had fixed 2003 as the cutoff date for the Khori village residents to claim rehabilitation relief by the government. The past policy envisaged that those who had proof of residence in Khori village prior to 2003 would be entitled to alternative accommodation. The SC asked the FMC to consider the representation of the villagers on modifications in the 2021 rehabilitation policy within seven days and notify the finalised policy by July 31 so as to enable the villagers to challenge, if need be, the validity of the new policy before the apex court. Appearing for few other Khori villagers, senior advocate Sanjay Parikh complained to the court that though the houses are getting demolished, the FMC was not providing the affected with temporary shelters even during the monsoon period causing a lot of hardship to a large number of people. FMC counsel said the corporation was providing them with temporary shelters and amenities. SC allowed the residents to approach the commissioner of FMC with complaints and asked the authorities to give reasons in every case where the temporary shelter and other facilities are not being extended to the evicted people. However, the bench said it would not be feasible for the FMC to give advance notice of eviction to the villagers after FMC counsel pointed out that the area is sensitive and untoward incidents could happen if a specific date for demolition drive in a particular area was notified. “Each and every villager, whose house is on forest land, has been told repeatedly since the SC passed the order on June 7 that they would be evicted. Every villager knows that they would be evicted. Additional notice would not be required to be given,” Bhardwaj said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-illegal-farmhouses-shouldnt-be-spared/articleshow/84698273.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||Hyderabad||60% people in Telangana have antibodies, vaccine effective: Union minister||HYDERABAD: The Indian Council of Medical Research’s serosurvey taken up in three districts of Telangana has revealed that over 60% of the population have antibodies against Covid-19. The sero study found that among those who were not vaccinated at all, the seropositivity was low at 51.3%. Among those who received one dose of vaccination, it was 78.5% and it was 94% among those who got both the shots. Minister of state for health and family welfare Bharati Pravin Pawar informed Lok Sabha on Friday that overall in the country in the fourth round of serosurveillance conducted from June 14 to July 6, 67.6% have antibodies. Bharathi Pawar said: “The survey was conducted in 70 districts from 20 states, including three each in Telangana and AP, and one Union territory. Metropolitan cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad have reported seroprevalence ranging between 17.6% and 56% at different times.” The seroprevalence at the national level went up from 24% in December 2020 to 67.6% in June 2021. In Telangana, it went up from 24.1% to 60.1% during the same period, she said. The National Institution of Nutrition conducted a survey in Jangaon, Nalgonda and Kamareddy districts in association with the Telangana health department. In the fourth phase of survey, six to nine-year-old children were included. About 55% of children were found to be seropositive, while 61 per cent of adults had Covid-19 antibodies in Telangana. Among health care workers, 82.4% had seropositivity rate. In AP, the sero survey was done in Vizianagaram, Nellore and Krishna districts. Dr A Laxmaiah, head of public health division, ICMR-NIN and nodal officer for study in Telangana, said: “Near 100% seropositvity among those vaccinated clearly indicates that vaccines are effective. This should remove any vaccine hesitancy and encourage people to get vaccinated as early as possible.” The ICMR strategy has been to do repeat cross-sectional serostudies in the same geographic locations so that the infection transmission trends could be documented and studied. NIN director Dr R Hemalatha said: “Although over 60% people have antibodies, over 40% of population is still susceptible. This is not the time to lower our guard. All non-pharmacological Covid-19 measures like wearing masks, hand sanitisation and physical distancing should be continued.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/union-min-60-people-in-t-have-antibodies-vax-effective/articleshow/84691499.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Children, if infected, generally remain asymptomatic or exhibit mild symptoms and do not get the severe disease,” Union minister of health Mansukh Mandaviya said in reply to a question by Kadapa MP YS Avinash Reddy in the Lok Sabha on Friday. He said, “Multiple waves have been noticed across the world during pandemics, including Covid-19. The wave may occur either due to mutations in the virus or due to the available pool of susceptible population, which in turn is also dependent on various pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions for management of the pandemic.” The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned that the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 has shown higher transmissibility than other mutant variants of concern (VOC) identified to date. “The public health approach and clinical management protocol for Delta variant is the same. Five-fold approach of test, track, treat, vaccinate and adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour remains the strategy for containment,” the health minister said.

The Panipat office has shared the details with HPSCB headquarters at Panchkula. HPSCB can go ahead with the sealing only after getting a nod from its Chairman, who is yet to be appointed. Board member secretary S Naranayan said the process has begun and soon the regional office will be informed about final orders. A team from the office of regional officer, Panipat identified these dyeing units during the surveys carried out by the board during June and July and got the videography of the units done while releasing the poisonous smoke in the air. Regional officer Kamaljeet Singh himself led the team which conducted the videography and gathered other details. Afterwards, the show-cause notice for closure of units were issued. “It was only after the expiry of seven day of notice period that we had approached the headquarters for further action. The chairman is competent authority to issue sealing orders and the deputy commissioner has also been urged to ensure required assistance like police arrangements, snapping of electricity and water connections,” said Kamaljeet. Officials said these units were not only accused of using prohibited fuel, but were also accused of disposing of the effluents into sewerage and ground. As a result, there had been incidents where people of localities had complained of getting coloured water with odour through water pumps. Notably, Panipat, which has 20,000 industrial units, is ranked 11th in the list of polluted industrial townships in the country. According to the board, the district only has 25 units which fall under the green category. While 370 industries have been added in the red category, 222 fall in the orange category for the purpose of corrective actions. For the past 10 years, the polluting industries have been slapped with penalties like compensation fines as well as criminal prosecutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hspcb-starts-sealing-process-against-20-dyeing-units-in-panipat/articleshow/84691562.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Coimbatore||Child marriages spike during pandemic in Krishnagiri district||KRISHNAGIRI: The Childline has seen an 82% spike in calls reporting child marriages in the district during April 2020-March 2021, compared to the same period in 2019-2020, indicating a rise in the incidence of minor girls getting married off when the schools were closed because of the pandemic. As per the data available with Childline, its helpline had received 327 calls reporting child marriages from April 2020 to March 2021, compared to 179 calls in 2019-2020. It has stopped 279 marriages during April 2020-March 2021 and 117 in 2019-2020. C N Prasanna Kumari, Childline coordinator, Krishnagiri district, said lack of fear of punishment among the parents was the main reason for the child marriages. According to a social welfare officer at the district collectorate, a team of officials would visit the child’s house and stop the marriage upon receiving information on impending marriage of a minor. Subsequently, the child’s parents would be made to sign a statement that they would not marry off their daughter until she attains the legal age for the marriage. A police complaint would be filed only when the parents try again to marry off their daughter before she reaches the legal age, the officer said. Prasanna Kumari, however, said as per the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, it was mandatory to file a police complaint once the child marriage was stopped. District child welfare committee chairperson G Kalaivani also confirmed that a first information report was mandatory in child marriage cases. The district social welfare officers are the child marriage prohibition officers, who are authorised to register a police complaint. Prasanna Kumari also suggested that the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) and the district child protection unit (DCPU) should be given more power regarding child marriages, since they were dealing solely with the child issues. Presently, it is not mandatory to involve CWC and DCPU in all child marriage cases. Kalaivani, chairperson, CWC, said, “When a CWC member or DCPU staff is involved in stopping a child marriage, they see whether the child needs care and protection. If she needs, they send her to the reception home, otherwise she will live with her family and CWC members will check on her regularly until the girl becomes a major. In cases in which CWC is not involved, officials sent the child to the committee only when the child needs care and protection.” Prasanna Kumari said making it mandatory to involve CWC or DCPU in every child marriage cases, making them nodal authority to file a police complaint and making it compulsory to send the child to a reception home for a buffer period would help reduce child marriages. Attempts to get a comment from the district social welfare officers failed to yield any results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/child-marriages-spike-during-pandemic-in-krishnagiri-dist/articleshow/84691620.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Jagati seeks simultaneousverdict in CBI, ED cases||Hyderabad: Concluding the prolonged hearing on which trial, quid pro quo or the attendant money laundering case should be commenced first, Justice Shameem Akther of the Telangana high court on Friday reserved his judgment in the matter. The judge heard the pleas filed by Jagati Publications and YSRCP MP V Vijaya Sai Reddy, who were arrayed as accused in both the CBI cases that deal with the scheduled offences and the consequent ED cases that deal with money laundering cases. Appearing for them, senior counsel S Niranjan Reddy said that the common trial court that was hearing both the CBI and ED cases had taken an unlawful decision to hear the ED case first despite its previous decision to hear them simultaneously. “Section 362 of CrPC says the court has no power to do so. At best it can correct any clerical errors in the order,” he said, explaining the reason why they were before the high court with an appeal. He wanted the high court to direct the trial court to pronounce the judgments in both cases simultaneously. “The trial in money laundering cannot be commenced first prior to the conclusion of trial in the scheduled offence,” he said. Appearing for the ED, additional solicitor general T Surya Karan Reddy said PMLA is a special law that was conferred with a pre-eminent status and the law says that the trial in such cases must commence first. Surya Karan said the ED case is an independent, distinct and standalone case and cited the judgments of Bombay and Madras high courts that held that the trial in other cases must be preceded by a trial in ED case. The judge reserved his orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jagati-seeks-simultaneousverdict-in-cbi-ed-cases/articleshow/84691612.cms||---

Udham Singh, who is the husband of chairperson of Sarurpur nagar panchayat in Meerut, was arrested after a raid by police on Thursday night. An FIR was registered against Singh on Thursday on the basis of a complaint filed by the bank officials. It was alleged in the complaint that Singh wanted the officials to issue a loan of Rs3 lakh to his 30 contractual labourers. When the officials refused to pass the loan, Singh allegedly threatened them with dire consequences. “He even threatened to kill the bank manager and left the branch,” a police officer said. It was then that the bank officials approached the ADG of Meerut zone, Rajeev Sabharwal, who ordered an inquiry. On Thursday night a police team reached Karnwal village and arrested Singh. A local hoodlum, Singh has at least 65 cases of murder, loot, extortion etc. registered against him. He was involved in a turf war with another local criminal Yogesh Bhadora, leading to several killings. According to SSP Meerut Prabhakar Chaudhary, “Udham Singh came out of Barabanki jail just 10 days ago. We were getting reports that he was threatening people for extortion money. He was also in the process of expanding his gang. Recently, he misbehaved with some bank officials and even threatened to kill one of them. On the basis of complaint, we have filed an FIR against him. He has been arrested. We are also making a list of his associates.” Meanwhile, Singh's wife Pushpa Devi expressed fear for her husband’s life. “All allegations are false. I fear the police might conduct his encounter,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/days-after-coming-out-on-bail-notorious-criminal-threatens-bank-staff-arrested-again/articleshow/84686790.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC bench withdraws personal comments on Stan Swamy after NIA says its morale is affected||MUMBAI: A Bombay high court bench headed by Justice S S Shinde on Friday took back its “personal comments” on the work of Father Stan Swamy, an accused in the Elgar Parishad case who died in hospital, after the NIA counsel objected. “If you think I said something, I take those words back,” said the judge after additional solicitor general Anil Singh, appearing for NIA, said, “After your lordship passed the comments…the agency’s morale is affected.” Singh had sought two minutes at the end of the hearing in Swamy’s case to make “submissions unconnected with merits of the matter”. He said “any personal or private comment from the bench, especially in open court in a pending investigation, gets twisted… (especially) personal comment on work of accused”. At this, Justice Shinde said: “I had said so far as legal issues are concerned, it is a separate matter.’’ It was “very balanced and “the court endeavours to be balanced”, he said, before adding: “No issues, I take back whatever I have personally said.’’ Swamy, 84, a tribal rights activist, was charged with anti-terror offences for allegedly being a Maoist and arrested last October. In May, he was shifted to Holy Family hospital from Taloja prison by HC order, pending hearing on his medical bail plea. He passed away on July 5 in the hospital ICU. Explaining that its comments were not in any way connected to the merits of the criminal case against Swamy, the bench added: “Even we are human beings. When something has happened suddenly….” It, however, told Singh: “We, in no uncertain terms, admire you. We never saw you get personally attached to the matter.” During the hearing, Swamy’s counsel Mihir Desai raised four issues. One was to seek participation of Fr Frazer Mascarenhas, through a lawyer, to participate in the judicial inquiry into Swamy’s death; to ensure the inquiry under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code is done in compliance with NHRC guidelines; since he Swamy died in Mumbai, to appoint a magistrate from the city; and, finally, to submit the report to the HC once complete. For NIA, Singh said he had no objection to the CrPC mandate being followed and an inquiry being conducted, but he said since Swamy’s appeals before the HC were against rejection of bail by the trial court, they would stand abated with his “unfortunate death’’. At this, Desai said there are various SC rulings that speak of the HC having powers of ‘parens patriae’ or to be the guardian of those unable to speak for themselves. The HC sought a compilation and of the issues Desai raised and whether the HC can hear the matter and adjourned it to August 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-bench-withdraws-personal-comments-on-swamy-after-nia-says-its-morale-is-affected/articleshow/84693868.cms||Swati Deshpande

The petition has been filed by an advocate of Punjab and Haryana high court. The NGT directed the committee to ascertain the number of tubewells discharging coloured water, depth of such wells, aquifer status in terms of movement and extent of contamination, characteristics of contaminated water with reference to effluent sludge disposed by the industry in question (dyes and dye intermediate), effect on agricultural crops, and bio-magnification in agro products. It may also suggest short and long-term basis considering agronomy and public health, remediation plan, and cost of such remediation. The committee would comprise Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) regional officer, MoEF&CC, Chandigarh; Punjab State Pollution Control Board, a nominee of Punjab secretary (environment), and district magistrate, Sangrur. The NGT also asked committee members to visit the site, interact with stakeholders, assess the ground situation, and recommend measures required to be taken and then furnish the report. “A copy of the report be forwarded to the chief secretary, Punjab, for ensuring remedial measures, based on the facts found. CPCB and PPCB will be the nodal agency for coordination and compliance. First meeting of the committee may be convened within two weeks,” reads NGT order. Advocate and social activist H C Arora had recently filed a petition with NGT and stated that certain tubewells were throwing out red-coloured, contaminated water and the source of this contamination was required to be identified as human beings and animals were bound to suffer some serious health problems. A chemical factory in the village shut down in 2005 and is being blamed for pollution in underground water. PPCB officials claimed that NGT had already imposed a fine of Rs 2 crore on industry owners some years ago and the matter of recovery of the fine was still pending in court. The fine was imposed under the principles of ‘Polluter Pays’ which is to be used for providing safe drinking water and remediation of water contamination. Sangrur deputy commissioner Ramvir said The village had already installed a reverse osmosis (RO) system to provide safe drinking water to villagers, while agriculture officials had got tested water as safe for the use of crops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ngt-asks-panel-to-submit-report-in-2-mths-on-coloured-tubewell-water/articleshow/84691640.cms||---
---||Kochi||‘Rs 40 crore brought to Kerala for BJP through hawala’||THRISSUR: The chargesheet submitted by SIT in the highway heist case stated that nearly Rs 40 crore was brought to Kerala for BJP leaders using hawala operators during the previous assembly elections. But, the chargesheet arraigned BJP leaders (including state president K Surendran), who were questioned by the police, as witnesses and not the accused. Surendran’s son Harikrishnan as well as Dharmarajan, one of the complainants, are also arraigned as witnesses. The chargesheet submitted at Irinjalakuda court on Friday stated that money reached the state on different days in March and April. The money was mobilized from Karnataka and apart from Kodakara, there was a dacoity incident at Salem also during transportation of the money; Rs 4.40 crore was looted on March 6, stated the chargesheet, a copy of which was made available to TOI. Dharmarajan, his brother Dhanarajan brought Rs 17 crore that was mobilized from Karnataka between March 1 and March 26 for distribution among BJP leaders in state, said the chargesheet. Another sum of Rs 23 crore was brought using the hawala agents in Kozhikode between March 5 and April 5, it said. The chargesheet made it clear that Rs 3.5 crore looted at Kodakara was illegally brought from Bengaluru for BJP’s campaign in previous assembly elections. The chargesheet said detailed probes ED, I-T department and EC were needed on this illegal money transport. Reports were submitted to these agencies along with copies of the chargesheet. The call details of Dharmarajan showed that he had contacted the phone used by Harikrishnan 10 times between late at night on April 2 and early morning on April 3; the time the heist took place. The chargesheet also gave details of the calls made by Dharmarajan to other BJP leaders.

The West Bengal Board of Madrasah Education (WBBME), which declared the results of High Madrasah, Alim and Fazil examinations 2021 on Friday, is upbeat about a sharp 65% rise in the number of girls taking the Class-X exams. The girls had also done better than the boys, officials said. “We have not published a merit list this year. It will not be possible to share the rankings but what is significant is a very high percentage of girls attempting Alim, Fazil and High Madrasah this year,” said Abu Taher Kamruddin, president of WBBME. He added: “A total of 74,267 students appeared for High Madrasah, Alim and Fazil this year, registering 15% more candidates than that last year. The dropout rate has come down significantly.” Sadia Siddika, a student at Naymouza High Madrasah in Malda, has topped the exam, scoring 797 out of 800. The daughter of a primary school teacher, Siddika wants to study medicine after Class XII. “I never thought of becoming a topper in the state, but I was confident of a good result. I have always wanted to become a doctor and I will continue to prepare myself for that,” Siddika said. Anisha Sultana and Rashida Khatun from Murshidabad, both of whom have secured the second rank, hope to study medicine. A student of Murshidabad’s Debkunda High Madrasah, Anisha has scored 796 and so has Rashida, who stayed at the school hostel. Anisha, the daughter of a grocery store owner at Beldanga, wants to study medicine. Rashida, a resident of Bhagabangola, also wants to pursue a career in medicine. The third wank was bagged by Sharifa Khatun, the daughter of a mason at Jangipur, who secured 795. A student of Muniriah High Madrasah at Jangipur, Khatun said she wanted to study literature. “I have secured enough marks to opt for science, but I want to study English literature. I always wanted to be a teacher,” Khatun said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/girls-top-high-madrasah-exams/articleshow/84691654.cms||Subhro Maitra
---||Agra||Come in formals or face action: Aligarh administration tells its employees||AGRA: As offices spring back to life after a bout of pandemic, the administration in parts of Uttar Pradesh, in its bid to “maintain decorum”, has asked employees to come in formals. Three months after the district magistrate of Sambhal passed an order directing its district headquarters employees to attend office only in formal clothes, a similar missive was shot off by Aligarh’s divisional commissioner. It has now barred government employees from wearing jeans pants, T-shirts and slippers. Aligarh’s divisional commissioner Guarav Dayal said that these are government instructions and are being implemented at divisional level to maintain office decorum. Though this order will be applicable at divisional level offices in the city, district magistrates of all districts under Aligarh division-- Aligarh, Hathras, Kasganj and Etah -- will be directed to implement it. “Disciplinary action will be taken against those who will violate the order,” he said, adding that coming to office in casuals violates the code of conduct and office ethics. There is no specific dress code proposed for the employees but it has to be ensured that informal outfits are not worn by them during office hours. Dayal said a drive, “behtar karyalaya” (better office) has been started to improve the condition of government offices. The upkeep of offices will be monitored and graded by senior officials. This, he said, would include proper storage of files and records, making proper sitting arrangements for visitors, polite interaction with complainants, and speedy resolution of complaints. "The aim is to motivate employees to improve the office look and behaviour towards others,” he said. After it came to power, the BJP-led UP government had banned wearing of jeans and T-shirts for the state government employees during duty hours in 2017. The government had also put a ban on chewing of paan masala and gutka in government offices, schools and colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/come-in-formals-or-face-action-administration-in-ups-aligarh-tell-its-employees/articleshow/84686826.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Delhi||Delhi: DDA reply sought on plea against 45-day window for MPD feedback||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Friday sought a response from Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on a plea challenging its notification by which the residents of Delhi have been given 45 days to raise objections or file suggestions on the Delhi Master Plan-2041. The petitioner, the National Hawker Federation, sought the court’s direction to quash and set aside the public notification dated June 9 issued by DDA on the ground that it violates the Delhi Development (Master Plan and Zonal Development Plan) Rules, 1959 and the Constitution of India. The plea sought direction from DDA to provide 90 days for filing suggestions, objections to the Delhi Master Plan as per rule. A period of 45 days is not sufficient to file objections by various stakeholders in view of the ongoing pandemic, it stated. A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh issued notice and granted time to DDA to file its response. The petition also asserts that stakeholders would want to share suggestions but most of them are unaware of the draft master plan. The petition submits that sharing information with respect to the plan was essential to not only ensure transparency but also to protect the right of citizens to participate. The petition prays for a direction to DDA to reach out and engage with the marginalised communities, particularly the slum dwellers and street vendors, while finalising the Master Plan-2041 by setting up desks for inspection, study of draft reports and land use maps at all zonal offices of DDA. Another plea has sought publication of the draft MPD-2041 in Punjabi and Urdu languages. The petition states that while the master plan was critical for envisioning the city’s next 20 years, DDA published its draft for the general public only in Hindi and English and excluded the two other official languages, Punjabi and Urdu. “It is thus argued that such publication was discriminatory as it excluded the part of the population which cannot read Hindi or English.” The petitions want DDA to publish all the documents, including the preparatory studies and maps, relied upon by it while preparing the draft master plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dda-reply-sought-on-plea-against-45-day-window-for-mpd-feedback/articleshow/84689153.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Stumped by spike in high scorers, CBSE asks schools to rework numbers||MUMBAI: The CBSE board is faced with a unique problem this year: A sudden spike in high achievers. After the board’s software pored over the data submitted by schools, it recently found the count of candidates with 95%-plus scores had zoomed way above the previous years’ numbers. The CBSE board was thus forced to reject a lot of the data; it has asked schools to rework their numbers, scale down the results and re-submit them by July 25. Little wonder then that Class X results are likely to witness a delay. Earlier, schools across India were to submit the data by June 30, the deadline for which was extended to July 5. “After that, we noticed that some schools had not followed instructions given to them for preparing the results based on the historical data. Also, some schools committed mistakes in uploading their data; marks of practicals were not uploaded. Additionally, some schools have not yet submitted their data at all,” CBSE examination head Sanyam Bhardwaj told TOI. There are two options in the CBSE results software: One, to upload the results data, and two, to submit the same after finalisation. “Most schools have uploaded the data, but have not submitted the same yet. So, the board assumes that they are yet to finalise the same,” said a source from the board. In Mumbai, some schools run by coaching classes and some popular chains of institutes were all pulled up for “inflated” scores. The CBSE policy is thus: Schools were asked to pick a reference year out of the past three (2018, 2019 and 2020) and stay in line with that performance. So, if a school picked 2018, when its performance was the most robust, results of 2021 had to be similar. If five students scored above 95%, then this time too, only five ought to be placed in the 95%-plus category, and so on and so forth. In case of new schools with no past reference to go by, the school and subject mean was to be in line with the national, state and district data. “However, if a school in the reference year picked by them had two students with 95% or more, then this time they have four or five. Hence, we have asked them to streamline their results,” added Bharadwaj. Schools that increased their class strength faced difficulty in staying within the reference year’s score range. “We could look at bunching scores as per the percentage rise in student numbers, but in our case this batch genuinely did well and we found it very difficult to work the data,” said the principal of a CBSE school. “Most schools give 18 or 19 of 20 in internals. In the case of theory then, students got 77 or 76 and the total scores went beyond 95%. We had to scale that down and we did so, but it was a rather difficult task,” said another. A CBSE coordinator said several schools contacted his office as they were in a fix about streamlining their scores with the previous years. “When principals and teachers are empowered, they must be judicious and fair in their marking,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/stumped-by-spike-in-high-scorers-cbse-asks-schools-to-rework-nos/articleshow/84695198.cms||Hemali Chhapia

Police said that the crooks targeted the car of Kanika Gupta, wife of Vivek Gupta, former Rajyasabha MP from Trinmool Congress and presently an MLA, on the BRT stretch in southeast Delhi. The men made away with Rs 1.9 lakh in cash, an iPhone, a gold coin and some documents. The incident was reported around 2.30pm on Friday. Gupta told the cops that she was in her car with a driver and had reached the Defence Colony flyover when a man on a motorcycle pointed out a flat tyre. The driver got out to check it when another biker pointed out smoke coming out of the bonnet, and Gupta exited the vehicle hurriedly. The first biker took the opportunity to grab her bag in the back seat and flee. An FIR has been registered. Investigation has revealed the crooks threw engine oil on the bonnet, which heated up and led to the smoke from the car.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/thak-thak-gang-targets-wife-of-mla/articleshow/84691694.cms||---

The Kanyashree recipient was felicitated by the Murshidabad district administration and police. “I want to study medicine. Doctors inspire me,” Rumana said. Das’s comment led to protesters gathering at the council’s Salt Lake office, demanding her resignation. They clashed with police and some were detained. But urging everyone not to read anything more into what she had said, Das pointed out, “I got emotional. It is not often that a girl battles to the top. When asked about the topper, my mind had gone back to Begum Rokeya. It is perhaps the best result in the council’s history. She is a jewel. Memories flooded and I said that in an emotional moment.” State education minister Bratya Basu said, “It is true merit matters, nothing else. But perhaps she (Das) was emotional. For the past decade, this government, led by Mamata Banerjee, has been striving to bring girl students to the fore. These are leading to these results.” HS topper Ramana Sultana with her family membersBJP state spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya questioned whether the reference to religion and not merit was a subtle attempt at appeasing a community. BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya tweeted, “In Mamata Banerjee’s Bengal, appeasement politics hits a new low, when a board official reduced academic achievement of a Class 12th girl student to her religious identity...” Rumana’s father Rabiul Islam, a head teacher, said, “It would have been better if such things were avoided. We have taught them to be good human beings first. Rumana follows in the footsteps of her grandfather who topped philosophy UG exams in 1962. She worked hard to achieve to what she did.” State minister Firhad Hakim said introducing Rumana by her religion could have been avoided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/religion-not-my-identity-hs-topper/articleshow/84691732.cms||Sukumar Mahato

Police said they left behind a note stating that they were taking the extreme step as they were suffering from post-Covid complications and were having trouble living a normal life. Ajay Kumar (34) and Suja S (30) had got married 10 months ago and was living in the flat on rent at Bharat Mills society. Suja’s mother, who stays in Kerala, was trying to reach her but she did not answer the calls. So, the mother asked her colleague to check on her. The friend broke open the door and found the couple motionless on the floor. The friend informed the police. The post-mortem examination at Nair Hospital found traces of poison in the bodies, but the poison hasn’t been identified. “The preliminary post-mortem report found poison in the bodies. We have sent the viscera of both the bodies to the forensic laboratory,” said senior inspector Anil Koli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-couple-with-post-covid-complications-dies-by-suicide/articleshow/84695206.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Mayawati's aide Satish Mishra invokes Ram & Brahmins on Ayodhya stage||AYODHYA: Seeking resurrection in soft Hindutva and social engineering after wallowing in political wilderness for a decade, the Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) launched its Brahmin conclave in the Hindutva nerve centre of Ayodhya on Friday amid chants of ‘Jai Shri Ram’. Asserting that Ram or Ayodhya was not the fiefdom of BJP, Mayawati’s aide Satish Mishra, said, 13% Brahmins and 23% Dalits would form an unassailable combination to recreate the 2007 BSP victory in 2022 assembly polls. “The saffron brigade should immediately provide details of funds collected in the name of Ram over three decades,” he said. Breaching the district administration’s cap of 50 participants, Mishra addressed over 5,000 Brahmin delegates at the conclave, which was rechristened ‘intellectuals’ meet’ to circumvent an earlier court ruling banning caste-based congregations. Exhorting Brahmins to once again support BSP, Mishra’s Ayodhya tryst signalled a paradigm shift in Mayawati’s Dalit politics with the invocation of Ram Lalla and promise of completing the grand temple on time, if voted to power. Assuming the avatar of a ‘Karmkandi Brahmin’, he offered prayers at Ramjanambhoomi and worshipped the Saryu river with 125 litre of milk, before kicking off the conclave on the outskirts of Faizabad City. This is the first time any BSP leader has visited Ramjanmabhoomi or overtly supported the Ram temple issue. Mayawati herself never visited Ayodhya even though she carved out Ambedkarnagar from then Faizabad district in 1995. Announcing mega Brahmin conclaves across the state and repeatedly harping on alleged persecution of the community in the present BJP regime, Mishra declared the second and third leg of BSP’s outreach programme will be held in the Hindutva hubs of Mathura, Vrindavan and Kashi. As earlier reported by TOI, he vowed to take up the legal battle of Khushi Dubey, 17-year-old jailed widow of slain Brahmin gangster Vikas Dubey’s aide Amar. Giving a clarion call for Brahmin unity, he said, “The temple bhoomipujan on August 5, 2020, was inauspicious and Brahmins had questioned the day and hour of the ceremony. Even the foundation of the Ram temple is not ready after after keeping Ram Lalla in a tent for decades. Now, there’s a question mark on its completion. Unmask the BJP and you will realise they have taken you for a ride and dumped you in the margins.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/maya-aide-invokes-ram-brahmins-on-ayodhya-stage/articleshow/84693914.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
---||Lucknow||Lucknow University bows to teachers’ demand, drops common minimum syllabus||LUCKNOW: Bowing to demands of teachers, Lucknow University authorities on Friday dropped its earlier directions to faculties on common minimum syllabus (CMS) and issued a fresh order asking departments to finalise their own syllabi by August 5. The decision will impact over one lakh students in LU and its associated colleges. The higher education department had drafted the CMS earlier this year. In April, it asked all the state universities to include 70% of its content in their syllabus for four-year undergraduate (UG) courses to be implemented in accordance with the New Education Policy (NEP) 2020. However, in May, all LU departments rejected the CMS saying its inferior in quality and its imposition amounts to undermining the university's autonomy, which in turn is against the spirit of the NEP. Teachers then went ahead and drafted a separate syllabus for LU. But, on June 15, LU authorities issued a fresh order directing departments to adopt CMS within seven working days. LU Teachers Association (LUTA) then raised a banner of revolt against the order, describing it as a violation of the university’s autonomy guaranteed in the UP State Universities Act 1973. LU Associated College Teachers also expressed reservation against the CMS on grounds that it was practically impossible for colleges to implement it in existing limited resources. Sources said that there was also a high level meeting between LU and state government officials on the issue on Thursday. Consequently, on Friday LU registrar issued a fresh order asking all the departments to get their respective syllabus approved from academic bodies and send them to the LU authorities by August 5. Welcoming LU’s Friday decision, teachers said that LU has already accepted the NEP recommendation on having a four-year UG course with multiple entry-exit options and vocational subjects. Further, they said, departments while drafting syllabus also kept in mind prime minister’s advice of covering local interests which he gave at LU’s centenary celebrations. Vice-chancellor Prof Alok Kumar Rai said, “We have only asked the department to finalise the syllabus. Departments will decide which syllabus they want to adopt.” "University is an autonomous body and only teachers hold the right to draft its syllabus as per the local demographic, social and economic needs. Surrendering this right would have meant compromising with our autonomy,” said LUTA president Prof Vineet Kumar Verma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lu-bows-to-teachers-demand-drops-cms/articleshow/84693949.cms||---
---||Goa||Landslide near Dudhsagar, rail services on South Western Railway route disrupted||MARGAO/VASCO: Long distance train traffic originating from as well as passing through Goa was paralysed after a landslide between Dudhsagar and Sonaulim railway stations on South Western Railway (SWR) route caused derailment of 01134 Mangaluru Jn - CSMT Mumbai train on Friday morning. However, no casualties were reported. As trains along the Konkan Railway route were suspended since Thursday in view of the overflowing Vashisti river in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra, several trains were diverted along the SWR’s Margao-Londa-Miraj route. However, on Friday morning, landslides occurred at two locations on the Braganza Ghat - between Dudhsagar and Sonaulim stations, and between Dudhsagar and Caranzol railway stations, while water rose above the danger level mark near the railway bridge in the Alnavar-Londa section in Karnataka causing water to flow over the railway track. SWR officials said that the train traffic along the section was temporarily suspended in view of passenger safety. SWR officials said that the 01134 Mangaluru Jn - CSMT Mumbai Special was running on the diverted route on SWR when the engine and a general coach next to it derailed in the Braganza Ghat. Passengers of the derailed coaches were shifted to other coaches and the train pulled back to Kulem station. 02780 Nizamuddin-Vasco train was detained between Dudhsagar and Caranzol stations and later brought to Castlerock railway station. The train was later short-terminated at Londa and passengers were refunded. SWR arranged for transshipment of the passengers of the train by buses to various locations. Accident Relief Train (ART) from Castle Rock and Vasco with re-railing equipment was rushed to the site, and heavy earthmoving machinery pressed into service along with a team of trained technicians to carry out track and train restoration work. Senior officials of SWR supervised the work. “About 500 cu m of rubble, muck and boulders have fallen on the track due to the landslide. In addition to the 15 trackmen of the section, 50 labourers have been mobilised for clearing the debris and restoring the track. Due to very heavy rainfall, there is further continuous accumulation of slush, boulders, mud from the area beside the track, making the clearing of debris, a challenging task. Mud had also accumulated inside the derailed coach,” a spokesperson of the SWR, Hubbali, said. Arrangements for meals, refreshments and drinking water were made for all the 345 passengers of train no 01134 and 887 passengers on board train no 02780, SWR officials said. A medical team from Belagavi was mobilised to attend to in cases of emergency. For the stranded passengers of Train No 01134, a special train to Trivandrum Central left Madgaon jn at 7pm. “Stranded passengers were given an option to board this train if they wished to return (to the originating station). Few of the passengers boarded Amritsar-Kochuveli Express which left Madgaon at 2.40pm,” the spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/landslide-near-dudhsagar-rail-services-on-swr-route-disrupted/articleshow/84694149.cms||Ruvina Khan

The deceased have been identified as Sharad Devre, Vilas Bacchav, Chandrakant Darekar and Satish Suryawanshi. According to police, all victims belonged to Malegaon. Their bodies were sent to Yermala-based rural hospital where autopsy was performed before handing over to their families. Three other people — Sanjay Sawant, Bharat Pagare and Gokul Shewale — also sustained serious injuries in the accident and have been rushed to Osmanabad civil hospital. Their condition is said to be critical. Police said the injured also include truck’s driver and cleaner. “The bus, carrying pilgrims to Tirupati, had a flat tyre while passing through Terkheda. The driver accordingly parked the bus in-front of a road-side hotel and started fixing the tyre. This is when a speeding truck rammed into the bus from behind,” a police officer said. Police said the impact was so hard that the bus skidded for around 100 feet, while the truck turned turtle before ending up in a roadside field. Upon learning about the accident, police teams rushed to the spot and carried out the rescue operation with the help of locals. Though an offence has been registered against the truck driver, police said that they are checking if the bus was parked on the road. Considering the impact of the accident, police now believes that the truck was over-speeding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/truck-rams-bus-on-way-to-tirupati-4-die/articleshow/84686885.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Mumbai||Indrani Mukerjea played active role in Sheena Bora murder: Court||MUMBAI: In a detailed order rejecting Indrani Mukerjea’s interim bail plea, a special CBI court this week held that it appeared she had played an active role in abducting, murdering and disposing of the body of her daughter Sheena Bora along with the other accused. The court said she was instrumental in destroying the evidence as well. “There is a prima facie clinching material to show the active complicity of the applicant in the alleged crime,” special judge AS Sayyad said in the five-page order. On the health concerns, the court said it appeared jail authorities had taken proper care to protect the prisoners during the Covid-19 pandemic. It also observed that positivity rate was drastically falling in the city and in jails. “It appears there are proper medical facilities available in jail and the applicant is under strict observation of doctors. It appears from the record that the jail administration is providing proper medical facilities to all the prisoners as per the jail manual,” the court said. The court made similar observations while rejecting her co-accused and ex-husband, 55-year-old Sanjeev Khanna’s interim bail plea. Both have been in jail since their arrest in 2015. Sheena was allegedly murdered in 2012, though the incident came to light only three years later. “There is documentary material to show that the applicant (Khanna) came from Kolkata and stayed in Hotel Hilltop, which was booked by accused Indrani Mukerjea. There is prima facie clinching material to show the active complicity of the applicant in the alleged crime,” the court said. Both had cited coronavirus and the high-power committee’s guidelines for release of inmates during the pandemic. Opposing their interim bail pleas, special public prosecutor Manoj Chaladan submitted that 68 witnesses of the total 253 have been examined. The prosecution expressed apprehension that the accused may influence the prosecution witnesses, who are yet to be examined, and they may also abscond, if released on bail. “Considering the role of the applicant in the alleged crime and the discussion made above, will disentitle the applicant to avail the bail as per the decision of high-power committee,” the court said in two separate orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/indrani-played-active-role-in-sheena-murder-in-mumbai-court/articleshow/84694221.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Prioritise 2nd vax dose as 18+ become eliglible, districts told||MUMBAI: Districts across the state have been told to prioritise second dose vaccination with the 18-44 age bracket becoming eligible for the second jab of Covishield starting this week. Since vaccination for this age group was started on May 1, those who had taken Covishield will complete 84 days on July 24. Data shows that over 95 lakh people from the 18-44 age group have taken the first dose, while 4.3 lakh people have taken both doses so far in the state. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary health, said, “We have already told districts to prioritise second dose across all age groups”. He, however, added that the first dose will not be stopped, but second dose recipients will be given priority. The decision has been left to individual districts and cities to decide what share of their daily vaccine stocks will be allocated to first and second dose recipients. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said the quota of first and second dose beneficiaries will be decided depending on need and requirement. “We have made 60% second dose and 40% first dose already and it could be revised later looking at the demand. Second dose is always a priority since complete vaccination is the main aim,” she added. In Mumbai, more than 22.3 lakh people between 18 and 44 years have taken the first dose and less than 75,000 have taken both doses. Those who had taken Covaxin can get the second shot after 28 days. In the Pune region, deputy director Dr Sanjay Deshmukh said they are following the 70:30 rule. “We are keeping 70% slots for the second dose beneficiaries and 30% for first,” he said, adding that there are more second dose beneficiaries at this stage. Both public and private centres are anticipating a rise in footfall at the vaccination booths. A private hospital head said they are hoping to see a surge in demand for slots from August. “Most private hospitals had started vaccinating those in the 18-44 age group after May 8-10. A demand for paid vaccination, though, will depend on how many stocks the public centres have,” he said. Vaccination for the 18-44 age bracket was allowed nationally from May 1, but the onus was put on states to vaccinate them. The Centre had also announced that states and private sector would have to procure their own vaccine stocks leading to an overnight scramble to secure doses from manufacturers directly. Maharashtra started the drive on May 1 by procuring around 10 lakh doses, but could sustain it only for 12 days. On June 7, the Centre reversed its vaccine procurement policy following which free va-ccination for the 18-44 age group was started from June 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-prioritise-2nd-vax-dose-as-18-become-eliglible-districts-told/articleshow/84693971.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Top colleges devise cut-off formula with Class X scores||KOLKATA: For students seeking admission to undergraduate courses this year, marks scored in the Class X board exam could be as crucial as the Class XII board result. The former could gain more weightage in some colleges that seeks to assess a candidate’s performance in individual subjects. This is because the Class X board exam was the last proper test many students in this batch have taken. The Class XI annual exam results would have perhaps been a better yardstick to assess the students but in most schools, it could not be completed in 2020 due to Covid. Several colleges across the city have devised their formulae to arrive at the aggregate and/or cut-offs with marks in individual subjects the students scored in their ICSE or equivalent Class X exams they had appeared for two years ago. This, despite the boards already giving weightage to the Class X results while preparing the Class XII marks. In many colleges, students will need their Class X boards scores even to apply in certain subjects. In others, marks scored in Class X boards will function as a tie-breaker for a seat if two or more students end up with same aggregate. According to the principals TOI spoke to, Class X boards are the only exam that this batch, which will be seeking UG admission, has taken. The boards are giving weightage to Class X board results but that is either on the aggregate or best of four subjects. In absence of Class XII exams, principals want their Class-X scores of individual subjects to gauge candidates’ aptitude for fields applied for. At Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira, those seeking admission in English, political science and economics will be screened on the basis of marks in Class X and XII boards. To apply for physics and microbiology honours, marks in chemistry, physics, life science and biology in Class X boards will play a crucial role. “The departments have devised their criteria for admission in their subjects. While some departments felt Class X and XII results were important, others felt they needed an online talk with students,” said Swami Ekachittananda, principal of the college. At Lady Brabourne, too, different departments have devised criteria for admission. “Class X boards were the last proper test this batch appeared for. So, it is a way of assessing the students’ aptitude for the subject or the stream they are opting for to some extent. Our different departments are giving varying weightage to marks in Class X boards,” said Siuli Sarkar, principal of Lady Brabourne College. Universities, like Jadavpur and Presidency, have not yet announced the criteria of admission. Meetings of the admission committee at both the universities are slated for next week. “The government has made it clear there will be no admission test or interviewsor counselling this year. So, in order to put in some sort of screening of the candidates, the university might follow last year’s process, under which marks in certain subjects in Class X boards were factored in,” said a JU official. Scottish Church will also look into the marks of different subjects scored in Class X. “Even if students score very high in Class XII boards, our formula will create some sort of a filter,” said Madhumanjari Mandal, principal at Scottish Church College. In many colleges, the authorities have decided to stick to Class XII marks only, as the boards are evaluating the students on the marks they scored in Class X boards and Class XI finals. “We had discussed in our admission committee meeting about giving 50% weightage to Class X Board results and 50% weightage to Class XII board results. But then, almost all the boards announced they would do the same. So, we dropped the idea,” said Subhasis Dutta, principal of Maulana Azad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/top-colleges-devise-cut-off-formula-with-class-x-scores/articleshow/84691819.cms||Zeeshan Javed

He has asked the five to appear before a group of parallel Sikh clerics at Akal Takht. However, the move has come under criticism by members of Hawara Committee, constituted by parallel jathedar of Akal Takht Jagtar Singh Hawara, the assassin of former chief minister of Punjab Beant Singh, at present lodged in Tihar jail. Mand, who is also former Lok Sabha MP from Ferozpur, arrived here at Akal Takht and summoned Congress leaders including — ministers Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, and MLAs Harminder Singh Gill, Khushaldeep Singh, and Kulbir Singh Zira to appear on August 2. “These Congress leaders had assured us to fulfil all of our demands, including taking action against the persons responsible for sacrilege incidents and firing upon innocent Sikhs at Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan, apart from release of Sikh political prisoners,” said Mand. The parallel jathedar was “elected” during an unofficial Sikhs gathering or ‘Sarbat Khalsa’ at Chabba village near Amritsar on November 10, 2015. During the gathering Hawara was appointed as parallel jathedar of Akal Takht and Dhian Singh Mand was announced as the officiating jathedar. A close aide of Mand, Jarnail Singh Sakhira alleged that they were deceived by the Congress leaders who had made “false promises” with the panthic leaders, following which the 192 days old Bargari Insaf Morcha was lifted on December 9, 2018. These Congress leaders didn’t keep their words and were guilty of playing with the sentiments of the community, he alleged. Strangely, the Hawara Committee was caught unaware. Professor Baljinder Singh , a member of the committee, said, “Mand had neither consulted nor taken permission from Hawara before starting or lifting the Bargari Insaf Morcha. He has lost his credibility due to his controversial functioning.” Differences between the two groups had earlier surfaced on the occasion of 37th anniversary of Operation Blue Star as Mand read out his message to ‘quom’, while Hawara’s father Gurcharan Singh had separately read Hawara’s message.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/parallel-group-of-sikh-clerics-summons-2-congress-ministers-3-mlas/articleshow/84691754.cms||Yudhvir Rana

The officials are finding a contractor that can repair the sewerage so that road could be constructed over again. The officials claimed that for this task they require technical staff, who are not in regular payroll of the municipal corporation (MC). The estimate for the loss is also being calculated On Thursday, a large portion of road had caved in near Model Town extension cremation ground. The rear portion of truck got stuck in the road and it was with great difficulty it was moved out. An old sewerage system of the MC was passing under the road and when the underground cables were laid down, the sewerage got damaged and due to frequent erosion of sand under the ground, the road caved in when a loaded truck passed over it. The driver had a lucky escape. One of the officials requesting anonymity said, “We are waiting for the contractor to take up this work because it is not our cup of tea. Technically sound contractor can fix it.

---||Surat||Affiliation issue keeps college teachers, students on the edge||SURAT: Future of some of the oldest colleges of south Gujarat run by Sarvajanik Education Society (SES) hangs in balance as there is uncertainty over which university they would be affiliated to. Currently, these colleges are affiliated with Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) ever since they came into existence. Now, with the formation of Sarvajanik University of SES, these colleges are gradually being disaffiliated by VNSGU as per government guidelines. However, the Sarvajanik University is not ready to give affiliation to these colleges without clarity on the issue of grants for salary and perks. This has raised doubts about the future among the teachers and students of grant-in-aid colleges of SES. The teachers and students of SES-run colleges on Friday held protests at VNSGU and made representation to the officials. The colleges in question include MTB Arts College, Sir P T Sarvajanik College of Science, Sir K P College of Commerce. However, VNSGU vice-chancellor K N Chavda clarified that the matter was between SES and the education department and the university had no role to play in it. “There cannot be two acts or set of rules for a private university in the state. The same rules apply to private universities in other parts of the state and as per my knowledge, there are no disputes,” added Chavda. VNSGU came into existence in 1966 in the campus Sarvajanik Education Society (SES). Meanwhile, SES’s private university Sarvajanik University was approved by the government recently. Chairman of SES Kamlesh Naik said, “We had proposed the government that we will take only self-finance institutions (SFI) while the grant-in aide colleges will remain affiliated with VNSGU. We are ready to affiliate grant-in aide colleges only if we get assurance on grants from the government.” VNSGU started disaffiliation of eight colleges of which five are run by the SES, one by the Vanita Vishram Trust and two from Bardoli are associated with trust that runs Uka Tarsadia University. A senior syndicate member of VNSGU, Sanjay Desai, said, “Earlier, in May the government had ordered a process of disaffiliation. Since it was not done the government sent a reminder for quick implementation. The teachers and students of these colleges do not need to worry as there will be no changes in benefits they are receiving.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/affiliation-issue-keeps-college-teachers-students-on-the-edge/articleshow/84690369.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Vax shortage, 241 centres to stay shut today||As many as 241 of the 309 public vaccination centres in the city will remain closed on Saturday due to shortage of Covid-19 vaccine doses. The BMC on Friday announced that only 68 centres will vaccinate on Saturday—46 will administer Covishield and 22 Covaxin. Free vaccination at the state and civic-run centres has been persistently hit due to paucity of stocks since the past few weeks. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said the city was left with less than 30,000 doses on Friday evening. The BMC is hoping to receive some doses on Saturday which would be distributed to centres through the weekend. This means vaccination at the public centres will resume fully only on Monday now. As vaccination in the city resumed after a two-day break, 82,062 people got the shot on Friday, of which nearly 50,000 were at public centres. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vax-shortage-241-centres-to-stay-shut-today/articleshow/84694007.cms||---

The police had then arrested two people from the spot and the duo revealed names of four more people behind the illegal activity and the police were after them for arrest. The four suspects approached HC for anticipatory bail and during the hearing of the same, the HC found that there was no evidence to link three of these applicants with illegal sand lifting activity. The bench of justice Sandeep Shinde took strong exception to the fact that instead of impounding and retaining these equipment as crucial evidence against the people involved in illegal sand lifting, the police destroyed the same. The HC granted anticipatory bail to three of the applicants and rejected the same of the fourth applicant owing to his previous involvement in four similar offences. “In fact of the situation, instead of attaching the fiber and suction boats, a team of police destroyed them and thereby caused disappearance of evidence. This action on part of the police is foreign to the Code of Criminal Procedure. Rather it may attract penal provisions of section 201 of the IPC. Police ought to have preserved the evidence but they high-handedly caused its disappearance. This act of police cannot be overlooked,” Shinde said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-orders-inquiry-against-police-for-destruction-of-evidence/articleshow/84686956.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Now, the students are raising the issue on social media platforms, criticising authorities concerned for initiating no concrete step against the culprit. Members of the All-India Students’ Association have submitted a memorandum to LU vice-chancellor AK Rai requesting immediate action in the case. They alleged that girl students are feeling insecure and are planning to leave the online platform. “In four days the miscreant has uploaded obscene content at least two times. If this continues how difficult it would be for students to continue with studies,” said a BA student Arvind Chauhan. Another student Vidya Srivatsava said, “The varsity has, so far, prepared no plan to handle such nonsense. In fact, the varsity’s approach has only emboldened the culprit.” Expressing similar views, BCom student Atul Agarwal said, “University authorities are waiting for police to do something and not taking any step on their own.

---||Chandigarh||Old sewerage system not discontinued due to scarcity of funds: MC||Ludhiana: Be cautious while driving at road, especially in this rainy season, as earth beneath roads is hollow. The major cause behind this hollowness is old sewerage system and permission to telecom companies for laying the underground cables. The municipal corporation (MC), due to scarcity of funds, has failed to replace the old sewerage system in the city. Though plans were made to rehabilitate existing trunk storm water drains at two locations under smart city mission, but nothing has been done so far. The proposal was made for Malhar Road and DMC Road starting from Saggu Chowk to Dhami Eye care centre, which is perhaps the worst affected, as in the past few years four major road caved in at this stretch. After this, Dugri Road storm sewerage line and existing drains along Ferozepur Road were supposed to be taken up. The plan was to create a new sewerage line inside the existing old dart sewerage so that in case old line gets damaged from outside there will be no impact. The old dart sewerage gets damaged easily and due to erosion road caves in. Superintending engineer of operation and maintenance cell Ravinder Garg said, “We are taking up this matter seriously and two proposals are going under smart city mission. These are under process.” However, the officials claimed that most of the old sewerage lines passing under the roads are old and where ever it is brick walled sewerage the chances of road caved in increase especially if underground wires are laid down. This kind of old system is at Malhar Road, Gill Road, Chandigarh Road and Hambran Road. Meanwhile, a resident of Gurdev Nagar Ayush Sharma, said, “During these days we should drive on our risk as already due to water logging it becomes tough to drive and if there is no guarantee of roads then people' lives will be in danger. The authorities should do something to replace these old sewerage lines for the safety of public.” He said moreover when civic body gives permission to the telecom companies for undergrounding of cables then officials should monitor the work as well for avoiding loss to their sewerage or water supply lines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/old-sewerage-system-not-discontinued-due-to-scarcity-of-funds-mc/articleshow/84694080.cms||---

The upper caste men said that Rajat, a Dalit, should not “dare” to sport a beard, “the pride of Thakurs”. It took Rajat five days to gather the courage and file a complaint, his family said. After a video of the incident, which the Thakur men had put online, went viral, police booked six men and the barber who shaved off Rajat's beard for rioting, causing hurt, criminal intimidation and under sections of the SC/ST Act. The seven men are yet to be held though. “No arrest has been made yet but we are tracking those involved,” Saharanpur SSP Shivasimpi Chanappa said. It was around 7am on Sunday, when Rajat was passing by a street in his village, Shimlana, that Neeraj Rana, Satyam Rana, Mokam Rana, Ripantu Rana, Monty Rana and Sandeep Rana surrounded him. “They started abusing me and hurling casteist slurs. They had knives and other sharp weapons on them. They dragged me to the barbershop and threatened to kill me,” Rajat’s complaint to the police said. “They forcefully got my beard shaved off, beat me up and filmed it all.” While doing so, Rajat added, they said, “How dare you sport a beard? You think you people can be like us Thakurs? Only we can have beards.” Then, they warned him against going to the police or they would “burn him and his family alive”, the complaint said. For days, Rajat did not. “He got high fever that day because of the trauma,” Rajat’s brother Sonu Kumar told TOI. “It was just before his exams (Rajat is a BTech final year student). We gave him the courage to fight this off and appear for the exam (scheduled on Friday).” One of the six men, meanwhile, posted the video on a local WhatsApp group, from where someone picked it up and uploaded it on Facebook on Thursday morning. It was shared widely. Feeling utterly humiliated, Rajat decided he had to report it to the police. On the basis of his complaint, an FIR was registered at Badgaon police station on Thursday evening. “It is not the first time something like this has happened in our village. It is dominated by the upper caste. We remain oppressed,” Sonu said. Bhim Army’s Saharanpur unit president Rohit Raj added, “There are many villages in Saharanpur which are dominated by upper castes. At times, they eat and drink with us. At times, they do this. They show us our place.” Watch Shocking: Dalit techie thrashed, beard shaved by Thakur men in Uttar Pradesh||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/dalit-techies-beard-shaved-off-thrashed-by-upper-castes-video-put-online/articleshow/84686966.cms||Ishita Mishra

The government claimed that the number is three times more than what Samajwadi Party provided in five years and much more than the 95,000 provided by BSP. Meanwhile, as the Olympic Games were inaugurated in Japan on Friday, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said it would be highly beneficial to have sportspersons in the police force and asked senior officials to draft a policy to recruit sportspersons/athletes under a fixed quota. He said a similar system should be set up across departments and asked for an implementation plan. “Last week, the CM had held an interaction with 10 sportspersons from UP who are representing India in the Olympics and assured them of development of sports facilities in the state. As part of the government’s promotion of sports under Khelo India Khelo programme, the CM also recommended there should be a special quota for sportspersons in police services,” a government spokesperson said. The CM directed all government departments to restore sports quota immediately and ensure recruitment of sportspersons and athletes. The departments have been directed to draft a proposal to this effect. The spokesperson said recruitment of sportspersons would not just encourage sports in the state but also help in increasing employment. On Thursday, the CM had announced that by December, the government would ensure that there were at least 50,000 more recruitments in the government. The government has claimed that since 2017, when BJP came to power, it has directly recruited 3,44,136 people. Of these, most jobs were given in the police force where 1,43,445 people were appointed, followed by basic education department which recruited 1,25,986 persons. In addition to this, 47,546 people were hired on contractual basis while jobs were outsourced to 2,73,657 others. “When you compare with previous governments, you will notice BJP is far ahead in terms of employment generation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/provided-6-65l-jobs-in-4yrs-3-times-more-than-sp-govt/articleshow/84694031.cms||---

---||Delhi||Rs 293 crore given to North Delhi municipal corporation for salaries: Satyendar Jain||NEW DELHI: Urban development minister Satyendar Jain on Friday said the Kejriwal government had given an advance of Rs 293 core to North Delhi Municipal Corporation to disburse salaries to its employees. The fund-starved corporation is often unable to pay its employees, including sanitation workers, on time, prompting them to resort to protests. The government released the funds on Thursday. “We hope that the north corporation pays the pending salaries as soon as possible. We have given them an advance for the next instalment, which is not due yet,” Jain said. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor, however, claimed the amount was part of the basic tax assignment fund for the current quarter. “Delhi government has not released any specific advance amount for salary and minister Satyendra Jain’s statement in this context is misleading,” he alleged. A case related to the release of funds by Delhi government to the corporation is being heard by Delhi high court, Kapoor said, claiming that the amount should have been released 22 days ago. The three BJP-run municipal corporations and the AAP government have been locked in a battle over funds for years. While the AAP government claims that it has been releasing more funds to the corporations as compared to previous governments, BJP alleges Delhi government is starving the corporations of funds to hamper their work. The civic polls are due in early 2022. Meanwhile, criticising the central government over the farmers’ issue, Jain said, “It is unfortunate and shameful that Union ministers are using bad words to refer to our food providers, our farmers.” The minister also alleged that Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta, who had claimed that his residence in Patel Nagar was attacked by Aam Aadmi Party workers on Thursday, was doing a drama. “It is being rumoured that people from Aam Aadmi Party had attacked Adesh Gupta’s house. He just alleged that this attack had happened. I feel it is all just a drama,” Jain said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rs-293cr-given-to-n-corpn-for-salaries-jain/articleshow/84689283.cms||---

---||Aurangabad||Pune: Trio assault teacher near National Chemical Laboratory gate||PUNE: Three men in a car intercepted an assistant professor (29) from Aurangabad when he was walking from the National Chemical Laboratory gate to the University Chowk around 1.30am on July 20, assaulted him and fled with his cellphone after it fell on the road. The victim had reached the National Chemical Laboratory (NCL) gate in an autorickshaw (hired from Wakdewadi) for staying with his friend after arriving in the city from Aurangabad by bus around 12.30am, the Chatushrungi police said. When he called his friend, the latter told him that he was standing at the wrong gate and he should walk towards the university, from where he could be picked up. As the assistant professor started walking, the trio came in a car from the rear and started an altercation with him on some flimsy ground. One of them attacked him, the police said. The victim suffered cut injuries to his left thumb and left thigh, the police said. The assistant professor on Thursday registered a police complaint. The police have invoked a charge under Section 329 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt) of the Indian Penal Code against the trio and are searching for them. The police said the victim had pursued M Tech from the Savitribai Phule Pune University. He started from Aurangabad for Pune in a bus on the evening of July 19 to collect his varsity leaving certificate and related documents. He reached Wakdewadi in Pune around 12.30am on July 20. From there, he hired an autorickshaw to the NCL gate. Citing the FIR, a police officer said, “The three men were travelling in a grey sedan in high speed. They stopped on seeing the victim walking alone around 1am. One of the suspects in the rear seat had a knife. The victim raised an alarm, but the man having the knife did not utter a word. He attacked the assistant professor with the knife on the latter’s left hand and left thigh.” Senior inspector Rajkumar Waghchavre said on Friday, “The victim’s phone slipped from his hands and his specs fell on the road. The assailant picked up the cellphone worth Rs6,000 and sped away towards the University Chowk. The victim later narrated the incident to his friend, who rushed him to a private hospital for treatment. He was later shifted to another hospital, from where he was discharged on Thursday. He later visited the police station. We have not lodged an FIR related to robbery because the assailant did not snatch the cellphone and nor did rob cash or valuables.” Sub-inspector Mohandas Jadhav, who is investigating the case, said, “The victim said in his statement that the assailant seemed to be aged around 30 years. He was wearing black shirt and trousers. The injured victim could not note down the car’s registration number because it was dark. We did not find CCTV cameras at the spot. We are analysing CCTV cameras at other places, working on certain clues and conducting technical investigations. We hope to detect the case at the earliest.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/trio-assault-teacher-near-ncl-gate/articleshow/84698433.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh Cabinet rejig: Ministers unlikely to be purged||LUCKNOW: As the Yogi Adityanath government now appears to go for a cabinet expansion, what looks now certain is that no existing minister would be dropped. With the big poll battle just eight months away, this would send a wrong signal, feels the BJP think tank. So, it will use the addition of five to seven new ministers and nomination of four MLCs to plug the loose ends in the organisation. However, a final decision on the reshuffle of ministers is yet to be taken. Sources said that while one section in the government is of the view that some ministers should be shifted on the basis of their performance, another believes that there is not much time for a minister to prove his mettle in a new department in around six months. According to sources, in a bid to balance the caste and regional factors, around 12 permutations and combinations have been sent to the central BJP for a final approval. Sources said that whether Jitin Prasada, who recently switched over from Congress to BJP, be only made MLC through nomination or be inducted in Yogi cabinet is one major decision which the Central leadership has to take. The nomination of Prasada to the upper house is almost certain. Similarly, Central leadership will also decide the fate of NISHAD Party chief Dr Sanjay Nishad. The state unit has reportedly sent several proposals for him. His nomination to Vidhan Parishad and induction to the state cabinet, or a chairman's post at any board or corporation are few options being toyed for him. The Central leadership may also show its inclination for an insider Nishad neta. Besides Brahmin and Nishad, smaller castes and sub-castes could also be given the representation. Party sources said that focus is on smaller castes like Bind, Balmiki, Sonker, Kashyap, Shakya etc. Adding to it, MLAs from the region which have not been represented might get priority along with the caste, sources said. The name of Sangeeta Bind Balwant, an MLA from Ghazipur, is doing the rounds for ministerial berth. Similarly, MLA from Khair constituency in Aligarh district, Anup Pradhan and former Rajya Sabha member Vidya Sagar Sonker can also be considered. After the death of minister Vijay Kumar Kashyap, the BJP think tank is planning to elevate someone from Kashyap community also. Names of Ram Chandra Pradhan and Krishna Paswan, MLA from Khaga constituency in Fatehpur are also on the probables' list. However, after the elevation of Kaushal Kishore as minister of state in the Modi cabinet, chances of another pasi getting a ministerial berth in UP are dismal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cabinet-rejig-mins-unlikely-to-be-purged/articleshow/84694088.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Flood water rose 13ft in Mahad, 80,000 sans power as towers fell||MUMBAI: The state reported over 11 landslides in 48 hours across five districts. Besides the one at Taliye, landslides in Kevnale and Govele-Sutarwadi villages in Raigad killed 11 persons. In Ratnagiri, six died—four at Dhamnand and Bormani villages of Khed and two at Parshuramghat village of Chiplun. As many as 17 persons are missing from these locations. Satara authorities said there was a landslide in the Pasarni ghat of the district, which leads to Panchgani and Mahabaleshwar hill stations. It has significantly affected vehicular movement on the key road. District collector Shekhar Singh said: “The road damage is proving a major hurdle. The rescue teams are finding it difficult to reach the landslide sites. Many are missing. We have sought an additional team of NDRF.” Mishaps were reported from Sindhudurg on Friday, but did not result in fatalities. In Kolhapur, alarmingly, the Panchaganga was flowing at 55ft on Friday night, way above the danger level of 49ft. Kolhapur guardian minister Satej Patil said flooding in the district was set be to worse than in 2019. Ratnagiri guardian minister Uday Samant said Navaja had received 726mm rainfall and Chiplun taluka, one of the worst-hit sites on Thursday, 600mm. “When we talk of Chiplun, we have to count the actual rainfall here and also in the hills that bring water to the town,” he said, referring to record rain in Mahabaleshwar over the past few days. Over 1,500 people in Ratnagiri and another 1,000 in Raigad have been rescued from flooded areas and shifted into shelters. The deaths of the eight Covid patients in Ratnagiri were reported due to disruption in oxygen supply due to flooding. Relatives and rescue team have alleged that the hospital was flooded and equipment malfunctioned due to water-logging “An IAF helicopter rescued two persons from Chiplun and it airlifted 10 NDRF personnel to Ratnagiri from Mumbai on Friday,” said Cdr Mehul Karnik, PRO, defence minister. Talking about Mahad, Mahesh Sanap, rescue head of Wilder West, said: “During our operations, we noticed 12 to 13 feet water reaching to the top of the first floor. The water has receded now.” Though water has receded in Ratnagiri and Raigad, rescue operations are underway and villages by rivers continue to be on high alert. Two 220KV towers of state transmission utility MSETCL collapsed in the heavy downpour in Raigad district, resulting in plunging 80,000 consumers into darkness in Mahad and Poladpur on Friday. Repair is on in war footing. A portion of the old bridge over the Vashishti river has collapsed, resulting in further closure of the Mumbai-Goa highway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-flood-water-rose-13ft-in-mahad-80k-sans-power-as-towers-fell/articleshow/84694070.cms||---

However, seeing that other states are reopening schools, we will review how it goes for them and plan accordingly,” Kejriwal said after inaugurating the country’s first ISO 9001-certified MLA office in Timarpur constituency represented by AAP’s Dilip Pandey. “We have been receiving a lot of messages from parents regarding the safety of children and want to assure them that the safety of children will be our priority,” Kejriwal added. On the shortage of vaccines in Delhi, the chief minister said, “The Centre needs to rethink its system of supplying vaccines to provide the states with more stocks.” Dedicating the MLA office to the public, Kejriwal said the real certificate would be their trust and confidence. Asking them to give feedback on its functioning, he said, “This is not just MLA Dilip Pandey’s office, this is your own office. Whenever you face a difficulty, you can get it solved here. Even if you don’t have a problem, you are always welcome to have a cup of tea and talk.” He added, “Here people will find a person allotted to handle each kind of grievance. The streamlined process is the speciality of this office.” The MLA office prepared a quality manual and conducted risk assessment before attaining the certificate for three years. Through a grievance management software and an app, people will receive updates through SMSs and WhatsApp. “The office has been certified after complying with rigorous international quality standards of International Organisation for Standardisation. This is the first office in the country to get certified,” Kejriwal said. Pandey said the biggest certificate was the one given by the people. “We always solicit your guidance and will continue to work to gain the certification of your trust.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/keeping-eye-on-other-states-for-school-reopening/articleshow/84689339.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Police question Shilpa Shetty in porn case, link Raj Kundra to betting||MUMBAI: The city crime branch carried out a search of actor Shilpa Shetty’s house in Juhu in connection with the pornography case involving her husband Raj Kundra on Friday. Shetty was a director in Kundra’s Viaan Industries which is under the scanner. A police team recorded Shetty’s statement on when and why she resigned from the post. Police may now probe Shetty’s bank accounts to check if proceeds from subscriptions to an app named Hotshots linked to Kundra’s firm and showing films with sexual content, landed in her accounts. The crime branch has called for forensic auditing of Kundra’s accounts; they have found transfers into a Yes Bank account from Mercury International (dealing in online betting and casino gaming) from South Africa. Police have also invoked IPC section 201 for destruction of evidence after a forensic examination of eight servers seized from Kundra’s companies JL Stream and Viaan Industries showed deletion of data Seeking extension of Kundra’s custody, police cited diversion of monies earned from the app as well as Kundra’s links to online betting. The remand plea said transactions showed he received huge tranches of dollars and pounds which needed probing. Kundra, also known as Ripu Sudan Kundra (45), and his IT head Ryan Thorpe (43) were produced before a magistrate on Friday. They were arrested on Monday. The court has sent them to police custody till next Tuesday. The defence lawyer argued that, "Videos on which the crime branch case is based, do not fall under the pornographic content category. These videos and photos mentioned in the first chargesheet don't show 'actual act of coitus' or 'actual act of intercourse'." Defence lawyer Adv Abad Ponda said, "OTT platforms like Netflix and Amazon have similar content. Shows like Sex life and Four Shots have similar content. I don't understand why Mumbai police is going after Kundra but not after Netflix and Amazon." Hotshot earned 4,000-10,000 pounds monthly excluding expenses, police said. In the remand plea, police cited an alleged chat from Kundra's phone where he spoke of selling 119 adult films for $1.2 million. The police alleged that after the Hotshot App was removed by YouTube, Google Play and Apple, Kundra created another app called Bollyfame. Police said they have examined 119 video clips from it and most are porn clips. “Prima facie investigation has found that Raj Kundra founded Armsprime Media Pvt Ltd which through London-based Kenrin Pvt Ltd bought Hotshots app to upload objectionable videos on social media. Kundra's company Viaan Industries and its employees were involved in maintenance of the app,” the remand plea said. In February, the crime branch raided a bungalow in Madh Island and allegedly busted a porn film-making racket. This was the case which eventually led to Kundra’s arrest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-police-question-shilpa-shetty-in-porn-case-link-kundra-to-betting/articleshow/84695227.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Senior inspector Rajkumar Waghchavre said, “Usha Kate, a homemaker from Pimple Saudagar, had taken a Rs30 lakh loan from Gaware and his wife to help her son Mahesh start a cow breeding business in 2018. Kate repaid the loan with interest, but a dispute broke out after the moneylender claimed there were outstanding dues. The suspects started demanding more than Rs80lakh and started harassing her and Mahesh.” Waghchavre said, “In her FIR, Kate said Gaware summoned Mahesh to his Aundh residence last December and threatened him at gunpoint — even fired in the air. Kate claimed that two other suspects put guns on her son’s head, threatened to kill him, forced him to sign and give his thumb impression on stamp papers and blank documents. The suspects then confined him at a place in Deccan Gymkhana and beat him up.” The senior inspector said, “Kate later came to know that her 7.5acre plot in Raigad district had been transferred in the name of one of the women suspects and filed a complaint with revenue department, before moving a local civil court, claiming that she had not sold the land. Kate told police that Mahesh had registered a case against four suspects in January.” A charge sheet was filed, but Gaware and others started harassing Kate and her son, demanding that they hand over their property in Pimple Saudagar and withdraw the complaint. Kate approached the police and filed a case. We have invoked charges of attempted murder and extortion under the Money Lending Act, Arms Act and Maharashtra Police Act,” Waghchavre said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/couple-held-six-booked-over-attempt-to-murder-extortion/articleshow/84689297.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh now booked in Thane extortion case||THANE: Thane police registered a case of extortion and abduction against former city police chief Param Bir Singh, a serving deputy police commissioner and three others at Kopri police station on Friday, reports Nishikant Karlikar. This is the second case filed against Singh, the first one lodged at Marine Drive police station on Thursday. In the Thane case, DCP Parag Manere, developer Sanjay Punamia, businessman Sunil Jain and one Manoj Ghotkar have also been named as accused. Punamia and Jain were arrested in the Marine Drive case and are in police custody. Ghotkar’s name had featured in the first case too. The complaint was lodged by Sharad Agrawal, nephew of developer Shyam Sunder Agrawal, the complainant in the Marine Drive case. Both the complaints are on similar lines. According to the complainant, between November 2016 and May 2018, Punmiya, Jain, Ghotkar, Manere and Singh, in connivance with each other, initially “extorted” Rs 2 crore from him. A police officer said the demands were made at Singh’s official residence in Kopri’s Bara Bangla area and Punamiya’s Marine Drive flat. Punmiya and Agrawal were business partners and after the latter’s arrest in the Urban Land Ceiling Regulation (Act) scam, police demanded money for his release, it is alleged. The complainant further said the accused forcibly made him sign documents to grab his land located in Bhayander township, which was in the name of his mother Draupadi Devi. Its market rate was Rs 8 crore, but the accused threatened and made a purchase deed of Rs 1 crore. The complainant further alleged that the accused threatened to book Shyam Sunder Agrawal under MCOCA and grabbed his land in Nashik and Sinnar, a police officer said. Besides, the accused collectively extorted Rs 4.68 crore along with two land parcels of varying sizes. The complainant was “abducted” and kept at a crime branch unit near the commissioner’s office in a bid to pressure him and pay up the money, it is alleged. Singh was police commissioner of Thane during this period. Jaijit Singh, the Thane police commissioner said, “At present, two accused have been arrested by the Mumbai police. Once their police custody gets over, we shall seek their custody for further investigation. If required, we shall call everybody mentioned in the offence registered. The evidence pertaining to the case will be collected as it is just a day that the case is registered. I shall go by the law and there is no pressure.” Singh and Manere were not available for their comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/param-bir-now-booked-in-thane-extortion-case/articleshow/84695238.cms||---

The government had imposed flood cess to raise funds for the state’s reconstruction after the floods of 2018. The cess was launched as 1% in addition to the goods and services tax, after clearance from the GST council. It was then decided to continue the cess for two years. The flood cess that was announced in the budget speech of 2019-20, was aimed at raising approximately Rs 1,200 crore each year. As per the figures till March 31 this year, the government has already raised Rs 1,705.24 crore through the flood cess. The government expects that the final figures are expected to cross Rs 2,000 crore. The prices of home appliances, electronic goods, vehicles, etc, are likely to reduce once the cess is removed. The cess is currently applicable to all products with GST rates of 12%, 18% and 28%. Products with GST rates zero percent to 5% have been excluded. Also, traders, who are presumptive taxpayers with an annual turnover of up to Rs 1.5 crore, are also excluded from the cess.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/flood-cess-to-end-on-july-31/articleshow/84689375.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The BMC on Friday said that following an investigation, the police handed over a list of citizens suspected to have been given fake vaccine doses. After verifying the names, it was decided to hold a vaccination drive for the residents of Hiranandani Heritage society on S V Road. The fake vaccine drive racket came to light after the 390 residents of Kandivli society approached the police on June 15 and complained about vaccine certificates not being generated. Subsequently, over half a dozen of bogus vaccination camps were traced across the city. So far, 14 people have been arrested, including Dr Shivraj Pataria (61) and his wife Neeta who run Charkop-based Shivam Hospital which is at the centre of the scam. The hospital has been sealed by the BMC. The arrested accused have allegedly confessed that the vials used in these fake vaccination drives contained saline water. BMC officials said on July 8, they had sent letters to the director of public health services and additional secretary of the ministry of family health welfare seeking guidance for the protocol for re-vaccination of those who have supposedly received fake doses. The officials said that others such ‘victims’ will also be inoculated against Covid in a phased manner. In case of those who have received a vaccine certificate, the officials said that for now they would be registered using an alternative number and once the guidelines come from the Centre, action would be taken accordingly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-to-re-vaccinate-victims-of-fake-drive-from-kandivli-hsg-society-today/articleshow/84695245.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 49 dead, 47 missing in Taliye village landslide||NAVI MUMBAI: A string of landslides triggered by the rain fury in Konkan over the past two days has claimed scores of lives. The worst was at Taliye village in Raigad’s Mahad taluka, which has so far claimed as many as 49 lives. Another 12 are injured and 47 are missing. The landslide took place at around 5pm on Thursday, but till late at night rescuers hadn’t been able to reach the spot, as reported by TOI in its July 23 edition. An NDRF team airlifted from Mumbai had to return as the Raigad administration did not provide a landing facility. Villagers said they received no alert from the government. “No advance disaster alert was given to the villagers. Our tribal hamlet has 45 houses with a population of over 120. Boulders from the hill fell from a height of 100 feet in the landslide,” said Milind Gangawane, who lives at Taliye. He estimated 90 villagers could be trapped under the debris. However, relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar claimed that the locals had been shifted a few days ago. “The villagers were shifted to a safer location by the local administration 4-5 days ago but they moved back on their own after the rains receded,” he said. The NDRF said one of its three teams had to return from Mahad. “An NDRF team had to return to Mumbai from Mahad as the district administration could not provide a landing facility on Friday evening. Another NDRF team has reached Taliye village by road. One more team has reached Dhamnand site (another landslide) in Khed taluka and started rescue operations,” said Pavan Gaur, deputy commandant, NDRF, 5th Bn, Pune. “The NDRF claims are being looked into,” said Raigad district information officer Manoj Sanap. The BJP alleged that government authorities were late in reaching Taliye village. “Opposition leaders have reached here. But even 20 hours after the incident, no local official is here. Not even the tehsildar. If the administration and the NDRF had reached on time, more lives could have been saved,” said BJP leader Praveen Darekar. The government, in turn, accused the Opposition of playing politics. “The heavy rains and poor condition of roads have impacted rescue operations. The Opposition should not politicise the issue,” said Wadettiwar.

SAD leader Harish Rai Dhandha, while terming the verdict as the victory of human rights, said now Bains’ plea had been rejected, the government should take action against the police officers, who had shielded him for eight months and had even refused to register a case against the LIP legislator for four days after a local court directed them to do so. He said the minister’s role in shielding Bains should also be probed.Dhandha also appreciated the courage shown by the victim, a 44-year-old widow, who he alleged had to face threats and intimidation from Bains. “Now, we are confident that justice will be done in the case with the arrest of Simarjit Bains,” he added. District president of SAD, Ranjit Dhillon, said, “We have given 72 hours ultimatum to the police for arresting Bains because now they do not have any excuse. If police will not act, we will discuss among party leaders and plan agitation against police and the Congress government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/sad-demands-arrest-of-simarjit-bains-in-rape-case/articleshow/84694178.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Cancel bail of Rs 3kcr ponzi scam accused: ED files plea in high court||Chandigarh: The enforcement directorate (ED) has moved a petition before the Punjab and Haryana High Court seeking cancellation of bail given to two accused Bansi Lal and Radhe Shyam, directors of the Future Maker Life Care Private Limited, and 10 others in a 2019 money laundering case. The petition was filed by Krishan Kumar, assistant director, directorate of enforcement, under Section 439 (2) Code of Criminal Procedure for cancellation of regular bail granted to the accused on April 8 by a Panchkula special court. Arvind Moudgil, the senior counsel for ED, submitted in the application, “The court (Panchkula special court) has committed grave error in granting the bail to the accused persons merely on the account that they had joined the investigation and not arrested by the investigating agency by invoking Section 19 of PMLA, 2002, whereas new facts and circumstances have emerged and the persons have never assisted and cooperated with the agency.” Moudgil also submitted the case pertains to a fraud amount of Rs 3,000 crore, out of which only Rs 260 crore has been attached by the ED and the investigation is still going on. The counsel submitted that the case involves active participation of all these persons and their interrogation is necessary to unearth the money embezzled by them. The high court has now fixed August 3 as the next date of hearing in this matter. The ED on January 23 filed a prosecution complaint --- equivalent to a police charge-sheet --- against Radhe Shyam and Bansi Lal of Hisar-based multi-level marketing (MLM)-scheme promoting companies Future Maker Lifecare Private Limited and FMLC Global Marketing Private Ltd in the case. Around 31 lakh investors were cheated by the companies through the ponzi scheme involving a fraud of around Rs 3,000 crore. The ED had filed the prosecution complaint seeking punishment to the accused and confiscation of attached assets of Rs 261.35 crore. Fake Covid FIR On July 20, a Special PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) court of Panchkula had directed staff to lodge an FIR against accused Ram Singh under the relevant provisions in accordance with law at the Sector 5 police station for submitting a fake Covid positive report to seek seeking exemption from court. Dr Sushil Kumar Garg, special judge under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), Haryana at Panchkula court, had also cancelled bail of accused Ram Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cancel-bail-of-rs-3kcr-ponzi-scam-accused-ed-files-plea-in-high-court/articleshow/84689378.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The process for engaging 300 e-buses by Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) is already underway, and by next year, the capital is likely to overtake Pune as the Indian city with the maximum number of e-buses. Sources said the department had finalised tenders for 465 e-buses. There are plans to get a total of 1,000 e-buses under the Cluster model and, along with the approved 300 buses of DTC, Delhi is set to overtake Maharashtra’s Pune, which has 150 e-buses and plans to induct 500 more, officials said. On March 26, the Delhi cabinet approved engagement of 300 low-floor electric AC buses by DTC. While 118 buses are to arrive in October, 100 by November and 60 by December. The remaining 20 buses are likely to reach by January 2022. The e-buses will be parked at depots in Subhash Place, Mayapuri, Rohini, Rajghat and Mundela Kalan. However, due to the second wave of Covid-19, the delivery of e-buses for DTC, along with the creation of supporting infrastructure such as charging stations, have been delayed by over a month. Under the scheme, the operator will maintain the buses and provide the driver, while DTC will depute its conductor and bear the cost of electricity consumption.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/transport-dept-may-float-tender-for-engaging-over-400-e-buses/articleshow/84689432.cms||---

After the collision, the six persons on the two bikes were tossed in the air and landed on stones with serious head injuries. Four of them were declared dead at the hospital while one passed away during treatment. Two men in the SUV also sustained minor injuries while the driver fled the spot. Rajendra Kumar, 55, was a resident of Kasganj district. He along with his two sons Manoj and Jitendra were on a bike on the way to Shahjahanpur to meet a distant relative. In Budaun, Rajendra’s cousin Deewari Lal joined them along with his sons Ashok Kumar and Anil.

---||Mumbai||90 killed, 70 missing as rains play havoc in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: At least 90 people have died and nearly 70 are missing after rain-related tragedies—largely landslides—reported across the state on Friday following incessant, and sometimes record-drowning, showers. Raigad, the worst affected district, reported 60 deaths in three landslide incidents, including the worst at Taliye village in Mahad taluka that has claimed 49 lives. Another 47 people were feared trapped under the debris. While rescue teams were delayed in their bid to access the site, villagers claimed they had got no advance alert. However, the government said the villagers had been shifted to safety but had come back. PM Narendra Modi announced Rs 2 lakh for the families of the victims of the Raigad landslips, and Rs 50,000 as compensation to the injured. CM Uddhav Thackeray announced an ex gratia of Rs 5 lakh for the families of victims of all the 11 landslides since Thursday. Rain and flooding due to raging rivers both began receding in the Konkan districts, especially Ratnagiri and Raigad, but the administration said they will remain on alert. The rescuers’ focus is turning to western Maharashtra’s Satara and Sangli, where an IMD red alert for heavy rain is in place. Satara and Kolhapur reported 13 deaths due to landslides and other rain accidents and 26 people were missing, while nearly 85,000 people have been shifted to safer places, largely from Sangli and Kolhapur, as levels of the Krishna are rising. Eleven passengers had a lucky escape as their bus was almost swept into the swollen Chikotra river in Kolhapur early on Friday when the driver ignored warnings and drove on to a flooded bridge. He has been booked. Ratnagiri district reported 17 deaths—nine due to landslides and floods, and eight of Covid patients in a private hospital that was affected by the floods. Over 1,500 people in Ratnagiri and another 1,000 in Raigad have been rescued from flooded areas and shifted into shelters. The flooding also affected infrastructure, mainly roads and railway tracks, but also electricity pylons. About 80,000 consumers were without power in Raigad’s Poladpur and Mahad on Friday after two high-voltage electricity towers collapsed. Repair is on in war footing. The state reported over 11 landslides in 48 hours across five districts. Besides the one at Taliye, landslides in Kevnale and Govele-Sutarwadi villages in Raigad killed 11 persons. In Ratnagiri, six died—four at Dhamnand and Bormani villages of Khed and two at Parshuramghat village of Chiplun. As many as 17 persons are feared missing from these locations. Satara authorities said there was a landslide in the Pasarni ghat of the district, which leads to Panchgani and Mahabaleshwar hill stations. It has significantly affected vehicular movement on the key road. District collector Shekhar Singh said: “The road damage is proving a major hurdle. The rescue teams are finding it difficult to reach the landslide sites. There is no mobile network in the hilly areas. Many are missing. We have sought an additional team of NDRF.” Mishaps were reported from Sindhudurg district on Friday, but did not result in fatalities. In Kolhapur, alarmingly, the Panchaganga was flowing at 55ft on Friday night, way above the danger level of 49ft. Kolhapur guardian minister Satej Patil said flooding in the district was set be to worse than in 2019. Ratnagiri guardian minister Uday Samant said Navaja had received 726mm rainfall and Chiplun, one of the worst-hit sites on Thursday, 600mm. “When we talk of Chiplun, we have to count the actual rainfall here and also in the hills that bring water to the town,” he said, referring to record rain in Mahabaleshwar over the past few days. The deaths of the eight Covid patients in Ratnagiri were reported due to disruption in oxygen supply due to flooding. Relatives and rescue team have alleged that the hospital was flooded and equipment malfunctioned due to water-logging “An IAF helicopter rescued two persons from Chiplun and it airlifted 10 NDRF personnel to Ratnagiri from Mumbai on Friday,” said Cdr Mehul Karnik, PRO, defence minister. Talking about another badly-hit township, Mahad, Mahesh Sanap, rescue head of Wilder West, said: “During our rescue operations, we noticed 12 to 13 feet water reaching to the top of the first floor. The flood water has receded now.” Though water has receded in Ratnagiri and Raigad, rescue operations are underway and villages on the banks of rivers continue to be on high alert. Two 220KV towers of state transmission utility MSETCL collapsed in the heavy and continuous downpour in Raigad district, resulting in power outages in Mahad and Poladpur on Friday. “One NDRF team from Pune and two from Odisha have been sent to Sindhudurg. Villagers along the Tilari river have been put on high alert for the next five days,” said Hemant Chavan, district information officer. A portion of the old bridge over the Vashishti river has collapsed, resulting in further closure of the Mumbai-Goa highway. While Kolhapur police booked the bus driver who endangered the lives of 11 passengers, a Ratnagiri-bound bus of the Karnataka state transport service got stranded in water on the Kolhapur-Panhala road. As many as 25 passengers were safely evacuated, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/90-killed-70-missing-as-rains-play-havoc-in-maha/articleshow/84695254.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Woman clicking selfie while holding a gun shoots herself||LUCKNOW: A 26-year-old woman in Hardoi died of a gunshot wound while trying to click a selfie with a single-barrel gun of her father-in-law on Thursday night. The incident took place when the gun, which was loaded and the unsuspecting woman placed her finger on the trigger to pose for the selfie, went off. The bullet hit the victim woman Radhika Gupta on her neck and she was rushed to hospital where the doctors pronounced her dead on arrival. The victim 's father-in-law, Rajesh Gupta, told police that Radhika was married to his son Akash Gupta in May 2021. The victim's father however has expressed apprehension of foup play and lodged a police complaint in this regard. “We have a small jewelry business in the town. On Thursday, around 3 pm, my son Akash brought back our 12-bore single-barrel gun that was submitted to the local police station during panchayat elections,” said Gupta, "the gun was kept in the second-floor room where Radhika was trying to click selfie while holding it." “Around 4 pm, we heard the gunshot and ran upstairs to find that Radhika was hit by the bullet and rushed her to the nearest hospital where she succumbed to injuries. The phone's camera was found switched on in selfie mode,” Gupta told police. SHO, Shahabad, Shivshankar Singh, said that the 12-bore single-barrel gun and mobile phone of the victim have been seized and sent for forensic examination. “We have also recovered a photo of the victim with the gun, said to be clicked seconds before she was dead,” said, SHO Singh. The body has been sent for post-mortem examination to be performed by a panel of doctors. “We have noticed only a gunshot on the body and prima facie no signs of scuffle were found on the victim’s body,” said the SHO. Police said that Akash was also interrogated who said that his wife got too excited seeing the gun. “She had already taken photos with the gun, but she wanted more. Hence, during another selfie attempt the trigger got pressed,” he said. SHO Singh also said that the father of victim woman, Rakesh, has expressed apprehension of a foul play in the case and lodged a complaint of dowry death in the local police station. A senior officer said that forensic experts will be asked to probe the case and if the need arises, then the crime scene would be recreated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/woman-clicking-selfie-while-holding-a-gun-shoots-herself/articleshow/84694182.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty
---||Nagpur||Many students will take Std XI common entrance test, say academics in Maharashtra||NAGPUR: Even though the common entrance test (CET) for Std XI is not mandatory, academics feel that majority of students will appear for it due to priority in admissions. The CET will be held in August and just for this year, it will be the gateway to state board affiliated junior colleges because theory papers were cancelled due to the pandemic. Kabir Rawlekar, vice-principal of Ambedkar College (Deekshabhoomi), said, “Those who appear for the CET will be given priority during admissions. After their admission process is done, the vacant seats will then be thrown open to the non-CET students. So due to this clause, you can say that it’s almost mandatory.” An official, who is an integral part of the common admission process (CAP) for junior college admissions confirmed the same. “Yes. Even though CAP will be the gateway for admission in Nagpur city, CET candidates will be taken in first,” said the official. CAP is the mandatory route for junior college admissions in certain cities of Maharashtra. For rural areas, the admission process is direct. TOI was the first to report about CET being introduced for Std XI admissions. On May 22, TOI published a report about Maharashtra government’s plans to conduct a CET for Std XI admissions because of there being no proper benchmark in absence of the traditional SSC exam. Due to the devastating second wave of Covid-19, Maharashtra cancelled its Std X board exams. To provide a uniform platform for assessing marks for Std XI admissions, the state education department formulated the plan for a CET. A state board principal told TOI that rules should have been different for central board students. “This CET is for admissions to our junior colleges, so why should our own students appear for it? We have a heavy influx of CBSE and ICSE students shifting to state board, and it’s for them that this CET must be held. By saying that even our students must appear for CET, the state government is sending a message that they don’t trust SSC assessment done by schools,” said the principal. Another principal said it will be interesting to see how CBSE schools give admissions. “Some have started provisional admissions even though their results have not come yet. So, this CET should actually have been only for non-state board students,” said the principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/many-students-will-take-std-xi-cet-say-academics/articleshow/84689446.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Similarly, the daily Covid cases have dipped to under 100 since the last five days, despite a spurt in testing. Meanwhile, the NMMC has launched a drive to test all members of the housing society where even a single positive case is found. On July 20, the infectivity rate had dropped below 1% , the lowest in several months. Just 55 cases were reported from the 7,300 tests, bringing the positivity rate to a mere .075%.  According to NMMC sources, the dip in infectivity rate has been attributed to aggressive testing while targeting the hotspot and containment areas apart from random testing being conducted at housing societies. With the daily average of 6,500 tests, average positive cases stand at 90 daily, bringing the positivity rate to 1.38% from 3% a month ago. Based on the weekly data, the daily cases are fluctuating in the range of 55 to 100 with daily tests between 6,000 and 8,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/infectivity-rate-plummets-below-1-5-in-navi-mumbai/articleshow/84695266.cms||B B Nayak

The previous highest 24-hour July rainfall was 439.8mm on July 7, 1977,” said Pulak Guhathakurta, IMD, Pune. Two weather systems, one along the west coast of India and the other in the Bay of Bengal, have brought unprecedented rain to Maharashtra in the last two days, triggering landslides and flooding. All four rivers that originate at Mahabaleshwar — Krishna, Koyna, Venna, Savitri — are in spate. The flooding, landslides and devastation over the past two days is unlike that of 2019, when large amounts of water were discharged from dams. Incessant and heavy rain in these districts of Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli, Ratnagiri and Raigad has caused havoc now. As the aerial distance between Mahabaleshwar and Mahad (in Raigad district), Navaja and Chiplun is not much, heavy rainfall here brings water down to these towns. The Poladpur weather station in Raigad district recorded 305mm rainfall in 24 hours till 8.30 am on Friday, the third-highest July rainfall. Guhathakurta said: “Since July 18, Mahabaleshwar has received heavy to extremely heavy rainfall for six consecutive days. Maharashtra has recorded widespread rains, not only in ghats and west Maharashtra, but also in the interiors.” All three met subdivisions of Maharashtra — Konkan & Goa, Madhya Maharashtra and Marathwada — have got excess rainfall from June 1 to July 23 with Mumbai suburbs, Ratnagiri, Beed, Jalna and Parbhani getting large excess rainfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mahabaleshwar-gets-almost-60cm-rain-in-24-hours-its-highest-ever/articleshow/84694245.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Chandigarh||Ludhiana MC yet to start on 3 multi-storey parking lots planned at smart city launch||LUDHIANA: Although the industrial town registers maximum number of vehicles every year, parking spaces available are not enough. The civic body had planned multi-storey parking lots at three locations in the city at the very beginning of smart city mission, but till now not even a single parking lot has been constructed by the officials.  More parking lots are required in the city for reducing parking at roadside and traffic mess afterwards. The municipal corporation (MC) had planned to construct multi-storey parking lots at Feroze Gandhi market and Books Market while an underground parking lot was planned at Ferozepur Road. For the Feroze Gandhi Market parking lot, everything was finalised and detailed project report was also finalised. For this project, the officials had to stop the tender invitation last year because of certain objections raised by the senior officials in Chandigarh and officials were also told to revise the parking cost. It is still in limbo whereas for other two projects, for Ferozepur Road, the civic officials were in tussle with National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) because NHAI is constructing the elevated road project there and they were doubtful about underground parking. As far as Books Market is concerned, the civic officials had to get land from zila parishad but they could not get it. Requesting anonymity one of the officials claimed that except Feroze Gandhi Market other two projects are not in priority list as of now due to certain issues and multi-storey parking at Feroze Gandhi Market is kept at hold because already construction work is going on at many locations in city already. He said it would create problems for the commuters and residents. However, when contacted, mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu he said due to Covid-19 certain projects slowed down, but now they will pick up the pace so more projects will also be taken up. Meanwhile, a resident of Model Town Charanjit Singh, said, “There are so many vehicles at the city roads but when it comes to find parking there is hardly any space so people park at roadsides causing traffic jams.” He said the authorities should pay attention towards these basic requirements as well. Another resident from Civil Lines, Drishant Kapoor said the smart city lacks even basic things for the residents and parking space in the city markets is one of the important things. “Outside every important market or other places where people visit in large number, parking lots should be there so that people should park their vehicles in parking and then visit market, “ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-yet-to-start-on-3-multi-storey-parking-lots-planned-at-smart-city-launch/articleshow/84694224.cms||---

The KMC authorities had taken such an initiative last year but could not continue it due to the Assembly polls. Now, the same project is getting renewed across the city in phases. According to plans, the KMC will set up a camp in an area of a particular ward and the civic officials from the borough concerned will be assigned to interact with the citizens. “Initially our officials from the borough will take note of the citizens’ problems relating to mutation of land or buildings. Later we will address all other civic problems in due course,” said a KMC official. The KMC will begin the Duare KMC programme from Saturday. The first camp will be set up in Azadgarh (Tollygunge) area, informed the KMC Board of Administrators (BoA) chairman Firhad Hakim. “After talking to our officers, the citizens need to submit their papers relating to their properties.

The heavy showers have disrupted road and rail lines and the state government immediately requested aerial reconnaissance and disaster relief assistance from the men in uniform. Over the last 24 hours, Indian Coast Guard crew flew over four sorties in the Chetak helicopters to assess the damage and to provide relief material to stranded locals. An advanced light helicopter from INS Hansa was deployed to Ratnagiri to assist in flood relief operations while another helicopter was sent to Mallapur in Karwar district to rescue four individuals who were stranded atop Hotel Highland surrounded by flood waters. The four individuals were airlifted to Ankola stadium. The Navy was also asked to help rescue a stranded family at Gangem, but the family refused to be evacuated as the water level was expected to recede. The coast guard’s rescue flights were over Dharbandora taluka and the choppers dropped off personnel, life jackets and buoys to aid search and rescue operations. The coast guard also distributed relief material, packed food and drinking water to stranded locals. The coast guard has also assembled a flood response team with rescue gear and kept them on standby to assist state government agencies.

In his letter to the chief secretary on Friday, Satheesan said that the “good service entry” that was cancelled for Salini O G, former under-secretary of revenue department, should be restored immediately. “Cancelling the good service entry of an official that was awarded after analyzing the official’s services is unheard of and strange. Such a decision is derogatory for a person who serves with honesty and dedication,” he said. The officer has also petitioned revenue minister K Rajan requesting withdrawal of adverse remarks about her in the order withdrawing her good service entry by the government. In her petition, Salini, who was transferred as assistant director in the directorate of general education (higher secondary), said that at least the remarks in the order be withdrawn even if the “good service entry” is cancelled.

The proposal had been made by the revenue department. While two bravehearts were with Delhi Police, three were with Indian Air Force and one was posted with Civil Defence. “Those who lost their lives in the line of duty cannot be compensated, but the family will get some help to honour their sacrifice. Delhi government stands with the families of all paramilitary, Army, police and civil defence personnel residing in Delhi,” said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. On July 25, 2020, Sanket Kaushik, an ACP with Delhi Police, was checking vehicles on Rajokri flyover when a speeding mini-truck coming from Gurgaon hit him. He was admitted to AIIMS in a critical condition and died due to his injuries. Another braveheart from Delhi Police, Vikas Kumar, was run over by a speeding car on September 15, 2016 while checking near Nehru Place. He was from Jhajjar district in Haryana. The car smashed through the barricade and hit him. He was admitted to AIIMS in a critical condition and passed away after 15 days. Civil defence personnel Parvesh Kumar was checking vehicles near Mangolpuri flyover on September 20, 2020 when he was hit by a truck. He died during treatment.

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: How ‘effort files’ help police nab fugitives using archival information||JAIPUR: The ‘effort files’ at Jaipur police stations contain complete records of fugitives and absconders that often surprise even outlaws. “Every cop who returns from the search has to fill in complete details of efforts made in pursuit of an absconder. These files are very helpful in arresting accused who have been running away for several decades,” said additional police commissioner, crime, Ajay Pal Lamba. Besides the family details, the ‘effort files’ keep detailed records of deaths in the absconder’s family, his genealogy, and even some astrologers that the accused might have consulted a long time back. According to Lamba, these files have helped police nab absconders in cases as old as 30 years. The cops may get transferred or retire, but the hunt continues. Sometimes as many as 20 policemen have laboured to fill up record sheets in pursuit of the outlaw. Often referred to as ‘kundli’ the ‘effort files’ have taken cops to peculiar places. One cop said that when one outlaw seemingly vanished from all records, he had to go to multiple cities to search death records to check if the accused was still alive. One time another cop went to locate education records of an absconder in a school that was closed a long time ago. “Sometimes even the wanted person may be ignorant of minor details of his or her own life. Our cops have even gone to Haridwar to search for cities and places where the accused’s relatives live,” Lamba said. Recently, the city police had learned that one of the accused who had been evading for the past 27 years was posing as a head priest in Haryana. The arrest was made possible after the police had located a distant relative through the effort file. The sources said that often ageing outlaws presume that the police had stopped searching for them. But the police officials believe that arresting absconders, proclaimed offenders and standing warranties are crucial to dispose of pendency. “Arresting all absconders is important. If there are multiple accused involved in a single crime and we have arrested all others barring one, then other accused also await justice. Also, courts also nudge for the arrest of the accused evading warrants,” Lamba said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/how-effort-files-help-police-nab-fugitives-using-archival-information/articleshow/84692097.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Daylight robbery: 2 rounded up by police||Mohali: Police rounded up two persons involved in a daylight armed robbery at the house of Muthoot Finance company regional manager. Zirakpur police, with support of the CIA, is likely to crack the case in the next 24 hours, sources in Mohali police said. Sources said one of the suspects is from Morinda and the other is from near Ludhiana. Police sources said they charted the route followed by the robbers by connecting CCTV footage from various locations and mobile tower dumps collected from the spot and learned that the two motorcycles changed their routes, with one moving towards Patiala and the other towards Morinda. Tracking the movement of the two, police reached Morinda, from where they rounded up one person. The other was rounded up from near Ludhiana on his disclosure. Tightlipped about the two suspects, SP (Rural) Dr Ravjot Kaur Grewal said, “We have got success to quite an extent in the case and are very close to cracking it. We have taken the support of CIA staff and picked up vital clues from the spot which are being connected.” The daylight armed robbery rocked Zirakpur on July 22 when four armed men broke into the house of the regional manager of Muthoot finance and looted gold jewellery after holding family members captive. The incident has been recorded in CCTV cameras of nearby buildings. Police have registered an FIR in which victims declared that they lost 30 tolas of gold jewellery as well as Rs 20,000 cash. The house is located at Sharma Enclave in Lohgarh area of Zirakpur. Four robbers armed with pistols and sharp-edged weapons came on two motorcycles. The house owner, Jaydev Goyal was away and his 60-year-old wife Naresh Rani, their 40-year-old son Kapil Goyal and a domestic help were present in the house at the time.

---||India||Rajya Sabha suspends unruly TMC MP but he refuses to leave House||NEW DELHI: TMC MP Santanu Sen, who had snatched papers from IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and then tore and flung them in Rajya Sabha on Thursday, was suspended from the Upper House for the remaining period of the monsoon session on Friday.  Parliamentary affairs minister V Muraleedharan moved a motion for Sen’s suspension, amidst continuing protests from the opposition on the Pegasus snooping controversy, which was promptly passed by a voice vote in Rajya Sabha and accepted by Chairperson M Venkaiah Naidu. Sen, however, did not budge from his seat despite directions to “withdraw from the House”, first by Naidu and then deputy chairperson Harivansh, leading to Rajya Sabha being repeatedly adjourned in the pre-lunch session.  Thereafter, it was adjourned for the day. Lok Sabha proceedings were adjourned following disruptions by Congress, DMK and TMC, with MPs “shaming” the government over the Pegasus row and farm laws. Shiv Sena did not join the disruptions. Lok Sabha saw brief moments of all-round unanimity when Birla extended best wishes to the Indian contingent to the Tokyo Olympics and all members thumped benches in support of the Indian squad. Soon after, MPs from Congress, TMC, DMK and Shiromani Akali Dal gathered in the Well, demanding an inquiry into the Pegasus surveillance reports and the farm bills respectively. Earlier, in RS, moving the motion, Muraleedharan said, “I move Santanu Sen, AITC, be suspended from the services of the House for the remaining part of the current session for his unruly behaviour, unbecoming of a member of RS...” TMC member Sukhendu Sekhar Ray strongly protested against the manner in which the motion was brought without listing it in the day’s business and not giving Sen an opportunity to respond. Derek O’Brien, in turn, raised the issue of Sen being allegedly threatened by a minister (Hardeep Puri), but the chairperson said it had happened after the House was adjourned. “What is happening in the House in the presence of the chair that is taken note by me. Subsequently, what has happened, it has not been brought to my notice,” said Naidu, who earlier had expressed his anguish at proceedings in RS “hitting a new low” with papers being torn and flung after being snatched from a minister. Officials also made it clear that the rules empower the chairperson to allow any business to be taken up in the House without it being listed for the day. Sen’s suspension from RS may become the rallying point for all the opposition parties, including the Left, to join hands against the government. The Pegasus scam and farm laws are going to be priority issues for all opposition parties which protested against the House order to suspend Sen. The parties have decided to assemble at the Gandhi statue in Parliament premises every day for half an hour before the House opens at 11 am, demanding reinstatement of Sen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rajya-sabha-suspends-unruly-tmc-mp-but-he-refuses-to-leave-house/articleshow/84696154.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Cannot provide certificate, print your own: Maharashtra Council of Indian Medicines to doctors||NAGPUR: In a bizarre decision, Maharashtra Council of Indian Medicines (MCIM), while accepting that it is unable to provide printed permanent registration certificates to ayurveda doctors, has asked the medical practitioners to get the provisional certificate printed themselves by confirming their credentials on the website. Now, the doctors have raised question on validity of this computerized printout of certificate which will neither have digital or physical signature, stamp, seal, bar code, or any other security feature. According to them, quacks can easily imitate such printouts and continue their practice. TOI Nagpur, on June 20, had raised the issue of ayurveda doctors awaiting their registration renewal from 2019. At that time, the MCIM officials had accepted that there was delay in distribution of certificates due to technical reasons. However, in July first week, MCIM came up with a unique notice in which it asked more than 20,000 such doctors, who are still to get the renewal and registration certificate in physical format, to log on to the MCIM website and get their certificate printed. “Confirm your credentials like date of birth, date of registration and registration number and get the printout of the permanent registration certificate,” reads the notice issued by MCIM registrar Dr DU Wange. The notice has no mention when the MCIM will provide the certificates physically to the doctors. Registration with MCIM is essential for ayurveda doctors to prove their authenticity. A certificate with security features is also must to stop quackery, especially in rural Maharashtra. The MCIM had started the drive of registration renewal and issuing permanent certificates to doctors in 2019 with the same aim, but the recent notice has ended the sole objective of the drive, said doctors attached to National Integrated Medical Association (NIMA), Maharashtra. “If a print-out taken at home is acceptable as permanent registration certificate, any quack in any part of the state can take such printouts and continue with the quackery,” said Dr Shubham Bobde, president of NIMA students forum. “This printout is nothing but information about doctor, his qualification etc. Neither a signature of MCIM official, nor a seal, or barcode is there to authenticate it. Validity is also not mentioned on it. What is the use of such certificate when we are paying hefty Rs2,000 for this registration?” asked Dr Bobde. Interestingly, the MCIM has increased the registration renewal fees from Rs50 to Rs2,000 in 2019. “We have written to the state government in this regard,” said Dr Mohan Yende, state coordinator of NIMA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cant-provide-certificate-print-your-own-mcim-to-docs/articleshow/84689560.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The RTA was transferred for failing to check and challan overloaded vehicles being used to transport illegally mined sand and gravel. The transfer came in force after local MLA Gian Chand Gupta informed the DMO and RTA to curb illegal mining at Dangri River in Badona Kalan village in Raipur Rani a few days ago. The orders were issued during the grievance committee meeting chaired by the sports minister along with Haryana Vidhan Sabha speaker-cum-MLA Gian Chand Gupta, Panchkula mayor Kulbhushan Goyal, Panchkula deputy commissioner Vinay Partap Singh and other office-bearers. Both the officers were pulled up by the sports minister as they failed to give a satisfactory reason for to their failure to check illegal mining despite being informed about it by the MLA. They also failed to produce any challan data of overloaded vehicles being used for illegal mining in Panchkula. While redressing complaints of fly menace in Barwala and Raipur Rani, MLA Gian Chand Gupta directed the DC to conduct a series of meetings with poultry farm owners and ask them to adhere to the norms set to dispose poultry droppings in a scientific manner so that breeding of flies could be curtailed. The minister also asked for a detailed report on the department failing to release compensation for crop destruction due to the fire in Barwala. He ordered the district revenue officer to release compensation by July 30 and submit the report. Officers of UHVBN told the sports minister that Rs 2 lakh had been deposited with the MC, Panchkula to shift high tension wires passing through the residential area of BPL colony in Naggal village.  Supervisory panel formed to check fly menaceDuring the grievance committee meeting, Haryana Vidhan Sabha speaker-cum-local MLA Gian Chand Gupta directed the deputy commissioner to constitute a supervisory committee to address the fly menace in Barwala and Raipur Rani. He asked the DC to include poultry farm owners, departmental officers and local residents in the committee, which would regularly visit poultry farms to ensure that scientific methods were being adopted to dispose of poultry droppings, disabling fly breeding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pkula-district-mining-officer-suspended-rta-transferred/articleshow/84689489.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

During Monsoon session in Lok Sabha, MP Diya Kumari proposed the development of Kumbhalgarh as a potential tiger reserve in Rajasthan. Dr Sonali Ghosh, DIGF (NTCF), has formed a four-member team which will work in conjunction with the ministry of environment, forest and climate change and submit the report in 30 days. Retired IFS R N Mehrotra, N K Basu and Kaushik Banerjee from Tiger Cell of Wildlife Institute of India and Hemant Kamdi from NTCA Nagpur have been appointed as the coordinating members of the committee to explore the favourable conditions to rehabilitate the tigers in Kumbhalgarh forest. In a detailed report, the committee will take into consideration the present scenario of the region which includes congenial environment for tigers, landscape and connectivity, boundaries and human dwelling around the sanctuary. The project was conceptualised 10 years ago by Rahul Bhatnagar, retired CCF (Wildlife). Kumbhalgarh is an apt location for tiger sanctuary because in the 70’s tigers did exist in this lush forest. The stretch of Rawali Todgarh has abundant space for their free movement and does not require additional resources. Every year more than 10 lakh tourists visit Kumbhalgarh. The tiger sanctuary will help boost tourism further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/panel-formed-to-explore-viability-of-tiger-reserve-in-kumbhalgarh/articleshow/84692114.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Bahujan Samaj Party intellectuals’ meet goes beyond Brahmin outreach||LUCKNOW: If BSP’s social engineering was successful in winning over Brahmins in 2007 assembly elections, this time it is trying to go one step ahead. On Friday, when the party general secretary and BSP chief Mayawati’s man Friday, Satish Mishra, addressed over 5,000 delegates at its ‘intellectuals’ meet in Ayodhya’, he not only talked about the ‘persecution of Brahmins’ but also, in a first, invoked the cause of Ram temple. While BSP has been in power four times, it was only in 2007 that the party could win a full majority on its own. The success was credited to Mayawati’s social engineering formula which ensured addition of a big chunk of Brahmin votes to its loyal Dalit vote bank. The party had then fielded 86 Brahmins out of 139 upper caste candidates. Out of these, 45 won the elections, claimed Mishra. In 2012 assembly polls also, the BSP chief gave ticket to as many as 74 Brahmins. However, the youth appeal of Akhilesh Yadav put brakes on Mayawati’s social engineering plan and Samajwadi Party won with a bigger majority. This made Mayawati put this formula on the backburner in the 2017 elections. She fielded only 34 Brahmin candidates while going back to Dalit-Muslim combination, giving around 100 tickets to Muslims. However, riding on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s popularity, BJP swept the polls, winning 312 seats. Now, with the next assembly polls round the corner, BSP is back to its Brahmin-outreach plan with some value addition. So, on Friday, Mishra not only talked about ensuring quick building of the grand Ram temple at Ayodhya when the party comes to power, but in his one-hour speech, also invoked several other Hindu gods and goddesses. He also said that after the completion of phase one of his tour of six nearby districts, he would begin phase two by offering prayers at Mathura and Vrindavan, the abode of Lord Krishna and Lord Vishwanath in Varanasi in the third phase. Doesn’t it sound similar to what the Saffron brigade would say -- “Abhi toh kewal jhanki hai (Ayodhya), Mathura, Kashi baaki hai”, asks a political analyst. In the fourth phase, Mishra said that he would offer prayers at Chitrakoot dham and conclude his temple run in the fifth phase by offering prayers at Siddharthnagar bordering Kapilvastu in Nepal, the birth place of Gautam Buddha. During his Friday speech, Mishra also narrated how when he offered a Lord Ganesha’s statue to Mayawati at a rally in Lucknow, she coined a slogan “Haathi nahin Ganesh hain, Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh hain”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bsp-intellectuals-meet-goes-beyond-brahmin-outreach/articleshow/84694256.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: NIA opposes Sudha Bharadwaj’s default bail plea||MUMBAI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday opposed the plea for default bail filed by Elgar Parishad accused Sudha Bharadwaj, saying that the definition of court found in the anti-terror law UAPA shows that the court could be a sessions court and need not be a special designated court. Bharadwaj, accused of alleged Maoist links in the 2018 Elgar Parishad case, had petitioned the HC to seek default bail on the ground that the judge was not designated a special judge under the NIA. Her counsel Yug Chaudhry had submitted that in cases of scheduled offences a sessions judge has no power to take cognizance, only a ‘special’ court would have jurisdiction, and it has to be set up by state or Centre. State advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni and public prosecutor Aruna Pai concluded submissions on Friday said since NIA was not investigating the case in 2018, no special court was necessary to grant extension of her custody or at the time of filing of chargesheet. He argued she had “not made a proper application” for default bail and that the chargesheet was filed on February 29, 2019, well before the time granted by the court. The hearing, which was before a bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar, will now continue in August.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/elgar-case-nia-opposes-sudhas-default-bail-plea-in-mumbai/articleshow/84694287.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Third wave unlikely to have huge impact on kids, says Uttar Pradesh govt||LUCKNOW: The results of recently-conducted sero survey for Covid-19 in Uttar Pradesh have shown that the number of antibodies against the novel coronavirus infection in children are prevalent at almost the same rate as the adult population. On the basis of the report, the state government said on Friday that it was not anticipating high impact on its population below 18 years of age in the next Covid wave. “During the first and second waves, it was found that children were equally infected with Covid-19 as adults in UP. Furthermore, the sero survey has shown that antibodies against Covid are present in children at almost the same rate as the adult population,” additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Amit Mohan Prasad said on Friday. “We are not anticipating a high impact on children if the third wave hits the state. We don’t believe that children will bear the brunt of Covid the most, as per positivity of previous waves and prevalence of antibodies,” he added. Prasad, however, said the government was gearing up with critical care equipment specially for children and ordered special ventilators and BiPap machines for them. “The regular ventilators used for adults have also been found effective for children. We have both these types ready ahead of the expected third wave,” he said. Conducted from June 4 across all the 75 districts of UP, preliminary results of the sero survey found antibodies in every second person of the state – around 55-60% of the population, following the second Covid wave. The study included lab tests of samples across three categories – general population, slums and those who had contracted Covid-19. Replying to a media query on Covid deaths due to oxygen requirement, Prasad accepted that while oxygen was required at times during the course of the second Covid wave, the demand was fulfilled by the state government. “Covid deaths took place due of the affect of the disease on lungs and other reasons. Oxygen was adequately provided by the government,” he claimed. “Oxygen was also arranged from other states like Gujarat, Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand. Oxygen management was up to the mark in the state and was fulfilled by all means,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-3rd-wave-unlikely-to-have-huge-impact-on-kids/articleshow/84694310.cms||Yusra Husain

The officials at checkposts failed to perform their duty effectively and they were suspended. The department plans more action in this case, said the minister. A comprehensive inquiry is in progress and the department is evaluating the need for more action against officials. In addition to the measures taken, the department is also assessing the need for amending the existing rules and regulations. The minister said that the forest department has not issued any order in connection with the illegal tree felling case. He also said that there is no dispute with the revenue department and all measures were taken after proper discussions between the departments. No decision was taken without discussing with the revenue department in the case, the minister replied to a question raised by the opposition. However, the opposition boycotted the question hour in the assembly since the government was not ready to conduct a judicial probe into the illegal tree felling. The opposition members alleged that a major looting was done under the shield of a government order, issued by the revenue principal secretary last year, allowing farmers to fell all categories of trees, except sandalwood, from their land having title deeds. It was suspected that even the order was issued to facilitate illegal felling of rosewood trees. They alleged that the government did not take action against the real culprits. Opposition leader V D Satheeshan said Muttil tree felling is the state’s biggest forest smuggling in recent history. The government is trying to shield someone. He asked how smugglers could ferry timber worth crores of rupees from the northern district to a sawmill at Perumbavoor in Ernakulam amidst the pandemic-induced curbs without the support of the authorities. So far, 40 cases have been registered in connection with tree felling and no one was arrested yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/minister-admits-to-failure-in-illegal-tree-felling/articleshow/84689617.cms||---

On the basis of the complaint filed by Khokhar, the vice-chancellor and senior legal officials of Punjabi university appeared in person before the commission headquarters. The commission observed that Khokhar, besides being a highly qualified person, was a former Indian Information Service (IIS) officer recruited through Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) and was appointed as APRO in Punjabi University after due process of selection in 2001 against a permanent reserve post for SC candidate. After successful completion of probation period, his services were made substantive in 2002. Later, out of two posts of APROs, one of the posts on which Khokhar was working was abolished in 2003 by the University as an austerity measure to save Rs 1.5 lakh per annum. Thus, he was removed from service. The Commission observed, “While removing H S Khokhar from the service the position regarding his appointment against reserved post was concealed and being a permanent employee even no alternative post was provided to him. This, prima-facie, proved that H S Khokhar was treated so on account of being Scheduled Caste. Though in the year 2008, Punjabi University rectified its wrongdoing by taking back Khokhar into service but in between the period, he suffered irreparable loss and his life was almost ruined.” Sampla directed vice-chancellor, Prof Arvind to take immediate action for payment of salary for the intervening period between 2003 and 2008 to Khokhar and submit an action taken report on July 28.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sc-panel-directs-punjabi-university-to-pay-arrears-of-senior-dalit-officer/articleshow/84689569.cms||---

Dr Ajay Sharma, principal SD College, said, “We are waiting for the guidelines from Panjab University (PU). Currently, exams are being conducted online. It is likely that students will be coming to college before August 20. We are expecting the guidelines to be out by next week following which we can take steps accordingly.” A few colleges had reopened in November last year, but the turnout of students was not much. Dr Pawan Sharma, principal, DAV College, Sector 8, said, “We are prepared to welcome students back after a long break due to the pandemic. We are making every possible arrangements to ensure safety and hygiene of students and the staff. We have installed hand sanitisers at every possible stop. Screening on a daily basis will be done at the gate. This will include checking the temperature and oxygen level of the students.” “We will make sure that students who are vaccinated, will come to the college. We have placed placards at different places on the campus spreading the word of wearing masks and maintain social distance. We are just waiting for further guidelines of admission which is to be announced by the university.” The UT condition for reopening is that all teaching, non-teaching staff, and students must have received at least one dose of the Covid vaccine a minimum of two weeks ago. Talking about the hostel facilities to be reopened, Sharma said, “Around 70-80 students are in a hostel and the rooms are given with single occupancy. These are those students who are giving their exams online and facing some connectivity issues back in their hometown.” After spending a long time away from college, students have mixed feelings. Prakshi, a student of BTech from CGC, Landran, said, “I am excited to be back in the classroom and I cannot wait to be taught in-person but at the same time I am nervous about how things will be managed in the college.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/colleges-await-pu-norms-for-aug-reopening/articleshow/84689636.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai rain subsides but is in triple digits in Karjat, Matheran||MUMBAI/KALYAN: Even as rainfall in the city and suburbs subsided, adjoining areas like Karjat and Matheran recorded triple digit figures (152.60mm and 152mm respectively) in the 24 hours ending 8.30am on Friday. IMD has forecast a further decrease in rain for Mumbai, issuing a yellow alert for Saturday, which indicates heavy rain at isolated places, but an orange alert in in place for Thane and Raigad, indicating heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places. Karjat and Matheran fall under Raigad district. In the 24 hours ending 8.30am on Friday, IMD Colaba observatory recorded 12.8mm rain and IMD Santacruz recorded 19.4mm. All through Friday, Colaba and Santacruz recorded 8.6mm and 1.8mm rain in the nine hours ending 5.30pm. From Sunday, the weather bureau expects rain to subside for Mumbai, with only light rain forecast. IMD said the monsoon has remained active to vigorous over most parts of the state during the past 3-4 days. Stock in the lakes suppl-ying potable water to Mum-bai rose by 4%, touching 57.7% of what is required. The total stock stands at 8.3 lakh million litres, compared to 7.8 lakh million litres (53.9%) a day earlier. Meanwhile, a day after the torrential downpour wreaked havoc in Kalyan, Badlapur and Bhiwandi, residents demanded compensation for their losses saying they had been dealt a double whammy as the Covid-19 pandemic had caused losses and now their goods had been destroyed and their belongings washed away in the flood waters. An estimated two lakh people from around 50,000 households in the region have been affected. Residents demanded a relief package similar to what was given by the state government in the aftermath of the 2019 floods. Many spent all of Thursday in temporary accommodation and returned to their homes only on Friday morning after the water level had receded. Residents said their television sets and other electronic items had got damaged after being immersed in water for more than 24 hours. Sonali More, who lives in Kopar, Dombivli, along the creek, said the entire area was water-logged. “Residents of around 500 chawls were forced out of their homes all night. Many of us camped at Kopri railway station,” More told TOI. Several locals from Kalyan too spent the night at a vacant building. “Not a single government official or politician came to offer help,” said Narayan Gupta, who has two houses in a chawl at Bhawani Nagar. This pocket near Waldhuni River in Kalyan was badly hit too. Badlapur resident Mahendra Jawle said his house on the first floor of a building in Hendrepada was under water. “The loss this time is worse than it was two years ago,” said Jawle, adding, “We hope to get some relief package from the government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rain-subsides-but-is-in-triple-digits-in-karjat-matheran/articleshow/84694328.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Lucknow||‘Flu vaccines won’t help children, mask and Covid-appropriate behavour will’||A lot is being said and much more is being interpreted by parents amid speculations that the third wave may hit sooner than later. As all kinds of doubts leave parents worried, TOI’s Shailvee Sharda spoke to Prof Shally Awasthi, head of paediatrics department and dean of research and development at King George’s Medical University, to clear the mist. She is also a part of the national team that formulated the guidelines for operationalization of Covid-19 care services for children and adolescents. Excerpts: · A number theories and information are doing rounds on children being at the highest risk of the anticipated third wave. Is this true? There is a possibility, though small, that children will be at highest risk in the anticipated third wave. This possibility is based on the observation that in the first wave, mean age of affected patients was 50.7 years which fell to 48.7 years in the second wave. We have to be prepared for involvement of children as it needs special skills and infrastructure, including supplies. · How big is the risk? Which age group is most vulnerable? The US relaxed Covid-19 protocols when almost 55% of their population was vaccinated with at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine as of July 1. Yet, in certain areas there, cases are rising. Delta variant (B.1.617.2) is a variant of concern there as well as in the rest of world. Delta variant is easily transmissible. US too has seen vaccine hesitancy in adults aged 18-39 years. Today, we in India have vaccinated more than 42 crore people, which is one-third of the population. This is a remarkable feat. India is in the process of unlocking, malls, cinemas, gyms and schools. This puts us at potential risk of third wave. People are openly violating Covid-appropriate behaviour and there is vaccine hesitancy. · How prepared is UP to tackle the third wave? UP has learned from the experience of second wave. Hospitals are ready with ICU and oxygen facilities to take care of burden of cases. Management protocols for paediatrics as well as adults are in place. Training of health care staff is going on. Equipment and supplies for paediatric patients are in stock. Oxygen production capacity will soon be increased by almost 300%. · Certain paediatricians are recommending anti-flu shots for children so that they have some immunity. Is it helpful? Flu vaccine is not effective against Covid. It will protect against seasonal flu, hence is recommended for children above 6 months of age. Symptoms of flu are similar to that of Covid. Both are caused by respiratory viruses and present with fever, cough, runny nose, fast breathing and gastrointestinal symptoms · What is the progress on Covid vaccines for children? There are at least 4 vaccines in the pipeline for use in children in India. Zydus Cadila ZyCov D (DNA vaccine) trials are on and by the end of July it is likely to get authorization for use in children between 12 and 18 years. Three doses will be needed 28 days apart. Covaxin (Bharat Biotech) is an inactivated vaccine and phase 2/3 trials are on way for its use in children aged 2-18 years. Another variant of Covaxin (BBV154) is a one-shot nasal vaccine and its trials include children. Results are awaited. Novavax (a protein subunit vaccine) in partnership with Serum Institute of India is about to begin a trial in children in India. The fifth vaccine is Pfizer mRNA vaccine which is being used in children 12 years and older in the USA but not available in India as of now. · What precautions can parents follow to keep their children safe? Parents must follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, such as using mask correctly, maintaining distance of 2 metres from others, following hand hygiene as recommended and coughing and sneezing in their elbows to avoid generating aerosols. They must avoid unnecessary visits to public places. This will also set an example for their family and friends to emulate. All eligible family members must get vaccinated against Covid-19. Parents must ensure that their children receive all doses of routine immunization. Special attention must be paid to providing nutritious food to their children. Diet must include fruits and vegetables, must be freshly made at home and adequate in frequency and amount. Exclusive breastfeeding must be practised for infants below 6 months of age. Homes must be made child-safe. Heathy interaction with children will promote their intellectual development and keep them as well as parents happy. Each family must identify a family paediatrician and consult her/him for routine health check-ups. Parents must be comfortable with the paediatrician so that if need be, tele-consultation can be done. · Are there any medicines or supplements or immunity boosters that have been recommended? As such no additional immunity boosters are recommended for children. Growing children require minerals such as zinc and iron, and vitamins, both fat and water soluble, for optimal growth. They must get these from natural dietary sources. Fruits and vegetables are good sources. Recommended daily allowance of Vitamin D has to be given as supplements as it is not present in food products in the required amount. For children above 1 year, 600 IU of Vitamin D must be given daily. · A large number of Covid-19 affected persons are asymptomatic? Is this true for children as well? Yes, this is true for children also. A meta-analysis of 28 articles published in 2020 has reported that on an average 16% of Covid-19 positive children can be asymptomatic. However, the exact percentage is not known and can be as high as 50%. These asymptomatic children can infect others. · Children may act as super-spreaders in the family. What precautions need to be taken? Yes, asymptomatic children can be super-spreaders. Even if they are symptomatic, it is almost impossible to isolate them. So if a child is Covid-19 positive, one adult, preferably vaccinated or recovered from Covid-19, should be responsible to take care of the child in isolation. This person should use a face mask and frequently wash hands. The surroundings when the child stays must be sanitized thrice a day. · What are the warning signs of Covid-19 in children? Fast breathing, persistent high fever, lethargy, drowsiness, poor feeding and oxygen saturation of <95% by pulse oximeter are red flag signs. They indicate worsening of disease and need of immediate care in a facility which has oxygen and paediatric intensive care unit. · How do we differentiate normal fever from Covid-19 fever? Fever is a common presentation of most infective and some non-infective disorders. In situations of pandemic, a high index of suspicion should be there for Covid-19, especially if fever is accompanied by cough, runny nose, muscle aches and pains and stomach upset. It is prudent to rule out Covid-19 by RTPCR, especially if one is not protected by Covid-19 vaccination or natural disease in the last three months. · What steps should a parent take if she/he notices flu like symptoms in their child? Parents should isolate themselves with the child, get the child tested for Covid-19, ensure proper fluid intake and give normal diet. They should measure body temperature and for fever above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, give syrup paracetamol. They must consult their paediatrician at the earliest. On advice of the paediatrician, they should also measure oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry and look out for red flag signs enumerated above. · Are there any helplines to keep in mind if the child takes ill? In UP, there are two Covid-19 helplines: 18001805145 and 1075. In addition, through the e-Sanjeevani portal of government of India, advice of paediatricians in the government sector can be obtained. · Younger children cannot take steam. Some may not be big enough to gargle. What home remedies may be recommended? Steam inhalation is not an essential part of Covid-19 management. Children should be kept in comfortable temperature (around 26-28 degrees centigrade) and in rooms with cross ventilation and 30%-40% humidity. Proper sleep, diet, hydration and stress-free environment is needed for the child.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/flu-vaccines-wont-help-children-mask-and-covid-appropriate-behavour-will/articleshow/84694329.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Solar Group and Ordnance Factory Board clear trials for ATAL grenades||NAGPUR: The Solar Group has cleared the test to make one more weapon system. A week ago, the company cleared user trials for 81mm anti-thermal, anti-laser (ATAL) grenade, the latest tank defence system. The Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) too cleared the trials for the grenade at the same time. With this, Solar Group, which is the only private entity to have passed the user trials, will have to now compete with OFB for bagging the order. Both will have to bid through request for proposal (RFP) to be floated by the armed forces. The 81mm grenades are a defensive system for tanks. The grenades create a smoke screen, which blocks lasers and makes it difficult to trace coordinates, preventing the tanks from being hit by the enemy. The grenades have been developed by the High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL), one of the units of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Sources said the RFP will be on 60:40 basis. This means the lowest bidder will be getting 60% of the order. To get the rest 40%, the next bidder will have to match the lowest price, said sources. The OFB, which is now being turned into a public corporation from a government department, will have to compete for the orders. Solar, which has emerged as the first private company to bag major orders, is expected to deliver the latest multimodal hand-grenades to the army. The OFB, which is also making the same grenade, has been asked to match the rates with that of Solar Group to get a bulk production order. Solar Group undertakes defence business through its fully owned subsidiary Economic Explosives Limited (EEL). The group has also cleared the trials for two versions of Pinaka rockets, making it eligible for taking part in the RFP for these systems too. Last month, trials were held for the enhanced range version of the rockets, which can hit targets up to 45km away. The rockets have been developed by the Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE), also a part of DRDO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/solar-group-and-ofb-clear-trials-for-atal-grenades/articleshow/84689641.cms||Shishir Arya

The river level is expected to rise due to continuous rainfall on Friday and water discharge from dam on Saturday. The Pune-Bengaluru national highway (NH4) stretch at Kini, Sangli phata, Uchgaon and Kognoli was submerged under the flood waters and several travellers were stuck in the middle of their journeys. Long queues of vehicles could be along the highway. With the Mumbai-Goa highway already closed from Thursday and the Pune-Bangalore highway closed on Friday, the entire traffic movement from Maharashtra to other southern states has been completely affected. Kiran Bhosle, assistant police inspector with Shiroli police station, said, “One car and ten motorcycles were swept away from the Pune-Bangalore National Highway on Friday evening when they tried to riskily pass through the inundated road stretch from Tawde hotel to Sangli phata towards Pune. They ignored the road closure by the administration. The car driver, who had got stuck, was rescued after three hours while the two-wheeler riders were saved after they abandoned their vehicles.” The Panchganga river had crossed the danger mark of 49ft in the wee hours of Friday. The swollen river brought water gushing into Kolhapur city and the adjoining villages of Prayag Chikhali, Ambewadi. The National Disaster Response Force teams had begun rescue operations. A team of Indian Army was expected to reach Kolhapur by Friday night. The river water level is expected to rise further because of the possibility of opening of gates of the Radhanagari dam. Radhanagari dam is filled to 344 feet height, while its automatic gates open up at 347 ft. Guardian minister for Kolhapur Satej Patil said, “With the gates of Radhanagari dam likely to open on Saturday morning, the condition of the flood is set to get worst and can be more dangerous than the 2019 floods. A team of Indian Army is on the way and will reach Kolhapur tonight to carry out rescue and relief operations in the district. People are advised to not to come to witness the flood and rescue operations as the rescue vehicles and ambulance are getting stuck in the traffic congestion.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-heads-for-floods-worse-than-2019-nh4-shut/articleshow/84687371.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||India||Bombay HC takes back comments on Stan Swamy after NIA objection||MUMBAI: A Bombay high court bench headed by Justice S S Shinde on Friday took back its “personal comments” on the work of Father Stan Swamy, an accused in the Elgar Parishad case who died in hospital, after the NIA counsel objected. “If you think I said something, I take those words back,” said the judge after additional solicitor general Anil Singh, appearing for NIA, said, “After your lordship passed the comments…the agency’s morale is affected.” Singh had sought two minutes at the end of the hearing in Swamy’s case to make “submissions unconnected with merits of the matter”. He said “any personal or private comment from the bench, especially in open court in a pending investigation, gets twisted… (especially) personal comment on work of accused”. At this, Justice Shinde said: “I had said so far as legal issues are concerned, it is a separate matter.’’ It was “very balanced and “the court endeavours to be balanced”, he said, before adding: “No issues, I take back whatever I have personally said.” On July 19, the HC bench had orally expressed “respect” for services rendered by Swamy but added in the same sentence, “legally whatever was there against him is a different matter”. Swamy, 84, a tribal rights activist, was charged with anti-terror offences for allegedly being a Maoist and arrested last October. In May, he was shifted to hospital from Taloja prison by HC order, pending hearing on his medical bail plea. He passed away on July 5. Explaining that its comments were not in any way connected to the merits of the criminal case against Swamy, the bench added: “Even we are human beings...||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bombay-hc-takes-back-comments-on-stan-swamy-after-nia-objection/articleshow/84696212.cms||---

This new system is being developed as part of a strategy to crack down on touts who have been active at the city’s mega centres and fleecing people with promises of ensuring a jab at these centres. Sources in the civic body said KMC board of administrators (BoA) chairman Firhad Hakim has taken the initiative for a mega centre located close to his residence. It has been effective in keeping touts at bay. Following allegations that a section of local toughs was taking cash from vaccine aspirants of the neighbourhood for a shot at Ahindra Mancha, Hakim asked the Chetla police to issue coupons to bonafide recipients from the police station so that they could show them at the entry to Ahindra Mancha and get the jab free of cost. Similar processes could be followed at other mega vaccination centres, said a civic official. According to a civic source, though the mega centres were set up to cater to the needs of the priority group, these centres also vaccinating those who are waiting for the second dose or people in the 18-44 age group who are queuing up at these mega centres. “This has led to a huge demand for vaccination and taking advantage of citizen’s desperation to get the jab, touts have started crowding outside these mega centres. We need to weed out this racket. Else, the citizens will suffer in the days to come,” a KMC official said. Vaccination clinics located across 144 wards are not spared of this menace, said a KMC medical officer. In fact, the pressure is particularly on the clinics as they have been allocating 70 % of the daily vaccine supply for recipients of the second dose. The remaining 30 % vaccine supply has been reserved for citizens in the age group 18-44 and above. “Most of our clinics are experiencing a huge supply and demand gap and a section of touts is taking advantage of this,” said a KMC borough executive health officer. According to a KMC health department senior official, the civic body would now need to keep a constant vigil over the activities of a section of touts who are getting active outside the civic body’s vaccination clinics. “The civic brass has taken a timely decision to distribute vaccination coupons at the mega centres. This system will go a long way in ensuring a smooth, tout-free vaccination process,” said a KMC medical officer posted at one of the civic body’s Covid vaccination clinics. The mode and time of distribution of coupons from the KMC vaccination clinics is in the process. “We may need to distribute coupons 24 hours in advance,” a KMC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/get-coupons-from-cops-for-cov-jabs/articleshow/84689686.cms||Saikat Ray

The flooded Krishna river waters entered over 1,200 houses in the low-lying areas on Friday. Sangli administration has evacuated 36,000 people from 86 villages and the evacuation efforts continued from the localities, which submerge at 52 feet. The administratin has appealed to residents from these area to be ready for evacuation. Meanwhile, the Karnataka irrigation department increased the discharge from Almatti dam to three lakh cusec, which is helping in keeping the Krishna water level under control. Sangli district collector Abhijeet Chaudhary said, “We expect the river water level to reach 50 feet to 52 feet but unlikely to breach 2019’s maximum level of 57.5 feet due to timely discharge from the dams.” Krishna’s water level also increased due to discharge of water from Chandoli dam located along Warna river, one of the tributaries of Krishna. Discharge of 28,500 cusec was done from Chandoli dam and caused flooding to Warna river. Shirgaon, village located at Kolhapur and Sangli border was disconnected due to flood water. Shifting from Shirol taluka Residents of villages from Shirol taluka from Kolhapur district, which also gets affected due to the flooding of Krishna river were being shifted on their own to safer places. One of the two NDRF teams arrived for Kolhapur district has been deployed at Shirol. Villages such as Khidrapur, Herwad and Kurundwad are likely to get flooded once Krishna crosses 50 feet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/36k-evacuated-in-sangli-as-river-touches-danger-level/articleshow/84687377.cms||---

But these are only for the staff specials, for commuters who need to travel along a particular route for just one day, and can’t make use of their month tickets for the purpose. ER has also eased curbs allow need-based ticket buying for individuals (outside the notified essential sectors) who might have to commute for a certain requirement on a particular day. Six such ticket counters have started functioning out of Sealdah station. Other stations on the Sealdah division have also opened these ticket counters. The division is currently operating around 270 staff specials. An ER spokesperson said that these ticket sales were initiated as the railways realized that many essential workers were unable to commute in routes not specified in the monthly ticket. As per rules, a passenger is issued only a single monthly ticket for a particular route. “We found that many were required to commute along multiple routes. The tickets are for them,” he said. The commuters belong to the sectors notified by the railways in the pandemic to allow more and more essential workers to board the trains that were originally meant for railway staff. “Depending on the situation, individuals from categories other than those notified by the railways are also allowed to buy these daily tickets,” the ER spokesperson said. In that case, the commuter must produce his or her identify card at the ticket counter or explain the reason for his travel. “The person seeking to buy the ticket must convince how genuine his reason for travel is. An examinee is allowed but family members of railway staff may face refusal to avail the staff specials if their reason is not valid,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ajanta/train-tickets/articleshow/84689687.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

In a representation, they said curfew and subsequent lockdowns had affected their business. As lockdown in the night hours remained for a longer period, their business was closed, they added. An agenda in this regard will come up before members of the finance and contract committee (F&CC) for discussion and approval in its meeting on Thursday. “People were allotted the kiosks in December 2019 for three years. They restarted the business after lockdown/curfew during September 2020. But after the lockdown the business was affected as college/university/OPDs in PGI had not become functional. Then, complete lockdown and curfew had been imposed for Saturdays and Sundays during the month of April, May and June,” the representation said. They plea further said, “Due to the curfew/lockdown, their business was affected as there was negligible sale during the daytime. As the UT administrator has appealed to private property owners not to charge rent from the tenants and decided to examine and consider exemption of rent/licence fee for government-owned shops, we have requested licence fee for April, May and June or till the lockdown/night curfew is imposed may not be charged for kiosks at the night food street,” the plea added. The kiosks runners have attached the period along with dates when the Chandigarh administration had imposed lockdown and night curfew. Since the matter is related to financial aspects, the members of the F&CC will discuss it first before taking any decision. In 2020, based on the request of the kiosks runners, MC had exempted the licence fee for some duration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/waive-off-licence-fee-for-april-june-night-food-street-kiosk-operators/articleshow/84689672.cms||Deepak Yadav

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Institutes welcome decision, but parents remain anxious||JAIPUR: Though private schools have welcomed the decision of the government to reopen institutes, parents criticised the move. Principals of private schools have said that they will start the institutions in accordance with the guidelines to be issued by the state government. Lata Rawat, mentor of Cambridge Court Schools in Jaipur, said, “The government has taken the decision after consulting with experts which will benefit the children. Rajasthan is not the first state that has taken this decision at a time when corona cases are negligible. It’s been more than a year since children are out of touch with school and the more that gap is reduced it will be beneficial for the overall development of the children. We will follow all the guidelines by the government and open schools accordingly.” Other principals are still thinking whether to start all the classes or just higher classes. Principal of St. Anselm School, in Jhotwara, Father Paul Paulickal said that for students below Class IX, it is not feasible to open schools. “I believe it is a good decision that schools are reopening, but below Class IX, it is still a risk for students. From Class IX to XII due to board examinations and practical, it is important to call them to school. We haven’t decided how many classes we will reopen, but will follow government’s guidelines regarding it.” Now, parents have strongly opposed the decision and have termed it to be influenced by the private school lobby. Amit Chhangani, father of a student in Class VI said that this is a completely baseless decision of the state government. He said, “When government is claiming that we are approaching third wave, then why are they opening schools now. Minister Govind Singh Dotasra said that they will open for two months and will shut down again if needed. What do they think our children are for corona trial? I will not send my child to school and risk her life.” Another father Arvind Aggarwal said that in schools, without any supervision younger children will always be at risk of getting infected. “No vaccines are available for below 18-year-old children, but the government is ready to open schools. Just because corona impacts small children less doesn’t mean they are completely immune. We do not support this decision,” said Arvind. Some schools are ready to follow a hybrid formula where 50% will be given online classes and other will be called for physical classroom teaching. As the government cannot force parents to send their children so this formula has to be followed by schools, but lower income schools will face difficulty due to lack of infrastructure for online classes and parents’ economic constraints for the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/institutes-welcome-decision-but-parents-remain-anxious/articleshow/84692199.cms||---
---||Delhi||Report on Covid deaths at Delhi's Jaipur Golden hospital was preliminary: Satyendar Jain||NEW DELHI: Delhi government’s report to the high court about not being certain if oxygen shortage led to the death of 21 Covid-19 patients at Jaipur Golden Hospital could be considered a “preliminary report, prepared just in a day”, health minister Satyendar Jain said on Friday.  “In this particular case, the report had to be submitted in just a day. You can say it was a preliminary report,” he said when asked why Delhi government’s panel submitted in the high court that no death occurred at Jaipur Golden Hospital due to oxygen shortage. “For a final report, we had set up a new committee, which was supposed to investigate all such deaths, including at Batra Hospital. But the Centre got the panel dissolved through the lieutenant governor,” he added.  Delhi government’s report to the high court had referred to the findings of the expert committee which said, “In view of natural virulent course of the disease and lack of any evidence suggestive of oxygen shortage in the case records, the committee was of the opinion that shortage of oxygen as the cause of death could not be ascertained.” “Many of the reported patients had one or multiple co-morbidity like heart disease, diabetes, DM, hypothyroidism and hypertension. All these patients were receiving some form of oxygen therapy and/or ventilator support during the hospital stay,” the report had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/report-on-covid-deaths-at-jaipur-golden-hosp-was-preliminary-jain/articleshow/84689770.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: School reopening to see movement of 2 crore people||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has been warning citizens against the possible third wave, still, the state government has announced to reopen schools. This has surprised people. The reopening would mean the movement of an additional two crore people, including 1.8 crore students, daily and thereby increasing the risk of infections. On the contrary to Gehlot’s warnings, education minister Govind Singh Dotasra didn’t see the third wave or the infection posing any threat to the children. Dotasra said, “It is said that children won’t be impacted much by Covid. So, schools can be reopened for them. For elder students above 18, most of them have been vaccinated.” The minister proposed the idea of opening schools on the basis of a condition that if the third wave of Covid strikes, they can review the decision. “The closure of schools has impacted the students belonging to low-income families and they need to be taught in classrooms,” said Dotasra. Even schools are not prepared to open it. Educationists said that reopening should be done in a phased manner. To start with, the secondary and senior secondary classes can be opened. TOI spoke to several schools who confirmed that due to pandemics they have retrenched their staff. “We have reduced teaching as well as non-teaching staff, including transport personnel, due to non-payment of fees. The understaffed model is feasible in the online mode of training where two-three sections have been merged and instead of four teachers, one is handling the merged classes,” said a director of a chain of schools in Jaipur, requesting anonymity. Recalling the opening of schools in January 2021, principal of a private school said that attendance was poor and they had to adopt the hi-breed formula by teaching both online and offline under the limited resources. Society of Private Unaided Schools in Rajasthan president Damodar Goyal said that they welcome the decision and would follow the guidelines sincerely. A section of paediatrics believes that until the danger of the third wave is ruled out schools for primary and upper primary shouldn’t be opened. “It is very important that a bio bubble for children has to be created like vaccination of parents, teachers, transporters. Thereafter, they should be allowed to attend the classes following all Covid protocols,” said R K Gupta, senior paediatrician, J K Lon Hospital, Jaipur. Principal of RNT medical college, Udaipur and senior paediatrician Lakhan Poswal told TOI that the recent sero survey indicating that close to 60% of children have been exposed to the virus while at home making them less vulnerable for the infection. “Our research says that younger children have developed behavioural problems while adolescents have psychiatric problems while remain at home makes it very important for them to attend classes,” said Poswal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/school-reopening-to-see-movement-of-2cr-people/articleshow/84692232.cms||---

The system is already there in many sectors. The civic body has already completed a survey regarding implementation of the project and has decided to start it from Madanpura village. Deputy mayor Kuljit Singh Bedi said, “We had noticed that houses in villages did not have proper identification or address, making it difficult for a person coming from outside to locate the house. Also, this numbering system will help in smart city concept in future. We have decided to give numbers to houses in villages and will start the project from Madanpura.” He said at present, house numbering is either based upon the name of the owner or is done in a haphazard manner. The MC will simplify it, as followed in Chandigarh. Bedi said, “We will also try to give proper lane numbers along with house numbers somewhat on the pattern of Chandigarh, so that locating a house in a village will be easier.” However, the project has drawn criticism from villagers as from the past decades the address system continues to be primitive as villagers are habitual of locating a house based upon the owner or family name. Secondly, the houses at present have addresses registered on Aadhaar card and MC might find it difficult and laborious to get the addresses modified on Aadhaar cards of the villagers. Jagdev Singh, resident of Madanpura, said, “We already have a house number from the time of my great grandfather around 80 years ago. And now, the MC has decided to give new numbers to houses. This will cause difficulties.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-mc-adopts-ut-method-of-house-numbers-in-rural-areas/articleshow/84689724.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

The figures are encouraging for the Bidhannagar civic body, but the authorities are not lowering the guard. Last year, there were 15 dengue cases till the first week of September, after which it went up close to 100 by the end of October. In 2019, there were about 850 dengue cases till the end of October. The Bidhannagar civic authorities have been conducting a number of preventive measures while the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) has procured an Eliza NS 1 test reader for free dengue tests. “As of now, we have reports of only six persons being affected by dengue this year. A door-to-door survey is on to check if anybody has been suffering from fever or any other symptom of dengue or Covid. We are regularly conducting fogging and guppy fish will be released in the canals like every year. The canals will be cleaned to prevent water from stagnating and larvicide will be sprayed. We are also urging residents to keep their rooftops clean,” said BMC board of administrators chairperson Krishna Chakraborty. Large parts of Salt Lake and Rajarhat had been affected by dengue from 2017 to 2019. Cases were low last year and the civic authorities want to lower the number. New Town authorities have installed an Eliza NS1 test reader at the UPHC, which uses different scientific methods to detect if a blood sample has dengue. Residents who have fever and want a quick answer regarding dengue infection can now visit the health centre between 10am and 1pm and and get tested for free. They will get the reports on the same day between 3pm and 4pm. NKDA has also started a mosquito-prevention drive with house-to-house fever survey with the help of volunteers and health workers, spraying of larvicide on road sides and water bodies, fogging and releasing guppy fish in the water bodies. The authorities are also in the process of engaging an agency to provide mosquito-control measures. Last year and in the beginning of this year, there had been a surge of mosquitoes in New Town and NKDA had installed a mosquito trapping equipment in four places — at Eco Park, in the open air theatre of Nazrul Tirtha, in the open lawn of Rabindra Tirtha and at Eco Urban Village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/just-6-dengue-cases-in-bidhannagar-so-far-but-authorities-keep-guard-up/articleshow/84689737.cms||Suman Chakraborti

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath calls out Rahul Gandhi for his ‘divisive aam baat’||LUCKNOW: An ‘aam baat’ from Congress MP Rahul Gandhi snowballed into a political storm on Friday with UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath mincing no words in calling Gandhi divisive for having rejected UP’s famous mangoes. On his way to address a press conference, Gandhi was asked about his choice of mangoes. He stunned many around him when he said: “I don’t like UP aams. I like Andhra’s. It is a matter of taste. Langda is doable. Dussheri is too sweet for me.” His rejection of UP’s produce did not sit well with the state’s CM. “Shri Rahul Gandhi ji, your taste is divisive. The entire country is aware of your divisive upbringing. The impact of disruptive values is so strong on you that you have reduced even the taste of fruits to regionalism. But remember, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, the taste of India is one,” the CM tweeted in Hindi. BJP MP from Gorakhpur Ravi Kishan also jumped into the debate, saying that Rahul did not like mangoes from UP and UP did not like Congress. Gandhi has found himself in the centre of controversy earlier this year as well, when he compared UP unfavourably with Kerala soon after losing the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from the Congress bastion of Amethi but winning from Wayanad. “It is much easier to talk policy in Kerala…simple, straightforward, extremely solid political mobilisation at the grass-roots level. The system responds very quickly. It is not a political war but I love going there. I feel happy, I feel like I’ve come home. There is affection, there is mutual affection,” he had said. Gandhi had added that in UP, there had been a complete break between communities, “no conversation between communities, much more complex negotiations, much harder to get things done, many more fights but potential is huge”. In February 2021, he said at a rally that he was used to a very different kind of politics when he was an MP from the north. “For me coming to Kerala was very refreshing because suddenly I found that people were interested in issues, and not just superficially but going into details,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-calls-out-rahul-for-his-divisive-aam-baat/articleshow/84694393.cms||Neha Lalchandani
