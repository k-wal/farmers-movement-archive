Missouri asked for help last week from nearly formed federal “surge response” teams as it combats an influx of cases that public health officials are blaming on fast-spreading delta variant and deep-seated concerns about the vaccine. After one official noted the effort that could include door-to-door promotion of the vaccine, Parson tweeted, “I have directed our health department to let the federal government know that sending government employees or agents door-to-door to compel vaccination would not be an effective or a welcome strategy in Missouri!” But Jeffrey Zeints, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said Thursday that the best people to talk with about vaccinations are local “local trusted messengers” like doctors, faith leaders and community leaders, who may go door to door. “So I would say for those individuals, organizations that are feeding misinformation and trying to mischaracterize this type of trusted messenger work, I believe you are doing a disservice to the country and to the doctors, the faith leaders, the community leaders and others who are working to get people vaccinated, to save lives and help to end this pandemic,” he said. Parson has urged people to get vaccinated, while also declining to enact restrictions to control the virus' spread, instead asking residents to take personal responsibility. Missouri, which leads the nation with the most new covid-19 cases per capita over the last two weeks, never had a mask mandate, and Parson signed a law last month placing limits on public health restrictions and barring governments from requiring proof of vaccination to use public facilities and transportation. Over the weekend, the Republican governor tweeted a picture of himself at a fireworks celebration in the tourist town of Branson, a large crowd behind him. Branson is about 40 miles (65 kilometers) south of Springfield, where one hospital was so overwhelmed with patients that it temporarily ran out of ventilators and took to social media to beg for help from respiratory therapists. Just 29.5% of residents in the county where Branson is located have received at least one covid-19 vaccine shot, state data shows. That is below the state rate of 45% and the national rate of 55.1% but not unlike several other southwest Missouri communities. Some have vaccination rates in the teens and 20s. Vaccine and mask resistance runs deep in the area, Branson's mayor was elected to office this spring after running on a platform that called for doing away with masks. “I think what Missouri shows us, unfortunately, is that it's the unimmunized who are ending up in the hospital,” said Dr. Chris Beyrer, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “And that makes it in some ways even more of a challenge for health care workers, because these are preventable hospitalizations and preventable deaths.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/missouri-governor-doesnt-want-door-to-door-vaccine-help/articleshow/84247854.cms||---

The move, as per the order, has come in view of the security threat posed due to the recent trend of carrying out drone attacks by anti-national elements. “There shall also be complete prohibition on flying of drones and other UAVs over all areas/venues in Jammu district where the lieutenant governor is scheduled to visit in connection with holding events. Since it is not possible to serve individual notices to all the persons concerned, this order is being passed ex-parte,” the order stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/raj-bhawan-civil-secretariat-in-jammu-declared-no-fly-zones/articleshow/84248433.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||Joe Biden says US war in Afghanistan will end August 31||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden on Thursday said the US military mission in Afghanistan will conclude on Aug. 31, saying "speed is safety" as the United States seeks to end the nearly 20-year war.  "We did not go to Afghanistan to nation build," Biden said in a speech to update his administration's ongoing efforts to wind down the US war in Afghanistan. "Afghan leaders have to come together and drive toward a future."  Biden also amplified the justification of his decision to end US military operations even as the Taliban make rapid advances in significant swaths of the country.  The effort to further explain his thinking on Afghanistan comes as the administration in recent days has repeatedly sought to frame ending the conflict as a decision that Biden made after concluding it's an "unwinnable war" and one that "does not have a military solution."  "How many more, how many more thousands of American daughters and sons are you willing to risk?" Biden said to those calling for the US to extend the military operation. He added, "I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan, with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome."  Biden said he didn't trust the Taliban but trusted the capacity of the Afghan military to defend the government.  Before his speech, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden administration officials always anticipated an "uptick" in violence and greater turmoil as the US withdrawal moved forward. She added that prolonging US military involvement, considering former President Donald Trump had already agreed to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan by May 2021, would have led to an escalation of attacks on American troops.  "The question fundamentally facing him was after 20 years was he going to commit more American troops to a civil war in Afghanistan," Psaki said.  Biden said it was "highly unlikely" that one government will control Afghanistan after the US pullout, and urged the Afghan government to reach a deal with the Taliban.  The president added that there is no "mission accomplished" moment as the US war comes to an end.  "The mission was accomplished in that we got Osama bin Laden and terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/joe-biden-says-us-war-in-afghanistan-will-end-august-31/articleshow/84248774.cms||---
---||World||Arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari extradition hearing fixed for February 2022||LONDON: Arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari, wanted in India for tax evasion and laundering money, told a court here on Thursday that he did not consent to extradition and his hearing was fixed to run for 13 days from February 21, 2022. Bhandari (59), an Indian citizen, is the subject of two extradition requests, which run to 3,500 pages: one relating to fraudulent evasion of income tax in India, and the other to money laundering. Bhandari, who has conditional bail, appeared in the dock at Westminster magistrates’ court wearing a face mask. Ben Lloyd, representing the Crown Prosecution Service, said: "He was an Indian resident for tax purposes and had global income and was liable to pay tax in India. He had a number of companies in India and overseas and acquired a significant income outside of India and had assets overseas which were not disclosed to the tax authorities in India. The Indian government passed legislation saying that those with undeclared assets had an opportunity to make declarations and, if they did, they would comply with law, but he did not. Both extradition requests list a number of properties in places like the British Virgin Islands. Documents were altered or falsified to give an impression the properties were not owned by him, when they were." Bhandari’s barrister, Mark Summers QC, who successfully defended Julian Assange against extradition to the US, made an application to vary Bhandari’s bail conditions to allow him and his wife to take overnight breaks in England. District Judge Michael Snow granted the request, saying "the risk of absconding is low".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/arms-dealer-sanjay-bhandari-extradition-hearing-fixed-for-february-2022/articleshow/84248753.cms||NAOMI CANTON

A Chinese media outlet Caixin reported citing the Ministry of Ecology and Environment that one out of every two Chinese companies inspected by regulators were found to have numerous air pollution issues, with those in the building materials and chemical and pharmaceutical sectors among the biggest culprits. “Of the 1,582 companies inspected in 30 cities in May, 882 were found to have a total of 1,940 issues related to air pollution of the environment,” the Ministry said in its statement earlier this week. Due to the following air pollution, people may be caught with severe diseases. Harvard University's Jesse Turiel and Boston University's Robert Kaufmann examined the measurement of PM2.5, particulate matter that's linked to lung cancer, asthma and heart disease, recorded by Chinese and US stations between January 2015 and June 2017. They discovered temporary divergences between the two data sets that were more likely to occur during periods of high air pollution, suggesting that “government-controlled stations systematically underreport pollution levels when local air quality is poor.” China is the world's largest carbon producer, closely followed by the US, according to Fox News. “Local bureaucrats face immense pressure to report the ‘correct’ numbers to their higher-ups, and some resort to colluding with other local officials or misreporting data. Given these institutional incentives to cheat, official air pollution data in China often is treated with a high degree of skepticism, by both outside observers and the general public,” the researchers wrote. “Our results strongly suggest that some local Chinese officials continued to misreport measurements of PM2.5 concentrations in many of the country's largest megacities, even after the government's post-2012 policy reforms. Consistent with our findings, in early 2018 the MEE announced that it had caught officials in seven cities manipulating data during the previous year,” the researchers said. According to a report by research from Ember, a London-based energy and climate research group, China is now responsible for more than half (53 per cent) of the world's coal-fired electricity, up from 44 per cent in 2015. Over the years, China has received applause for its clean environmental speeches at climate change and environmental events. However, ground reality narrates a different story as China continues to be the largest coal producer globally. Citing China Coal Transport and Distribution Association's (CCTDA) data, the Asia Times reported that the coal used by coastal power plants at five major Chinese utilities hit 4,88,800 tonnes during the last week of March, more than double from a record low seen on February 10 last year. Despite making tall speeches about the road to have a clean environment, the Chinese government reportedly plans to add coal storage facilities in 2020 to ensure stockpiles at or above 15 days' normal supply for coal-driven power plants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/most-of-chinese-companies-responsible-for-air-pollution-says-ministry-report/articleshow/84249067.cms||---

Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava told a news conference that 80 people were still considered missing in the disaster, believed to have been inside the Champlain Towers South when it abruptly crumbled in the early hours of June 24. As of midnight Eastern Daylight Time (0400 GMT) on Thursday, the emergency effort officially transitioned from an attempt to find survivors to a recovery operation, vanquishing any hope of extracting anyone alive from the rubble. "Yesterday was tough," Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said at the news conference. "But the work is going to go on and they are going to identify every single person."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/death-toll-in-florida-condo-collapse-rises-by-6-to-60/articleshow/84239144.cms||---
---||India||Hurriyat Conference reiterates resolution of Kashmir issue through dialogue||SRINAGAR: The All Parties Hurriyat Conference has said that the recent rise in killings of people in the valley is a “grim reminder” of the need to resolve the Kashmir conflict urgently and prevent the region from getting consumed by it. In a statement, the incarcerated Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said the fast-changing geopolitical reality of the region also points to the need for urgent conflict resolution. It said the silencing of guns on the LoC by India and Pakistan provided the much-needed relief to the residents of LoC living constantly under the shadow of terror. “It [the ceasefire] also pointed to a thaw in India-Pakistan relations, always a welcome development for the people of J&K who see it as a harbinger of engagement and dialogue between the two neighbours and the way forward for resolution of Kashmir dispute. But sadly, not much has moved forward since, or improved for the people of J&K, instead the oppressive situation on the ground continues unabated,” the statement said. The APHC said that the political leadership and hundreds of political prisoners and youth are languishing in jails or under house detention and the health condition of many among them is a constant source of worry. “[Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front chief] Yasin Malik a heart patient needs immediate replacement of the 25-year-old heart valve, as per his family sources, while [Democratic Freedom Party chief] Shabir Shah’s health has deteriorated in jail as he is suffering from various ailments.” It also said that the passing and implementation of laws aimed at demographic change, post August 2019’s unilateral decision by the Government of India has led to the fear of loss of identity among the people of J&K which is deeply disturbing them, statement said. The APHC said that it has always advocated for peace and growth for all the people of the region and its strong belief that this can actually be achieved with the resolution of the Kashmir conflict through dialogue among India and Pakistan and the people of J&K. It said that to achieve that, the government must revoke all measures of demographic change and all laws that disempower the people of J&K, especially since August 2019, and release the youth and all political prisoners from jails and under house detention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hurriyat-conference-reiterates-resolution-of-kashmir-issue-through-dialogue/articleshow/84249706.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||World||Suspect in stabbing of rabbi now facing hate crime charges||BOSTON: A man already charged with stabbing a rabbi outside a Jewish school in Boston now faces additional hate crime offenses, prosecutors said Thursday. Khaled Awad, who is originally from Egypt, arrived in the US with biased views against Jews, Christians and American culture, Suffolk Assistant District Attorney Margaret Hegarty said during a court hearing. Witnesses who knew or interacted with Awad told investigators he would become angry if his views were challenged, she said. “The witnesses also noticed that the suspect would stereotype various differences in racial groups and behavior, which included whites, Blacks and that he was especially harsh on Jews,” the prosecutor said. Awad, 24, who has been living in Boston, was charged Thursday with a civil rights violation causing injury and intimidation with bodily injury, prosecutors said. He has already pleaded not guilty to assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and six other charges in connection with the July 1 stabbing of Rabbi Shlomo Noginski outside the Shaloh House in the city's Brighton neighborhood. “We believe this was rooted in antisemitism,” District Attorney Rachael Rollins said outside court. Noginski, an Israeli citizen with 12 children, was stabbed multiple times in the arm and was released from the hospital the day after the stabbing. Awad was seen acting suspiciously near the Shaloh House the day before the attack, when he first demanded Noginski's car keys, Hegarty said. In addition, Noginski was wearing a yarmulke and Awad had to walk past a Menorah, suggesting that he targeted Jews, the prosecutor said. The attack has been condemned by Boston's Jewish community. Awad's court-appointed attorney, Stephen Weymouth, requested a competency evaluation. A court clinician told the judge that Awad has been diagnosed as bipolar and has not been taking his medications while in Massachusetts. “Competency could be an issue,” Weymouth said in court. He also dismissed the idea that the stabbing was a hate crime, and said it was more likely a “crime of opportunity” in an effort to steal a vehicle. Awad was ordered to undergo further psychiatric evaluation at a state hospital. A dangerousness hearing scheduled for Thursday was postponed until July 29, after the evaluation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/suspect-in-stabbing-of-rabbi-now-facing-hate-crime-charges/articleshow/84249924.cms||---
---||World||2 Haitian Americans detained in slaying of Haiti president||PORT-AU-PRINCE: Two men believed to be Haitian Americans - one of them purportedly a former bodyguard at the Canadian Embassy in Port au Prince - have been arrested in connection with the assassination of Haiti's president, a senior Haitian official said Thursday.  Mathias Pierre, Haiti's minister of elections, told The Associated Press that James Solages was among six people arrested in the 36 hours since the brazen killing of President Jovenel Moise by gunmen at his home in the pre-dawn hours Wednesday.  Four other suspected assailants were killed and two are still missing, Pierre said.  Pierre would not provide additional details about Solages' background, nor would he provide the name of the second Haitian-American he said was arrested.  Solages describes himself as a "certified diplomatic agent," an advocate for children and budding politician on a website for a charity he established in 2019 in south Florida to assist residents.  On his bio page for the charity, Solages said he previously worked as a bodyguard at the Canadian Embassy in Haiti. Calls to the foundation and Solages' associates at the charity either did not go through or were not answered.  "The pursuit of the mercenaries continues," said Leon Charles, director of Haiti's National Police, in announcing the arrest of suspects. "Their fate is fixed: They will fall in the fighting or will be arrested." Witnesses said two suspects were discovered hiding in bushes in Port-au-Prince on Thursday by a crowd, some of whom grabbed the men by their shirts and pants, pushing them and occasionally slapping them.  Police arrived shortly afterward to arrest the men, who were sweating heavily and wearing clothes that seemed to be smeared with mud, an Associated Press journalist at the scene said. Officers placed them in the back of a pickup truck and drove away as the crowd ran after them to the nearby police station.  Once there, some in the crowd chanted: "They killed the president! Give them to us. We're going to burn them!"  One man was overheard saying that it was unacceptable for foreigners to come to Haiti to kill the country's leader, referring to reports from officials that the perpetrators spoke Spanish or English.  The crowd later set fire to several abandoned cars riddled with bullet holes that they believed belonged to the suspects, who were white men. The cars didn't have license plates, and inside one of them was an empty box of bullets and some water.  At a news conference Thursday, Charles, the police chief, asked people to stay calm, go home and let police do their work as he warned that authorities needed evidence they were destroying, including the burned cars.  Officials did not provide any details about the suspects, including their nationalities, nor did they address a motive or say what led police to them. They said only that the attack condemned by Haiti's main opposition parties and the international community was carried out by "a highly trained and heavily armed group."  Prime Minister Claude Joseph assumed leadership of Haiti with the backing of police and the military and on Thursday asked people to reopen businesses and go back to work as he ordered the reopening of the international airport.  On Wednesday, Joseph decreed a two-week state of siege following Moise's killing, which stunned a nation grappling with some of the Western Hemisphere's highest poverty, violence and political instability.  Inflation and gang violence have spiraled upward as food and fuel grew scarcer in a country where 60% of Haitians earn less than $2 a day. The increasingly dire situation comes as Haiti is still trying to recover from the devastating 2010 earthquake and Hurricane Matthew in 2016 following a history of dictatorship and political upheaval.  "There is this void now, and they are scared about what will happen to their loved ones," said Marlene Bastien, executive director of Family Action Network Movement, a group that helps people in Miami's Little Haiti community.  She said it was important for the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden to take a much more active role in supporting attempts at national dialogue in Haiti with the aim of holding free, fair and credible elections.  Bastien said she also wants to see participation of the extensive Haitian diaspora: "No more band-aids. The Haitian people have been crying and suffering for too long."  Haiti had grown increasingly unstable under Moise, who had been ruling by decree for more than a year and faced violent protests as critics accused him of trying to amass more power while the opposition demanded he step down.  According to Haiti's constitution, Moise should be replaced by the president of Haiti's Supreme Court, but the chief justice died in recent days from COVID-19, leaving open the question of who might rightfully succeed to the office.  Joseph, meanwhile, was supposed to be replaced by Ariel Henry, a neurosurgeon who had been named prime minister by Moise a day before the assassination.  Henry told the AP in a brief interview that he is the prime minister, calling it an exceptional and confusing situation. In another interview with Radio Zenith, he said he had no dispute with Joseph. "I only disagree with the fact that people have taken hasty decisions ... when the moment demands a little more serenity and maturity," he said.  Moise had faced large protests in recent months that turned violent as opposition leaders and their supporters rejected his plans to hold a constitutional referendum with proposals that would strengthen the presidency.  On Thursday, public transportation and street vendors remained scarce, an unusual sight for the normally bustling streets of Port-au-Prince.  Marco Destin, 39, was walking to see his family since no buses, known as tap-taps, were available. He was carrying a loaf of bread for them because they had not left their house since the president's killing out of fear for their lives.  "Every one at home is sleeping with one eye open and one eye closed," he said. "If the head of state is not protected, I don't have any protection whatsoever."  Destin said Haiti has always been a complicated country and that he wasn't sure what the upcoming days would bring. "Haiti doesn't know what direction it's heading in right now," he said. "To be honest, I don't know what the solution is. There's always been a fight for power."  Gunfire rang out intermittently across the city hours after the killing, a grim reminder of the growing power of gangs that displaced more than 14,700 people last month alone as they torched and ransacked homes in a fight over territory.  Robert Fatton, a Haitian politics expert at the University of Virginia, said gangs were a force to contend with and it isn't certain Haiti's security forces can enforce a state of siege.  "It's a really explosive situation," he said, adding that foreign intervention with a U.N.-type military presence is a possibility. "Whether Claude Joseph manages to stay in power is a huge question. It will be very difficult to do so if he doesn't create a government of national unity."  Joseph told the AP that he supports an international investigation into the assassination and believes elections scheduled for later this year should be held, as he promised to work with Moise's allies and opponents alike.  "Everything is under control," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/2-haitian-americans-detained-in-slaying-of-haiti-president/articleshow/84250220.cms||---
---||India||Chirag is just the heir of Paswan’s assets: Pashupati Kumar Paras||NEW DELHI: Union food processing minister Pashupati Kumar Paras on Thursday escalated the face-off within the family to claim the legacy of his brother and LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan while claiming that he is the “real political successor” of Paswan and Chirag can be the “heir" of his brother’s wealth as per Hindu Succession law. Paras took charge of the ministry amid the ongoing controversy of Chirag challenging his uncle’s claim of leading the party in Lok Sabha. The Chirag led party has moved the Delhi High Court against the Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to recognise Paras as the leader of LJP in the Lower House. Paras said it was not “legally correct” and asserted that in democracy the majority prevails. Responding to a question from TOI how he was missing his political mentor and LJP founder, Paras said, “He was my brother and my ideal. Today I am sad that both my brothers are no more. I know many of you will come to Chirag. Let me tell you clearly that I am the real political successor of Paswanji. Chirag Paswan is definitely his son but he is not and cannot be his political successor. He definitely has a right on his father’s assets as per the Hindu Succession law.” The fuel between “chaha and bhatija” had started soon after the death of Paswan last year and recently the party was vertically divided between Paras group and Chirag group. Both sides now claim to represent the party. On being asked whether all options of reunion have now closed, Paras said he has asked Chirag to do “self-introspection” about his mistakes. “It’s not people but time, which is more powerful. Now it’s not the right time for any such reunion,” he said, indicating there is no immediate chance for any patch-up. Paras recalled that Paswan had asked him to fight assembly election from Alauli, Khagria in 1977-78 and also Lok Sabha election from Hajipur constituency in Bihar in 2019. Both these seats were earlier represented by Paswan. He said he was elected as MLA eight times and was also a minister in the Bihar government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/chirag-is-just-the-heir-of-paswans-assets-paras/articleshow/84250155.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Delhi||Work hand in hand or side by side: SC to AAP govt & Centre||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday expressed its anguish over the constant bickering between the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi and the Centre, saying no governance model requiring collaboration can work “if either of the two sides take a ‘my way or the highway’ approach, which both seem to have adopted”. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy said the hybrid model of governance for Delhi had worked well for many years even with different political dispensations in power at the Centre and the state. “But the past few years have seen an unfortunate tussle on every aspect with the state government seeking to exercise powers as any other assembly and the central government unwilling to let them do so,” it said. “We may record that the central government and the state government have been unable to see eye to eye on governance issues in Delhi. This has been responsible for a spate of litigation, and despite repeated judicial counsel to work in tandem, this endeavour has not been successful,” it said. The bench referred to several rounds of litigation between the Centre and the Delhi government for equitable sharing of constitutional power and jurisdiction and said that it was amply reflected in the genesis of the impasse over the assembly’s peace and harmony committee, headed by Raghav Chadha, allegedly straying into issues of law and order. This was also reflected in issues relating to Delhi Police concerning Delhi riots, it said. “We may note that the long and repeated battles between the state and the Centre appear to have cast a shadow even over the well-meaning intent of the committee to assess peace and harmony as reflected in the terms of reference,” it said. Turning to the AAP government, the SC said: “The political dispensation which is in power in the state has to recognise the constitutional scheme of division of powers in Delhi which circumscribes their ability to work only within those powers. When they got elected, they knew what they were getting elected for – not what they thought should be the division of powers.” Addressing the Centre, it gave a similar suggestion: “On the other hand, the central government is required to work in tandem, albeit with a different political dispensation. Maturity is required from both sides and we have to reluctantly note the absence of such maturity in this important inter-relationship. To work well, the central government and the state government have to walk hand in hand or at least walk side by side for better governance.” “The failure to do so is really a breach of their respective electoral mandates. The seven Lok Sabha seats are all held by the powers-that-be in the central government but a very different result came in the assembly elections. This has seen a repeat. It’s a reflection of the maturity of the electorate which has chosen to put one dispensation in power at the Centre while seeking to choose another in the state as the roles are divergent. The concerns are different,” said the SC. “The two powers unfortunately do not seek to recognise this aspect, and that is the bane of this structure requiring collaboration and concurrence. Unfortunately, it has become an endeavour to score points over the other. Some prior discussion and understanding could easily solve this problem instead of wasting large amounts of judicial time repeatedly arising from the failure of the two dispensations to have a broader outlook. In fact, the current round is, in our view, arising from the petitioners (Facebook) seeking to take advantage of this divergence of views and their inability to see a common path,” the SC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/work-hand-in-hand-or-side-byside-sc-to-aap-govt-centre/articleshow/84250424.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The school, established by the educational department in Punjab province, where Multan is located, opened its doors on the first day of school with 18 students enrolled.  "We have provided them everything that is required" for their schooling, tweeted Murad Rass, Punjab's education minister. He added hopes that the school will help transgender youth get better job opportunities later on in life.  More trans students were still expected to enroll in time at the school in Multan, where classes are offered from grade 1-12. Human rights activists welcomed the school's opening.  Trans people are considered outcasts by many, especially in conservative areas of Pakistan. They are often sexually abused, assaulted, and even murdered. They hesitate to get enrolled in regular schools to avoid discrimination.  "We are grateful to the government for opening this school and for providing free education to our community," said Ayesha Mughal, a transgender who for years has campaigned for the rights of their community.  In Pakistan, trans people are also often forced into begging, dancing, and even prostitution to earn money. However, that started to change in 2019, when the country's Supreme Court designated transgender people as a third gender. Before, trans people were often been denied treatment because doctors could not decide whether to treat them in a male or a female ward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-opens-state-run-school-for-transgender-students/articleshow/84248778.cms||---
---||World||Avenatti sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for extortion||NEW YORK: Michael Avenatti, the brash California lawyer who once represented Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against President Donald Trump, was sentenced Thursday to 2 1/2 years in prison for trying to extort up to USD 25 million from Nike by threatening the company with bad publicity. Avenatti, 50, was convicted of charges including attempted extortion and honest services fraud in connection with his representation of a Los Angeles youth basketball league organizer who was upset that Nike had ended its league sponsorship. Criminal fraud charges on two coasts disrupted Avenatti's rapid ascent to fame. Regardless of the outcome at Thursday's hearing, he faces the start of a fraud trial next week in the Los Angeles area, a second California criminal trial later this year and a separate trial next year in Manhattan, where he is charged with cheating Daniels out of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Avenatti represented Daniels in 2018 in lawsuits against Trump, appearing often on cable news programs to disparage the Republican president. Avenatti explored running against Trump in 2020, boasting that he would “have no problem raising money.” Daniels said a tryst with Trump a decade earlier resulted in her being paid $130,000 by Trump's personal lawyer in 2016 to stay silent. Trump denied the affair. Those political aspirations evaporated when prosecutors in California and New York charged Avenatti with fraud in March 2019. California prosecutors said he was enjoying a $200,000-a-month lifestyle while cheating clients out of millions of dollars and failing to pay hundreds of thousands to the Internal Revenue Service. Charges alleging he cheated Daniels out of proceeds from a book deal followed weeks later. Avenatti pleaded not guilty to all charges. Prosecutors requested a “very substantial” sentence, citing the U.S. Probation Department's recommendation of an eight-year prison term. Avenatti's lawyers said six months in prison and a year of home detention was enough punishment. On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Paul G. Gardephe rejected a request by Avenatti's lawyers to toss out his conviction in the Nike case on attempted extortion and honest services wire fraud charges. The judge wrote that evidence showed that Avenatti “devised an approach to Nike that was designed to enrich himself” rather than address his client's objectives. In written sentencing arguments, prosecutors said Avenatti tried to enrich himself by “weaponizing his public profile” to try to force Nike to submit to his demands. In a victim-impact statement, Nike's lawyers said Avenatti did considerable harm to the company by falsely trying to link it to a scandal in which bribes were paid to the families of NBA-bound college basketball players to steer them to powerhouse programs. An employee of Adidas, a Nike competitor, was convicted in that prosecution. The lawyers said Avenatti threatened to do billions of dollars of damage to Nike and then falsely tweeted that criminal conduct at Nike reached the “highest levels.” Avenatti's former client, Gary Franklin Jr., said in a statement submitted by prosecutors that Avenatti's action had “devastated me financially, professionally, and emotionally.” Franklin was expected in court Thursday. In their presentence submission, Avenatti's lawyers said their client had suffered enough, citing enormous public shame and a difficult stint in jail last year that ended after lawyers said he was particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus. “Avenatti's epic fall and public shaming has played out in front of the entire world. The Court may take judicial notice of this fact, as Avenatti's cataclysmic fall has been well-documented," the lawyers wrote. Although prosecutors asked Gardephe to impose a $1 million restitution order to help cover Nike's legal expenses, Avenatti's attorneys cited the lack of financial losses as a reason for leniency. “There was no financial loss to any victims so there is no restitution in this case,” they wrote. “The fact that a white collar federal criminal case was brought despite this fact is itself an important mitigating factor.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/avenatti-sentenced-to-2-1/2-years-in-prison-for-extortion/articleshow/84250287.cms||---

Gavin Newsom on Thursday asked people and businesses in the nation's most populous state to voluntarily cut how much water they use by 15% as the Western United States weathers a drought that is rapidly emptying reservoirs relied on for agriculture, drinking water and fish habitat.  Newsom's request is not an order, but it demonstrates the growing challenges of a drought that will only worsen throughout the summer and fall and is tied to recent heat waves. Temperatures in parts of the region are spiking this week but are less intense than the record heat wave that may have caused hundreds of deaths in the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia a week ago.  California's Democratic governor is asking for voluntary water conservation, which would include things like taking shorter showers, running dishwashers only when they are full and reducing the frequency of watering lawns.  "Given how low the reservoirs are going to be at the start of next year, the governor wanted to issue the voluntary call in the event that next year is also dry," said Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources. "The voluntary conservation is as much about planning for a dry next year as anything."  Newsom also added nine counties to an emergency drought proclamation that now covers 50 of the state's 58 counties.  Large cities, including Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, are not included under the emergency proclamation. But Newsom is still asking people who live in heavily populated areas to reduce their water consumption because they rely on rivers and reservoirs in drought-stricken areas for much of their supply.  A historic drought tied to climate change is gripping the U.S. West and comes just a few years after California declared its last dry spell over in 2016. The earlier drought in California depleted groundwater supplies and changed how people use water, with many people and businesses ripping out landscaping and replacing it with more drought-tolerant plants.  Compared to before the previous drought, urban water usage in California is down an average of 16%. But scientists say this drought is already hotter and drier than the previous drought, accelerating the impact on people and the environment.  Some of the state's most important reservoirs are at dangerously low levels. Lake Oroville in Northern California is at 30% capacity, and state officials worry water levels could get so low they might have to shut down a hydroelectric plant later this year. Along the Russian River, officials fear Lake Mendocino could empty later this year.  Some local water agencies have already implemented mandatory water restrictions.  Counties added to the state's emergency proclamation include Inyo, Marin, Mono, Monterey, San Luis Obispo, San Mateo, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz. The affected counties make up 42% of the state's population.  Counties included in the proclamation are eligible for various state actions, including suspending some environmental regulations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/governor-asks-californians-to-voluntarily-cut-water-use/articleshow/84251298.cms||---

Bishweswar Tudu, a first time BJP law maker from Mayurbhanj also thanked the PM for appointing two Cabinet ministers from the state with heavy portfolios. Tudu took charge of MoS in the Jal Shakti ministry, which is implementing two flagship programmes in rural areas – Swachh Bharat and Har Ghar Jal (drinking tap water connection). “We have made made remarkable progress in providing piped water connection to households in rural areas. We will try to push this further in association with the states,” he said. Talking to TOI on his induction as another Adivasi representative in the Council of Ministers, Tudu said, “It was former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee who created a separate ministry for tribal affairs. The BJP has always given huge importance to the progress of Adivasis. The party has continued this whenever it has come to power. The focus has been to take everyone together.” On the issue of three ministers from Odisha in this government including two Cabinet ministers, Tudu said the state never got such representation in the Cabinet. “It also demonstrates the focus of the current government on Odisha’s development. This is first time Cabinet minister’s berth for the railways has gone to a lawmaker from the state. The education minister is also from Odisha.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-hounours-adivasis-odisha-got-giant-share-in-cabinet-in-modi-regime/articleshow/84250783.cms||Dipak K Dash

Those who witnessed the girl being taken from her Louisville neighborhood on July 2 swiftly called 911 with a detailed description of the vehicle and a partial license plate number, police spokesperson Beth Ruoff told news outlets.  She said officers responded immediately and saturated the area.  "You just can't get there fast enough," said officer Jason Burba, who was among those responding. "Seconds feel like hours. Your only thought is getting there as fast as you can."  Police found a car matching the description given within 30 minutes and arrested Robby Wildt, 40, who was charged with kidnapping a minor. He has pleaded not guilty.  Neighbor Prentiss Weatherford, who witnessed the child being taken, told WHAS-TV he saw a car come around a corner and park in the middle of the street. He said a man got out and grabbed the girl "by the collar, threw the bike, put her in the passenger seat, and then took off."  Weatherford said he chased the vehicle and was able to get a partial license plate number.  When officers found the vehicle, body camera video shows Burba opening the passenger's side door to find the crying girl while Sgt. Joe Keeling places Wildt under arrest.  "I want my daddy!" the little girl cries as Burba carries her from the car.  Stranger abductions are rare, police said.  "Although we do not want the community to be alarmed, this is certainly an educational opportunity for parents to remind their children that `stranger danger' is real. It is important to talk to your kids about any adult who tries to use a ruse to lure them to their vehicles or away from public view," Ruoff said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/kentucky-girl-snatched-from-bike-found-quickly-man-charged/articleshow/84252400.cms||---

---||World||Environmental education needs greater investment, innovation, say experts||WASHINGTON: Environmental education provision needs greater investment and innovation if future generations are to be able to respond fully to the climate emergency, experts have said. Writing in the journal Environmental Education Research, Alan Reid from Monash University, Justin Dillon from the University of Exeter, Jo-Anne Ferreira from the University of Southern Queensland and Nicole Ardoin from Stanford University, who are senior editors of the journal, say environmental education is a “cornerstone for the social and environmental changes” needed in the future. The deepening environmental crisis will continue to worsen if there is not significant support and investment in environmental and science education, researchers have warned. Reforms would help young people to address the complex, interlinked and dynamic issues of contemporary situation. The experts argue governments and other organisations must direct more funding to education innovation in response to consistent warnings from scientists about trends in the deteriorating state of ecosystems, biodiversity and climate, amongst other environmental issues. Environmental and science education helps people to identify fake information and ideologies, and understand and respond appropriately to warnings about the climate emergency. They add that consensus on our environmental predicaments is not simply a matter for scientists, however. It must be supported by those in the humanities, arts, and social sciences, and wider society. Only then will contemporary calls by organisations such as UNEP and UNESCO that ‘environmental education be a core component of all education systems at all levels by 2025’, have a chance of gaining the multilateral and multileveled support the situation so urgently requires. The academics highlight international surveys that show many governments continue to fail to support and invest enough in environmental and sustainability education across pre-school, school, college and university settings. Professor Ferreira said, “The research base is clear about the superiority of whole-school approaches to quick curriculum fixes for addressing topics such as the climate emergency. The existential risk aspects also mean we need to look at investment and innovation in lifelong learning and non-school based provision, alongside examining the focus of current initial teacher education and continuing professional development.” Professor Reid said, “The popularity of outdoor education centers and activities are testament to the broader base of interest in environment and nature, as well as when arts, media and civil society addresses the climate crisis. Flagship environmental and science communication documentaries by the likes of David Attenborough examining the causes and effects of the climate emergency whet many people's appetites for understanding more from credible sources. Sir David's own learning journey in coming to understand the urgency of the situation underscores the rich learning opportunities available to us all, particularly in the run up to COP26 in Glasgow.” “Ensuring any form of environmental education is relevant, coherent, fit for purpose, funded appropriately, and available to current and future generations within and beyond the curriculum will be crucial to addressing sound and pertinent warnings from scientists,” he added. Professor Dillon said, “Global leaders should be discussing how to reimagine, recreate and restore environmental education to reduce the consequences of the environmental crisis. Countries should embed environmental and science education throughout society in ways that make sense locally.” Professor Ardoin said, “Only by investing in education and especially environmental and sustainability education, will it be possible to radically alter the course we are currently on, and thus demonstrate to ourselves and future generations that sufficient heed was given to our warnings.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/environmental-education-needs-greater-investment-innovation-say-experts/articleshow/84252905.cms||---
---||World||Chicago man charged in shooting of 2 federal agents, officer||CHICAGO: A federal indictment filed Thursday charges a 28-year-old Chicago man in connection to a drive-by shooting this week of three undercover law enforcement officers, and it says the suspect told authorities he mistook the officers for rival gang members.  Eugene "Gen Gen" McClaurin is charged with one count of using a dangerous and deadly weapon to assault a special agent from the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. Charging documents accuse McClaurin of shooting all three though the charge pertains to one agent. It is likely other charges will follow. A conviction on the one count carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence.  The indictment says McClaurin told investigators a friend had warned him rival gang members were in the area in a vehicle similar to the unmarked vehicle the two ATF agents and task force officer were in. He began following it, then pulled alongside and opened fire while driving onto an expressway on Chicago's South Side.  McClaurin "stated that he had purchased the Glock for personal protection a few months before the shooting," the indictment says.  McClaurin was scheduled to make an initial court appearance Thursday afternoon in US District Court in Chicago.  The shooting occurred at 5:50 am Wednesday near the 22nd District police station. The officers were treated for their injuries at an area hospital and released later Wednesday. The three officers were on their way to an assignment when they were shot, Chicago police Superintendent David Brown told reporters Wednesday.  The shooting came ahead of a visit to suburban Crystal Lake, Illinois, by President Joe Biden. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said she planned to discuss gun control and the city's violence, which has included an increase in shootings this year, with Biden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/chicago-man-charged-in-shooting-of-2-federal-agents-officer/articleshow/84253130.cms||---

This would include creation of more infrastructure for paediatric care, repurposing of hospital beds for Covid management, strengthening of genome sequencing, augment ICU facilities, installation of more oxygen tanks and creation of buffer stock of essential medicines. Of the total fund outlay, Rs 15,000 crore would be contributed by the Centre and Rs 8,123 crore by the states. This is the second such package approved by the Centre. The first Covid-19 response package was given by the government in April 2020. Coronavirus live updatesThe ‘India Covid-19 Emergency Response & Health System Preparedness Package: Phase-II’ will have two main components – the Central Sector (CS) and Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) components. The fund will be utilised by the Centre and the state government to provide support to government hospitals, agencies to augment their existing response to the second wave and the evolving pandemic, including at district and sub district levels in peripheral facilities, the government said. “This will be allocated to the states after consultation with them,” health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said. Under the central sector component, support would be provided to Central hospitals, including AIIMS, and other institutions for repurposing 6,688 beds for Covid management. Besides, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) would be strengthened by providing genome sequencing machines, besides sanctioning scientific control room, Epidemic Intelligence Services (EIS) and INSACOG Secretariat support. The fund will also be used for providing support for implementation of Hospital Management Information System (HMIS) in all the district hospitals. “This will be the biggest impetus for implementation of the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) at the district hospitals,” the government said. Read AlsoAt 1st meet with new ministers, PM says Covid norm violations worryingAmidst ongoing vaccination drive and relief in restrictions, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday expressed deep concern over violations of Covid norms. In the first meeting of the new council of ministers aft-er reshuffle, the PM said, “Over the past few days, we all have been seeing picturesThe central component will be also used for expanding tele-consultation services up to 5 lakhs per day from the present 50,000, and IT interventions and support, including CoWin. Under the centrally sponsored scheme, efforts will be aimed at strengthening district and sub district capacity for an effective and rapid response to the pandemic, the government said. The fund’s CSS component would be utilised to support states and UTs to create paediatric units in all 736 districts and also, to establish Paediatric Centre of Excellence in each state and UT. It also aims to augment 20,000 ICU beds in the public healthcare system out of which 20% will be paediatric ICU beds. The fund will also be used for adding more beds at the existing community, primary and secondary health centres to ensure closer to the community care due to the ingress of Covid-19 in rural, peri-urban and tribal areas. While these will be six to 20 bedded units, support would also be provided to establish bigger field hospitals (50-100 bedded units) depending on the needs at tier-II or tier-III cities and districts. The government also plans to augment the existing feet of ambulances and add 8,800 ambulances under the package.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-1st-meet-after-rejig-cabinet-oks-23123cr-for-covid-infrastructure/articleshow/84252511.cms||---
---||World||Woman charged with capital murder in Texas boy's death||HOUSTON: Prosecutors on Thursday charged a woman with capital murder in the death of a 5-year-old Houston boy she had been caring for and whose body was allegedly kept in a storage unit before being discovered in an East Texas motel.  Theresa Balboa, 29, previously was arrested and charged with tampering with evidence, a human corpse, in the death of Samuel Olson, whose father Balboa was dating.  Samuel's cause of death was ruled a homicide, but the Harris County District Attorney's Office had waited to charge Balboa with capital murder until investigating how he was killed. Court documents allege Balboa hit the boy "with a blunt object," but did not provide additional details.  Prosecutors previously said they had been testing a possible murder weapon.  Robert Scott, Balboa's attorney, did not immediately return a call or email seeking comment.  Samuel had been living with Balboa since April 30, which was the last day he was seen at school. Authorities haven't said why Samuel had been staying with Balboa instead of his parents, who were involved in a bitter custody battle.  According to a criminal complaint filed Thursday, prosecutors allege Balboa killed Samuel on May 12, just over two weeks before she reported him missing on May 27. Samuel would have turned 6 on May 29.  Balboa is one of three people charged in connection with Samuel's death. Her roommate, Benjamin Rivera, and friend Dylan Walker also face evidence tampering counts.  According to a previously filed arrest affidavit, Samuel's body was kept in a bathtub at Balboa's and Rivera's suburban Houston apartment until they put it in a plastic tote and hid it in a storage unit on May 13.  Authorities allege that on June 1, Walker helped Balboa move Samuel's body from the storage unit to a motel in Jasper, about 135 miles (215 kilometers) to the northeast, where it was found inside the plastic tote in a room Walker rented for Balboa.  After Walker helped Balboa move the body to Jasper, he called authorities to let them know where it was, police allege. Prosecutors said Balboa was on her way to Louisiana when she was arrested in Jasper.  Balboa, 29, remains jailed on bonds totaling $600,000 for the tampering charge and another count from a separate case. But prosecutors are now requesting she be held without bond on the capital murder charge. Rivera, 27, and Walker, 27, were freed after posting bond.  Balboa's next court hearing is set for Monday.  Samuel's parents had filed for divorce in January 2020. His mother had primary custody, but she hadn't seen her son since the summer of 2020, according to her attorneys.  "I just want justice to be served against all those involved in the death of my baby," Sarah Olson, Samuel's mother, said in a statement. She planned to speak at a news conference on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/woman-charged-with-capital-murder-in-texas-boys-death/articleshow/84253215.cms||---

Tribunal judiciaire de Paris’s ruling based on Cairn Energy’s application will impact some 20 properties, valued at more than 20 million euros (Rs 177 crore), as part of a guarantee of the debt owed to the British company that exited India a few years ago. Some of the properties are in the 16th Arrondissement of Paris, which is one of the wealthiest areas in the city. "This is the necessary preparatory step to taking ownership of the properties and ensures that the proceeds of any sales would be due to Cairn," said a source familiar with the proceedings. The action in France is part of Cairn’s enforcement strategy of pushing the government to withdraw its appeal against an international tribunal’s award in the retrospective taxation case. The arbitration tribunal had held that the government had violated provisions of an investment treaty in seeking capital gains tax from the British company. The company — which has less than 200 employees and a market capitalisation of £755 million (under Rs 7,800 crore) — has filed cases in several countries to pursue the unpaid international arbitration award of $1.7 billion (Rs 12,750 crore). The arbitration award has also been registered in other jurisdictions, including the US, the UK, Canada, Singapore, Mauritius, France and the Netherlands as the company intends to focus on high-value assets. It had filed cases in the Southern District of New York, seeking judicial confirmation that Air India can be classed as the alter ego of the Indian state and thereby jointly liable for the arbitral award. "Our strong preference remains an agreed, amicable settlement with the Government of India to draw this matter to a close, and to that end we have submitted a detailed series of proposals to them since February this year. However, in the absence of such a settlement, Cairn must take all necessary legal actions to protect the interests of its international shareholders," said a company spokesperson. The case is linked to the retrospective amendments to the law, allowing the government to levy capital gains tax for sale or transfer of assets located in India, a move that was piloted by Pranab Mukherjee after the government lost a case in the Supreme Court. The Modi government has stuck to the stand and has now challenged the award arguing that bilateral investment treaties cannot override the legislature’s powers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cairn-case-french-court-orders-governments-paris-properties-frozen/articleshow/84253425.cms||---
---||World||Amid growing frustration, White House pushes voting rights||WASHINGTON: The Biden administration on Thursday unveiled new efforts to help protect voting rights as complaints have grown louder from civil rights activists and other Democrats that the White House has not done enough to fight attempts by several Republican-led state legislatures to restrict access to the ballot.  President Joe Biden met with civil rights leaders in the West Wing, while Vice President Kamala Harris announced $25 million in new spending by the Democratic National Committee to support efforts to protect voting access ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.  Biden and his team have repeatedly promised a major push on voting rights after Senate Republicans blocked a sweeping election reform bill last month. The president last week told reporters that he planned on "speaking extensively" on voting rights and that he would be "going on the road on this issue."  So far, a major speech has not happened and a trip has not occurred, leading to rising frustration from those in his own party who view the GOP crackdown on voting rights as an existential threat to both Democrats and democracy.  That pressure has only mounted after a Supreme Court decision limited the ability of minorities to challenge state laws that Democrats say are discriminatory under the Voting Rights Act. Biden has brought in outside advocates for meetings at the White House and has consulted advisers on the best strategy for combating restrictive new laws.  Thursday's speech from Harris, tasked with leading the administration's response to voting rights challenges, was expected to be the first in a series of events from her on the issue, and aides were discussing a Biden speech potentially as soon as next week, according to two White House officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss internal deliberations.  "This campaign is grounded in the firm belief that everyone's vote matters -- that your vote matters," Harris said. "We want to help to make sure your vote is counted, and that is because our democracy is strongest when everyone participates."  Several states have enacted voting restrictions, and others are debating them, as Republicans have seized on former President Donald Trump's false claim of massive voter fraud in the 2020 election as a pretense for passing new legislation curtailing ballot access.  Democrats have grown nervous that the new laws could suppress turnout for next year's midterm elections when the party is trying to hold on to very narrow margins in both chambers of Congress.  "Folks, it is never too early to defend your rights," Harris said. "With these new laws that have been passed, or they're trying to, we have to start now to finish strong."  But some Democrats and voting rights activists believe that the White House did not start nearly soon enough. A number on the left have grown frustrated, including Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., who declared in a recent interview that "the president needs to lead out front and be very vocal on this issue."  Democrats on Capitol Hill have already tried to respond with a sweeping voting and elections bill that Senate Republicans united to block. Most Republicans have similarly dismissed a separate bill, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would restore sections of the Voting Rights Act that the Supreme Court previously weakened.  Those roadblocks have increased focus on the Senate filibuster, which, if left in place, would seem to provide insurmountable opposition to the pair of sweeping voting rights reform acts currently in Congress. Republicans have been unanimous in their opposition, and it would take the elimination or at least modification of the filibuster for the bills to have a chance at passage. Moderate Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona so far have expressed reluctance to change the Senate tradition.  Although not abandoning hope of a legislative solution, the West Wing has been shifting focus to other measures to protect the vote, including legal remedies pursued by the Department of Justice and in individual states, according to the officials. There also will be an emphasis on boosting voter turnout, with aides pointing to the successes Democrats had in getting out votes last year during the height of the pandemic.  Biden believes "that voting is a fundamental right for the American people," said White House press secretary Jen Psaki this week. "He is going to use every lever at his disposal to advocate for that."  Officials concede, though, that turning out voters is always harder in a nonpresidential election year. Some frustrated aides, seeing the reality in the Senate, believe too much of a focus has been placed on federal legislative measures and think that civic and business groups can also play a role in fighting the voting restrictions, noting that an outcry in Georgia helped water down some of the GOP's proposed plans.  The Supreme Court's 6-3 ruling last week upheld voting limits in Arizona that a lower court had found discriminatory under the federal Voting Rights Act. It was the high court's second major decision in eight years that civil rights groups and liberal dissenting justices say weakened the civil rights-era law that was intended to eradicate discrimination in voting.  Many Republicans continue to question the 2020 election's outcome, despite the absence of evidence of fraud. Republican elected officials in a number of states have responded by enacting restrictions on early voting and mailed-in ballots, as well as tougher voter identification laws, prompting some liberals to demand that Biden do more.  "We're past the point where we've lost faith that he's going to do it on his own," said Cliff Albright, co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund. "Where's your voting rights tour? People have already started to call this out. That's just going to escalate."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/amid-growing-frustration-white-house-pushes-voting-rights/articleshow/84253644.cms||---
---||India||Women live longer, but don’t have healthier lives||Females in India can expect on average to live almost three years longer than males. But when it comes to living a healthy life, the difference almost vanishes. This pattern of large gender differences in life expectancy but much smaller ones in healthy life expectancy is not unique to India. Public health experts say this global phenomenon could be due to poorer access to healthcare and attention to health, especially among older women. According to the World Health Statistics report of 2021 released recently, globally, women can expect to live an average five years longer than men, but when it comes to healthy life expectancy, that advantage shrinks to less than half as much at 2.4 years. The data also shows that the global average difference between life expectancy and healthy life expectancy is around nine years, which means that though life expectancy might be high, the last nine years would not be healthy. Many health experts have expressed concern that health and medical research has focused overly on prolonging life rather than on living healthier by slowing down aging to improve the quality of old age. This matters most in the 30-odd countries that have life expectancy of 80 years or more. They witnessed a small improvement in life expectancy in the 2012-19 period, but healthy life expectancy either remained stagnant or even declined. However, in less developed countries still struggling to increase life expectancy, the improvements in life expectancy and in healthy life expectancy seem to keep pace. In fact, several countries have recorded greater improvement in healthy life expectancy than in life expectancy. In just two countries, Oman and Afghanistan, do men have higher life expectancy than women. But in about a dozen other countries, men have higher healthy life expectancy than women. Most of these are also those with poor gender equality. Countries where the difference in healthy life expectancy between men and women is most narrow include India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, several sub-Saharan African countries and those in the Middle East. "Women’s life expectancy is significantly higher than men’s, but this advantage does not translate to women having healthier lives. There are several reasons for this disparity, including women’s lack of access and decision-making about their health and bodily autonomy. The recently released Longitudinal Aging Survey of India reveals a high prevalence of reproductive health problems among older women beyond the childbearing age group. Older women also have a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases and suffer from poor nutritional status as compared to their male counterparts," explained Poonam Muttreja, executive director of the Population Foundation of India. Interestingly, in some of the most developed countries with the highest life expectancy, like Sweden, the Netherlands and Switzerland, the difference in healthy life expectancy between men and women is very slim compared to the difference in life expectancy. This seems to be because of them hitting a sort of ceiling when it comes to healthy life expectancy, which seems to be about 71-72 years for both sexes. Of the 30 countries at the top of the life expectancy table, Japan, Singapore and South Korea alone have a healthy life expectancy over 73. Life expectancy is currently increasing more rapidly than healthy life expectancy, so that morbidity (average number of years lived in poor health) is slowly expanding, pointed out Guy Brown of the University of Cambridge in his paper titled "Living too long" published in 2014 in the journal Embo Reports. He urged a switch in medical research funding from causes of death to causes of aging and age-related morbidity. "The effort is to reduce the gap between life expectancy and healthy life expectancy. Over time, we can surely reduce this gap though pace of reduction will be slower. But finally, there is a limitation to how much you can expand the healthy years," explained Dr K S James, director of the International Institute of Population Sciences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/women-live-longer-but-dont-have-healthier-lives/articleshow/84253682.cms||Rema Nagarajan
---||World||Arkansas: Hutchinson takes over governors group as virus resurges||LITTLE ROCK: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican whose state is struggling with a resurgence in coronavirus cases and lagging vaccinations, called combatting vaccine resistance a priority as he took over as head of the National Governors Association.  Hutchinson was elected Thursday as the association's chairman, moving into the role as the Delta variant of the virus causes a resurgence in red states like Arkansas. Hutchinson's state has been at or near the top of the country in new cases per capita, and Arkansas this week saw its biggest one-day jump in hospitalizations since the vaccine became available.  "We have much work to do to overcome vaccine hesitancy, but we can do it together," he said at the group's summer meeting, which was held virtually for the second year in a row because of the pandemic.  Hutchinson is taking the reins from New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is leaving the chairmanship at a time he's facing multiple probes. They include allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment, whether he unethically used state resources for a $5 million deal for his Covid-19 memoir, and his administration's manipulation of data about Covid-19 outbreaks among nursing home residents.  Cuomo said the pandemic highlighted the importance of governors, as the federal government left it largely up to states to set up massive testing regimes and purchase scores of masks, ventilators, and others supplies. He commended Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, a former NGA chairman, for speaking "truth to his own party even when it was hard." Hogan had said former President Donald Trump left his state vulnerable amid the pandemic.  "Governors have a new credibility, governors have a new status," Cuomo said. "Let us use it well, and let us use it to do well."  The NGA chairmanship is the latest national spotlight for Hutchinson, who has gained attention for distancing himself from former President Donald Trump and his state's embrace of Trumpism. Hutchinson has appeared frequently on cable news and Sunday shows, also talking about the state's increasingly ominous Covid-19 situation.  Hutchinson warned that Arkansas' experience could be a grim preview of what awaits other states.  "What I see that we're experiencing in Arkansas right now with the surge of the Delta variant is going to be a likely experience in the coming months in other states as well," Hutchinson told The Associated Press in an interview.  Hutchinson this week kicked a series of town hall-style "conversations" he'll hold around the state aimed at encouraging people to get vaccinated. The first one was scheduled in Lonoke County, a rural county outside Little Rock where a little over a third of the population is fully vaccinated.  As in other red states, Arkansas' ability to impose new restrictions because of the latest surge have been curbed by lawmakers angry about restrictions imposed last year. The measures approved by the majority-Republican Legislature include a ban on mask mandates or vaccine requirements by government entities, including schools.  The forums follow other efforts to encourage vaccinations that have had limited success. That included an incentive _ offering lottery tickets or gift certificates for hunting and fishing licenses for those who get the shots _ that so far has had few takers.  "There's not much more I can do from a weekly news conference or a daily news conference from the state Capitol," he said. "I want to get out in the community because it's each community and local leadership that can greatly expand on what we're trying to do at the state and national level."  One way to build confidence at the national level, Hutchinson said, would be for the Food and Drug Administration to grant final approval for the vaccines. That would eliminate the justification used by some who haven't gotten vaccinated yet, he said.  Hutchinson said the NGA's role in responding to the pandemic will primarily remain communicating with the White House and the federal government, and advocating on behalf of the states. But he said they can also share ideas on how to increase vaccination rates.  "What we've learned as governors is communicating between the red and blue states, communicating between the governors, helps us all get the best ideas to address it, to be more innovative," Hutchinson said.  Hutchinson said governors also need more flexibility from the Biden administration on how they can use funding from the latest round of coronavirus relief funds and clarity on how they can be used.  The NGA will also likely play a major role in promoting the bipartisan pared-down infrastructure deal. But Hutchinson said there's no agreement among the association's members for a second, more expansive package backed by Democrats.  Hutchinson said he'll also use his chairmanship to promote computer science education in public schools, an initiative he's advocated at the state level in Arkansas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/arkansas-hutchinson-takes-over-governors-group-as-virus-resurges/articleshow/84253681.cms||---

All three terrorist infiltrators shot dead along the LoC were Pakistanis, the Army said. The two soldiers killed in one of the encounters in Rajouri were identified as Naib Subedar Sreejith M and sepoy Maruprolu Jaswanth Reddy. "Based on information regarding infiltration and movement of terrorists in the Dadal area of Sundarbani sector, the Army had been on the lookout for them since June 29," defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said in Jammu. "The information was corroborated today when a search-and-destroy patrol spotted terrorists in the Dadal forest area. The Army party challenged them and the terrorists opened fire, besides lobbing hand grenades. This led to a fierce encounter in which two terrorists from Pakistan were killed." Two AK-47 rifles and a large quantity of ammunition were found on the slain terrorists. The Army was scouring the area for more infiltrators till late in the night. A third Pakistani terrorist was killed in an encounter along another section of the LoC in Rajouri during the day, the Army spokesperson said. In south Kashmir, fourterrorists — two of them from Lashkar-e-Taiba — were killed in separate encounters at Pulwama and Kulgam post-midnight on Wednesday. IGP (Kashmir range) Vijay Kumar said while two terrorists were killed in the Puchal area of Pulwama in an overnight joint operation by the police and armed forces, the other two were gunned down in Kulgam's Zodar. The terrorists killed in Zodar belonged to Lashkar-e-Taiba, Kumar said. The other two are still to be identified. Early on Wednesday, security forces had killed one of the longest surviving terrorists of Hizbul Mujahideen in an encounter in the Handwara area of north Kashmir’s Kupwara. "5 militants killed in 24 hours in Kashmir.

---||World||Pfizer to seek OK for third Covid vaccine dose; shots still protect||Pfizer is about to seek US authorization for a third dose of its Covid-19 vaccine, saying Thursday that another shot within 12 months could dramatically boost immunity and maybe help ward off the latest worrisome coronavirus mutant. Research from multiple countries shows the Pfizer shot and other widely used Covid-19 vaccines offer strong protection against the highly contagious delta variant, which is spreading rapidly around the world and now accounts for most new US infections. Two doses of most vaccines are critical to develop high levels of virus-fighting antibodies against all versions of the coronavirus, not just the delta variant -- and most of the world still is desperate to get those initial protective doses as the pandemic continues to rage. But antibodies naturally wane over time, so studies also are underway to tell if and when boosters might be needed. On Thursday, Pfizer's Dr. Mikael Dolsten told The Associated Press that early data from the company's booster study suggests people's antibody levels jump five- to 10-fold after a third dose, compared to their second dose months earlier. In August, Pfizer plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization of a third dose, he said. Why might that matter for fighting the delta variant? Dolsten pointed to data from Britain and Israel showing the Pfizer vaccine ``neutralizes the delta variant very well.'' The assumption, he said, is that when antibodies drop low enough, the delta virus eventually could cause a mild infection before the immune system kicks back in. But FDA authorization would be just a first step -- it wouldn't automatically mean Americans get offered boosters, cautioned Dr. William Schaffner, a vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Public health authorities would have to decide if they're really needed, especially since millions of people have no protection. ``The vaccines were designed to keep us out of the hospital'' and continue to do so despite the more contagious delta variant, he said. Giving another dose would be ``a huge effort while we are at the moment striving to get people the first dose.'' Currently only about 48% of the US population is fully vaccinated _ and some parts of the country have far lower immunization rates, places where the delta variant is surging. On Thursday, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that's leading to ``two truths'' _ highly immunized swaths of America are getting back to normal while hospitalizations are rising in other places. ``This rapid rise is troubling,'' she said: A few weeks ago the delta variant accounted for just over a quarter of new US cases, but it now accounts for just over 50% _ and in some places, such as parts of the Midwest, as much as 80%. Also Thursday, researchers from France's Pasteur Institute reported new evidence that full vaccination is critical. In laboratory tests, blood from several dozen people given their first dose of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines ``barely inhibited'' the delta variant, the team reported in the journal Nature. But weeks after getting their second dose, nearly all had what researchers deemed an immune boost strong enough to neutralize the delta variant _ even if it was a little less potent than against earlier versions of the virus. The French researchers also tested unvaccinated people who had survived a bout of the coronavirus, and found their antibodies were four-fold less potent against the new mutant. But a single vaccine dose dramatically boosted their antibody levels sparking cross-protection against the delta variant and two other mutants, the study found. That supports public health recommendations that Covid-19 survivors get vaccinated rather than relying on natural immunity. The lab experiments add to real-world data that the delta variant's mutations aren't evading the vaccines most widely used in Western countries, but underscore that it's crucial to get more of the world immunized before the virus evolves even more. Researchers in Britain found two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, for example, are 96% protective against hospitalization with the delta variant and 88% effective against symptomatic infection. That finding was echoed last weekend by Canadian researchers, while a report from Israel suggested protection against mild delta infection may have dipped lower, to 64%. Whether the fully vaccinated still need to wear masks in places where the delta variant is surging is a growing question. In the U.S., the CDC maintains that fully vaccinated people don't need to. Even before the delta variant came along, the vaccines weren't perfect, but the best evidence suggests that if vaccinated people nonetheless get the coronavirus, they'll have much milder cases. ``Let me emphasize, if you were vaccinated, you have a very high degree of protection,'' Dr. Anthony Fauci, the US government's top infectious disease expert, said Thursday. In the U.S., case rates have been rising for weeks and the rate of hospitalizations has started to tick up, rising 7% from the previous seven-day average, Walensky told reporters Thursday. However, deaths remain down on average, which some experts believe is at least partly due to high vaccination rates in people 65 and older _ who are among the most susceptible to severe disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/pfizer-to-seek-ok-for-third-covid-vaccine-dose-shots-still-protect/articleshow/84252546.cms||---

The fund has a kitty of Rs 1 lakh crore for financing different farm-related infra works through easy and low-interest loans up to Rs 2 crore under ‘interest subvention’ scheme. The move comes at a time when the Centre renewed its appeal to agitating farm unions to return to the table even as it ruled out repeal of the laws. Under the modification, eligibility has now been extended to state agencies/APMCs, National & State Federations of Cooperatives, Federations of Farmers Producers Organisations (FPOs) and Federations of Self-Help Groups (SHGs). If an eligible entity takes up projects in different locations, all such efforts will be eligible for 'interest subvention' for loans up to Rs.2 crore. However, there will be a maximum limit of 25 such projects for a private sector unit. “For APMCs, interest subvention for a loan up to Rs 2 crore will be provided for each project of different infrastructure types such as cold storage, sorting, grading and assaying units, silos, etc within the same market yard,” said an official statement on the Cabinet’s move. Welcoming the move, taken at the first meeting after the expansion of the Cabinet, home minister Amit Shah said the Modi government is committed to agriculture and prosperity of farmers. He said that this historic decision is a reflection of the resolve of the government to further strengthen the APMC system. “This decision will not only further empower the APMCs but will also increase employment opportunities and benefit more and more people,” said Shah, who has also been made the minister of the newly created ministry of cooperation. The decision to allow this fund to be used for APMCs is also a signal to protesting farmers that the ‘mandis’ and the mechanism to procure crops at minimum support price (MSP) won’t end as feared by farmers in the wake of passing of the new farm laws. Emphasising on how the Centre intended to strengthen the ‘mandi’ and procurement system, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the government was committed to reform the farm sector so that farmers across the country get benefitted from it. Allaying concerns of farmers agitating for repeal of the three farm laws, Tomar said that his ministry’s offer to resume talks with farmer unions stand as he announced several times provided the unions don’t press for repeal of farm laws. The Cabinet also approved amendment in the Coconut Board Act, making it possible to allow non-official persons such as farmers’ representatives to head the Board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/agriculture-infrastructure-fund-loans-to-boost-apmcs/articleshow/84253788.cms||---
---||World||Oregon adopts most protective heat rules for workers in US||SALEM: Oregon adopted an emergency rule Thursday that strengthens requirements for employers to safeguard workers from extreme heat, including expanding access to shade and cool water in what advocates called the nation's most protective heat rules following deadly record-high temperatures in the Pacific Northwest.  "With these new rules, Oregon has a chance to lead the country in ensuring workplaces are safe from high heat, especially for those doing the most demanding and dangerous jobs like farming and construction," said Kate Suisman, an attorney with the Northwest Workers' Justice Project.  The emergency rule adopted by the Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Division, or Oregon OSHA, also mandates regular cooldown breaks and communication between employees and supervisors so workers can report concerns.  Among the more than 100 people in Oregon who died during the extreme heatwave in late June was an immigrant from Guatemala who was working outside, the state medical examiner said. He was part of a crew at a plant nursery that was moving irrigation lines. Oregon OSHA is investigating both the nursery and the labor contractor.  "Oregon OSHA is taking an important step forward in leading the nation on standards for outdoors workers," said Reyna Lopez, executive director of the Oregon farmworkers' union, known by its Spanish acronym as PCUN. "It's crucial that we continue to take steps toward long-term policy shifts in our state, that take climate change, and workers' safety seriously."  Oregon OSHA said the temporary rule is effective immediately and stays in place for 180 days.  "In the face of an unprecedented heatwave in the Pacific Northwest, and tragic consequences, it is absolutely critical that we continue to build up our defenses against the effects of climate change, including extreme heat events," said Andrew Stolfi, director of the state agency that includes Oregon OSHA.  The heatwave was caused by what meteorologists described as a dome of high pressure over the Northwest and British Columbia that was worsened by human-caused climate change, which is making such extreme weather events more likely and more intense.  Seattle, Portland, and many other cities broke all-time heat records, with temperatures in some places reaching above 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46 Celsius).  Oregon has recorded 116 deaths from the heatwave, while Washington state said Thursday that its toll had risen to 78. Authorities say hundreds of deaths may ultimately be attributed to the heat throughout the region.  Amid a historic drought, temperatures are spiking in parts of the US West again this week but are less intense than the earlier heatwave.  Under Oregon's new rules for workers, when the heat index is at or above 80 F (27 C), employers are required to provide access to sufficient shade and an adequate supply of drinking water.  When the heat index rises above 90 F (32 C), employers also must ensure effective communication between workers and supervisors so workers can report concerns, ensure that employees are observed for alertness and signs of heat illness, and provide a cool-down rest period in the shade of 10 minutes for every two hours of work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/oregon-adopts-most-protective-heat-rules-for-workers-in-us/articleshow/84253785.cms||---

This was revealed by Haridwar district magistrate (DM) C Ravishankar to TOI on Wednesday. Speaking about the progress of the probe, the DM said, “It has been found that the firm, Max Corporate Services, was not eligible to get empanelled for conducting Covid tests during the Kumbh but was given the contract. The mela health department’s role is suspicious in this regard and is being thoroughly probed.” The health departments of the district administration as well as the Kumbh mela administration had together empanelled 22 path labs for Covid tests during the mega event that was held from April 1 to 30. The Kumbh mela health department had in late December last year issued an advertisement for empanelment of path labs that were ICMR-approved. Max Corporate Services had applied in response to this advertisement and had submitted an expression of interest (EoI) on January 11. According to the DM, Max Corp Services’ EoI should not have been entertained by the Kumbh mela health department since the firm is not an ICMR-approved entity. Kumbh mela health officer Dr Arjun Singh Sengar, when queried about the issue, said, “The empanelment of Max Corporate Services was done in a proper manner as they applied along with Nalwa Laboratories and Dr Lalchandani Labs, both of which are ICMR-approved labs. The scam happened because the district administration, which had the responsibility to check the test details being filed by the path labs on the online portal, failed to do so.” Meanwhile, opposition Congress has alleged that documents related to the scam were being “manipulated” by officials and demanded that those under whose watch the scam happened should be replaced at the earliest to ensure a fair probe. Congress leader Sanjay Paliwal told TOI, “Without the replacement of the officers of the mela and district administration, a fair investigation is not possible as important documents are being distorted to influence the probe.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kumbh-scam-company-got-nod-for-tests-without-documents/articleshow/84253823.cms||MS Nawaz
---||World||Rachmawati Sukarnoputri, sibling rival in Indonesia politics, dies at 70||JAKARTA, INDONESIA: Rachmawati Sukarnoputri, a daughter of Indonesia’s founding president, Sukarno, and the loser in a struggle with her older sister, former President Megawati Sukarnoputri, to become his political heir, died Saturday in Jakarta, the country’s capital. She was 70. Her death, at Gatot Subroto Army Hospital, was announced by Sufmi Dasco Ahmad, an executive of her political party, Gerindra. The cause was covid-19. She died at the end of a week in which Indonesia reported its highest number of deaths from the virus in a single day, 24,836. The revered Sukarno founded the Indonesian republic in 1945 after the withdrawal of Dutch colonial rulers, and the family name still resonates almost mystically among many Indonesians. A trigger for the feud between the sisters was the collapse of a compact among Sukarno’s children to stay out of politics as long as President Suharto, the man who supplanted their father, held power. Suharto deposed Sukarno in a coup in 1967 and ruled Indonesia for 31 years before being forced from office in 1998. Sukarno died in 1970, and Suharto died in 2008. Both men like many Indonesians, used only one name. Megawati Sukarno, the older sister, broke the family compact when she joined the opposition Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) in 1987. The aura of the Sukarno name had the intended effect of attracting support to the party, and that same aura would help carry Megawati to the presidency in 2001. At different times on various pretexts, Rachmawati accused her sister of opening the country to the spread of communism, of undermining the constitution and of treason. She dismissed her sister as being “a biological child but not an ideological child” of their father. Megawati, famously taciturn, did not publicly engage in the spat, and even in a private face-to-face meeting with her sister was reported to have listened but to have said nothing. Rachmawati entered politics after the fall of Suharto, helping to found the Pioneers’ Party in 2002. But it won only a tiny number of seats in Parliament. She joined the Nasdem Party in 2012 but quickly left it to join the Great Indonesia Movement Party, or Gerindra, the party of Suharto’s son-in-law Prabowo Subianto. At her death, she was on its board of trustees. “Rachmawati always sided with anyone who opposed her eldest sister, including Prabowo,” said Andreas Harsono, a Human Rights Watch researcher who wrote a book about the early days of Indonesia, “Race, Islam and Power” (2019), and who knows the Sukarno siblings. “It is a dysfunctional family,” he said. Rachmawati was accused of being involved in a plot in 2016 to rally hard-line Islamists to kidnap the Christian governor of Jakarta. She was one of 11 people arrested on treason charges related to the plot but was released a day later, denying that she had been involved and saying, “How could I be doing treason against the country that my father helped found?” The Jakarta governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, was a close ally of President Joko Widodo, who’s Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle was headed by Megawati. Diah Permana Rachmawati Sukarno was born in Jakarta on September 27th, 1950, to Sukarno and his third wife, Fatmawati, who was considered his official consort for ceremonial occasions. Rachmawati was the third of five children of that marriage and had several half-siblings from Sukarno’s eight other marriages. Like Megawati, she took on the patronymic Sukarnoputri, meaning daughter of Sukarno, to emphasize the connection to their father. When she was 3, her mother left the palace in protest of Sukarno’s plans to take a new wife, and Rachmawati was raised mainly by a foster mother. She attended the Cikini College Elementary School, Cikini College Junior High School and Santa Ursula High School in Jakarta. Her pursuits were reported to have been traditional dance, fencing, swimming and badminton. She studied law at Universitas Indonesia but dropped out in 1969. Before going into politics, Rachmawati helped set up the Sukarno Education Foundation in 1983; it changed its name to Universitas Bung Karno in 1999. She earned a law degree there in 2002. Along with Megawati, she is survived by three sons, Hendra Rahtomo, Marhaendra Putra and Mahardhika Putra; a sister, Sukmawati Sukarnoputri; two brothers, Guntur Sukarnoputra and Guruh Sukarnoputra; and a number of half-siblings. She was divorced twice. Her third husband, Benny Sumarno, died in 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/rachmawati-sukarnoputri-sibling-rival-in-indonesia-politics-dies-at-70/articleshow/84253814.cms||---

While dealing with the controversy over the Delhi Assembly committee summoning Facebook Vice-President Ajit Mohan for spread of hate messages during Delhi riots, a bench of Justices S K Kaul, Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy said, “Entities like Facebook have to remain accountable to those who entrust them with such power.” TOI Editorial: Social media platforms can no longer be given special rights over contentWriting the judgment, Justice Kaul said, “While Facebook has played a crucial role in enabling free speech by providing a voice to the voiceless and means to escape state censorship, we cannot lose sight of the fact that it has simultaneously become a platform for disruptive messages, voices, and ideologies.” Referring to the debate over the role of social media in democracies, the bench said the endeavour has been to tackle hate speech on one hand while not suppressing the right to freedom of speech and expression of citizens that could make those in power uncomfortable. “The significance of this is all the more in a democracy which itself rests on certain core values. This unprecedented degree of influence (wielded by social media platforms) necessitates safeguards and caution in consonance with democratic values. Platforms and intermediaries must subserve the principal objective as a valuable tool for public good upholding democratic values,” the SC said, cautioning about the experience of western democracies where social media platforms were suspected to have been used for influencing core processes. Read AlsoCentre free to act against Twitter: High CourtNEW DELHI: The Centre is free to act against Twitter for any breach of new IT rules, the Delhi high court said on Thursday, adding the social media platform doesn’t enjoy any protection in this regard from the court. The HC made its stand clear following the microblogging site seeking more time toReferring to the vast reach of Facebook, the bench said it has 2.85 billion monthly active users worldwide, of which India accounts for 270 million. The SC said it made Facebook a powerful entity as far as influencing the opinions of citizens is concerned. “Such vast powers must necessarily come with responsibility,” it said. “Election and voting processes, the very foundation of a democratic government, stand threatened by social media manipulation,” it said, adding, “It is difficult to accept the simplistic approach adopted by Facebook -- that it is merely a platform posting third party information and has no role in generating, controlling or modulating that information. The endeavour to hide behind such simplistic models have been found to be unacceptable by the UK Parliament.” The SC said social media platforms like Facebook cannot deny that they use algorithms (which are sequences of instructions) with some human intervention to personalise content and news to target users. “The algorithms select the content based on several factors including social connections, location, and past online activity of the user. These algorithms are often far from objective with biases capable of getting replicated and reinforced. The role played by Facebook is, thus, more active and not as innocuous as is often presented when dealing with third party content,” the bench said, which could indirectly justify the recent government actions to make the social media platforms, including Twitter, fall in line with the new regulations. Read AlsoAbide by India’s rules: New IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw to TwitterNEW DELHI: Ashwini Vaishnaw took charge as the country’s new IT, communications and railway minister and emphasised that companies doing business in India, including social media giants such as Twitter, would need to abide by the law of the land. Vaishnaw, who replaced Ravi Shankar Prasad inJustice Kaul said, “The digital platforms can be imminently uncontrollable at times and carry their own challenges. One form of digital platforms are the intermediaries that claim to be providing a platform for exchange of ideas without any contribution of their own. It is their say that they are not responsible for all that transpires on their platform; though on complaints being made, they do remove offensive content based on their internal guidelines. The power and potentiality of these intermediaries is vast, running across borders. These are multinational corporations with large wealth and influence at their command.” Referring to Brexit and US presidential elections and the role of social media, the SC referred to a new word “Post-Truth” and said, “The obfuscation of facts, abandonment of evidentiary standards in reasoning, and outright lying in the public sphere left many aghast. A lot of blame was sought to be placed at the door of social media, it being a source of this evolving contemporary phenomenon where objective truth is becoming a commodity with diminishing value. George Orwell, in his 1943 essay titled ‘Looking Back on the Spanish War’ had expressed ‘…the very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world. After all, the chances are that those lies, or at any rate similar lies will pass into history’ -- the words have proved to be prophetic.” Justices Kaul, Maheshwari and Roy said Facebook has acknowledged before the SC that they had removed 22.5 million pieces of hate speech content in the second quarter of 2020, which showed that they exercise a substantial degree of control over the content that is allowed to be disseminated on its platform. “To that extent, a parallel may be drawn with editorial responsibility cast on other mass circulation media,” the SC said. “The business model of intermediaries like Facebook being one across countries, they cannot be permitted to take contradictory stands in different jurisdictions. Thus, for example in the US, Facebook projected itself in the category of a publisher, giving them protection under the ambit of the First Amendment of its control over the material which are disseminated in their platform,” it said. “This identity has allowed it to justify moderation and removal of content. Conspicuously in India, however, it has chosen to identify itself purely as a social media platform, despite its similar functions and services in the two countries. Thus, depending on the nature of controversy, Facebook having almost identical reach to the population of different countries seeks to modify its stand depending upon its suitability and convenience,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/social-media-platforms-must-be-accountable-supreme-court/articleshow/84253849.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

However, the SC also said the committee, which is headed by AAP MLA Raghav Chadha and is inquiring into the Delhi riots, could not pre-judge and foray into issues relating to law and order, Delhi Police and information technology, or compel the representatives of the social media platform to depose on them. In a 188-page judgment delineating the privilege powers of Delhi Assembly and its lack of jurisdiction over law and order as well as Delhi Police, both of which vest with the Centre, a bench of Justices Sanjay K Kaul, Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy said since the Assembly could not legislate on these two subjects as well as issues related to information technology, the committee also could not touch upon these issues while inquiring into the alleged role of Facebook in helping spread of hate speech during the Delhi riots. However, it said the committee has a legitimate role in seeking to inquire into issues relating to the general public of Delhi and is hence vested with the right to summon anyone, including the Facebook official, to appear before it as a witness. Writing the judgment, Justice Kaul said, "An assembly, more so in the nature of Delhi assembly with its own peculiarities (i.e., exclusion of certain powers), even if given the widest amplitude and powers which a committee should have, cannot step on the toes or rather shoes of an entity having exclusive jurisdiction by reason of List I (Union List)." It also said that the Delhi government exercises no legislative jurisdiction over the Information Technology Act, which again is under the purview of the Centre. Ajit Mohan had contested the summons from the Committee to join the hearing on Delhi riots. "In the larger context, the concept of peace and harmony goes much beyond law and order and police, more so in view of ‘on the-ground’ governance being in the hands of the Delhi government," the bench said, upholding the setting up of the committee. However, it took a serious view of Chadha's press conference on August 31 last year after issuing notice to Mohan, who had challenged the notice on the ground that he had already appeared and answered questions before a Parliamentary Committee on similar issues. "In this process, Chadha stated that it, prima facie, appeared that Facebook had colluded with vested interests during the Delhi riots in February, 2020. Comments were also made by the chairman to the effect that Facebook ought to be treated as a co-accused and an independent investigation should be carried out into its role in the riots," the SC noted in its judgment. "The aforesaid statements and conclusions are completely outside the remit of the committee and should not have been made. That it may give rise to apprehension in the minds of the petitioners can also not be doubted," the three-judge bench said. The bench also said, "The committee cannot have a misconception that it is some kind of a prosecuting agency which can embark on the path of holding people guilty and direct the filing of supplementary chargesheet against them. We, thus, opine that this aspect has to be kept in mind by the committee so as to not vitiate future proceedings and give rise to another challenge." "We are of the view that in any eventuality, as speculative as it may be, if the committee seeks to traverse the path relating to the excluded entries, ie law and order and police, any representative of Facebook who would appear before the committee would be well within their right to refuse to answer the query and such an approach cannot be taken amiss with possibility of inviting privilege proceedings. It is a delicate balance to follow and we do not seek to give an excuse to the representative of the petitioners to not answer questions and frustrate the proceedings before the committee qua the petitioners." The SC said it is giving this limited protection to the Facebook official to ward off possible posers to it if the committee embarked on prohibited areas of law and order, police and I-T Act. "We are quite confident that such an eventuality will not arise, given the important role that the committee is performing and that it will accept the sagacious advice. So much and not further," it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delhi-house-panel-can-summon-facebook-supreme-court/articleshow/84253933.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The HC made its stand clear following the microblogging site seeking more time to appoint key officials as mandated under India’s new law. Advocate Sajan Poovayya, representing Twitter, told the court it was not seeking any protection. “You are free to take action, please enforce the rules,” Poovayya responded, when the Centre iterated the US-based company’s stance was in violation of India’s IT rules. Poovayya sought time from the court to file a notarised affidavit from the US regarding the issue of compliance. Meanwhile, Twitter filed a short note, clarifying the status of appointment of the interim chief compliance officer (CCO), interim RGO as well as a nodal contact person on an interim basis. It said it required eight weeks to regularise these positions. Justice Rekha Palli HC granted two weeks for the notarised affidavits to be filed and listed the matter for further hearing on July 28, but made it clear the affidavit would be filed not only by Twitter but all its newly appointed officials too, taking responsibility for the company’s compliance. “Even though the court is not able to appreciate why the said note refers to these officers as interim, since no affidavit has been filed by Twitter, it seeks two week time to file the notarised affidavit from the US. However scanned copies will be filed by July 13th. It will be accompanied by the affidavit of the concerned persons who have been or are being appointed,” the HC noted in its order. The HC had on July 6 directed Twitter to inform it by July 8 as to when it would appoint a resident grievance officer (RGO) in compliance with the new IT rules. In its reply, Twitter said an interim CCO has already been appointed on July 6, an interim RGO and interim nodal contact officer would be appointed by July 11 and within two weeks, respectively. However, the bench questioned the usage of the term “interim” and pointed out that “tomorrow, you may take benefit of the word ‘interim’” Poovayya explained that since Twitter was in the process of setting up a liaison office in India, it could not appoint “permanent employees” and informed the court that at present, the contact address of Twitter Inc was that of its lawyer in Bengaluru. Petitioner-lawyer Amit Acharya, represented through advocate Akash Bajpai, said in his plea he came to know about Twitter’s alleged non-compliance when he tried to lodge a complaint against a couple of tweets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-free-to-act-against-twitter-high-court/articleshow/84253954.cms||Abhinav Garg

Vaishnaw, who replaced Ravi Shankar Prasad in communications and IT, and Piyush Goyal in railways, said anyone who lives and works in India will have to abide by the country’s rules. The new minister’s statements come in the backdrop of the tussle between the Centre and social media companies, especially Twitter, over the new IT rules, which had prompted Prasad to take a tough stance. The micro-blogging platform has failed to comply with requirements to designate compliance, grievance and nodal officers, something its rivals have managed to do. While the government was already upset with the non-compliance, which resulted in the loss of the company’s immunity against third-party content/posts, the court, too, has taken a grim view of the repeated failure by Twitter. The comments, which came after the bureaucrat-turned-businessman’s meeting with BJP general secretary (Organisation) BL Santhosh, signal the government’s intent stick to its stand. Separately, after taking charge as the railway minister, Vaishnaw said, “Railway is a major part of PM Modi’s vision. His vision for railways is to transform the lives of the people, and ensuring that everyone — from the common man to the farmers and the poor — gets the benefit of railways. I will work for that and will try to implement his vision.” Vaishnaw also thanked the PM for entrusting him with this responsibility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/abide-by-indias-rules-new-it-minister-vaishnaw-to-twitter/articleshow/84253982.cms||---

Sources said CM Singh’s meeting with party chief Sonia Gandhi was positive as it was capped by Singh making a public statement that he would abide by and implement any decision of the leadership. “Singh has shown the trait of a leader of stature as well as discipline that was expected of him, despite the testing circumstances,” said a senior Congress manager. In contrast, there is a sense of unease with the ceaseless tweeting by Sidhu which appears to be targeting the Congress government and the CM. “There is no restriction in Congress that a newcomer or a junior leader can’t be given a key party post. But it is incumbent upon him to show he is capable of tying himself to the discipline that is required of such a position. Flamboyance is fine, but discipline is different,“ the manager added. Sources said the party has a narrow window to ascertain that Sidhu can be restrained in his approach if he occupies a key position. The appreciation for CM Singh in the party circles for his statement that he will abide by Sonia Gandhi suggests that there is an expectation that Sidhu will follow suit since he has not made such a remark till now. Congress is set to come out with a decision on the reorganisation of the party in which the key factor is how Sidhu would be accommodated. Sidhu is adamant on the state president post but is facing resistance from the CM and “Gennext” leaders. In what appears to be an attempt to stall Sidhu, CM Singh has also played the “Hindu card” by saying that the reins of state organisation should be given to a leader from the Hindu community which he says was required for social balancing. However, Sidhu has strong backing of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra which is seen as crucial. The apprehension that Sidhu can jump ship if he is denied his wish mildly rankles some sections, especially in view of the AAP’s renewed push in the state, but the Gandhis appear assured on that front. However, the party has finalised the other less challenging decisions on setting right the social balancing in the government and the rest of the organisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-miffed-with-sidhus-tweeting-wants-discipline/articleshow/84254006.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

Health minister Mangal Pandey said the hospitals have been asked to increase the number of beds in paediatric wards, equip them with oxygen pipelines and keep important medical equipment ready for treatment of children. He said the health department was providing all necessary equipment to the hospitals besides holding regular meetings with the superintendents and principals of the health institutions. “Private hospitals and non-government organisations are also being encouraged to make advance planning to save children from the deadly virus,” the minister told this newspaper. He appreciated the Patna-based Mahavir Vatsalya Aspatal for creating a separate 90-bed children ward. The Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) has almost completed its preparations for the future. “We have reserved one floor entirely for treatment of children in the event of third wave of Covid,” IGIMS superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said. The Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) is also busy improving its childcare facilities. The hospital has started readying 60 new paediatric beds. The virus tends to mutate for its own survival and after witnessing the human sufferings in first and second waves, there are strong chances of its third wave,” PMCH superintendent Dr IS Thakur said. The work on connecting 80 beds with oxygen pipeline is likely to begin soon, Dr Thakur said, adding in case of emergency, the hospital would arrange other facilities from its own resources. The number of paediatric beds at Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) has been increased from 84 to 124. “Additional equipment like infusion pump, monitors and ventilators have been provided by the health department,” NMCH superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh said. Though piped oxygen is available in all the beds, 99 oxygen concentrators have also been kept ready at NMCH. Mahavir Vatsalya Aspatal director Dr S N Sinha said one floor of the hospital was dedicated for the 90-bed children ward. “The ward has been created keeping in mind the possible third wave of Covid,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hospitals-improve-infra-to-face-3rd-wave/articleshow/84244338.cms||VK Tripathi

Many of the certified startups that sought financial assistance from the state have been waiting for over 14 months for what was promised. Since the launch of the Goa Startup Policy – 2017, the state government has repeatedly promised to make Goa one of the top 25 startup destinations in Asia. Startups say that the Pramod Sawant government’s steps have been towards the opposite direction. Those that were certified by the startup promotion cell (SPC) with valid startup certificate numbers, have begun to scale down operations. At a time when the Covid-19 pandemic has hurt startups, the delay in disbursement of funds has added to their financial woes. “My company is registered with the SPC. Our application for funding is pending since the past 14 months. Our second tranche of seed funding is pending since April 2020 and by now, we have incurred expenses to be covered under the third tranche and have run out of funds,” said managing partner at Uzoorba Technologies, Vincent Toscano. While the department of information and technology has certified at least 110 startups, disbursal of funds to them has been slow. The state high-powered committee was scheduled to meet in May, but the meeting was cancelled due to the second Covid-19 wave. The Covid-19 pandemic offered Brizz Medical, a startup that provides home delivery of medicines from local pharmacies, an ideal opportunity to scale up. Founded by Isha Kher along with her father Sunil, Brizz Medical had planned on expanding its delivery service to other parts of Goa but the lack of funding to promote the startup stalled those plans. “The funds would have helped or the state could have given us some marketing assistance. Even this little bit of marketing would be very helpful,” said managing director Isha. Her father says Brizz Medical has a presence in four to five towns in Goa, but aside from Panaji and Mapusa, it has yet to strengthen its presence in the other towns. Startups have applied for seed funding, internet reimbursement and salary incentives, but till the high-powered committee meets to approve the disbursement, the IT department cannot do much. IT director Ankita Anand said the government plans to hold the high-powered committee meeting in the first week of August to clear all pending incentives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/14-months-on-goas-startups-stare-at-funding-mirage/articleshow/84251498.cms||Newton Sequeira

---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Implement law we brought to regularise 30,000 employees, says Sukhbir Singh Badal||CHANDIGARH: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has urged the Congress government in Punjab to take up the ‘Punjab Adhoc, Contractual, Daily Wage, Temporary Work Charged and Outsourced Employees Welfare Act, 2016’ for immediate implementation. Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal said the then SAD-led government had decided that services of A, B, C and D group of employees who were working on an adhoc, contractual, daily wage, temporary, work charge or outsourced basis under state government entities for more than three years would be regularised. He said the Act had been notified in the Punjab government gazette on December 24, 2016, but as the general election was announced in the first week of January 2017, the same could not be implemented. The Akali leader also condemned the “brutality being inflicted on contractual employees” who were agitating for regularisation of their services. He said it was shocking that the Congress government had refused to regularise 30,000 contractual employees since the last four and a half years even though the party had promised the same in its election manifesto. Sukhbir assured the contractual employees that the SAD would agitate and force the Congress government to implement these promises failing which their services would be regularised once the SAD-led government was formed in the state in 2022. The Ferozepur MP said it was shocking that after taking over the reins of the state, the Congress government instead of regularising these employees had ignored their genuine demand and refused to hold any talks with them. “Agitating contractual employees, including those of the education department and health department, have been lathi-charged and even women employees have been manhandled,” he added. The government attitude was such that recently when 9,000 contractual employees working under the national health mission demanded regularisation of their services as many as 1,000 employees were terminated, said Sukhbir, adding that this was done to employees who worked under trying times during the period of Covid pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/implement-law-we-brought-to-regularise-30000-employees-sukhbir/articleshow/84250647.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: ‘Hosp go-around led to pregnant doctor’s death’||KOLKATA: The state has lost at least 65 doctors to Covid in the second wave. During the peak, towards the end of April, Kolkata also lost a doctor not to the infection but to pregnancy-related complications, during which she was reportedly refused treatment by two major private hospitals. The 32-year-old doctor at 35 weeks of pregnancy died in the emergency unit of the third hospital. The West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission (WBCERC) on Thursday concluded the hearing in this case, but reserved judgement for another day. According to the petition filed with the commission, the physician, Shradha Buthra, started developing labour-related issues at her Jessore Road home on the evening of April 24. She had been consulting a gynaecologist at the latter’s Bangur Avenue chamber. When she felt unwell, she called up the doctor, who reportedly asked her to go to a corporate hospital near Salt Lake. The patient reached the hospital around 7.45pm. “The family alleged they were told by this hospital that they could take her in, but it was full of Covid patients, which scared the family into not admitting her,” said WBCERC chairperson Justice (retired) Ashim Kumar Banerjee. Buthra was then taken to a mother-and-child speciality hospital in central Kolkata, where the gynaecologist works as a consultant, around 11pm. Buthra had already suffered convulsions. According the complaint lodged by her deceased husband Nikunj, this hospital refused to attend to the patient saying she needed a better set-up. The hospital arranged an ambulance and allegedly told the family to take her to another facility. The family took her to the third hospital, 2km away, the patient allegedly lay unattended in the ambulance for 30 minutes. When a family member started narrating their plight live on Facebook, only then did doctors at the emergency admit the patient. But she collapsed to death in the emergency wing. “It is such a sad incident where we lost a young doctor and her unborn child. We have concluded hearing of this case but the verdict has been reserved for now,” said Banerjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hosp-go-around-led-to-pregnant-doctors-death/articleshow/84248355.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The water discharge through the Valmikinagar barrage across the river increased from 1.53 lakh cusecs on Wednesday evening to 2.93 lakh cusecs at 6pm on Thursday. “The water discharge through Valmikinagar barrage might cross the 3 lakh cusecs-mark due to the very heavy rainfall received in the catchment areas of the river in Nepal,” a state water resources department official said. The WRD has already sent an “express alert” to all the chief engineers of the divisions lying in the Gandak basin and asked them to remain vigilant. Even though the Mahananda in eastern Bihar districts has been flowing below the danger level, its water level is expected to rise by Friday. A high-level team comprising senior officials from the departments concerned, along with West Champaran DM Kundan Kumar, has made aerial survey of the flooded areas to take stock of the situation and streamline rescue and relief operations. The state team, comprising transport department secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal and agriculture director Adesh Titarmarey, assessed the damage caused by flood in Ramnagar, Gunaha, Sikta, Mainatand, Majhaulia and Chanpatia blocks. Reports from Motihari said flood caused by Gandak, Burhi Gandak, Lalbakeya and Bagmati rivers has made the situation in 75 villages under various blocks of East Champaran district grim. Agarwal and Titarmare, along with East Champaran DM Shirshat Kapil Ashok, conducted an aerial survey of the flood-hit areas of the district to estimate the damage. The East Champaran DM said 6.12 lakh people of 144 villages under nine blocks have been badly affected by floods from different rivers. He said adequate steps have been taken to conduct rescue and relief operations. Met predicts more rainfall in east and central Bihar: The India Meteorological Department on Thursday issued a yellow warning for thunderstorm along with lightning in the state over the next two days. It stated that moderate to severe thunderstorm accompanied with frequent cloud to ground lightning is very likely over Bihar during the next 24 hours. Fairly widespread rainfall has been predicted in the state till June 12. S K Mandal, a meteorologist at Patna, said rainfall or thunderstorm over the next 24 to 48 hours is likely to be comparatively more in eastern and central parts of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/flood-situation-grim-in-north-bihar/articleshow/84243305.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Car rental agencies hike rates in survival struggle||KOLKATA: Several private car rental agencies in the city have hiked rates following the century run of petrol and increase in diesel prices towards the Rs 100 mark. Those who haven’t done so yet said they will have to follow suit soon if they want to cut down on daily losses. Till last year, a regular sedan was available at Rs 130 to Rs 140 per hour for a minimum of 10 hours or Rs 13-Rs 14 per km for a minimum 100km. Now, most agencies have increased the fare to Rs 150-Rs 160. “How else can we survive? The pandemic has robbed us of customers and the rising fuel price leaves us with nothing even after a full day’s trip. We used to charge Rs 1,400 for 10 hours even last month, but now we have increased it marginally to Rs 1,500. We were left with practically nothing after paying for fuel and a day’s salary for the driver,” said Pronab Kr Mohanty, who runs a car rental firm in New Town and Salt Lake In the last two months prices of petrol and diesel have spiked almost every alternate day. On Thursday, petrol in the city cost Rs 100.68/L and diesel was selling at Rs. 92.71/L. Till April, petrol cost Rs 90.60/L and diesel was sold at Rs 83.59/L. “At times, owners like us are being forced to drive the cars to earn some profit. For a 100km trip, there is a fuel consumption of around Rs 900 these days and the driver’s daily fee is Rs 600. If we don’t charge Rs 1,500, we will end up paying from our pockets. We don’t earn enough from this to pay for the EMI, maintenance and family expenses any more,” said Mithun Ghosh, who manages a car rental service in Behala. Faruque Ansari of Fast Services in Park Street said Covid restrictions have broken their backbone. “We are charging Rs 1,500 for a normal sedan and Rs 3,500 for an average SUV. We also rent out luxury cars, like BMW, Audi and Mercedes Benz, for anything between Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000 for 10 hours, but we haven’t increased rates for this section,” said Ansari, who had to sell four of his 13 cars in the past year to manage expenses. With a large number of corporates opting for work from home, the situation has worsened for rental agencies that used to provide cars to these companies. Those still in operation — mostly affiliated with with emergency services — are continuing with the older rate of Rs 140 per hour and claim to be taking a deep cut in profit margins to ensure they don’t lose the tenders. “I am paying from my pockets, but if I increase the rate, another agency will quote a lower one and bag the tender,” said the owner of an agency unwilling to be named.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/car-rental-agencies-hike-rates-in-survival-struggle/articleshow/84248229.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Accused Asgar Shah was known to the victim. “Shah confessed to being party to the crime and looting Rs 15 lakh in cash, in addition to gold and silver ornaments. Our team took him to his residence to carry out the seizures,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. Around Rs 10 lakh in cash, jewellery and mobiles were seized from the rented flat where he lives. However, Sharma refused to say if others were involved in the crime. Kolkata Police has set up a seven-member SIT, headed by an assistant commissioner-rank officer, to probe the case. Police sources said the victim knew Shah for over two years. They were friends and met often. After her family found out about the it, they placed curbs on her movements and took away her phone. When they left for work, they would lock the door to prevent them from meeting each other,” said an officer, adding that Shah was aware that her parents and brother returned late. According to cops, Shah came to the house with an electrical drilling equipment in the afternoon and used a duplicate key to the lock on the main door to enter the house. He tied up the woman’s hands and legs, raped her and fled. While leaving, he bolted the door, raising the suspicion of the woman’s brother who was the first to return home late in the evening,” said an officer.

While the price escalation then was due to supply shortage because of transportation problems, the current rise is due to a rise in production cost and transportation. Retail price of dressed chicken has gone up from Rs 200 to Rs 250 per kg while that of boneless chicken has increased from Rs 300 to Rs 330 per kg. Price of drumsticks has increased from Rs 230 per kg to Rs 260 per kg. “Given the current trend, the price may go up further,” said New Market Chicken Traders’ Association secretary Saukat Ali. Wholesale chicken price has gone up by at least 30% to cross Rs 230 for the first time in over a year following a sharp rise in cost of corn and soya used as feed in poultry farms. The price of egg has also climbed from Rs. 5.50 per piece to between Rs 6 and Rs.6.50. “Eggs are now being sold at Rs 75-Rs 80 per dozen in the retail market. The wholesale price is somewhere around Rs 5.75 per piece,” said an official of National Egg Coordination Committee. According to sellers in city markets, the chicken price had been hovering around Rs 200 even a fortnight ago. “I was selling chicken at Rs 200 per kg till a few days ago. Now it has gone up to Rs 260 per kg,” said Satyajit Sinha Roy, a chicken seller at Lake Market. A Behala market vendor said he is selling dressed chicken at Rs 250 and boneless chicken at Rs 360 per kg. At Janbazar, the rate of dressed chicken is hovering between Rs 250 and Rs 270. “Managing family budget has become tough. How will middle-class households survive?” said Golpark resident Shyamali Bose. West Bengal Poultry Federation deputy CEO B R Das said poultry farms had been forced to hike chicken price as cost of corn had gone up by 60% from Rs 12-Rs 13 per kg to Rs 20 per kg while that of soya had increased by over 40% from Rs 32-Rs 35 per kg to Rs 46-Rs 48 per kg. In addition, transportation cost has increased due to rise in fuel prices and stricter monitoring to curb overloading. “There is excess production of chicken in the state. Yet prices have gone up because of the continued rise in production cost,” Das said. West Bengal Poultry & Egg Federation general secretary Madan Mohan Maity said a majority of raw materials for poultry food, like soya cake, sunflower cake, nut cake and corn, were procured from Maharashtra, Punjab and Haryana. “Due to the increasing fuel price and restrictions on weight of goods carriages, production cost has shot up. Once fresh raw materials are produced in our state by November, the price of poultry food will also come down.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/feed-cost-rise-transport-trouble-take-chicken-egg-prices-to-lockdown-high/articleshow/84248313.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Petrol continues upward march||KOLKATA: Petrol price in Kolkata continued the uphill climb even after breaching the Rs 100-mark on Wednesday, reaching an all-time high of Rs 100.68 on Thursday after a 39 paise increase in 24 hours. This was the 37th hike in two months and fourth in eight days this month. Diesel price, too, increased by 15 paise since Wednesday to touch Rs 92.71 on Thursday, barely Rs 7 shy of a century. Petrol pump operators hinted the prices may increase further given the nation-wide trend. Sources in an oil PSU said fuel prices across India have been turning more volatile with the prices of crude oil showing a firm trend. During the Covid lockdown, when crude oil prices had come down, the central and state governments had increased fuel taxes to bolster revenues. The central government had also raised the excise duty on both fuels. With the crude oil price increasing, the motorists are now feeling the pinch. Surajit Saha (34), a banker from Konnagar, said he rides around 80km daily between his home and office on his bike and had a monthly fuel expense of around Rs 3,000. “But in the last few months, the fuel expense has gone out of my budget. I end up spending anything between Rs 4,200-Rs 4,500. In these times of restrictions, travelling on public transport is out of the question and, hence, we will have to bear with the additional expense no matter how much it hurts our pockets,” said Saha who works at the Esplanade branch of a private bank. The rising fuel prices have even forced people to make immediate changes to their regular travel plans. “I drive between Kolkata and Durgapur quite often to meet my parents. But with the current fuel price, I don’t intend to drive any more. I will take an AC bus at one-fourth the cost,” said Sourabh Roy, a resident of Entally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/petrol-continues-upward-march/articleshow/84248241.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Chirag told mediapersons in Begusarai on the second day of his ‘ashirvad yatra’ that he was seeking people’s blessing and also trying to feel their pulse during his visit to different districts as part of the yatra. At the same time, he predicted a mid-term poll in the state. Lashing out at JD(U) for its “role” in the split of the LJP, a charge denied by Chirag said several leaders and workers of CM Nitish Kumar’s party were in his contact and ready to switch over. “The induction of Rajya Sabha MP and JD(U) national president RCP Singh into the Narendra Modi Cabinet has led to strong resentment among other leaders of that party,” he added. He said the NDA would not remain intact in days to come, leading to a mid-term poll in the state. “We have started preparations for the mid-term polls and asked the workers of the party to be ready. I have decided to start ‘padyatra’ from October,” he added. Reacting to the induction of his uncle and Hajipur MP Pashupati Kumar Paras into the Union Cabinet, Chirag said, “The last month’s coup in the party by my uncle left me with no other option but to seek people’s blessing. The JD(U) had to spare its berth for Paras in the council of ministers at the Centre.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chirag-says-mid-term-polls-inevitable-in-bihar/articleshow/84243591.cms||Ramashankar
---||Business||No tax on foreign account if Indian not beneficial owner: Income Tax Appellate Tribunal||MUMBAI: Mere mention of a person’s name in the account-opening form of an overseas bank does not mean that such an individual is the beneficial owner of the bank account, according to a recent order passed by the Delhi bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT). An I-T officer had held that Jatinder Mehra, who had ‘opened’ this bank account, had not disclosed this overseas asset in his tax returns and the stringent provisions of the Black Money Act would apply. Thus, he sought to tax the Rs 5.7 crore (being the funds in this account) in Mehra’s hands. However, the ITAT observed that Mehra had filed an affidavit disclosing complete details of the ownership of the bank account. Based on the solitary fact of his name mentioned in the bank account-opening form and lack of any other evidence relating to ownership or beneficial ownership over such an account, the sum could not be taxed in India in the hands of Mehra, ruled the ITAT. In this case, an intricate set of facts were involved. Mehra’s name together with his passport details were on the account-opening form of a Singapore bank. However, this account belonged to a foreign company — Watergate Advisors, incorporated in the tax haven of British Virgin Islands. Mehra’s son, a non-resident Indian since 1998, was the director and sole shareholder of this company. Under tax laws, overseas income held by a non-resident cannot be taxed in India. It all began when a search was conducted in the case of Rakesh Agarwal Group, Baroda, and details of six trust companies came to light, one of which relates to this case heard by the ITAT. In April 2005, a Cayman Islands-based revocable trust was settled by Mehra, and the beneficiaries of this trust were his two sons and a grandson. The trust deed was revoked in December 2011 and the trust funds (Rs 5.7 crore, if converted into Indian rupees) were transferred into the Singapore bank account. It is this sum that the I-T officer sought to tax in the hands of Mehra, by applying the provisions of the Black Money Act. At the first level of appeal, the Commissioner Appeals had ruled in favour of the taxpayer. But the I-T department filed an appeal with the tax tribunal. The ITAT observed that, in response to queries raised by the I-T officer, Mehra had submitted that he does not even have a copy of the trust deed. His son, in order to show regard and respect towards his father, had wanted him to be a nominal settler of the trust, without his having to invest, contribute or settle any amount to the trust. Based on the entire facts, as the I-T department could not provide evidence that Mehra was the owner or beneficial owner of the sum lying in the Singapore bank account, the ITAT ruled in favour of the taxpayer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/funds-in-overseas-bank-a/c-cant-be-taxed-in-hands-of-indian-resident-if-he-is-not-beneficial-owner-itat/articleshow/84249101.cms||---
---||Patna||Now, door-to-door vax drive for elderly & disabled in Bihar||PATNA: With a view to helping senior citizens and disabled people receive Covid vaccine shots easily, the state government has decided to kick-start a door-to-door immunisation drive in different districts. An instruction was issued in this regard to the officials concerned via videoconferencing a few days ago after which they began making the necessary arrangements. The district magistrate (DM) of East Champaran, Shirsat Kapil Ashok, told TOI on Thursday that people, who wished to avail the door-to-door vaccination facility, would have to call on the toll free number 18003456624. “Vaccinators will reach the houses of the beneficiaries and inoculate them. They will also stay there for at least 15 minutes and keep in touch with the latter over the phone,” he added. Abhishek Singh, the DM of Gaya, which has 43,000 disabled people and nearly 2 lakh senior citizens, said, “Once such people get in touch with us, we will send our teams by the ‘Teeka Express’. Those living on the same route will be vaccinated on one day.” Although the door-to-door inoculation facility is meant to ramp up the vaccination process, some officials are of the view that this method may delay the immunisation drive because it will require additional time and manpower. As many as 1,78,71,009 doses of Covid-19 vaccines were administered to beneficiaries in Bihar till Thursday evening. Of these, 1,53,21,214 received their first dose and 25,49,795 their second. Nearly 44% of the vaccinated people were in the age group of 18 to 44 years, 28.94% in the group of 45 to 60 years and 27.59% in the group of 60+ years. According to sources, the state received 9.59 lakh doses of Covishield on Wednesday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/now-door-to-door-vax-drive-for-elderly-disabled-in-bihar/articleshow/84244063.cms||Sheezan Nezami

This despite a marginal contraction in FY20. According to the latest data from the ministry of commerce, tyre exports went up by 10% in value terms in FY21 to touch a figure of Rs 14097 crore, up from Rs 12,844 crore in FY20 (see table). In volume terms, tyre exports went up by 8% and reached 3.64 crore units. US, Germany, France, Italy and UK are the biggest export markets for Indian tyres. The export pickup came despite disruption in international trade following Covid pandemic that led to a sharp contraction of 23% in tyre exports from India in the Q1 of FY21. “The rise in exports during a challenging year bears testimony to the resilience of the industry to bounce back”, said Anshuman Singhania, chairman Automotive Tyre Manufacturers Association (ATMA). “Production capacities have stayed ahead of the domestic demand curve while widening the footprint in the export markets,” he added. Indian manufactured tyres are exported to over 170 countries and the top five markets -- US, Germany, France, Italy & UK -- comprise nearly 36% of the entire value of tyre exports. Tyre exports went up in double digits in each of the top 5 export markets in FY21. The US continues to be the largest market for Indian tyres accounting for 17% of total tyres exported from the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tyre-exports-hit-5-year-high-of-rs-14097-crore/articleshow/84248530.cms||---
---||Business||‘Google Pay, PhonePe must cut sops’||MUMBAI: Google Pay and PhonePe will have to pull back on customer incentives to bring their market share gradually toward the 30% cap imposed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), a report by Bernstein Research has said. PhonePe currently has a market share of 46% of UPI transactions by volume, followed by Google Pay, which accounts for 35% of all UPI transactions. In March, NPCI came out with its framework for implementing the cap. The corporation had said that it was authorised to penalize third-party app providers if they violate the cap. “Within the UPI super-apps, PhonePe leads the pack on overall UPI market share and has grown market share relative to Google Pay and Paytm. PhonePe and Google Pay continue investing in providing customer incentives and spend on marketing at 2.5-3.0x revenue,” said Gautam Chhugani of Bernstein in the report. The report points out that UPI, which gained popularity with users sending money to each other, is now increasingly being used for merchant payments. In volume terms, more people use UPI than cards (both credit and debit) to make payments in stores. Overall, cards still do better because of online payments and standing instructions. With recurring mandates coming up for UPI, the online segment could also grow. If the big two pull back on incentives, it is likely to result in the share of payment to merchants going up further. According to the report, Paytm has cut its marketing spending from 1.2 times of revenue in FY17 to 0.4 times in FY20. It now spends 0.2 times of its revenue on marketing. Besides having a market share of only 14%, Paytm is not subject to the caps as it is a payments bank and not a third-party app provider. However, Paytm is not chasing peer-to-peer transactions and is focusing on building a full-stack payments suite beyond UPI — point-of-sale, online payments gateway — the report said. It is also building a financial services platform focusing on pay-later lending and wealth management and insurance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/google-pay-phonepe-must-cut-sops/articleshow/84249197.cms||---

Thinking that the boy must have injured himself with a sharp object, the parents got him treated but were aghast when they later took him to a counsellor too. The counsellor told them that he was depressed due to Covid-induced self-isolation and had actually inflicted the injury on himself. Introvert by nature, Rittam even had to prodded at school by his friends to start a conversation. Over the last one year, he hardly met his friends and spent most of his time in his room as he is a single child. “All of this led to anxiety and the boy couldn’t even vent it out. So, the boy inflicted a wound on himself. It was his way of asking for help,” Dr Jalnidhi Nanavati, child and adolescent psychiatrist, told TOI. Dr Nanavati further said that many cases of adolescents facing depression and anxiety due to Covid-related restrictions have surfaced of late. Child psychiatrists and counsellors said that children and adolescents socialize with friends at school or in sports clubs. But for more than a year now, they haven’t been able socialize freely leading to depression among them. “They feel numb and to vent out their feelings, sometimes children inflict pain on themselves as they have no one to talk to. I get at least three such cases every week wherein the adolescent either inflicts wound or sometimes attempts suicide,” said Kanan Parikh, a professional counsellor. Rajkot’s 18-year-old Dhaval Gokani’s (name changed) addiction to mobile phone and other gadgets during the lockdown led him to a suffer from bipolar disorder due to sleep deprivation. The teen became so aggressive that one day he even assaulted his father.  Dr Chetan Hansalia, a Rajkot-based psychiatrist said, “The boy was put under medication for three weeks. Many teenagers have become aggressive as they couldn’t socialize with friends during the pandemic.” Surat-based psychiatrist, Dr Mayank Agrawal, said he treated a 14-year-old girl who got so addicted to Instagram that she began skipping classes to be on the app all the time. “Gradually, she started losing her temper if her photos didn’t get enough likes and once even consumed phenyl in anger!” he said.

While they don’t match the financial firepower of giants like SoftBank, KKR and Blackstone, they have been the busiest ones on India’s VC-PE deal street. Sequoia Capital, Accel India, Blume Ventures, Elevation Capital, Chiratae Ventures and Matrix Partners are the most active VC-PE firms in India, having closed more than 100 deals each in a little over five fiscals, according to industry trackers EY and Venture Intelligence. Fresh faces, too, have been entering the dealmaking space, increasing competition in the industry, which until a decade ago was a nascent alternative investment class. While these six firms have been the busiest, SoftBank, KKR, Blackstone, GIC, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) and Warburg Pincus are the biggest cheque writers (see graphic). US-based Sequoia leads the most active VC-PE firms’ list, having participated in more than 300 deals, whereas Japan’s SoftBank is the biggest VC-PE investor in India, having poured in nearly $12 billion in this period of just over five fiscals. But Sequoia invested $3.7 billion across its deals, while SoftBank’s investment is spread among 34 deals. “Typically, VC funds such as Sequoia, Accel, Blume and Elevation have an investment style and philosophy that is materially different from that adopted by PE funds such as KKR, Blackstone and Warburg. VC funds make more early stage bets, which are thereby riskier than those made by PE funds,” said EY India partner and national leader (private equity services) Vivek Soni. “The mortality rate of these early stage businesses is a lot higher than that of later stage businesses invested into by PE funds that often look for control and significant minority deals in mature companies whose business model and profitability is established. The capital invested in these early stage businesses per deal is also much smaller, reflecting the size of the target startup. In mature, late stage deals, the median investment value per deal has only been increasing since the past four years as large, global PE investors continue to allocate larger amounts of capital to India.” VC-PE investments in India totalled nearly $174 billion in the period under review, with the last fiscal seeing a record high of $47 billion despite the uncertainty triggered by the Covid crisis. Enthusiasm for tech startups, healthcare and consumption stories propelled the surge in deal activity. The industry has come of age, with more than 1,000 VC-PE shops operating in the country today. A decade ago, the number was in low triple digits. In comparison, China has more than 23,000 registered alternative investment managers. “India will continue to garner more interest from existing as well as new alternative investment managers,” said Soni. “On the supply side, the number of investible targets has also been increasing, as new business models emerge and existing ones demonstrate the ability to scale up.” Pranav Pai, founding partner of the VC firm 3one4 Capital, said, “With a dozen startup IPOs planned over the next few quarters, this exit cycle will also lend more optimism and should support additional reinvestments back into the ecosystem.” Pai estimated that Indian startups should raise $15-20 billion, on average, every year this decade. This possibly indicates that both active and new VC-PE firms will be competing to strike deals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/smaller-vc-pes-beat-biggies-on-deal-count/articleshow/84249677.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Mukesh Kumar, the manager of a popular salon chain on Fraser Road, told this newspaper, “A lot of customers visit us on Saturdays and Sundays. The footfalls are quite low on weekdays when we have been told to operate.” Chitra Kumari, who runs a salon and spa centre in Kankarbagh, urged the government to allow beauty parlours to function on all days. She also promised to follow the Covid safety protocols religiously. “All my employees, who have been fully vaccinated, sanitize every equipment after use and give the customers disposable masks. Now, if my salon is not permitted to function on all days, I will be forced to shut it down,” Chitra rued. Another salon owner, Rajesh Kumar, welcomed the decision of the customers to not visit beauty parlours and spas that were flouting the Covid safety measures. He claimed, “Everyone wants to be safe. We, therefore, maintain physical distancing and sanitize the salon regularly.” Meanwhile, customers, who had been waiting for salons to reopen, have heaved a sigh of relief. Ayush Taneja, a teacher and resident of Bakarganj, said, “I am quite excited to revisit my favourite salon after a long time. I will, however, make sure that I take all necessary precautions because health is far more important than looks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/allowed-to-run-on-three-days-salons-witness-poor-footfalls/articleshow/84244180.cms||---

A light/medium truck runs 7,000 km per month and uses up 1,000 litre of diesel now costs between Rs 90,000-Rs 95,000 on fuel bills while a CNG powered truck will need just Rs 50,000. Truckers and fleet operators are pushing for CNG vehicles for shorter hauls. Companies including Tata Motors, VECV, M&M and others are cranking out their CNG strategy while others (Ashok Leyland and DICV) are looking at a larger alternative fuel strategy.“In the 3.5 tonne to 15 tonne segment, CNG is proliferating rapidly because of the rise in diesel prices and we expect the share to hover around 25-30% of this market,” said Vinod Aggarwal, MD & CEO, Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles (VECV). VECV has CNG variants for its entire 4.9-16 tonne range.Truck marketers say the CNG preference has a geographical bias. “CNG share is highest in NCR and regions like west and south have a smaller share which is now rising,” said Rudrarup Maitra, VP at Tata Motors. Tata Motors offers CNG options both in its small commercial vehicle range as well as an intermediate and light CV segment. M&M, which launched the Supro Profit range with a CNG option on Thursday is also looking at CNG with growing interest. “We now have CNG in our small commercial vehicle range of products with both Jeeto and Supro and there will be more CNG variants over a period of time,” said Veejay Nakhra, CEO-automotive division, M&M. Auto analysts say CNG is a viable option for small trucks till electric power becomes cheaper and easier to use. “There is an increasing preference for CNG trucks in light of rising diesel prices and restrictions on polluting vehicles in some cities. This trend will play out in terms of increasing penetration of electric CVs in the medium term,” said Shamsher Diwan, VP, ICRA. “While the current penetration of e-LCVs is negligible, he said, ICRA expects this to hit 4-6% over the medium term,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/truck-cos-look-at-cng-as-diesel-turns-pricey/articleshow/84248442.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

Low-cost carrier SpiceJet announced on Thursday that it will launch three new direct flights from Patna to Surat, Kolkata and Bengaluru. An airline executive said the first direct flight to Surat from Patna will operate thrice a week – Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays – from July 16. The flight (SG-343/ 344) will depart from Patna at 9.25am and land in Surat at 11.40am. It will take off from Surat at 12.40pm and land in Patna at 3.10pm. The airline has also enhanced its operations with additional frequencies on Kolkata and Bengaluru routes. Kolkata-Patna-Kolkata flight will reach here at 8.50am and depart at 3.40pm from July 16. Another flight, SG-947/ 948, will touch down at Patna at 7.25pm and depart for Bengaluru at 8pm, starting from July 17. It will operate on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. The airline will deploy its Boeing 737 and Q400 aircraft on these new routes. SpiceJet is presently operating eight flights on Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Ahmedabad, Guwahati, Chennai and Amritsar routes. An IndiGo executive at Patna said they are operating 19-20 flights on an average against the scheduled 22 flights after the easing od curbs. “We are operating flights depending on footfall of customers. Right now, there is no plan to increase the number of flights as we are already operating 22 flights. The passenger movement started improving from June-end on longer routes like Ahmedabad, Pune and Bengaluru. On shorter routes like Kolkata and Lucknow, the footfall is yet to pick up,” he said. Meanwhile, an Air India official at the airport said they are operating seven flights, including three daily ones on Delhi routes. GoAir is operating six flights and Vistara one. Patna airport presently operates 34-35 flights per day against the scheduled 48 aircraft in its summer schedule.

Thanks to the intervention of health officials and mass awareness created by health experts and voluntary organisations, only two children have died so far due to this disease. Muzaffarpur civil surgeon Dr Vinay Kumar Sharma said that altogether 20 cases of AES were reported from the entire district and only two of them died. Both the deaths were reported from Paru block. As against this, as many as 418 children were found affected with this disease and 104 of them died in Muzaffarpur district alone in 2019. Following this, the government created infrastructure facilities in children wards of various hospitals and health centres and posted a good number of doctors. “Besides medicines, ORS, glucometres etc were made available in sufficient amounts at all the primary health centres,” said Sharma. The civil surgeon also said that efforts were also made to create public awareness in rural areas by hiring auto-rickshaws fitted with audio-systems which moved from village to village educating people about preventions of this disease. Helps of village-level doctors and local social and voluntary organisations were also sought he added. Muzaffarpur-based paediatrician Dr Arun Shah, who has made an extensive study on AES in five blocks of Muzaffarpur district from March 15 to June 30 this year, found that, for the first time in the last 25 years, not a single child died this year. Dr Shah, with the cooperation of the local administration, had launched an aggressive awareness campaign in all these blocks with a population of more than 10 lakh. Dr Shah said people were told to ensure that their children did not go to bed without taking meals at night. Fasting for long hours after consuming litchi has been the root cause of this disease, he said. Substantiating Shah’s version world renowned virologist and professor of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore, Dr Jacob John, said in May and June before the onset of the monsoon every year, this disease is triggered by consumption of raw semi-ripe fruit with high amount of toxin (hypoglycin A and MCPG) by a malnourished child. No well nourished child would be a victim of acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy even if he or she consumes such fruits, including litchi, he said. Dr John said that even though children had been dying from this disease for a long time, its correct diagnosis could be made only recently. He said that malnutrition, going to bed empty stomach and easy access to litchis are the root causes of this disease. Former deputy director of Lucknow-based Indian Institute of Toxicology, Dr Mukul Das, who has done toxicological studies of litchis grown in Muzaffarpur, said toxin called methylene cyclopropyl glycine (MCPG) found in litchi is responsible for causing hypoglycemic encephalopathy. “Litchi does not cause any harm in well-nourished children, but only in undernourished children who had eaten litchi fruit the previous day and gone to bed on an empty stomach,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/just-20-aes-cases-in-muz-so-far-this-yr/articleshow/84245796.cms||B K Mishra
---||Business||LIC cleans books of bad loans as it gets IPO-ready||MUMBAI: The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) is cleaning up its books ahead of its initial public offering (IPO) later this year. The corporation, which brought down its net non-performing assets to 0.05% as of March 2021 from 0.79% as of March 2020, is now selling its fully provided NPAs. As part of its IPO plans, the corporation plans to audit its half-yearly accounts for the period ended September 2021. Traditionally, the corporation has been publishing only full-year accounts. The half-yearly accounts are likely to include the embedded value — a valuation method unique to insurance companies that includes the net present value of future earnings from policies. LIC has appointed Milliman as the actuary for the process and EY as the advisers. The corporation is simultaneously engaged in the recast of its capital base that will enable the distribution of shareholding over a much wider base. The government is determined to complete the public issue during the current fiscal and, with that in mind, is working toward ensuring that the corporation’s books are IPO-ready as of end-September. The ministry is putting the remaining legislative changes in place. LIC, too, is working overtime to put in place policies to comply with Sebi regulations for listed companies. Although LIC has a large corporate debt portfolio, the share of exposure to corporate debt is small considering that it has policyholder funds, which have gone up to Rs 34,87,654 crore. IDBI Capital Markets has put on the block LIC’s exposure to 15 companies, including DHFL, Reliance Communications, Reliance Capital, Jaiprakash Associates, Amtek Auto, IL&FS and Sintex. According to sources, the corporation has fully provided for these loans and the sale would improve the quality of its portfolio. Sources said that it is not selling the entire portfolio of default debt, but is doing so in a phased manner. IDBI Capital Markets is offering LIC’s loans to asset reconstruction companies, banks, NBFCs, and alternate investment funds. The potential buyers must sign a non-disclosure agreement. The investment bank has said that it may resort to the Swiss challenge method of selling where the rivals will be given an option to improve on the best bid. Sources said that some of the loans were being sold because of a regulatory requirement. LIC’s IPO is expected to be the biggest in India with many analysts expecting a share sale in excess of Rs 1 lakh crore. Besides its sheer size, the corporation is seen as valuable given its share of new business and high persistency among its policyholders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lic-cleans-books-of-bad-loans-as-it-gets-ipo-ready/articleshow/84249860.cms||Mayur Shetty

The state government had recently released Rs 36 crore for the installation of state-of-the-art digital 2D/3D RGB (red, green, blue) projection system at the planetarium with chained suspended dome screen and high-capacity optical telescope. Planetarium director Anant Kumar said the upgradation work would begin after signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Bihar Council on Science and Technology (BCST) and National Council of Science Museum (NCSM), Kolkata, on Friday in the presence of minister of science and technology Sumit Kumar Singh. The NCSM is supposed to complete the project in two years. The telescope and the screen will, however, be installed at the planetarium within six months. The modernisation is expected to enable the technological switch from celluloid films to digital 3D stereo projection. The new system will be fully digitised with 3D as well as 2D shows. It would be equipped with optical hybrid system and surround sound among other latest technologies. Anant said the RGB laser projector would allow exceptional brightness and image intensity and make the viewing experience more vibrant for the people. “The latest projection system will be suitable for the dome-shaped planetarium, which has the base diameter of 16m. The specifications of the projection system have been determined by the technical advisory committee comprising national-level experts. Besides, the aluminium screen will also be changed with suspended dome-shaped screen and changes have to be made in the seating arrangement,” the director said. He added, “After the renovation of dome-shaped gallery, the seating arrangements will be changed accordingly. The seating capacity will be reduced to 225 from the existing capacity of 261 as more comfortable chairs will be placed.” Anant said high-capacity optical telescope would enable students, researchers and civilians to see astronomical events, including eclipses (lunar and solar), planetary movement and meteor showers. “A separate screen will also be set up for sky gazers to see astronomical events,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mou-set-to-be-inked-today-for-modernisation-of-planetarium/articleshow/84245784.cms||Faryal Rumi

Acting on a complaint lodged with the Bhakti Nagar police station in Siliguri on June 28 this year, a West Bengal police team headed by a special branch officer, Vishwajeet Ghosh, reached Kishanganj and sought the cooperation of the local police in arresting Dubey. Kishanganj SP Kumar Ashish constituted a special team led by SDPO (sadar) Anwar Javed Ansari. Subsequently, a joint team of the Bengal and Kishanganj police took Dubey into custody from outside the court premises. Ansari said the lawyer was charged with extorting money from Mukesh Singhal, Bimal Singhal and Uttam Agarwal on the pretext of helping them in the auction of luxury vehicles seized earlier by the police and officials of prohibition and excise department. Dubey, according to the police complaint, had introduced himself as a judicial officer-cum-auction officer posted in Kishanganj. “He was handed over to the visiting police team after completion of legal formalities in Kishanganj,” Ansari told this newspaper. Dubey, however, feigned ignorance about any complaint lodged against him in West Bengal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lawyer-held-for-duping-three-wb-traders-of-rs-91l/articleshow/84244488.cms||Ramashankar

After conducting a survey of the area, we have come to the conclusion that we will not be able to ply buses to the railway station. Encroachments are also a major problem along the road. We had hoped that the rail administration would take steps in this regard, but they have not,” Dattatray Zende, traffic manager, PMPML, told TOI. The special tri-weekly train from Hyderabad will reach Hadapsar Railway station at 10.50am on Friday. A railway official admitted that train bookings were increasing, but the development of the road was still a long-term priority. “We have not said that the development of the road is not our priority. We want to ensure that the basic infrastructure is in place first. As and when the number of trains increases, we will develop the road. There are 10% bookings from Hyderabad and 9% from Hadapsar. Though bookings have slightly increased, they are still low,” a railway official said. On Tuesday, the Pune rail officials had claimed that commencement of the train was a surprise. However, senior officials of the South Central Railway disagreed. “Whenever the railway board decides to start a train, the divisions concerned are taken into confidence. They are asked about the infrastructure at the stations and based on the green signal by them, the train is announced. It is never done suddenly,” the official said. A Pune rail division official said, “The chief operating officer of the division decides the same.” Ch Rakesh, chief public relation officer, South Central Railway, said that the Central Railway officials would be in a better position to comment on the same. Asked why the train has been allowed at the Hadapsar station despite inadequate infrastructure, Shivaji Sutar, chief public relation officer, Central Railway, said, “We are on the job.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/narrow-approach-road-to-hadapsar-station-hurdle-for-pmpml/articleshow/84250723.cms||Joy Sengupta

The state government had recently sent a letter to all the vice-chancellors to start choice based credit system in their campus. In this process, students will get 80% marks on his/her academics and 20% on any other courses he had studied. Those courses can be related to studies or any skill development that will enhance their skill for the job market. Sandesh Nayak, college education commissioner, said, “We want the current system to have some change so that it will be beneficial for students in future. The pandemic is a wake up call for us and we need to change the system now.” He further said that recently college education department started skill development courses under massive open online Courses (MOOCs) under which various online courses were given to students. If further choice-based credit system is introduced in the universities, then points of joining these courses can also be made part of their evaluation. Commenting on the choice based credit system, vice-chancellor of Dr B R Ambedkar Law University, Jaipur, Dev Swarup said that in the current scenario it is difficult to have this system in universities and colleges. “In the higher education committee, we recently submitted a few recommendations to bring change in the system. First, was to introduce semester system in colleges and to remove the private student concept from the system. Semester system will organise the education with multiple examination without depending on just one examination.” He further said that private students who just have to give examination without coming to college are also been negatively impacted with the promotion in pandemic. “We can have choice-based credit system if we will have good faculty and infrastructure in the government colleges as most of the higher education institutes are lacking that. Once we are able to implement these changes and build our infrastructure on it, we can think about choice based credit system,” said Swaroop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-wants-choice-based-credit-system-in-varsities/articleshow/84248423.cms||---

The sudden spurt in dengue cases after a couple of years has baffled doctors who said they are unable to assess the sudden resurgence of the vector-borne disease. The confirmed as well as some suspected cases have turned critical with a drastic fall in the platelet count to below 10,000 and required hospitalization in the last one week. These cases are yet to be put on record by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s malaria and filarial department which verifies serum samples through its Mahal Diagnostics Centre before adding them. As per the protocol, patients with high fever are first tested for Covid but hardly any of them is found positive. “Any patient with fever or sore throat had 30 to 40% chances of testing Covid positive during the peak of the second wave. Now, positivity had dropped to less than 0.5%,” said Dr Prashant P Joshi, professor and head, department of general medicine at AIIMS, Nagpur. “Among the admitted patients one has all the symptoms of dengue but NS I antibodies are negative. At the same time, all the other samples tested positive for dengue. We didn’t have so many patients of dengue in the last few years. Some are being reported from one specific area,” he said. These patients come with high grade fever, headache, dehyradation or bodyache, he said. Dr Joshi added that these patients need five to seven days of proper care and monitoring to recover well from dengue. None of the patients became bad at AIIMS Nagpur, he said. Dr Joshi also warned about different strains of dengue commonly known as I, II, III and IV. “Once infected with ‘I’, you may develop immunity from that particular strain. But there are chances of contracting a more severe infection,’ he said. Dr Mohan Nerker, internal medicine expert and director of Seven Star, said rush of mild dengue patients has increased but some are also coming with shock. “However, they recover in a day or two with proper and timely treatment. Dengue has classically symptoms so those testing negative too are getting symptomatic treatment. Scrub Typhus too has been seen among some patients,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/all-symptoms-of-dengue-covid-but-patients-test-negative-for-both/articleshow/84246111.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The barefooted boy, who helps his parents sell balloons, lives in a rain shelter with his family and siblings and despite clothes in tatters wears a clean mask proudly. In the video, shared by local travel promoter Abhay Karki on his Instagram and Facebook handles “Dharamshala Local,” the young boy is seen asking irresponsible tourists why they are not wearing their masks. He can be seen holding a stick to warn tourists walking in a busy McLeodganj lane to wear face masks. After the video of the little boy’s policing went viral, McLeodganj police searched for the little ‘corona warrior’ to take his help to sensitise people, especially tourists, to wear masks. “He is just five. But his IQ level is too high for his tender age,” says McLeodganj SHO Vipin Chaudhary, adding that the police want to take his help to sensitise the people in the area. “He has become famous all around. He himself wears a mask all the time and he wants everyone to do the same. We are hesitant about keeping him with us for the drive as experts have advised that the next wave will weigh heavy on children. We shall first seek permission from his parents and then will keep him with us for one or two hours a day to sensitise people,” Chaudhary said. The SHO, who encouraged the boy for his responsible behaviour, clicked photos with him. “He knows the value of masks and social distancing. He belongs to a migrant labourer family that sells balloons here. They do not have a home to live in or good clothes to wear. The boy is living a miserable life with no shoes to wear and clothes in tatters. The thing that will impress the world is that despite all these problems, he always wears a face mask. And he asks people to wear masks. He will definitely help police in spreading awareness among people, especially tourists,” the SHO added. When asked about his plans for the future, Amit says he will become a cop. After the video went viral, many people came to support Amit and his family financially. Some people contacted Abhay Karki, who had uploaded the video and a person sent money to buy Amit shoes. An elderly couple gave Amit new clothes to wear. Amit’s parents had migrated from Gujarat to Himachal for livelihood many years ago. Amit and his three brothers live in a rain shelter at McLeodganj with their parents who sell balloons. “We spotted the boy in McLeodganj. The family has no phone. They are four siblings. They live in a rain shelter. They call it ‘Hawa Ghar’ as it's open from all sides. He used to go to a government school but now schools are closed and he does not have a phone for online classes. I was contacted by a person who wanted to help Amit. He sent me money and I bought shoes for him and his two siblings who were present in McLeodganj. An elderly couple was offering him money. We suggested them not giving money but buy something useful. So they donated new clothes. He is our star and corona warrior,” said Karki. According to McLeodganj SHO Vipin Chaudhary, nobody taught Amit about Covid-19 safety protocols but he picked up details due to natural instincts and his learning power. “The main chowk of McLeodganj remains busy all the time. We challan people not wearing face masks and also give them masks to wear. We were watching boy here for the last two to three weeks. He was watching and observing us scolding, challaning and distributing masks. And then he also started scolding people for not wearing masks,” Chaudhary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/5-yr-old-balloon-seller-to-teach-covid-19-norms-in-mcleodganj/articleshow/84250761.cms||Suresh Sharma

These fire hydrants help the fire officials get water supply on the spot instead of going back to the fire station for a refill. Chief fire officer of JMC-Heritage Devendar Meena said, “This will be a 7km long system in which 30 fire hydrants will be installed at various points including Ghat Gate crossing, Sanjay Market, Indira Market, Badi Chaupar, Choti Chaupar and will finally end at Kishanpole Market. This will be beneficial for fire officials in the city.” The Rs 5-crore project has been taken up by Jaipur Smart City Ltd. The hydrants will be painted red. One water tank with three parts of one lakh capacity each is being constructed at Ghat Gate fire station from which the hydrants will be connected. The biggest challenge fire officials face at present is traffic congestion in Walled City. Once a fire tender arrives, they face problem in getting refill for which going back to the fire station is necessary. A lot of time and energy is wasted in the process, however, it is expected to be solved with the system of fire hydrants. The construction work began around two months ago and will take another six months to complete. Another important issue the fire department is working on is choosing such points in the market that will not hamper traffic on the road. As per traffic rules, vehicles cannot be parked beside fire hydrants. Hence, such places have been identified in crowded market areas of Walled City where these hydrants will not obstruct the traffic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/walled-city-to-have-fire-hydrant-system-soon/articleshow/84248430.cms||---

While joint and body muscle pain is very much associated with the post-Covid recovery period, experiencing same pain for long-term (more than a month) could be arthritis, said rheumatologists in the city who are presently seeing more patients with such problems. “In Covid-19, mostly drugs for treating rheumatoid arthritis were used. So, many people, including clinicians, think that Covid-19 recovered patients are safe from arthritis. But we are seeing many patients who have started suffering from arthritis during their post Covid phase,” said rheumatologist Dr Parikshit Sagdeo. Dr Sagdeo has seen a few cases of Covid-related arthritis which is known as viral arthritis as well as post-Covid arthritis known as inflammatory arthritis. The latter happens when there is no active infection in the body. Covid-induced changes in the immunity are considered as responsible factors for reactive arthritis. “Not Covid medicines, but the changes in our immunity brought by them are responsible for these problems. If you are suffering from knee or joint pain for more than four weeks post recovery, you should see a doctor. A family physician can refer you to the rheumatologist in case needed,” said Dr Sagdeo. Clinicians are still in the process of fully discovering the consequences of Covid-19. Doctors had experienced the similar kind of spike in cases of arthritis post chikungunya. “The virus had induced arthritic disorders in many patients. Thus, a possible increase in post-Covid rheumatoid arthritis should not be overlooked,” said Dr Saurabh Chahande, consultant rheumatologist. “I have seen one case in which a patient started experiencing the symptoms of arthritis after getting vaccinated with Covid-19 vaccine. It was temporary. But those who are already on arthritis medication should consult their doctor, and rearrange their medicines for a week before getting jabbed,” he said. Doctors said that the local studies relating Covid-19 with arthritis are not available but in UK, USA and Korea studies have observed that infections with coronavirus coincided with an interesting rate of development of rheumatoid arthritis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/long-term-post-covid-joint-pain-could-be-arthritis-experts/articleshow/84246127.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Littering of food and other waste is a problem too. The locals claim that the practice has become rampant as people are not conducting puja at their homes and instead finding secluded spaces to conduct rituals. Besides, the place has become dirtier after more tourists have started coming to Maldevta and Sahastradhara. Sumit Singh, who is part of a cycling group, said, “We explore new spots every weekend, but this kind of waste disposal around green spaces fills us with disgust. This is not the place to conduct 'pooja'.” Another local resident, Satnam Singh said, “Once people dump the waste at a spot it becomes permanent. Since the movement of tourists has become regular, food waste is left behind on a daily basis as well. People come to the mountains for its scenic beauty, but go back polluting it.” He added that a large quantity of 'puja samagri' can be seen lying in the area, left behind by families who perform rituals in the Maldevta area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/green-cover-at-maldevta-littered-with-waste/articleshow/84248429.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Man wanted by Jaipur police posed as priest in Haryana for 27 years until cops outwitted him||JAIPUR: Desh Bandhu, 50, was convinced that Jaipur police had finally stopped searching for him after nearly 27 years. He enjoyed his days in hiding as a popular priest of a local ashram in Bapora in Haryana until a police party posing as devotees whispered to him that they had come to take him away. A visibly shaken Desh Bandhu, living comfortably as Riti Maharaj for years, turned pale and quietly submitted himself to the VKI (Vishwakarma Industrial Area) police station on Wednesday. According to SHO, VKI, Mangi Lal Vishnoi, several of the priest’s devotees were in disbelief and police had to convince them that the man in their custody was one Desh Bandhu Jat, a fugitive on the run since 1994 after being booked under Section 325 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt) of the IPC. “We had never stopped looking for him because there were several warrants issued against him. He had changed his permanent address to evade police and became a priest of an ashram in Bapora in Bhiwani district of Haryana. He initially worked under a head priest and replaced him after the head priest died,” Vishnoi told TOI, adding that for over two decades Jaipur police was searching for the fugitive across several cities until they stumbled upon a clue a few days ago. Vishnoi said that a police party including head-constable Sahab Singh was sent to Bhiwani. The cops arrived at the ashram posing as devotees. Singh and his team confirmed the fugitive’s identity. As people were milling around the ashram, one of the cops quietly told Desh Bandhu that they knew his real identity. Sources said that the fugitive wore a stony look and agreed to come with city police. “He did not expect that police would still be chasing him after over two decades. We had also sought help from local police because it was a sensitive case,” an official said. SHO Vishnoi said that a special operation was launched to catch old fugitives. Under the same operation, two other fugitives, Subey Singh Jat, 55, and Prateek Singh, 35, were arrested. “Our team at VKI had been continuously following up on leads for all fugitives,” Vishnoi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/man-wanted-by-jaipur-police-posed-as-priest-in-haryana-for-27-years-until-cops-outwitted-him/articleshow/84248437.cms||---
---||Goa||Eli Sabia reunites with Coyle at Jamshedpur FC||Panaji: Jamshedpur FC have completed the signing of Brazilian defender Eli Sabia from Chennaiyin FC. Sabia was an important member of Chennaiyin for the past three seasons but has now opted to reunite with coach Owen Coyle after their terrific run to the final in 2019-20. When Coyle joined Jamshedpur last year, Chennaiyin’s leading goal-scorer Nerijus Valskis and defender Laldinliana Renthlei followed him. Now, Sabia has done the same. “Coyle is a big admirer of Eli Sabia and believes he will add to the team’s strength considerably. It’s no surprise that they will be working again (at Jamshedpur),” said a source who has tracked the transfer. The Brazilian is a left-sided centre-back, same as Peter Hartley, who has renewed his contract at Jamshedpur. Coyle, however, remains confident that Sabia can make the adjustment and fit into the new side perfectly. Coyle had paired Hartley with Nigerian defender Stephen Eze at the back last season. The two were strong, with Eze – who played all matches -- adding to the team’s offensive strength with four goals. Sabia, on the other hand, played 19 of the team’s 20 group-stage matches in the Indian Super League (ISL) last season. In the previous season, the Brazilian started in 19 of the 21 games as they put together a stunning run to the final, which included an eight-game unbeaten streak after Coyle took over from John Gregory. Sabia, who had 67 appearances for the club across four seasons, first joined the club in 2016. He then returned home for a spell at Sertaozinho FC before switching to Al Raed in Saudi Arabia. Jamshedpur finished sixth, four points behind fourth-placed FC Goa last season. They are determined to qualify for the play-offs for the first time and are now on the hunt for two more foreign players to complete the squad. Among Jamshedpur’s foreign contingent, Valskis has an existing contract with the club, Hartley has extended his stay and Jordan Murray joins them from Kerala Blasters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/eli-sabia-reunites-with-coyle-at-jamshedpur-fc/articleshow/84265228.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Mumbai||Don’t debar students, solve fee issue, Bombay HC tells unaided schools||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Thursday asked unaided schools to consider an amicable solution to any issue of students not being allowed to attend virtual classes for non payment or late payment of fees. Counsel J P Sen for the Unaided Schools Forum said he would attempt to find an amicable way to resolve the issue. The HC bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni said it welcomed such attempt given the Covid-19 pandemic situation and adjourned a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by a BJP Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Atul Bhatkhalkar, to July 16, giving time for the schools to study the issues and apply its mind. “We don’t want that parents of students leave aside everything and approach authorities with grievances. This is not a happy situation,” said HC. “ Do not debar students students, find a solution. It is not something that they should be coming to courts for…the approach should be different.’’ The HC allowed the Unaided Schools Forum and the Maharashtra English Schols Trustees Association to intervene in the PIL and directed that they may file their affidavit before the next date. Bhatkhalkar’s counsel Birendra Saraf said while last year the HC had passed protective orders against students being denied permission to attend classes over non-payment it was for that year, and this year again there have been complaints of students being asked not to attend even virtual classes for delay in payment of fees. “How can dispensing or sharing of knowledge be denied to students and how is that a burden?’’ The PIL sought interim orders to enable school fee payment in instalments and not to debar any students from either online or physical classes over fee arrears or non-payment or withhold their progress report. Sen stressed that he has just received the PIL copy on Wednesday and said he needs to study the contentions as it was not all bad as painted by the petitioner. He said in fact, schools have been trying to settle any issues that may arise too due to financial constraints. Geeta Shastri, additional government pleader, submitted the notifications by which a divisional fee regulatory committee had been set up in various districts and it can address disputes and grievances by parents over fees. She also showed some internal communication dated July 8 by the department for its functioning. The HC expressed its satisfaction over such information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/dont-debar-students-solve-fee-issue-bombay-hc-tells-unaided-schools/articleshow/84253034.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan hopeful of more early approvals, more funding for forest, green projects||JAIPUR: With two elected representatives from the state in key central ministries such as forest and environment and jal shakti, the desert state can now look forward to some major projects coming its way in the future. The major rejig of the council of ministers at the Centre saw Rajya Sabha member from the state Bhupendra Yadav take charge of ministry of forests, environment and climate change (MoEFCC) on Thursday. Sources in the forest department are hopeful that proposals of new sanctuaries and tiger reserves will get an extra push. Recently, the MoEF had approved the conversion of Ramgarh Vishdhari Sanctuary in Bundi district as the fourth tiger reserve in the state. Forest department officials are expecting that Yadav will clear the proposal for the fifth tiger reserve in Rajasthan as a priority. A proposal for upgrading the Kumbalgargh wildlife sanctuary into a tiger reserve is pending since 2019. The proposed reserve is spread over 1280.49 sqkm, of which 355.25 sqkm will be the core area and 925 sqkm as buffer area in phase I. This apart, the state is at the fore of facing the impact of climate change on its environment and the state government is keen on Centre's intervention in helping the state combat and fund projects related to desertification and climate change migration. Already a beneficiary of the Union environment ministry’s schemes like the national action plan to combat desertification, the national river conservation programme and the national action plan for climate change, the state is hoping for a stronger push to related projects. “Being a desert state, these factors impact us much more. The state has its own Action Plan on Climate Change on the lines of the National Action Plan on Climate Change. The plan involves 14 departments but more funds will help ensure better implementation,” said a senior official. With Yadav representing the desert state, a better understanding of the issues and thrust on these projects is anticipated. On the other hand, Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat has been incharge of jal shakti since 2019. With the central government expected to focus more on strengthening its flagship and development programmes, a better implementation of the Jal Jeevan mission is expected in the near future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-hopeful-of-more-early-approvals-more-funding-for-forest-green-projects/articleshow/84248496.cms||---

Speaking at an event in Ayodhya recently, Maurya, who also holds the charge of PWD, said his department would name roads after the kar sevaks who gave their ‘balidan’ for the Ram Temple. “This will be done for those kar sevaks who were from UP. Where there are no roads, we will build roads and not just name the roads after the kar sevaks, but also put up their photographs there,” the minister said. The roads leading to the homes of these kar sevaks, he said, would be called Kar Sevak Marg. “The Samajwadi Party government mercilessly shot Ram Bhakts who had collected in Ayodhya for the Ram temple. Our government will commemorate the sacrifice of all those who died in the police action on October 30 and then November 2 of 1990,” Maurya added. As per official records, around 17 persons were killed over the two days though the VHP and the BJP have maintained that many more had actually died. The incident occurred in the light of a Rath Yatra taken out by BJP stalwart LK Advani, which then UP CM Mulayam Singh Yadav vowed to not allow into the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/maurya-roads-to-be-named-after-martyred-kar-sevaks/articleshow/84253026.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Due to this, persons with disabilities are not getting the much-needed employment opportunities under the scheme.”“It is well known that the community is reeling under the problems of unemployment, illiteracy and financial weakness. There are limited opportunities in government jobs and they do not get jobs easily even in the private sector. The bankers, too, don’t issue loans to them for self-employment,” he added. “Therefore, you are requested to direct the department concerned to bring a policy to ensure 4 per cent reservation for specially-abled persons in MGNREGA work.”Earlier, the court of the chief commissioner for persons with disabilities, (Divyangjan), had directed the department of empowerment of persons with disabilities, government of India, to formulate a central policy to nominate them to the urban local and panchayati raj bodies.The state government had amended the Rajasthan Municipal Act, 2009, to introduce this provision in the Act, under which it has been made mandatory to keep a post vacant in an urban local body for a PwD nominee. Rajasthan was the first state in the country to do so.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/frame-policy-to-ensure-5-quota-for-people-with-disbilities/articleshow/84248488.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh govt’s new population policy aims at control & better health||LUCKNOW: On the occasion of World Population Day on July 11, UP government will unveil its new policy on population control for 2021-30. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has called for community centric approach to population control so that better facilities may be made available to people and the state can be developed properly. “Poverty and illiteracy are major factors for population expansion. There is also a lack of awareness about population in certain communities and we therefore need community-centric awareness efforts,” he said. An official said UP’s total fertility rate is 2.7% currently whereas it should ideally be less than 2.1%. Most states have achieved this, with the exception of UP and some states including Bihar. A government spokesperson said the policy will follow a five pronged approach to population control but the policy is also focussed on improving health. During a presentation made before the CM on Thursday, it was stated that the proposed policy will aim at efforts to increase accessibility of contraceptive measures issued under the Family Planning Programme and provide a proper system for safe abortion. “On the other hand, efforts will be made to stabilise population by providing solutions for impotency and infertility, and reducing infant and maternal mortality rate through improved health facilities,” he said. Another segment of the policy will focus on comprehensive arrangements for the care of elderly while another focus will be on improved management of education, health, and nutrition for adolescents between 11 and 19 years. The policy will look at different strategies and work towards a convergence of existing schemes to streamline population control efforts and improvement in health. The CM has said that health clubs should be formed in schools and added that digital tracking should be done for newborns, adolescents and elderly people. “While finalising the new policy, efforts should be made to maintain the demographic balance in all communities, ensure easy availability of advanced health facilities and bring down the maternal and child mortality rates through proper nutrition. The objectives of the new policy should be embedded in the spirit of the Sustainable Development Goals,” the CM said. Additional chief secretary, health, Amit Mohan Prasad said that UP’s population policy is being prepared after studying several reports, including the National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-04. An official said the NFHS-05 is scheduled to be released soon and therefore, targets will be set for two phases, 2026 and 2030. Meanwhile, UP Law Commission chairman Justice AN Mittal is framing a draft law for the government to help check rising population of the state. “The draft law will be prepared in the next two months and the report will be submitted to the state government,” Justice Mittal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ups-new-popn-policy-aims-at-control-better-health/articleshow/84253054.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Lucknow||From Left to Right, Kaushal’s giant leap to the Centre||Lucknow: Among seven BJP MPs who made it to the Union cabinet from Uttar Pradesh, it is Mohanlalganj MP Kaushal Kishore who stands out. He’s perhaps the only leader who began his political career as a communist in the early Nineties to traverse all the way into the right-wing camp during BJP’s electoral juggernaut under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi in 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Communist Party of India (CPI) leaders recall how Kaushal, a Pasi Dalit, during his student days would attend their meetings in Malihabad assembly constituency. And this despite the plummeting political graph of CPI amid a resurgence of regional political players like Samajwadi Party and Mayawati’s BSP. Election Commission data show Kishore joined CPI and contested as its candidate in 1993 and 1996 assembly elections, but lost to SP’s Gauri Shankar by around 6,000 to 7,000 votes. “The margin was slender and this bolstered his political ambitions and he began drifting from his ideological mooring,” recalled CPI national secretary Atul Anjaan, while speaking to TOI. It was Anjaan along with another CPI leader Ashok Mishra, who spotted Kishore and mentored him. Their efforts boomeranged when Kishore quit CPI and contested as an Independent from Malihabad in 2002 to defeat SP’s Gauri Shankar by a margin of over 25,000 votes. Sources close to Kishore said, he had managed to garner support of socialist leader and former PM Chandrashekhar, a move which fetched him a significant number of votes of Thakur community, which has a sizeable population in Malihabad. Kishore supported Samajwadi Party, then led by Mulayam Singh Yadav, in forming the government and managed to earn a cabinet berth as a labour minister. Even as his political stature as a Dalit leader rose in his constituency, Kishore formed his own political outfit, Rashtrawadi Communist Party (RCP). The move didn’t pay off as he not only lost the seat in 2007 assembly elections to SP’s Gauri Shankar, but slipped to the third spot after BSP’s Mewa Lal. He again contested as an RCP candidate in 2012, but again lost, this time to SP’s Indal Kumar. His political fortunes swung when he merged his RCP with BJP and managed to get a ticket from Mohanlalganj parliamentary seat in 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Buoyed by the popularity of PM Modi, Kishore defeated BSP veteran R K Chaudhary, also a Pasi, by a margin of around 1.5 lakh votes. Kishore’s powerful emergence under the BJP banner spurred the party to project him as a Dalit leader. And in 2016, he was appointed as chief of UP BJP’s SC Morcha, the addendum arm of saffron brigade to reach out to Dalits. The move contributed to BJP’s attempts to wean away Dalits from BSP supremo Mayawati in the 2017 assembly elections, which saw saffron party storming to power in UP with an overwhelming majority. In fact, Kishore’s wife, Jai Devi, contested as a BJP candidate from Malihabad seat and defeated SP’s Raj Bala by a margin of over 22,600 votes.  In 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Kishore again won on a BJP ticket, defeating CL Verma of BSP by around 90,000 votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/from-left-to-right-kaushals-giant-leap-to-the-centre/articleshow/84253078.cms||Pankaj Shah

Sawant, an MP and former heavy industries minister at the Centre, derided the micro, small and medium enterprises portfolio given to Rane, a former Sena leader. “For Maharashtra, the portfolio status has gone from ‘heavy’ to ‘micro’, but it is expected that he should be able to work comfortably with it. However, he seems more interested in making political statements… I feel he has been inducted to attack Shiv Sena and not caring after his responsibility,” Sawant told TOI. On the cooperation ministry, he said: “It is just to harass the sector in Maharashtra, as the cooperative sector has a strong network in the state under the leadership of MVA members, especially NCP.” Sawant dismissed the possibility that Rane could hurt Sena, saying Sena has defeated him both in his Konkan stronghold and in Mumbai. Sena MP Sanjay Raut threw a barb over the new ministers from the state, saying BJP has Sena and NCP to thank for the selection. Kapil Patil and Bharti Pawar were in NCP earlier, while Rane started with Sena, went to Congress and is now with BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-takes-dig-at-rane-sniffs-plot-in-new-coop-ministry/articleshow/84253092.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

Speaking at a press conference, Gupta alleged that tanker mafia was “ruling the roost” under the Arvind Kejriwal government.  He alleged that AAP came to power in Delhi promising to eliminate tanker mafia active under the then Congress government, but now the same mafia was ruling the roost under the Kejriwal government.  He added that the Kejriwal government and his ministers would only realise how it feels to be without water when a minister’s water supply was cut off.  Gupta also claimed that DJB, which was running at a profit of Rs 800 crore, was now “in the red, and in fact, on the verge of bankruptcy”.  “Lakhs of people in over 100 localities are not getting water and many of them are forced to buy it. In such a situation BJP cannot remain a silent spectator and its workers will agitate in every nook and corner of the city to protest against the city government,” Gupta said. On Thursday, Delhi BJP members and workers staged protests against the AAP government at different places across the city over the alleged water crisis.

The issue surfaced when a video, shot recently, went viral showing hundreds of people clustered in a limited pool area at the popular tourist spot without social distancing and masks. "What is the administration doing? We are already very worried of a third wave and such actions are bound to make the situation worse?" said a Mussoorie resident, expressing concern at the unchecked turnout which was visible on Thursday as well. Rajat Aggarwal, president of Mussoorie Traders' Association, said that while tourists are welcome, precautions are essential too. “Social distancing should be strictly followed. Some restrictions should be imposed at tourist places, like Kempty Falls, where there is no entry fee. Perhaps a head count of visitors or installing an entry gate can be done,” he said. Tehri Garhwal district magistrate (DM) Iva Srivastava, under whose jurisdiction the area falls, said that the administration has been “strictly enforcing social distancing norms at Kempty Falls.” “At least 50% of the challans in the district have been issued at the waterfall alone," Srivastava said. She added, “After recent reports of pool crowding, more strict action will be taken. Not more than 50 persons would be allowed inside the pool at a time. Police personnel would carefully monitor the entry and exit to the pool.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/viral-videos-show-hundreds-of-people-bathing-in-limited-pool-area-at-mussoories-kempty-falls/articleshow/84246292.cms||Anmol Jain

The meet will witness attendance of senior RSS functionaries, including Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat, sarkaryawah Dattatreya Hosable and all five sah sarkaryawah (joint general secretaries). According to Akhil Bharatiya Prachar Pramukh Sunil Ambedkar, Bhagwat will digitally connect with kshetra and sah-kshetra pracharaks of 11 regions from across the country on Friday and Saturday. The kshetra pracharak is a crucial functionary who oversees Sangh activity in their regions. From UP, the meeting would be attended by Anil Singh (east UP) and Mahendra (west UP). Kshetra pracharaks’ inputs from UP gain political significance in the wake of assembly polls next year. As a matter of fact, UP has been the focus for Hosable, who has been keeping a vigil on political churning in the state. In wake of the pandemic, number of participants has been restricted, RSS said. On July 12, the ‘prant’ and ‘sah prant pracharak’ of all 45 prants would connect online to participate in the meeting.

Instead it was time for A to Z (all castes and communities) factors to unite in order to defeat the ruling BJP. He said the newly constituted Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha (BSM) led by former BJP ally Om Prakash Rajbhar will not only thrive on the A to Z formula but will soon fill up the space vacated by the Congress which is shrinking in UP more rapidly. “The politics of Uttar Pradesh will no longer revolve only Muslim-Yadav factor. Everyone’s participation will be necessary,” he said adding: “Apart from Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party, the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha will emerge as a strong alternative to the Congress party in the state.” He evaded queries on Morcha’s chief ministerial candidate, saying that they will cross the bridge when they come to it. Owaisi was in Lucknow on Thursday morning where he met Morcha convenor Om Prakash Rajbhar while on his way to Bahraich where he inaugurated AIMIM’s first election office in UP. In Bahraich, he also visited the dargah of Sayed Ghazi Salaar who was murdered by the King of Shravasti Suheldev. Interestingly, Owaisi’s new found political friend and BSM chief OP Rajbhar also heads a party named Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP). Responding to a media query over the government announcement to rename roads after Kar Sevaks who died during firing in Ayodhya, Owaisi said it would have been better if the BJP would have done something to ensure that bodies were not found floating in the Ganga instead. SBSP chief OP Rajbhar, who was also present at the media interaction, said Morcha currently comprises 10 smaller parties and the new front will work on the principle of ensuring that everyone get its due share.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/m-y-factor-wont-work-its-time-for-a-to-z-in-up-owaisi/articleshow/84253164.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Chennai||Reserved govt posts for SCs lie vacant for over a decade in Tamil Nadu||Tamil Nadu may have 69% reservation, but it doesn’t necessarily reflect in representation on the ground. For nearly a decade at least 30,000 posts reserved for Scheduled Castes (SC) are lying vacant in various government departments in Tamil Nadu, multiple sources confirmed to TOI. This, according to employees’ associations and activists, indicated the lack of will to implement the reservation policy in employment in the government sector. Repeated demands and protests to draw attention of the higher authorities have yielded no results. "The vacancies in our department remain unfilled for several years now," said an officer in the Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare department. Admitting to the anomaly, a senior officer in Adi Dravidar Welfare department said they have issued a circular asking the district collectors and heads of each government department to furnish the details of the vacant posts. "We have started the exercise. We will soon start the process of compiling the data," said the officer on condition of anonymity. "The government is committed to filling the vacancies through a special drive," he said, recalling such an assurance in the governor’s address in the state assembly recently. Tamil Nadu’s reservation policy specifies that 18% of the 69% quota should be reserved for SCs in the recruitment process. The recruitment agencies like the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission and the Teachers Recruitment Board have, however, failed miserably to maintain the quota, sources said. VCK general secretary and MP D Ravikumar said 14,317 teaching and 4,643 non-teaching posts for SCs in the higher education institutions remained unfilled. "The backlog of vacancies are growing every year. The situation is no better in other departments," said the MP. He said he had petitioned higher education minister K Ponmudi to look into the huge backlog. Citing a RTI reply to a query, S Karuppaiah of Tamil Nadu Dalit Liberation Movement said 27,264 vacancies of posts meant for SCs were lying vacant in 2019. "Now the number would have surpassed 30,000. It is nothing but denying equal opportunity to the oppressed sections in the land of Periyar (E V Ramasamy) and Anna (C N Annadurai)," he said. A plethora of petitions to the chief minister’s special cell, minister for SC/ST and official departments concerned under the previous regime had no effect. In March this year, the Centre had disclosed that at least 42,000 posts reserved for the SC and Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Castes had been lying vacant in various Union ministries. Members of Joint Action Council of Tamil Nadu Teachers Organisations and Government Employees Organisations said the government’s disinterest in filling vacancies derailed the reservation policy meant to ensure social justice. They noted the reservation policy was not followed in promotions too. "Police, education and two other departments followed reservation policies for promotions, while the rest of the government departments followed service rules. This should be taken up too," said another official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/reserved-govt-posts-for-scs-lie-vacant-for-over-a-decade/articleshow/84248526.cms||Shanmughasundaram J
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: We function to our oath, courts must pass order on facts and law, CJ||Mumbai: In his first physical address, Bombay high court Chief Justice Dipankar Datta on Thursday said, “We all function to our oath. Government is only a client to a lawyer and a litigant before us…and courts must pass order based on facts and law.” He agreed with former HC judge, Justice S C Dharmadhikari, who said that only passing judgments against the government cannot be seen as an indication of how independent the court is. Justice Dharmadhikari said, “Impression is that the more you decide against the government, the more independent you are, but judges must decide every case on its merits.” CJ Datta and Justice Dharmadhikari were speaking at the 30th anniversary of the Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal (MAT) in an event at its south Mumbai premises. Former Bombay HC judge, Justice Mridula Bhatkar, who is the present chairperson of MAT explained its growth and its effectiveness as a tribunal. Justice Dharmadhikari said that “when tribunalisation of justice is done, an impression is that you are dispensing with justice and not dispensing justice,” but that is not so, adding that a journey that began in 1991 in a “ramshackle premises” with barely any infrastructure where his father was the first head has grown to be a tribunal where lawyers help address the issues faced by government employees in accordance with law. Quoting a Madhya Pradesh HC judge, Datta said that a case is a file before the courts, but is the litigant’s life and “it is our duty [as courts] to protect life”. The chief justice, disarmed everyone when he smilingly said, “I am proud to be associated with the MAT’s 30th birthday’’. He said he would like to “appreciate the efforts of the member of the bar (lawyers) who assist us in delivering judgments." He said many a times Judges are given credit for laying down a law as a precedent, via judgments but it is lawyers who assist with the material, their analysis of the issue and interpretation of law and submissions. “The credit comes to us, but the credit should go to you all too,’’ he said addressing, as the chief guest, a small gathering of lawyers practicing at MAT and senior counsel too, including Ram Apte, Prasad Dhakephalkar, Anil Sakhare, Atul Rajadhyaksh, Mihir Desai, as well as the advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni who were present. Five lawyers including Apte, the only lady lawyer, Poonam Mahajan, who was the first lawyer to have appeared for a litigant before MAT when it started, on July 9, 1991. She has been practicing regularly since, always commuting from Pune to Mumbai. Justice S C Dharmadhikari, in his usual humility said, “I am a poor substitute of my father’’ the late eminent Judge and jurist Chandrashekhar S Dharmadhikar. But the CJ praised Justice Dharmadhikari who retired in .. He said, “I have read your Judgments and though lengthy sometimes, one doesn’t lose track." He added, “people should desire to emulate him. The industry behind the judgements (authored by Justice Dharmadhikari) is commendable," he added. In an observation that those fighting for rights of employees could take heart from, he said, “Public service law is uncodified law. I used to feel lost in the jungle of such law, when I used to practice." He said, “It is a very difficult task. Those who appear for employees often do not get departmental instructions readily." Rules must be published, he said as action cannot be taken based on unpublished instructions. Justice (retired) Dharmadhikar exhorted younger members of the bar to come forward and accept positions at the bench. It will be difficult to find retired Judges as members, he said. The MAT chairperson Justice Bhatkar meanwhile pointed out that as work at the tribunal grew two more circuits were needed, and opened up in March 1992 at Nagpur and Aurangabad. The idea was also to ensure people did not all have to travel only to Mumbai from afar. She also said the tribunal recognizing the importance of alternate means had introduced mediation where possible as a means to redress grievances and at times it has worked and at times not. In July 1991, there were 2500 matters transferred to MAT from the HC. In 2000, 6172 matters were filed and disposal was 4621 while a decade later in 2010, 5376 matters were filed and 5979 disposed and in 2019, 5780 filed and 5115 disposed. The Covid-19 pandemic led to a reduced filing of 3735 in 2020, but disposal did not slump much, it was 2491 while in 2021 so far the filing was 1527 and disposal, 822. The total pendency of cases, however, is almost 10,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-we-function-to-our-oath-courts-must-pass-order-on-facts-and-law-cj/articleshow/84253179.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Nagpur||Man-animal conflict greatest threat to wildlife: Report||NAGPUR: A global report released on Thursday by World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has said that human-wildlife conflict (HWC) is one of the greatest threats to wildlife species. It called for maintaining connectivity for wildlife through human-dominated spaces as many species have adapted to exploit and utilize these areas, bringing difficult deliberations and delicate negotiations about land-sharing and land-sparing to the forefront. “The future of coexistence, thus, requires enabling wildlife persistence within human-dominated landscapes while substantially and sustainably reducing risks and costs for people and wildlife. Integrating HWC management with land use planning programs and social and environmental safeguard systems, such as social and environmental impact assessments can decrease negative impacts of development activities,” the report said. The report calls for a new linear infrastructure projects to consider connectivity and the requirements of wildlife to decrease negative impacts. The conflict between people and animals raiding farms for food and water to preying on cattle is one of the main threats to the long-term survival of some of the world’s most emblematic species, it warns. When struggles arise from people and animals coming into contact, it often leads to people killing animals in self-defence or as pre-emptive or retaliatory killings, which can drive species to extinction. The report – ‘A future for all-the need for human-wildlife co-existence — featured contributions from 155 experts from 40 organizations based in 27 countries, highlights that globally, conflict-related killing affects more than 75% of the world's wild cat species, besides many other terrestrial and marine carnivore species such as polar bears and the Mediterranean monk seals and large herbivores such as elephants. In India, data from the MoEFCC indicates that over 500 elephants were killed between 2014-2015 and 2018-2019, most related to human-elephant conflict. During the same period, 2,361 people were killed as a result of conflict with elephants. “In Chandrapur district alone 26 people have died in wild animal attacks this year,” said forest officials. “Within a human lifetime, we have already seen extraordinary and unparalleled changes to our planet. Global wildlife populations have fallen an average of 68% since 1970,” says Margaret Kinnaird, Global Wildlife Practice Leader at WWF International. “This report is a clarion call to elevate the problem of human-wildlife conflict and give it the attention it deserves in national and international processes,” says Susan Gardner, director, UNEP’s Ecosystems Division. The report says India faces an increasing challenge of HWC, which is driven by development pressures. With the world's second-largest human population along with the largest wild populations of tigers, Asian elephants, one-horned rhinos, Asiatic lions, and other globally threatened species, India faces urgent problems of HWC that must be addressed to achieve a socially just form of conservation. India’s elephants probably embody the problem the best. Elephants in India are restricted to just 3-4% of their original habitat, with their remaining range plagued by deforestation, invasive species, and climate change. This is pushing elephants to seek resources outside of forests and protected areas. As a result, marginalized people face the brunt of elephants’ increasing reliance on crops. As many as 500 people are killed by elephants and thousands of families facing crop and property loss to elephants annually. The report says that completely eradicating human-wildlife conflict is not possible but that a well-planned, integrated approaches to managing it can reduce conflicts and lead to a form of coexistence between people and animals. Such approaches require work on prevention, mitigation, response, research, and monitoring, all backed by strong policy support and the participation of local communities. The report also highlights how accelerated habitat fragmentation and land-use change shape, where and how much humans and wildlife interact in India's densely populated landscapes – highlighting both possibilities and limits of tolerance and space-sharing. “Despite being so strongly linked to the sustainable development goals (SDGs), human-wildlife conflict continues to be overlooked by policymakers. If HWC is not adequately addressed by the international community, WWF believes it will have a considerable negative impact on countries’ ability to meet the majority of the SDGs,” says Dr Kinnaird. “If the world is to have a chance of meeting the SDGs by the 2030 deadline, human-wildlife conflict must be explicitly included in SDG implementation plans, as well as at the heart of the Convention on Biodiversity’s the new framework,” the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/man-animal-conflict-greatest-threat-to-wildlife-report/articleshow/84250818.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

While the culprit was arrested within 12 hours, the question remains how criminal elements have been accessing railway premises when only essential workers are being allowed to travel on trains. TimesViewThis sad case once again highlights the need to control access to railway stations. Petty criminals manage to have a free run of railway premises. Although the cops need to be commended for catching such culprits in many cases, chain and mobile phone snatching incidents have even led to tragic deaths. Commuters, especially women, need to be alert to their surroundings and take precautions.The incident took place on Wednesday, when Snehal Hulke (30), a junior engineer with WR, was travelling to work in the second-class compartment of a Churchgate-bound train from Virar. Hulke is a trainee and had to report for duty at 5pm. Around 4.40pm, when the train halted at Dadar’s platform no 4, a man boarded the ladies coach. “Hulke had her back to him and was checking her phone. Just as the train started to move, the man snatched her phone and jumped out of the coach,” said senior inspector Mehboob Inamdar. Hulke ran after him, but the train had gathered speed by then. She fell on the platform, landing on her back. Witnesses called the police and Hulke was rushed to Jagjivan Ram Hospital, Mumbai Central. Her brother, a doctor, told TOI. “Snehal is in a lot of pain and is unable to lie down. She has suffered a swelling to the spine and we are waiting for the MRI scan report.” Police went through the CCTV footage of Dadar station and found images of a man that matched the robber’s description provided by Hulke. Rahul Butiya (25) was tracked down to Bhawani Shankar Road in Dad-ar (W), where he lives in a slum. Hulke’s phone worth Rs 17,000 was recovered from him. “This is the first time Butiya has been booked for an offence on the railways,” said an officer. Butiya has been booked under IPC Section 392 (robbery) and faces up to 10 years in jail, if found guilty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-wr-staffer-jumps-off-train-to-chase-thief-injures-spine/articleshow/84251025.cms||Nitasha Natu

MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi on Thursday reaffirmed: “Our embassy in Kabul and Consulates in Kandahar and Mazar-e-Sharif are functional. We are, however, carefully monitoring the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan and its implications on the safety and security of Indian nationals there.” Foreign minister S Jaishankar said in Moscow on Thursday that like 20 years ago when India, Russia and Iran supported the Northern Alliance against the Taliban, all three continue to stand against “fundamentalist thinking, radicalism, extremism and terrorism.” Jaishankar also referred to his meeting with Iranian President-elect Ayatollah Ebrahim Raisi in Tehran on Wednesday. “We discussed Afghanistan in detail. Countries of the region have a strong interest in ensuring an outcome that is both good for Afghanistan and the region,” Bagchi said. Iran invited India to Raisi inauguration next month. Meanwhile, Jaishankar said there is a lot of concern about the India-China relationship. “...For the last 40 years we had a very stable relation. But for the last one year, there has been a lot of concern... because China has not observed agreements that it had signed up to when it came to our border.” On the possibility of nuclear arms race between the two nations, Jaishankar dismissed it saying the evolution of Chinese nuclear programme has a larger dynamic than India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/missions-in-afghanistan-still-working-but-situation-under-watch/articleshow/84254248.cms||---

According to CoWin Portal the total number of doses extended in Uttar Pradesh till 9 pm on Thursday was 3.6 crore while Maharashtra was at 3.57 crore. The state now accounts for about 10 % of the total doses given the country. Data indicate that against its primary target of vaccinating 13.6 crore people, UP has been able to provide at least one dose to 22.4% of its population. On Thursday, UP also became the first state to have given the first dose of the vaccine to over 3 crore people. As per the Cowin portal, 3,04,96,595 persons have taken at least one dose while 55.27 lakh are fully vaccinated in state. The nearest contender is Maharashtra where 2.82 crore have taken at least the first dose. The others to follow are Rajasthan (2.15 crore), Gujarat (2.11 crore) and Karnataka (2.04 crore). Among districts, Lucknow (15.64 lakh), Gautam Budh Nagr (13.04 lakh), Ghaziabad (11.29 lakh), Meerut (10.50 lakh) and Gorakhpur (9.93 lakh) are among the top performers while Kasganj (1.78 lakh), Lalitpur (1.86 lakh), Kaushambi (1.98 lakh) and Auraiya (2 lakh) are among the worst performing. Health officials attributed the improvement in vaccination scenario to the launch of the cluster model which has addressed the key bottlenecks particularly connectivity and digital divide and created an ease of vaccination. The steps taken, such as micro-planning, have accelerated UP’s vaccination drive. In fact, since the launch of the cluster model, vaccination in the rural areas has picked up very well. On a daily basis, about 40% of the vaccinations are taking place in villages. Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said that there was visible enthusiasm for the vaccine now. He also said that the state had ample stock and all eligible persons must get themselves vaccinated as soon as possible. ACS, information, Navneet Sehgal said that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath expressed happiness over the pace of the vaccination programme and directed district officials to ensure that every eligible person was facilitated for the vaccination. He said that the CM had congratulated the team behind the drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-pips-maharashtra-to-be-state-with-max-jabs/articleshow/84253206.cms||Shailvee Sharda

President of Goa Yachting Association Siddharth Satardekar said that the deputy collector’s move to dismiss the case is yet another instance of “government departments trying to snatch away the legitimate assets” of sporting organisations in Goa. “Despite being directed by the revenue department to re-hear the case and pass an order based on merits, the deputy collector chose to dismiss the application,” Satardekar said.  “It is a known fact that there are plenty of private parties who work in connivance with officers of the government departments so as to favour their interests in these sorts of properties that would render them handsome compensation,” he added The Indian Navy was using the structures at Dona Paula to run a sailing institute after Goa’s liberation and according to Satardekar, it was officially handed over to the Goa Yachting Association on August 30, 1974. “In 1978, on finding fault with the provisional revenue records which showed the premises wrongly listed in the name of the river navigation department, the Goa Yachting Association made an application to the city survey to make the necessary corrections,” Satardekar said. The application was eventually decided by the deputy collector in 1989 where the river navigation department was judged to be the rightful owner of the plot. After a long delay, the matter was re-heard by the deputy collector’s office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/unjust-says-yachting-body-after-rejection-of-dona-paula-plot-ownership-plea/articleshow/84251093.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi: In 2 days, 5 gangsters in police net after shootout||NEW DELHI: In the last two days, five hardened criminals have been arrested after exchanging fire with police as part of a fresh crackdown on street criminals. The injured criminals are currently undergoing treatment. On Thursday evening, a shootout ensued between cops from Delhi Police’s Special Cell northern range and a notorious criminal, Satish. Wanted in over 20 cases of snatching and robbery, he was cornered in Rohini around 6pm during which he started to fire at the policemen. In retaliatory firing, he sustained a bullet injury in his leg. He was shifted to a hospital and would be arrested upon discharge, said DCP Sanjeev Yadav. In another operation late on Tuesday, two notorious criminals, Sazee and Tajim Saifi, were arrested after a shootout near Karni Singh shooting range in Prahladpur. “Two pistols and five live cartridges were seized from them, apart from four shells from the spot. The accused were involved in cases of snatching, robbery, theft, attempt to murder and under Arms Act in Delhi-NCR,” said Yadav. The third operation took place near Sector 36 in Rohini in which a criminal named Deepak and his associate, who were riding a bike, were stopped by police. They tried to fire and flee, but Deepak was shot in his left leg in retaliatory firing by police and overpowered. His associate, however, managed to escape. In the fourth encounter, a notorious snatcher, Pradeep Gurri, was arrested by cops from Special Cell southern range. Involved in over 25 cases of robbery, burglary and snatching, Gurri was recently booked under MCOCA. Police got a tip-off that he would come near Crowne Plaza Hotel in Rohini around 11pm on his white Apache bike. After he was spotted by the informer and intercepted by the cops, he tried to fire and escape. In the exchange of fire, he sustained a gunshot injury in his leg and was taken to a hospital. The crackdown was conducted by teams led by DCP Yadav and formed under ACPs Sanjay Dutt and Jasbir Singh to apprehend street criminals. “To curb street crime, Delhi Police is on its toes to check bikers at key points, including crime hotspots. Special Cell has specifically been tasked to tackle gun-wielding criminals committing street crimes,” Yadav said. Bike-borne armed snatcher gangs have unleashed terror in parts of Delhi by targeting women and pedestrians. In many recent cases, the criminals had opened fire on the victims on the slightest resistance. After this, Special Cell was tasked to retaliate proportionately, said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-2-days-5-gangsters-in-net-after-shootout/articleshow/84251014.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Crushing debt and dreams of easy money led to murder of SC lawyer Kitty Kumaramangalam||NEW DELHI: Deep financial crisis triggered by Covid-19 led the three accused men to plot and execute the murder of 70-year-old Kitty Kumaramangalam during a robbery bid at her Vasant Vihar home on Tuesday night, police’s probe into the crime suggests. The prime suspect, Raju, who was a washerman in the locality, had contracted the viral infection last year. Ironically, it was Kumaramangalam and a few others who had offered him financial and medical aid. However, his debts kept mounting in the following months and quick and big money through crime seemed the only way out. The trio, who were alcoholics, desperately needed money to sustain their vices and clear debts. At times, they fell short of money to buy even a pint of liquor. Last month, Raju thought about robbing the septuagenarian as she came across as an easy target. He had free access to her house for the past five years as he regularly cleaned her clothes every two-three days. For the last two months, Kumaramangalam often allowed him to keep the clothes in the cupboard as she was not keeping well. The washerman discussed the plan with his friend, Suraj, whom he knew since the past eight years. Eventually, Rakesh was roped into the plan. Rakesh and Suraj are drivers. Raju had met Rakesh during the lockdown through Suraj. Murdering Kumaramangalam during the heist was always their plan as Raju was a known face, police said. Though he came to her house around 6pm-7pm every day, he delayed his visit on Tuesday to rule out any possible visitors. The trio parked their scooter a little away from her house and Raju first went in to get the door opened. After committing the crime, they went to their respective accommodations, while Suraj was tasked to sell the stolen jewellery. Raju didn’t get anything as the briefcase of his share had only documents. He had asked for a bigger share from the sale of gold. Police are still conducting raids to arrest Suraj, who is supposedly hiding in Rajasthan with the gold. His last location was near Jaipur. During interrogation on Thursday, Raju and Rakesh kept blaming each other by claiming to be accomplices. Their statements have been recorded separately and they would be confronted with Suraj’s version. Kitty was a Supreme Court lawyer and wife of late Union minister P Rangarajan Kumaramangalam. The robbers first tied her up and throttled the maid when she opened the door. They then smothered the elderly woman with a pillow. They left with ease after ransacking the house. However, the household helper, Mithila, survived and spilled the beans to police later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/crushing-debt-and-dreams-of-easy-money-led-to-murder-of-sc-lawyer/articleshow/84251059.cms||---

Two people were arrested for smuggling the rice. Acting on a tip-off, the airport police led by inspector Malaisamy conducted a vehicle check at checkpost number 3 on the Trichy – Pudukottai road. The team intercepted a truck proceeding from Trichy to Pudukottai. As the truck was loaded with the sacks, police grew suspicious and searched the vehicle. They found that the vehicle was loaded with 50 sacks of PDS rice weighing each 50kg worth Rs 14,125.

Since Covid protocols prevent them to meet physically, community members in Mumbai will hold an online prayer meeting on Friday. A community member said the prayers will be for Báb and peace on earth. According to the Bahai faith, the Bab faced persecution and endured self-sacrifice in order to restore spiritual life to the decaying soul of mankind. On May 23, 1844, the Báb declared his mission which quickly drew the attention of thousands of seekers who were attracted to his message. He said his purpose was to prepare the way for the coming of the ‘Promised One of all Ages’, a divine teacher who would fulfill religious prophecies of the past and proclaim a message that would ultimately unite mankind. Baha’is believe this teacher was Baha’u’llah. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bahais-to-hold-online-prayer-meet-today/articleshow/84253209.cms||---

The commercial complex was opened in February 2021. An auction was held soon after the inauguration but the space to accommodate 43 shops could find only one taker. Two others had backed out in the last stage. Trida is now going for another round of auction hoping for a turn around. It has pitched an aggressive business model in tune with the investment in terms of land value, project cost and amenities available. Trida has fixed the deposit amount at 60 times the base price and auction is held for the deposit amount and not for the rent. “We have gone for this model to make up for the investment we have made in this land and the prospects this area holds for business. Even this rate is slightly lower than the market rate. We have had instances where even if auction is done based on rent, we would end up fetching deposit amount even 100 times the base price. At Chalai, we are doing auction not on rent but on deposit sum,” said a Trida official. Trida’s commercial complex at Chalai is its fourth biggest complex after those at Kesavadasapuram, Palayam and Medical College. Spread over three floors, it has 9,000 sq ft office space and 43 shop spaces. The administrative sanction of Rs 15 crore was given for the project in 2014. The officials said that while there have been enquiries from various corners people are reluctant owing to the Covid situation. “The model is such that you have to invest a huge sum initially and then make the most of the land and location to do good business. But given our present situation, nobody wants to take that risk. In case of another lockdown or further rise in cases, they would lose heavily and we can’t assure anything from our end as well,” the official said. In 2020, Trida had waived off shop rents in various other commercial complexes. “The revenue from commercial complexes, including the one at Chalai, is crucial for Trida. We have no other sources of revenue, but when the merchants are unable to open shops and function, we have to waive the rent and bear the loss. We haven’t been able to find takers for our new complex so far, but we are hopeful that this situation will change,” said Trida chairman C Jayan Babu. The local self-government department had earlier salvaged Trida from revenue recovery proceedings by diverting fund from the cash-strapped LIFE housing mission to pay loan liabilities to the tune of Rs 8.97 crore. Trida had taken nearly 30 loans during the past two decades for various reasons like creation of urban infrastructure, housing and land acquisition and owing to non-payment, HUDCO had agreed for a one time settlement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cash-strapped-trida-bets-big-on-chalai-commercial-complex/articleshow/84246360.cms||Aswin J Kumar

With an aim to encourage and inculcate the value of reading among students, Attingal Government Girls Higher Secondary School has started an initiative, ‘Pusthakakoodu’, in connection with the activities of the Malayalam Club. The initiative, which kickstarted on Monday, aims at distributing books from the school library to students during the pandemic time. “Our students have shown great interest in reading. Even when the schools remained shut owing to the pandemic, they have asked us whether they can get the books from the school library. Considering their interest and with an intention to bring back the reading culture, the Malayalam Club of the school put forth the idea of Pusthakakoodu,” said staff secretary of the school Safeena Beevi. Vehicles of teachers have been set for the purpose. After prior booking, either students or their parents can collect their favourite books from the vehicle parked in a public place nearby their residence. ‘Pusthakakoodu’, planned and executed in two weeks, had so far received requests from nearly 400 students seeking different books, including short stories and novels. “The initiative, which includes students from Class VI to X, has received support from both parents and students. In a way they are happy as it brings solace to students stuck up in their homes. And instead of students, parents can come and collect the books,” Beevi added. Through the WhatsApp group, students would be provided with the list of available books. From the list, they can choose any book of their interest, but they have to inform the teachers in advance the books they wish to borrow. Following that, the details of the book and borrower will be recorded in a register. A student can borrow a maximum of five books which they have to return in two weeks. When they return, they have to submit a review of the books that they have read. Attractive prizes await the best review. According to teachers, lower-class students mostly prefer short stories, whereas, high school students often like to read novels. And mostly, students from Class VII and VIII are showing interest in reading. In the initial phase, books will be distributed to students staying in different areas of Attingal municipality. Students of nearby panchayats can avail the benefits of the programme during the second phase. The school has a big library with more than 25,000 books of different genres and topics. Apart from a common library, the school also has class libraries with 50 books each.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/teachers-deliver-books-to-students/articleshow/84246384.cms||---

CPM staged a demonstration near the central bus stand in the city as part of the state-wide protest called by its state president K Balakrishnan condemning the role of the BJP-led Union government in handling the case of Fr Stan, who died at Holy Family Hospital in Mumbai on July 5. The 84-year-old activist was arrested for his alleged role in Bhima Koregaon violence on October 8, 2020 by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The CPM recorded its opposition against the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and termed the death of Swamy a ‘murder’. Trichy urban district secretary of CPM R Raja spearheaded the demonstration. The act of keeping an octogenarian in prison for more than eight months without giving him bail is barbaric, Raja said. “The central government did not allow him to get bail even though he was down with Parkinson’s disease. The human rights activists across the world, including those from the United Nations Organisation (UNO) raised voice in support of bail for Swamy, but none of their cries fell on the ears of the Union government,” he said. Besides taking action against those responsible for the death, Raja demanded that the central government should release all other rights activists arrested in the Bhima Koregaon case. UAPA imposed on students, rights activists and journalists by the central government should be revoked, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/cpm-protests-against-centre-over-fr-stans-death/articleshow/84251040.cms||---

Coinciding with the birth anniversary of former chief minister K Kamaraj on July 15, the Tamizhaga Cauvery Vivasayigam Sangam will organise a massive hunger strike in protest against the Karnataka government and the central government over the Mekedatu row, said its general secretary P R Pandian in Thanjavur on Thursday. Pandian announced the protest after convening a meeting of the functionaries of the association’s south and north district. He said the hunger strike will highlight construction of a dam at Rasimanal, and getting the due share of water to save the crops. He accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of instigating Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa to construct a dam at Mekedatu across the Cauvery. “Hence, there is no hope that the central government will stop Karnataka from going ahead with the dam project. Tamil Nadu government should insist on the Cauvery Water Management Board (CWMB) to intervene and solve the issue,” Pandian said. The farmers’ association leader also expressed his displeasure over the state government for neither pressurizing the CWMB nor taking up the issue with the Supreme Court. He said that the adamant behaviour of Yediyurappa to construct the dam against the sovereignty of the country will affect the relationship of the neighboring states. Pandian said that state water resource minister S Duraimurugan should have demanded the CWMB to release 40 tmc water to save the Kuruvai crop in the current season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmers-plan-massive-hunger-strike-in-thanjavur-on-july-15/articleshow/84251055.cms||---

The health department’s efforts by way of surveying the PwD population jointly with differently-abled welfare and revenue departments have shown the way for other districts to increase vaccination coverage for the immunocompromised section. Of the total 11,155 PwD population in Pudukottai, 7,182 have been vaccinated. In the past 20 days, the health department has been busy identifying PwDs in every village and scheduling to vaccinate them by ensuring zero wastage. They obtained the list of PwD voters from the revenue department and registered PwD beneficiaries from the district differently-abled department. Thereafter, block medical officers and health staff chalked out a routine plan to vaccinate PwDs at the doorstep. “We prepared route map covering PwDs in many villages nearby on a single day to avoid wasting vials. District administration allotted a portion of doses to vaccinate PwDs almost every day,” Dr B Kalaivani, deputy director, health services, said. When the vaccines were minimal, the district administration utilised the available doses for PwD though it suspended the drive for the general public. “Prior information was given to the families of PwDs about doorstep vaccination. Special camps were promoted in advance and the patronage was desirable too,” Dr D Kathirvelu, differently-abled welfare department officer said. Around 2,000 PwDs who were hesitant to take the jab are being given counselling through medical teams. Some of the districts that have not taken up doorstep vaccination for PwD seriously were seen having poor vaccination coverage. Salem and Chennai came in second and third covering 38.1% and 33.2% of the eligible PwD population. Thiruvannamalai and Madurai were the bottom-placed districts with 3.8% and 3.6% vaccination coverage respectively. Of the total 5,28,781 eligible PwD population in the state, 62,603 were given at least one dose as of July 7 with a coverage of 12.03%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/pudukottai-tops-in-vaccinating-disabled-people/articleshow/84251105.cms||Deepak Karthik

The incident took place on July 5 (Monday). The deceased was identified as B Sriram, a resident of Viragupettai area in Trichy city. In his complaint, the boy’s father V Balamurugan, 38, a daily-wage labourer, said that his son was playing in front of his house on Monday and decided to cook some jackfruit seeds on the firewood stove outside the house. As it failed to catch fire properly, Sriram brought a bottle of sanitizer and started to pour it, which caused a sudden outburst of fire. Sriram’s hand and other body parts caught fire. Neighbours, who came to his help, rushed him to the MGMGH. The boy was undergoing treatment in the burns ward at the hospital, but died on Wednesday. The body was handed over to the family members on Thursday. The Fort police said mishandling of sanitizer cost the boy’s life. The use of sanitizer has been rampant since the outbreak of Covid-19. However, it has to be carefully used as the alcohol content in the sanitizer is inflammable, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-boy-13-pours-sanitizer-into-fire-dies-of-burn-injuries/articleshow/84251095.cms||---

Revenue minister R Ashoka told reporters here on Thursday that 2-3 lakh houses in Bengaluru are vacant as on date and said the tweaked tenancy law — once brought in — will help owners get tenants and rentals will soften a bit. “This is a proposal. We expect feedback from the public before we officially introduce this in Karnataka.” The state’s move flows from the Model Tenancy Act passed by the Centre in June first week. Owners, tenants must fix rent: MinisterThe Centre sent the law to states either to enact fresh legislation based on the template or suitably amend the existing laws. The minister said, “Earlier, the government had a role in fixing rentals. We now propose that rent should be fixed by owners and tenants. After they reach an agreement, they must finalise it legally and upload it on revenue department website.” Revenue officials will resolve disputes, if any, within 60 days. “Even if anyone plans to postpone hearing in the case, there won’t be more than three chances,” the minister was quoted as saying by his office in a press release. Ashoka said the government plans to abolish the posts of four regional commissioners and instead establish a regional commissionerate at Bengaluru. “I have been thinking on these lines for six months as offices of the regional commissioners have become white elephants. We are spending crores of rupees on these offices and each has more than 125 employees,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/karnataka-to-soon-adopt-new-model-tenancy-act/articleshow/84261476.cms||---

BDA housing project: Activist wanted probe into corruption charges against BSY family TJ Abraham, a Bengalurubased social activist, had filed the complaint seeking probe into alleged payment of bribe of Rs 12 crore in a BDA housing project as revealed in a TV expose and collection of Rs 17.5 crore in cash or through shell companies on behalf of the chief minister allegedly by his close family members. Others mentioned in the complaint included the CM’s grandson Shashidhar Maradi and son-in-law Virupakshappa Yamakanmaradi; Sanjay Sree, son-in-law of Yediyurappa’s daughter Padmavathi; cooperation Minister ST Somashekar and Chandrakanth Ramalingam. On November 20, 2020, the social activist approached the governor seeking sanction for prosecution against the chief minister and Somashekar. “The private complaint filed by the petitioner under Section 200 of CrPC and interim application filed under Section 156(3) of CrPC is not maintainable in the absence of valid sanction and is accordingly dismissed,” special judge B Jayantha Kumar observed in his order, placing reliance on the Supreme Court’s decisions on requirement of valid sanction and pointing out that the allegations centered around the CM. Abraham alleged that Rs 12.5 crore bribe was paid by a representative of Ramalingam Construction Company to the CM’s family members in lieu of permission granted to the company to resume a stalled housing project of the BDA. The complainant claimed he approached the Anti-Corruption Bureau in November 2020 seeking investigation into the case, and the agency closed the case on within three weeks of receiving the complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-guv-nod-city-court-junks-plaint-against-bsy-son/articleshow/84254414.cms||---

The incident took place at Dumrikala village in Parseoni taluka, Nagpur district. Sohan Devdhagle, 26, and his teenaged girlfriend are learnt to have consumed poison to end their lives earlier this week. Their bodies were found inside the bathroom of Devdhagle’s residence. Police said several messages regarding Devdhagle — who belonged to a farmer’s family — were found in the standard IX student’s notebooks. Last week, Devdhagle had gone to meet the girl’s family, which outrightly rejected his proposal, stating that their daughter was still a minor. Police said the couple took the drastic decision when Devdhagle’s parents had gone to the farm. The couple was rushed to sub-district hospital at Ramtek, where the minor was declared dead. Devdhagle was referred to Government Medical College and Hospital in Nagpur, where he too was later declared dead.

---||Madurai||Madras high court can’t be pushed to act like post office, says judge||MADURAI: Calling the bluff of writ petitions that come with seemingly innocuous prayer of a direction to ‘dispose of a representation’, Madras high court has said courts can’t act like post offices or demean their own constitutional status by dealing with such cases which are known for rampant abuse. The modus operandi of ‘consider-the-representation’ type of cases is that the petitioner would submit a representation for a civic complaint with an authority, and then move the high court for a ‘direction’ to the authority concerned to ‘dispose of’ the representation. Even an innocuous order of the court is then misrepresented as a ‘direction’ and authorities are forced to pass orders. Justice N Anand Venkatesh, ticking off this putrid practice of the Bar, said unless advocates did some introspection before filing such writ petitions in future, the court be constrained to impose costs besides dismissing the petitions. Noting that the court also should do some self-introspection and become more stern and strict while dealing with such petitions, Justice Anand Venkatesh said: “This court should not demean its status and act like a middleman between the petitioner and the authority concerned. It is quite unfortunate that a constitutional court is being engaged on a daily basis to dispose of stale representations by mechanically issuing directions to various authorities to consider the representations.” The judge observed that it is really painful to take note of the fact that writ petitions filed 10 years ago are pending before this court without a final disposal and this court is not able to take up those cases because of mandamus cases which consume most of the time. Such writ petitions virtually saps the energy of the registry right from numbering these writ petitions till making the order copies ready. The judge observed that in a majority of the writ petitions that are filed before this court seek for the issue of a writ of mandamus and in most of the cases, this court finds that a representation is given just one week before filing the writ petition and thereafter, a writ petition is moved before this court. Sometimes, these innocuous directions issued by this court are also misused and it is taken by the authorities as if a favourable order has been issued and by virtue of the same, a person, who may not have any right over the property, is issued with patta just by quoting orders passed by this court, said the judge. The judge made these observations while hearing a batch of petitions which sought to issue patta to the petitioners by considering their representations. The judge had dismissed the petitions on the ground that all these writ petitions lack any material and the petitioners have approached this court by just giving a representation and filing an acknowledgement card.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-cant-be-pushed-to-act-like-post-office-says-judge/articleshow/84251143.cms||Kaushik Kannan

---||Trichy||Trichy corporation identifies two roads for ‘Streets for People Challenge’||TRICHY: The Trichy Corporation has identified two roads for the ‘Streets for People Challenge’ organised by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs. Trichy has been selected as one of the 113 cities for the pan-India challenge to create pedestrian-friendly streets. The Lawsons Road in Cantonment and the Karur Bypass have been selected for the purpose. People are encouraged to share their proposals to develop a benchmark model in ensuring equal rights for pedestrians and bicyclists to emulate the same in other streets of the city. The challenge focuses on a fair distribution of space for stakeholders, safety and security of the users, comfort, meeting the demands of locals and liveability, environmental sustainability as key components. Public can submit their ideas incorporating the key components after conducting an inspection in both roads. The designs should be area-specific, offering solutions for existing challenges and should promote equal rights for pedestrians, the corporation said. “We will call for innovative ideas from various experts and stakeholders seeking low-cost and comprehensive solutions to make the city liveable and to increase the public space,” corporation commissioner S Sivasubramanian said. Winning ideas will get three cash prizes for each of the two roads identified. Rs 1 lakh will be offered as the first prize, Rs 75,000 for the second prize and Rs 50,000 for the third prize. Registration for the challenge closes on July 12. On July 15, a street audit involving site inspection will be conducted by the civic body. Based on the study, designs must be submitted in a shared folder comprising a writeup, design concept and budget estimate to trichycitycorporation@gmail.com.

The case of the prosecution was that the eight people, who were the petitioners and other villagers of Manamkathan village, gathered on the Kayathar to Devarkulam road on March 6, 2017 and staged a protest. It was alleged that during the agitation, the petitioners had prevented vehicle movement without heeding to the request made by the officials. The Kayathar police had registered a case against the petitioners under sections 143 (unlawful assembly) and 341 (wrongful restraint) of IPC and a final report was filed before the Kovilpatti judicial magistrate II court. The petitioners filed this present petition before the HC Madurai bench seeking to quash the trial court proceedings. Justice G Ilangovan observed that it is seen that the petitioner and the other villagers staged a protest demanding the renovation or repair of the public road. It cannot be construed or considered to be illegal or unlawful. So, assembly at the place of occurrence cannot be construed as unlawful assembly as there is no materials to attract offences under Section 143 of IPC. The judge observed that the second allegation is that the petitioners committed an offence under Section 341 of IPC. Facts and circumstances of the case shows that they were not intended to assemble in the place of occurrence, for the purpose of obstructing the public transport or movement of the public. The demand made by the petitioners is repairing the village road and it may not be construed as illegal demand. Hence, the judge quashed the proceedings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/people-have-right-to-protest-for-public-grievances-hc/articleshow/84251147.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Trichy||People’s run for vaccine continues in Trichy||TRICHY: The vaccination camps, especially those exclusively administering the second dose of Covaxin in the urban and rural localities of Trichy district witnessed heavy crowds on Thursday. As there was a shortage of Covaxin in the district for the past two weeks, people rushed to the venues as they got the information that Covaxin will be administered at three locations in the rural areas and one location in the urban area. Several people who were desperately waiting for the second dose had to return without getting the jabs since the centres received only a minimal number of vaccines. In the rural area, three centres at Navalpattu, Inamkulathur and Puthanatham received 300 doses of Covaxin each. Although the venues were in rural areas, a few people from Trichy city were seen rushing to the centres since they have crossed their due date to take the second dose of the vaccine. In the urban area, Trichy Corporation called the beneficiaries and asked them to visit the main office to take the shots. While it was mentioned that only the second dose will be administered, desperate people were also spotted standing in the queue to take the first dose. As the vaccination camps are functioning in Trichy after a gap of five days, heavy crowds were reported even in the centres that are administering Covishield. Four centres administered Covishield vaccines to people in the city, and all of them saw people standing in queues from 6 am. Corporation sources said that a total of 3,615 people were vaccinated on Thursday, which include 1,001 people who took the second dose. “Since there were complaints of overcrowding at the Covaxin vaccination camp organised at the main office of Trichy Corporation, we will plan to decentralise the venue,” Corporation Commissioner S Sivasubramanian said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/peoples-run-for-vaccine-continues/articleshow/84251136.cms||---
---||Surat||Gujarat: Software nets copycats taking exams online||SURAT/ VADODARA: Mehul Kumar, a BCom student, had convinced his topper friend to appear in online exams on his behalf. But minutes after his friend started answering questions, he was immediately identified. Another student who thought a prompter sitting beside him will help in crack the online exams too failed miserably. Nearly 500 such copycats have been caught adopting unfair means while appearing in online exams of various undergraduate and postgraduate courses of Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) that began on June 26. These students were simply not aware that their images are being clicked, videos being recorded by the devices which they thought would give them a lot of leeway to cheat. Based on this suspicious conduct, VNSGU has registered cases against these students which are being reviewed by a fact-finding panel. “Students tried using bluetooth earphones, talk over the phone or refer to books to find answers. All such misconducts were caught,” said IB Patel, VNSGU’s officer on special duty (exam section). Interestingly, during offline exams of over 1.50 lakh students, around 600 are caught adopting unfair means at VNSGU. But in online format, over 500 out of just 33,000 were caught. “Students are happy with this online exam format and those appearing with preparation do not have to fear about anything,” said VNSGU’s vice-chancellor (VC) K N Chavda.  VNSGU started using software to guard the sanctity of online exams from this year. But other universities in Gujarat are beating the cheaters in their own game since last year. M S University in Vadodara and Sardar Patel University in Vallabh Vidyanagar adopted proctored online exams last year. Initially, over 20 % of 9,000 students who were appearing for online exams had tried some or other means to cheat at MSU. “But as the message was loud and clear that there is an eye constantly watching them, number of students adopting such unfair means have also reduced. Now, the numbers of whose cheating have halved,” said MSU’s officiating registrar K M Chudasama.  MSU developed an in-house software that was customised to detect any suspicious movement on the screens.  It takes screenshots of answers attempted by students, prohibits him or her from opening any other screen to google search answers, captures images and records videos in case of any suspicious movement. The university has also banned use of headphones. “Students taking strolls inside their house or keeping literature behind the screens also gradually stopped as all such unwanted movements were being recorded,” he said. SPU VC Shirish Kulkarni said that the university took services of one Ahmedabad-based software firm which was already providing such service to Gujarat Technological University (GTU). “Proctoring became possible as now we can show photographs to students who are caught cheating or using unfair means during their online exams,” said Kulkarni.  SPU has changed rules whereby students caught adopting unfair means during online exams can also be punished. “Now, they will be deterred from adopting any such means while appearing for online exams,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/smart-software-homes-in-on-copycats-taking-online-exam/articleshow/84246423.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

What has disappointed aviation enthusiasts and local people is the continuing delay in the matter despite a new government at the helm . Even though the existing runway is only 8,136 feet in length, Trichy airport in May handled 10,323 passengers, higher than those handled by Jaipur, Amritsar and Kolkata international airports. Acknowledging the airport’s role in the geographical centre of the state connecting several districts, AAI mooted a proposal in 2010-2011 to extend the runway length to 12,500 feet. This would enable the airport to handle wide-bodied aircraft and augment its passenger and cargo handling capacity. While it was estimated that 683.3 acres would be needed for the expansion project including 345.6 acres in the purview of the state government and 337.7 acres of defence land, only 35.86 acres has been acquired so far. Only about 10% of the required land was acquired, that too in 10 years. Aviation enthusiasts point out that the airport has registered significant growth with the limited infrastructure. “There are airports that handle fewer international passengers than Trichy but has a longer runway. Although work is under way for a new passenger terminal for about Rs 1,000 crores, the shorter runway is preventing the airport from tapping its connectivity and export potential,” H Ubaidullah, an independent aviation analyst said. Since 2011, at least four emergency take-off/landings at Trichy airport exposed the insufficient length of the runway. Flights that were supposed to make emergency landings were diverted to Chennai as it was unsafe to land on a shorter runway. “The land acquisition is progressing and we are frequently reviewing it. Litigation pending with the court is the reason for the slow progress,” Trichy airport director S Dharmaraj said. Meanwhile, Trichy MP and chairman of airport advisory committee Su Thirunavukkarasar said he will coordinate with the stakeholders to hold a joint meeting. “We will discuss with state ministers and MLAs for expediting the progress of airport’s runway expansion proposal,” the MP told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/regime-change-yet-to-impact-trichy-airports-runway-plan/articleshow/84251115.cms||Deepak Karthik

The firm or consortium which emerges successful in the tendering process should operate and maintain e-autos in the city and suburbs as a feeder service to the Metro. During the RFQ level, the bidders should submit concepts for operating the service and the most viable concept will be adopted. The top bidders in the RFQ level will be shortlisted for submitting the requests for proposal (RFP). The project will be awarded to the most competent among the shortlisted bidders. “The main objective of the project is to provide first mile and last-mile connectivity to Metro passengers. The plan is to roll out 77 e-autos in the first phase. The operator should conduct e-auto services connecting various Metro stations and centres of other modes of transport like railway station, water metro station or bus station,” an official with KMRL said. The plan is to provide e-autos as a feeder service which can operate in short distances up to six kilometre. Though the plan is to provide 77 e-autos in the first phase, KMRL intends to roll out 115 e-autos in three phases. The passengers can avail the services as share autos. The firm or consortium which is selected for implementing the e-auto feeder service should provide vehicles with GPS system. Passengers will be able to track the vehicles using GPS and check their availability via online. The firm should also provide a complaint redressal system for passengers. Besides allowing the selected firm to collect charges from the passengers as fixed by the government, it can also seek the corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds from various firms for operating the service. Moreover, the operator will be entitled to exhibit static or digital space for advertisements so as to generate revenue. KMRL will provide advertisement for feeder e-auto services through various media to attract more passengers to the service. The Metro agency will also set up charging centres for e-autos. According to sources with KMRL, the first level of the bidding will be completed within a couple of months. As of now, Kochi Metro has 22 stations and the number will go up to 25 once the Pettah-Tripunithura extension of the Metro is completed. It is expected that the extension to Tripunithura will be over by 2022-23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kochi-metro-invites-tender-for-feeder-e-auto-services/articleshow/84246398.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

Pakistan PM Imran Khan had himself alleged that the attack in Lahore had links with “Indian sponsorship” of terrorism against Pakistan. India also said it had asked OIC to be watchful that their platform is not subverted by “vested interests for comments on internal affairs of India or for anti-India propaganda through biased and one-sided resolutions”. In a rare meeting between Indian ambassador to Saudi Arabia and OIC secretary general earlier this week, the latter said it had proposed talks between India and Pakistan and that it wanted to send a team to J&K to assess the situation there. “The meeting was held in response to an earlier request made by the OIC secretary general to meet our ambassador. Our ambassador conveyed the need to correct some of the misperceptions about India that are perpetrated by vested interests in the OIC,” said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi. Asked about Pakistan’s claims related to the Lahore attack, he said the international community was well aware of Pakistan’s credentials when it comes to terrorism. “This is acknowledged by its own leadership, which continues to glorify terrorists like Osama Bin Laden as martyrs,” Bagchi said. Pakistan’s national security adviser Moeed Yusuf had told reporters in Islamabad on Sunday that the mastermind of the Lahore attack “is an Indian citizen” and he is associated with Research and Analysis Wing (RAW).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/stop-lying-on-hafiz-blast-india-to-pakistan/articleshow/84254384.cms||---

Given the pandemic situation, permission for the event has been given with restrictions “to preserve the faith of devotees”, minister of state for home Pradipsinh Jadeja said on Thursday. The chariots of Lord Jagannath, Devi Subhadra and Lord Balbhadra will be accompanied by just five vehicles and a handful of persons to pull the chariots, as arrangements are being made to ensure that the procession returns to the temple in about five hours. Curfew will be imposed from 7am to 2pm in areas from where the procession will pass, Jadeja said.  “The government has closely monitored the number of new Covid-19 cases every day. Simultaneously, it has considered how to preserve the faith of devotees and has decided to hold the Rath Yatra with stringent restrictions and protocols in place,” Jadeja told media persons on Thursday afternoon. He added that the government was able to control the second wave of cases with great effort. “Stringent action will be taken against anybody who violates the curfew or restrictions and protocols,” the minister said. “Instead of crowding the yatra route, we request people to watch the live telecast of the event on Doordarshan and other channels. We recently suffered the second wave of coronavirus cases. We must be very careful and make sure the festival does not aggravate the situation,” Jadeja said. He added, “Since people from other districts and those living in the western parts of the city also flock to the route to watch the procession, police will regulate traffic on all bridges to keep people from going near the route.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rath-yatra-allowed-with-curbs/articleshow/84248818.cms||---
---||Madurai||For PTR Palanivel Thiagarajan, development goes beyond Madurai central||Q: What are your priorities for your constituency this time? A: I did not make promises in my first term, as I did not know about the system, and did not know what I could achieve. This time I have decided to finish the third drinking water scheme for Madurai, ensure 100 LPD for the people, work towards traffic decongestion and try to ensure proper solid waste management and liquid waste disposal and prevent sewage from flowing into river Vaigai and channels such as Kiruthumal nathi. Q: Do you think these are achievable targets? A: Unlike drinking water and streetlights, a UGD system cannot be done ad-hoc, in a semi-completed manner it has to be completed for the entire city. Now, we have outstanding officers in Collector Dr Aneesh Sekhar, who already knows the city well having been its commissioner, and corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan, a committed officer. So, hope to achieve at least some of it. Also, as finance minister, my ability to get financing for good projects should be perceived as higher than average, not just for Madurai, but all of Tamil Nadu. Q: Meenakshi temple is in your constituency. A: I am trying to get my leader, Chief Minister M K Stalin, to appoint me as chairman of the Thirupani committee of the temple, and get things moving for the consecration as already time has lapsed. Q: Most of the Smart city works are in your constituency, but it has also thrown life out of gear for residents due to lapses and delays. A: The corruption that the state saw in the last five years was of a grotesque form, most immoral, democratically sacrilegious. It doesn’t come under my ministry, but as finance minister local fund audit comes under my control. So I am contemplating asking the CM for a forensic audit of smart city works throughout Tamil Nadu. Q; What about the grievance boxes you installed in your constituency in the last term? A: I plan to rejuvenate it. But last time most of the petitions were in regard to OAP, bad ration goods etc. This time I have received about 800 petitions, 90% from educated youth seeking jobs. As finance minister I have interceded only in special cases, where families have been affected due to loss of life or extreme poverty. But, I am exploring possibilities of bringing new industrial parks or development, which would provide opportunities to educated youth of the region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/for-ptr-development-goes-beyond-madurai-central/articleshow/84251185.cms||---

When someone clicks on ‘Find your sulli deal of the day’, there is an e-auction with the photograph of a woman provided to the user. Chinmoy Biswal, public relations officer, Delhi Police, said, “Acting on a complaint received on the national cybercrime reporting portal about the Sulli Deals mobile app, a case was registered on Wednesday under Section 354-A (sexual harassment) of the Indian Penal Code by the Cyber Crime Unit and investigations have been started. A notice has also been sent to Github asking it to share relevant details with the cops.” On Wednesday, Delhi Commission of Women also sent a notice to Delhi Police and sought a copy of the FIR registered against the app as well as details of the action taken so far. In the notice, the commission asked for a detailed report from the cops on the pictures of Muslim women being uploaded and circulated on Github along with extensive use of derogatory language about the women. As per reports, pictures of at least 90 women from across numerous fields, including journalists and commercial pilots, were uploaded on the site for auction without their knowledge or consent. The women whose pictures were uploaded later faced harassment and some even received threats for denying their involvement in the auction. A day later on Thursday, National Commission for Women took cognisance of the matter. “Commission chairperson Rekha Sharma has written to Delhi commissioner of police for investigation into the matter and filing of an FIR,” NCW said. “NCW has to be informed of the action taken within 10 days.

However, on Wednesday, as Panvel tehsildar, Vijay Talekar, handed him the key to his renovated house — now named ‘Manohar Niwas’, the gratefulness and joy in his eyes expressed everything.Manohar’s small abode had been partially destroyed in the monsoon last year. So, looking at his deplorable situation, the gram sarpanch Surekha Pawar had requested the SEAL Ashram (Social and Evangelical Association for Love), an NGO, to assist the poor man who lived alone.“We immediately agreed to help out Manohar as he was practically our neighbour, and we believe in ‘Love your neighbour as yourself’. Our volunteers slowly got down to work to repair his village house, later also plastered and painted it while installing new electric lights. We felt happy to be of some use to the deaf-mute man who does not have any family members nearby for support,” said the founder of SEAL Ashram, Pastor K M Philip.New clothes and ration were provided to Manohar on Wednesday at a ceremony. Senior inspector of Panvel taluka police stationRavindra Daundkar, former sarpanch and adivasi leader Tukaram Patil were present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-deaf-mute-mans-rain-ruined-home-fixed-with-bricks-neighbours-love/articleshow/84253350.cms||Vijay Singh

Meanwhile, minister for health M Subramanian said that the state was vaccinating 1.5 lakh people per day now. People have been eagerly waiting for the details of availability of vaccines, and residential associations are being asked to get the details from the Madurai Corporation and the district administration. On Thursday, special camps were held in some parts of the city. But, none were held in the government sector as vaccines were not available. Meanwhile, 6,17,152 people had been vaccinated in the district till July 8. Minister M Subramanian, who spoke to reporters at the Madurai airport on Thursday, said that the state had received 1.58 crore vaccines from the Union government and that it had utilized almost all of it. On former minister R B Udhayakumar’s claim that only the constituencies of the ministers were being given priority in the vaccination drive, he said the allegation was not true. Vaccines were distributed to the districts as they were received and the district collectors were making the allotments, he said. Only 61,000 people were vaccinated by the AIADMK government per day, but now 1.5 lakh people are taking vaccines a day. There was a wastage of 8% of vaccines from January 16 to May 7, but this has been curtailed, he said. On the Union government’s suggestion that students to the AIIMS facility in Madurai be admitted to the Madurai Medical College, JIPMER, private medical colleges or government arts and science colleges, he said that all these were not feasible. The Madurai Medical College already has its full quota of 250 students, hence this would be taken up when he and the health secretary meet Union health minister Manusukh Mandaviya, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/no-vaccines-at-govt-facilities-in-madurai/articleshow/84251187.cms||---

The road between Andichioorani and Ottanam in Sivaganga was sanctioned during the AIADMK government and laid on the night of June 30 for two kilometres. Villagers say the road was laid overnight with the gravel being spread, levelled and tarred. Angry villagers confronted the highways officials and said the road had started developing pits and holes the very next day. The newly laid layer could be removed by hand, said Baskaran of Ottanam. He said they told the officials that the road was not of standard quality and picked up an argument with them, but they ignored it. On being brought to his notice, PWD minister E V Velu directed the director of State Highways Research Station, R Geetha, to inspect the road and submit a report. As the road was found to be of inferior quality, the department placed PWD divisional assistant engineer Mariappan, assistant engineer Marudhupandi and assistant engineer (quality control) Navaneethi under suspension. The state highways statement says the contract of the contractor, Darshan and Co, was also cancelled in this connection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/three-engineers-suspended-for-bad-quality-of-road/articleshow/84251199.cms||---

As the industry is going through a slack period, the order books have still not revived and traders are finding it hard to recover payments pending for over several months. To deal with the payments crisis and keep the businesses afloat, the traders’ body has taken up a new initiative. The welfare committee of the Federation of Surat Textile Traders Association (FOSTTA), since the second wave, has been taking up traders’ complaints of long-pending payments and helping them to get their money back. Not only traders from the city, but those from outside who have not been able to get money from their clients in Surat have benefited from FOSTTA’s drive. “More than 1,000 traders have received back their money amounting to crores of rupees,” said Manoj Agarwal, president of FOSTTA, adding that disputes over payments go on without any solution for years. “Instead of getting entangled in legal battles, we intervene when traders approach us. We try explaining to the debtor about the situation of the supplier,” said Agarwal, adding, “In most of the cases the person agrees and makes payment, but if the payment is not expedited, we circulate the name of the person in our WhatsApp groups due to which no one else enters into business with that trader.” An embroidery unit owner recently released goods of a trader after a similar pressure tactic was used against him. “The unit owner was returning our goods because of payments misunderstanding with some other trader. He had also not received payment from some traders, so FOSTTA intervened and got our goods released and cleared the embroidery unit owner’s issue too,” said Ashok Nahata, a trader of Arihant Textile Market. FOSTTA has also hired a lawyer to issue legal notice as the last choice. “So far disputes have ended with legal notices and no need has arisen to approach the court,” Agarwal told TOI. In some cases, officials of FOSTTA have travelled to other cities to get the debtor on the other side of the table for negotiations. “I had given up hope of getting my money after my client in Nashik didn’t pay for past two years. But when I got to know about FOSTTA’s initiative, I gave a complaint along with all documents and my payment of Rs 2.5 lakh was done within a couple of weeks,” said Ushab Bagrecha, a trader of Millenium Textile Market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/traders-body-turns-arbiter-to-clear-textile-payment-backlog/articleshow/84246464.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘In 2nd wave, Covid death among pregnant women rose 8 fold’||MUMBAI: The second wave of Covid-19 proved deadlier for pregnant women with more deaths and ICU admissions compared to the previous year, a study by two city institutes has concluded. In the light of their findings, researchers said the vaccination of pregnant women must be prioritised. After much hesitation, the central government recently gave its nod for vaccination of pregnant women. State officials said preparations are underway to start it next week. A joint analysis by the civic-run BYL Nair Hospital and ICMR-National Institute of Research in Reproductive Health has shown that the case fatality rate (CFR) among pregnant women rose nearly eight times while severe Covid cases were at least five times more in the second wave. The findings were recently published in the official journal of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. From 0.7% CFR in the first wave, the CFR jumped to 5.7% in 2021. The proportion of severe cases this time was 8.5% compared to 1.7% in the first wave. The comparative data of the two waves also showed that nearly 12% of Covid-positive pregnant women needed admission to the ICU or high-dependency unit (HDU) in the second wave compared to 2.4% in 2020. Nair hospital has been a dedicated centre for treatment of Covid-positive pregnant women since April last year. Between April 2020 and May 2021, it catered to 1,530 pregnant and post-delivery cases. Of these, 1,143 were treated between April and January this year, which the study considered as the ‘first wave’, while the remaining 387 were treated in the ‘second wave’ between February and May 2021. Of the 1,143 admissions there were eight deaths in the first wave, as opposed to 387 admissions and 22 deaths in the four months of the second wave. The maternal mortality ratio (per 1,000 births) in the second wave was significantly high at 83.3 among Covid-positive pregnant women compared to 10.2 of the first wave. The rate of stillbirths per 1,000 births was 34 in the second wave compared to 15.3 in the first wave. The rate of preterm birth, too, was 128.7 as opposed to 93.2 in the first wave. “Although the exact causes of the increase in severity and mortality are largely unknown, we suspect that a highly virulent variant of concern (B.1.617), which is now considered responsible for the second wave in Maharashtra and other parts of India, played a role,” said Dr Neeraj Mahajan, lead author of the study from Nair. The cause for 93% maternal deaths was COVID-19 pneumonia and respiratory failure. The findings of the study underlined the importance of offering vaccination to pregnant and lactating women, said Dr Rahul Gajbhiye, co-author of the study from ICMR-NIRRH. Over 20 lakh pregnant women in the state and about 1.5 lakh in the city would be eligible. Lactating mothers are already being inoculated. Nair and ICMR-NIRRH are also compiling a registry called PregCovid Registry of India to document the outcome of SARS-Cov2 infection in pregnant women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-2nd-wave-covid-death-among-pregnant-women-rose-8-fold/articleshow/84251251.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Madurai||Police stations in Madurai undergo delimitation exercise||MADURAI: Some of the police stations in the city have undergone delimitation exercises to ease public accessibility in reaching their respective police stations. Subramaniyapuram, Keerathurai, Keerathurai, Jaihindpuram, Thiruparankundram and Thirunagar under Madurai city police limits and Austinpatti, Perungudi and Silaiman police stations have undergone the delimitation exercise. City police commissioner Prem Anand Sinha said that some of the areas in the city were under police stations located far away from it, despite a police station available nearby. “This forced people to travel more. For instance, people in Mela Anupanadi had to approach the Avaniyapuram police station while the nearest one is Keerathurai police station,” he said. While the exercise has been completed and the government order has been issued, it will take some more time for implementation as a judicial notification is yet to be issued. Police sources said that areas such as Pasumalai Anna Nagar, New Ambedkar Nagar, Pethani Nagar, Muniyandipuram, Gopalipuram and Madakulam Main Road which are currently under Subramaniyapuram station and Sengundram Nagar and Thiagarajar College under Avaniyapuram station will be brought under Thiruparankundram police station. The following areas under Avaniaypuram police station will be brought under various other stations - Chinthamani and Anupanadi to come under Keerathurai; Prasanna Colonny, northern side of Ring Road, Chinnaudaippu to Sermathaivasan Junction to come under Perungudi station in rural police unit; Thendal Nagar and Ambedkar Nagar to come under Jaindpuram station; and areas under Sermathaivasan Junction to Kallambal Bridge on southern side of Ayyanarpuram to come under Silaiman police in rural police unit. Airport and adjoining areas including Madurai airport which are under the Perungudi police station will come under Avaniyapuram police station. Indira Nagar, Anjeneyar Nagar, Ambedkar Nagar, Thiruvallurvar Nagar Extension, Thiruvalluvar Nagar Centre, Kurinji Nagar, Aravind Nagar, PRC Colony, Kalai Nagar, Kamaraj Nagar, Thanakkankulam, Jeyam Nagar, Krishna Nagar, Ayyar Colony, Netaji Nagar, Yoga Nagar, Karthiga Nagar, Santhi Nagar, Meenakshi Nagar, Sowpakkiya Nagar, Mullai Nagar, Mottamalai, Athisivan Nagar, Vilachery North Muslim Street, Velar Street, Gandhi Street, Chetty Street, Yadavar Street, Netaji Nagar, Agraharam, Sevugar Street, Kottaram and Vilachery Main road which are under Austinpatti police station in rural police limit will come under Thirunagar police station. Om Shakthi Nagar 1st, 2nd and 3rd Street which are under the control of Thirunagar police station will go under Austinpatti police station. The commissioner said that it would be easier for the city police unit to take care of the security at the Madurai airport. VIP movement through the airport is often passing through Ring Road, which is mostly under the city police control. Coordination and providing security cover for VIPs coming into the city would be better if the airport is brought under the city. While some of the areas added to the city are not under the Madurai Corporation limit, the city police commissioner said that there is no need for the city police limit to be coterminous with corporation limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/police-stations-in-madurai-city-undergo-delimitation-exercise/articleshow/84251216.cms||V Devanathan
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Discarded PPE suits, masks repurposed into eco-friendly bricks||A little boy’s experiments with chewing gum years ago have today inspired a technology that is transforming non-medical discarded PPE suits and masks into eco-friendly bricks. Since last September, recycling genie and social entrepreneur Binish Desai has been manufacturing builder bricks from the pandemic’s non-biodegradable detritus.  The light grey bricks consist of 52% plastic waste (including masks, gloves and coverall suits), 40% paper mill waste, and 8% of the binder gum sap called chitin which makes chewing gum chewy. “I had played around with this chewing gum and paper as a child and saw how well it could harden,” says Desai. He first started making the brick with just paper mill waste in Valsad and Surat in Gujarat. With the pandemic and the vast amount of non-biodegradable collateral waste, he worked on what he describes as the ‘Brick 2.0’. The technology is now being franchised to units across the country – including Khopoli in Maharashtra, Raipur and Bengaluru. He says he hopes to work with the government to organise collection drives at factories and in housing societies.  Environmentalists have expressed grave concern about how the detritus generated by Covid-19 is going to infiltrate an already polluted planet. “The government has said wear masks but no one knows what to do with used masks. We constantly hear of divers finding masks floating in the ocean and getting stuck in the corals,” says environmentalist Stalin D of the NGO Vanashakti. According to the Central Pollution Control Board, India produced an average of 132 tonnes of Covid-19 biomedical waste daily between June 2020 and May 2021. Maharashtra reported a 45% increase in the volume of its biomedical waste.  Given the potentially toxic nature of biomedical waste, the government has strict guidelines for its collection and disposal. Hospitals are required to adhere to these. The waste from companies and homes is what falls into a more grey area. In Mumbai, each ward has two vehicles that ply daily to every housing society to pick up segregated biomedical waste, which is eventually incinerated in Govandi. However, many housing societies have not implemented a proper system of segregation and much of this waste ends up in the regular dry waste collection.  The waste Desai uses often comes directly from manufacturers – for example, the extra material that gets left behind when making PPE suits or masks; or the non-medical masks and head gear used by workers in an electronic chip factory; or the disposable shoe covers and disposable sheets used in clinics and salons. He is also working directly with housing societies and corporates in Gujarat.  Over the last few months, a small number of builders and architects have started using these eco-friendly bricks. Recently, a school and a temple management approached him. “Sustainability need not be expensive. Besides being environmentally friendly, and potentially tougher, they are cheaper than traditional bricks,” says Desai.  The 29-year-old has developed about 150 eco-products, including clocks, bicycles and crockery, recycled from waste material. He recently helped establish a social enterprise where retired sex workers in Bhiwandi are being trained to create crockery out of coffee grinds. “My work starts when your work stops. We are relocating waste rather than getting rid of it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-discarded-ppe-suits-masks-repurposed-into-eco-friendly-bricks/articleshow/84253385.cms||Namita Devidayal
---||Patna||Bihar: Criminals raid Muzaffarpur bank, loot Rs 6.8 lakh||PATNA: A gang of six armed criminals looted Rs 6.82 lakh in cash from Repura branch of the State Bank of India (SBI) under the Saraiya police station area in Muzaffarpur district on Thursday. The criminals also opened fire in the air to terrorise the locals who pelted stones at them. The incident took place around 11.20am when the bank officials were busy dealing with the customers. Four youths armed with country-made pistols entered the bank, held the employees captive and collected cash from the counter and chest. They assaulted the cashier, Akhilesh Kumar Paswan, with revolver butts. Akhilesh told police that the criminals overpowered the two security guards — Upendra Kumar and Raju Paswan — and collected money from the cash counter. They then forced the manager of the bank branch to hand over the keys of the chest. The robbers collected cash from the chest in plastic bags and fired in the air on the bank premises to terrorise the employees and customers. Two criminals having weapons in their hands stood guard on the main road. “When we pelted stones at the criminals, they opened fire in the air. They later escaped with looted money on their motorbikes,” an eyewitness said. The manager of the bank branch, Manish Anand, told police that the robbers also snatched cash from some customers. The security guards said they couldn’t identify the robbers as they were wearing masks and had covered their faces with clothes. Saraiya sub-divisional police officer Rajesh Sharma said efforts were on to identity the robbers with the help of CCTV footages. He added three empty cartridges were recovered from the spot. A video showing robbers in action later went viral on social media. On getting information, Muzaffarpur SSP Jayant Kant reached the spot and asked the SDPO and the SHO to crack the case at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/criminals-raid-muz-bank-loot-rs-6-8-lakh/articleshow/84245763.cms||Ramashankar
---||Nagpur||Supply food for students through PDS smart card: Teachers’ union||Yavatmal: Shikshak Bharati Sanghatana district president Sahebrao Pawar on Thursday requested the state government to supply food materials through Public Distribution System (PDS) with the help of smart cards. Pawar said that if good quality food is supplied through PDS, it would ensure the real purpose of the scheme is fulfilled, for which a smart card should be brought to use. Any other system wouldn't help the government provide nourished food to the children, he added. The state government has decided to credit the amount to the bank account of the students studying in Std I to VIII across the state for nutritious food (‘sakas aahar’) scheme currently under way in the schools. There was a great hue and cry over the scheme as it brings unnecessary burden on the teachers, besides corruption and pinching of food materials here and there. To avoid it and ensure that the eligible students get nourishing food regularly, the government decided to credit the amount into the bank accounts of the students. Though the intention is clear, it creates a number of hardships for the students and their parents. Besides, the students in the remote villages are not well-informed about the procedure. The banking system is unknown in the rural hamlets. If the government goes ahead with the new scheme, the workload of the banks will increase. The students may not get the nutritious food regularly due to misuse of the money by parents. It could be diverted for other needs in the household.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/supply-food-for-students-through-pds-smart-card-teachers-union/articleshow/84246458.cms||---

---||Vadodara||From 11,000 plus Covid beds at peak, only 42 occupied in Vadodara now||VADODARA: At the peak of the pandemic in May, 11,089 Covid-19 beds were occupied in hospitals with patients waiting in queue for want of adequate beds. Thankfully the worst is over and today, it has come down drastically low to merely 42 beds in Vadodara on Thursday. The pandemic had led to a panic situation regarding availability of beds, oxygen and some medicines in the city. However, the situation started easing out at a much faster rate when compared to the rise of the wave. In the second week of May, around 14,200 Covid-19 beds were available in the city. When the hospitalization was at peak on May 4, 14,043 beds were available and 11,089 of these were occupied. On Thursday, the number was merely 42 out of the available 6,048 beds. Sources in the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) said that most small hospitals had discontinued admitting Covid patients as sufficient beds were available in bigger hospitals. “Also, they want to start their routine work since hardly any Covid cases are being reported,” said an official. However, the VMC is not looking to reduce the number of beds drastically. This has been done to ensure that if there is a third wave, sufficient beds are available in case of a sharp rise. Makeshift hospitals started by the government have also been wound up. But the equipment at the premises where these came up has not been dismantled as a precautionary measure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/from-11000-plus-covid-beds-at-peak-only-42-occupied-now/articleshow/84246692.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||Lucknow||Roaming without a mask? You are violating others’ right to life||Masks and Covid-19 appropriate protocols have become a part of life since life was thrown out of gear by the coronavirus in February 2020. Health agencies across the globe, including the WHO, have recommended wearing mask to provide first line protection against the lethal virus. In fact, it may not be wrong to say that the guidelines of wearing a mask and washing hands from the early days of the pandemic seemed to have withstood the test of time. Despite the obvious benefits of using masks, which help protect from the airborne transmission of the virus, there continues to be some reluctance in wearing them, though this has vastly improved after the second wave. Many persons continue to roam without mask, endangering their own as well as the lives of those around them, until the police started strictly enforcing fines. With Rajasthan passing a law last year making wearing of masks compulsory, there has been a rising chorus to pass an all-India law with the same mandate. But the greatest concern that arises with such a law is that it often paves the way for police excesses. Therefore some states like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra have evoked the Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897 to make people adhere to the Covid-19 prevention protocol. In fact, UP came up with another law – the Uttar Pradesh Public Health and Epidemic Diseases Control Act, 2020 – to aid implementation. Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, read with Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897, which penalizes disobedience of an order duly promulgated by a public servant with up to 6 months’ imprisonment has been invoked for the slightest of violations. But such a provision must be used in extreme episodes as in the case of a habitual defaulter or someone who refuses to budge. But enforcement is the key to the success of any law. Unless implemented well, the law remains a paper tiger. Why work on implementation Every person’s life is protected under the Indian Constitution’s right to life. People who don’t wear masks are potential spreaders of the virus and endanger the life of the community at large. But to make the provision a reality, effective implementation of law is inexorable especially in times of pandemic. States must take necessary steps to make people follow the rule in present circumstances which complicate further because of factors like misinformation, illiteracy and general laxity. A Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan, while hearing Covid-19 matters, has opined that non-compliance with the mask requirements would violate the right to life of others. The right to life is perhaps the most paramount fundamental right, protected under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. In the celebrated case of Parmanand Katara versus Union of India, the Supreme Court expressly expanded the scope of Article 21 to include the right to health within it. One may also argue that the pandemic is a threat to the security of the State, and has even been classified as a ‘disaster’ under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.

---||Kochi||International traffic: Cochin airport becomes third busiest airport||KOCHI: The Cochin International Airport Ltd (Cial) has become the third busiest airport in India in terms of international traffic during the period of January-May 2021. The airport handled 5,89,460 international passengers during the five months and attained the third position after Delhi and Mumbai airports. In 2020, Cial was in the fourth position after Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai airports. If the passenger flow of April alone is considered, the airport has facilitated 1,38,625 international passengers and it was the second busiest airport in the country. Cial authorities said that the number of passengers in both the domestic and international sectors is increasing, which is a positive sign of recovery amid the second wave of the pandemic. “From just 3,000 passengers on June 1, the daily passenger volume increased to 7,012 on June 30 touching the total figure for the month to 1,43,366. The airport handled 1,139 aircraft movements during June. Cial, which has been handling 10 million passengers annually during the pre-pandemic period, is set to facilitate a projected surge in the aviation sector for the forthcoming months,” said a statement. During the first five months of the year, the total passenger volume registered at Cial’s domestic and international sectors was 15,56,366. In the domestic sector, Cial was the seventh busiest airport in the country in the pre-pandemic time. The domestic sector too is seeing a rise in passenger flow now. Cial managing director S Suhas said that the increase in traffic was because of the efficacy of the state government in making Kerala as one of the safest places to arrive during the pandemic period. He said Cial’s pro-active approach in making the airport a safe travel hub has helped in the achievement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cial-becomes-3rd-busiest-airport/articleshow/84246494.cms||---

A petitioner opposed the application and stated that the expert committee’s decision to allow entry was not based on medical grounds. “We don’t want a situation where nobody takes responsibility, and yet the numbers rise. But here, if some responsible body is saying they’ve examined the matter, I feel they can be allowed,” one of the judges said during the hearing. To a petitioner’s contention that the expert decision doesn’t seem to have been taken on medical grounds, the bench stated that the expert committee is quite a broad ranged committee. There is a lot of literature possibly on the internet that people do get Covid after even two doses and of the dangers of the new variant, the court said, and sought to know whether it is the court’s domain to evaluate this literature. “It’s for the experts,” the bench stated, adding that this is just its opinion and not its final opinion on the matter.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat’s cotton acreage may grow 10%||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat’s cotton acreage is likely to increase 10% this kharif season with farmers getting high prices for the natural fibre last year. Currently, the area under cotton cultivation in the state has increased to 16.50 lakh hectares as on July 5, compared to 15.72 lakh hectares during the same period last year. This was revealed in the latest data compiled by the state agriculture department. “At present, the area under cotton cultivation has increased by about 7% when compared with the same period last year,” said Arvind Pan, president, Saurashtra Cotton Ginners Association (SCGA). Pan added: “This is due to high prices of cotton last year.” Pan said groundnut sowing has been delayed due to stalled monsoon. “This may prompt some groundnut farmers to turn to cotton,” he said. “If the monsoon resumes now, there will be another 3% increase in the cotton acreage. Overall, the area under cotton cultivation is expected to surge 10% this year.” The area under cotton cultivation in Gujarat had declined 15% to 23 lakh hectares in 2020 from 27 lakh hectares in 2019. The average cotton acreage of the past three years is 25.53 lakh hectares. Strong demand from domestic and international markets had pushed up cotton prices to a decadal high of Rs 52,000 per candy (one candy is equivalent to 356kg) by the end of the cotton season for 2020-21. “The prices of high-quality Shankar-6 cotton are currently being quoted at Rs 51,500-52,000 per candy,” said a cotton trader. “The prices are expected to remain firm, which is going to lure farmers to cotton crop.” According to the Cotton Association of India (CAI), despite a lower acreage last year, Gujarat’s cotton output is estimated to rise to about 97 lakh bales in the 2020-21 season. One bale is equivalent to 170kg. In the previous season, the output was 95 lakh bales.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarats-cotton-acreage-may-grow-10/articleshow/84248927.cms||Kalpesh Damor

---||Nagpur||Homes flooded, traffic hit, few hours of rain inundates Nagpur||NAGPUR: Heavy rains lashed Nagpur city and adjoining regions on Thursday, leaving most areas in South, East, North and South-West Nagpur waterlogged and traffic disrupted. The new Manish Nagar railway underbridge too was completely flooded, exposing unplanned infrastructure development works in the city. TOI spotted disruption of vehicular traffic on Great Nag Road, Inner Ring Road (especially the patch between Chhatrapati Square and Narendra Nagar underbridge), Manish Nagar railway underbridge, Padole Hospital square and other roads. Due to waterlogged roads, traffic on Chhatrapati Square to Narendra Nagar RuB, Manish Nagar RuB, from Swawlambi Nagar Square to Radhe Mangal Karyalaya was diverted to other roads, traffic police said. As the rain intensified, health officer (sanitation) Dr Pradip Dasarwar, superintending engineer Manoj Talewar and chief fire officer Rajendra Uchake were monitoring the city from the command and control centre (COC) at NMC’s new administrative building. Watching through CCTV surveillance cameras installed across the city, sanitary workers were pressed into service to clean inlets of blocked stormwater network, especially on waterlogged roads and squares like Shankar Nagar, Sadar Coffee House Square, Ashok Chowk (on Great Nag Road), Jagnade Square etc. It helped to drain away the water rapidly. District guardian minister Nitin Raut, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, chief executive officer of Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) Bhuvaneswari S, additional municipal commissioners Ram Joshi and Jalaj Sharma visited the COC and monitored the dewatering works of sanitary workers and fire department. Fire control room of the NMC’s fire and emergency services department received many phone calls pertaining to waterlogging, especially in residential localities. “Rainwater entered many houses damaging household articles in Vandevi Nagar slum near Kalamna market, Telephone Nagar in Dighori area, Kalyaneshwar Nagar in south Nagpur among many other residential localities,” firemen on emergency calls told TOI. With poor or damaged drainage systems, rainwater was pouring on motorists beneath flyovers like Sadar’s Y-shaped flyover and double decker flyover on Wardha Road. Construction of Pardi flyover and Metro Rail work has damaged the stormwater network near Old Pardi Naka Square on Bhandara Road thus leading to rainwater gushing into shops at Prasad Apartment. Property worth lakhs of rupees was damaged due to rainwater entering over 50 shops here, said local resident Rajendra Gaur. Jai Jawan Jai Kisan president Prashant Pawar along with his supporters stormed the flooded Manish Nagar RuB and protested against MahaMetro. To a query about waterlogging on busy patches of Inner Ring Road, a senior official from NMC’s public works department said they had written several letters to the state’s public works department regarding faulty construction of stormwater networks in many patches of Inner Ring Road. But the state agency has not taken any corrective measures till date, the official admitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/homes-flooded-traffic-hit-few-hours-of-rain-inundates-nagpur/articleshow/84251270.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The police identified the deceased as Ishan Shinde (15) and said he lived with his family in the flat from which he fell in Vasant Lawns complex. “It was on Wednesday afternoon. He was standing in the gallery of the apartment of the high-rise building and might have lost balance and fallen from the building,” an officer from the Vartak Nagar police station said.

The India meteorological department (IMD) has also issued an orange alert of heavy to very heavy rainfall for July 11 and 12. “This is going to be an active spell of monsoon where it will be strengthened for five to seven days. Wind speed of 40kmph is a usual phenomena during the active monsoon period,” IMD scientist, Rahul M said. IMD has attributed the reason for this to the likelihood of the formation of a low-pressure area off north Andhra Pradesh and the south Odisha coasts by July 11. The increased rainfall activity is likely to continue for about a week, from July 11 till July 18, as per IMD’s observation. Heavy rainfall measuring 64.5mm to 115.5mm in 24 hours to very heavy rainfall measuring 115.6mm to 204.4mm of rainfall in the next 24 hours is very likely to take place with isolated and scattered distribution over Goa during this period. Squally weather is also expected along and off the coast, IMD said. “With increased rainfall activity to continue, the areas vulnerable for landslide, flooding may be kept under monitoring and necessary precautions may be taken,” the IMD warned. They have also warned of the possible uprooting of weak trees and collapse of weak structures, rock falls in vulnerable areas, longer disruption of municipal services like water and electricity, rise of water level in rivers and canals and damage to crops due to inundation. Some communities and islands may also be temporarily inaccessible, the IMD said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-on-orange-alert-for-july-11-12/articleshow/84251353.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Asaduddin Owaisi interview: ‘We are open to alliances to defeat BJP in Uttar Pradesh elections’||All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen has thrown down the gauntlet for the next year’s UP elections. In an exclusive interview to Pervez Iqbal Siddiqui, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi said their’s will be a direct fight against the BJP government over its failure to handle several key issues. Excerpts: AIMIM has invited applications for 100 seats in UP. This, when your party is part of Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha, which is yet to decide on seat-sharing?A: AIMIM state president Shauquat Ali has clarified that only applications have been invited for 100 seats. The number of seats will be decided by Morcha chief Om Prakash Rajbhar in consultation with AIMIM. It could be less or more than 100 seats. Is Morcha open to alliance with any opposition party?A: I can only reiterate what the Morcha convenor has said: We are open to an alliance to defeat BJP. The best person to talk about alliances is Om Prakash Rajbhar. You are scheduled to visit the mausoleum of Ghazi Salar Masud in Bahraich who was assassinated by Suheldev, the king of Shravasti. He is an icon for Rajbhar’s party. What’s the message behind this visit?A: Yes, I will visit the dargah. There is no political message. Whenever I visit any place, I also go to a famous mausoleum or madrassa in that city. AIMIM had initially announced that it will contest all seats in West Bengal. Later you fought only on seven seats. What are the chances of AIMIM doing a West Bengal in UP?A: Politics is a long haul. When we contest elections for the first time in any state, we start with a limited number of seats because the aim is to get a foothold. It also sends out a message to the cadres that the party wants to expand its base. In 2017 UP polls, AIMIM had contested on 36 seats but got only 0.2% (2,05, 232) votes. What has changed on the ground that prompted you to prepare for 100 seats?A: We have a stronger organisational presence in UP now. Besides, we have 100% booth presence in about 80 assembly seats. In the past five years, we have won municipal corporators and zila parishad seats. I have been constantly visiting UP. You recently said AIMIM will not allow BJP to form the next government in UP and Yogi Adityanath to become the CM again. This, when AIMIM does not have a single MLA in UP?A: No. That statement is being projected as a political turf war between two individuals. Yogi is the CM and has the collective responsibility towards the misrule in UP. We have been saying that we will defeat the BJP. Since Yogi is the CM, the fight will be against his party on the basis of his government’s pathetic performance in handling Covid, unemployment and other important issues. What are the important issues for UP assembly elections?A: This time it will be a direct fight between Yogi Adityanath and the women who lost their husbands to Covid. Yogi will face orphans who have lost their parents because of the government's failure and gross mismanagement during the Covid second wave. Yogi will face the ire of unemployed youth. Your direct attack on BJP is being seen as an attempt to polarise elections which traditionally helps BJP. Your comments?A: Accusing us for division of secular votes is a mere bogey that so called secular parties raise whenever we talk of what the Muslims got in return from the party they voted for. What is wrong in highlighting that Muslims are not getting their due share in UP. AIMIM did not contest the 2014 or 2019 Lok Sabha elections in UP. What happened to the ‘secular parties’ which badly lost one election after another when Owaisi wasn’t there to “divide the votes”. BSP has announced it will not ally with AIMIM while the SP is silent on the issue. Why?A: The problem is Owaisi has started pointing out that 58% of Muslims are illiterate while the literacy rate of the majority community is about 70%. Literacy rate of Muslim women is the lowest. Is Asaduddin Owaisi responsible for this? Parties which have always enjoyed the support of Muslims and people who have led such parties and became CMs should answer this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/we-are-open-to-alliances-to-defeat-bjp-in-up-elections/articleshow/84253454.cms||Pervez Iqbal Siddiqui

The HC on Thursday directed the state and the board to modify its time schedules given in the recruitment notification for various phases of the selections. Condense huge time gaps for each phase and fill the posts immediately, said a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy. The bench was hearing a PIL that expressed concern over the crumbling criminal justice system in the state owing to the huge number of vacancies of public prosecutors leading to a stage where one public prosecutor is acting as PP for several courts. The bench has been monitoring the issue for the past several months. Though the state has now issued a notification, it sought a time of 264 days to complete the process. The bench felt that the time sought was too long and said it does not require so much time. The bench gave two weeks to the state to issue a revised notification and posted the case to August 25 for further hearing. The court took up the letter written by the registrar general of the high court as a PIL and made the officials act towards fulfilling the task of ensuring a PP for each court to take the trials in criminal cases forward. There was a proposal to equip every criminal court complex with a huge PPs office that has all modern amenities and gadgets that connect all courts digitally, making it easy for authorities to ascertain facts without any loss of time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fill-up-public-prosecutor-posts-without-delay-hc-tells-govt/articleshow/84251344.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Now, almost a quarter of the eligible adult population in Maharashtra has received at least one shot, and 8.7% are fully vaccinated. Maharashtra is second only to UP, which has administered over 3.6 crore doses till Thursday. Within the state, Mumbai has vaccinated the most: 59.3 lakh have got one shot, while 12.5 lakh have got both doses. The feat was marred as the drive slowed again due to insufficient supply of doses this week. The BMC has suspended inoculation for Friday at public centres. The state could barely vaccinate 3.1lakh people on Thursday while Mumbai’s turnout halved to (45,171) compared to the previous day. Immunisation took place only at 115 of the 303 public centres in the city. State officials confirmed they are hoping to receive around 7lakh doses on Friday. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said if doses arrive by Friday night, there would be a trimmed drive on Saturday and the full schedule will run from Monday. This is the second time in little over a month when the BMC has had to cancel vaccination drive due to shortage. Vaccination in the first week of July had seen a significant uptick. On July 3, Maharashtra had administered 8 lakh doses in a day, but the numbers have dropped since. In all, Maharashtra has administered 3.57crore doses, of which 2.06 crore people have got the first shot and 73.98 lakh have been fully vaccinated. UP may have administered the highest doses in the country, but it is behind Maharashtra when it comes to complete vaccination. The number of people fully vaccinated in the country’s most populous state is 55.27 lakh, according to CoWin. Up to 45 lakh doses in the state have been administered in private hospitals. Dr Dilip Patil, state’s immunisation officer, said the erratic supply is hurting the drive. “Whenever we have doses, districts vaccinate in their full capacity,” he said. The Centre had assured Maharashtra of 1.15 crore doses in July. “But we are not sure what volumes will actually arrive. It all depends on how much companies have managed to augment their production capacity,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/vax-milepost-3-57cr-jabs-given-9-state-adults-fully-inoculated/articleshow/84256646.cms||Sumitra Debroy

We are currently processing enquiries. We will continue this programme,” a senior PMC official said. The civic body has tied up with care homes, hospitals and patient care centres to hold these drives. Each mobile unit has the capacity to administer 150 doses daily. The units come with doctors, nurses and paramedical staff.. Officials said the PMC’s plan is to have 15 of these specialised mobile units. Overall, the vaccine-on-wheels programme, which is supported via CSR funding, hopes to cover a target of one lakh beneficiaries who are unable to travel to vaccination centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-plans-to-have-more-mobile-units/articleshow/84248993.cms||---

Confirming the development, Ayush Prasad, CEO of Pune Zilla Parishad, on Thursday told TOI, “The special vaccination drive for bedridden citizens has started on trial/pilot basis, following the state government’s recent submission of the plan before the Bombay high court. Our aim is to cover as many beneficiaries as possible.” He said, “The bedridden citizens living in housing societies, bungalows or individual residential or housing society premises in 13 tehsils of the district will avail of the benefit of the doorstep vaccination. In the first two weeks, we would vaccinate at least 200 such patients.” The administration has directed the head of the Primary Health Centres to work in tandem with gram panchayats, elected bodies and other staffs to identify such patients in their limits and vaccinate them on priority. “The drive will be executed systematically so that every eligible bedridden citizen gets the shot,”Prasad said. “Our health staffers would identify patients and then go with an ambulance to the respective housing society or individual house for doorstep vaccination. After the vaccination, they would observe the patient for the next half an hour. This move would ensure smooth vaccination in the district,” he said. “A vial containing 10 doses needs to be utilized within four hours or it may go to waste. Vaccinating citizen living in individual residences and ensuring half an hour observation period at every home is likely to involve wastages,” said a PMC health official. A PCMC official said, “We have developed the ‘mi jababdar’ (I’m responsible) cellphone app for citizens wishing to sign up a person with special needs for Covid vaccination. We contact these people accordingly.” (With inputs from Piyush Bhusari)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/trial-run-of-home-vaccination-for-bedridden-starts-in-district/articleshow/84248963.cms||Sandip Dighe

It will be a physical resource centre for the companies to avail third party services training on benefits of e-commerce, GST and taxation support, shipping and logistics support, cataloguing assistance among others. Part of Amazon India’s plan to digitize Indian MSMEs, the centre will provide local partners additional revenue channels while creating awareness and understanding of e-commerce, understanding the export markets and offer MSMEs the support to grow their businesses, the e-comm giant stated “Surat is a major hub of MSME sector in Gujarat and the centre will cater to the companies in Surat and nearby areas. It will be a one-stop place for MSME to do all sales in India and engage with other Amazon programs,” Amit Agarwal, senior vice-president and country head of Amazon India said. “Some of our sellers are buying from Amazon but they have not taken the first step to come online. So, we thought that a physical centre would help and through this we will handhold the small and medium businesses with everything,” said Manish Tiwary, vice-president of Amazon India, told TOI. The company has also seen a rise in the number of sellers on its platform over the last one year. “We have 8.5 lakh sellers in India, but 3 lakh of them have come since January 2020, just before the pandemic so there has been a sharp acceleration in sellers coming online,” Tiwary said, adding that due to the pandemic there has been a rise in both sellers and customers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/amazon-india-sets-up-countrys-first-digital-centre-for-msmes-in-surat/articleshow/84246616.cms||Jay Pachchigar

Bitten by insects on her feet and other body parts, she has developed septicaemia. The baby, who is undergoing treatment at Rohilkhand Medical College in Bareilly for over the past one week, has “miraculously survived and is out of danger”, say doctors. Confirming the progress, child welfare committee officials said the baby’s condition has improved a bit and she is no more on the oxygen support. Her wounds, however, are yet to heal, said officials, adding that she is still under observation. After locals brought her to the district hospital, the baby was shifted to the medical college as her condition had started deteriorating. Speaking to TOI, child welfare committee chairperson Dr DN Sharma said, “The baby has shown some improvement. The oxygen support has been removed. Her wounds, inflicted by the insects, are yet to heal. She is undergoing treatment. Her overall condition is, however, much better.” “Once completely recovered, we will shift her to the Bareilly district hospital. Then, after contacting district probation officials, advertisements will be issued for her identification. If her real parents don’t turn up within two months, we will then set in motion the process for her adoption,” added Dr Sharma. Officials said the adoption would be processed through the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA), a government body. Those interested in the adoption would have to submit the required documents on the CARA website. Following which a verification would be carried out to ascertain the authenticity and eligibility of the person seeking adoption, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/miracle-baby-now-one-week-old-out-of-danger-wounds-yet-to-heal-docs/articleshow/84244443.cms||Maria Khan

The government is considering the option and it will be soon cleared,” principal secretary (disaster management) Aseem Kumar Gupta told TOI on Thursday. “Fully vaccinated” refers to those for whom it has been at least two weeks since the second dose. During a recent meeting with the health ministry, the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 and the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation in India stated that people who have received both the doses of vaccine could avoid quarantine and Covid-19 testing during inter-state travel. People associated with the travel industry and those planning leisure and business trips described the Maharashtra government’s idea as “a welcome move”. Nilesh Bhansali, director of the Travel Agents Association of Pune, said, “This will be a big relief. Each day there are several queries from many fully vaccinated people willing to travel but are in two minds because of the mandatory RT-PCR negative report. Relaxation of the rule can also lead to an increase in the number of people coming for short vacations.” Many states, including Maharashtra, have made the RT-PCR negative report mandatory for the incoming travellers, even if they are fully vaccinated. The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) recently stopped its buses to Karnataka after the neighbouring state came out with strict regulations about carrying the RT-PCR negative report. “We will not be able to resume our bus services unless the restrictions introduced by states such as Goa, Gujarat and Karnataka are removed. It is, however, heartening that Maharashtra is considering doing away with the restriction,” an MSRTC official said. Kadambari Goswami, who wants to visit her parents in Kolkata, said, “I am fully vaccinated but reluctant to travel because the RT-PCR report is needed both for travelling to West Bengal and while returning to Pune.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maha-mulls-over-rt-pcr-test-relief-for-incoming-travellers-with-2-shot-cover/articleshow/84249060.cms||Joy Sengupta

The National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) and the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC), the apex bodies that advise the government on vaccination have approved the inoculation of pregnant women, state immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar said. National, state and peripheral level trainings have been completed and the ministry of health and family welfare’s guidelines have been shared with all stakeholders, he said. Borkar appealed to all pregnant women to avail of the opportunity and advised that they go early to avoid crowds at the vaccination centres and to go on a full stomach and stay hydrated. Drinking water is being provided at all vaccination centres, he said. “Research has found that the benefits outweigh the risks involved. Vaccination per say will not prevent infection, they could still contract Covid, but the consequences of the disease will be worse in the unvaccinated,” Borkar said, adding that if the intensity, hospital admissions, morbidity and mortality will be much less among the vaccinated. Vaccination for Indians and Nepalis without ID cards will take place at the TB Hospital, Monte, Margao, on Sunday, Borkar said, adding that there will be more camps for this group in South Goa and North Goa depending on the demand. Till date, 73.6% of Goa’s population has taken at least one dose of the vaccine and the state has administered more than 10,25,354 doses. The government wants to reach out to the remaining 27% in the next few weeks, by July 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-to-commence-vaccinating-pregnant-women-from-today/articleshow/84251388.cms||---

Borkar, who holds charge of the health and family welfare section of the directorate of health services (DHS), said that of the six pregnant women who have succumbed to the virus during the second wave of the pandemic, three had gestational diabetes, two had hypertension and one suffered from kidney disease. No expectant mother had died of the virus during the first wave, he said. Just last week, the expert committee — a recommendatory body comprising doctors to help the government prepare for a potential third wave of the pandemic — had suggested that pregnant women be given the choice to get vaccinated against Covid-19 after they are counselled. Its members had said there was no evidence of teratogenicity (ability to cause defects in a foetus) in women who had taken the vaccine while being unaware that they were pregnant. Goa sees an average of 18,000-20,000 childbirths each year. Borkar appealed to all expectant mothers to avail of the opportunity to get inoculated against Covid-19. He also advised them to go early to avoid crowds, and to ensure they have eaten well and are adequately hydrated. Drinking water is being provided at all vaccination centres, he said. “Research has found that the benefits outweigh the risks involved. Vaccination, per se, will not prevent infection. They could still contract Covid but the consequences of the disease will be worse in the unvaccinated,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/jabs-for-pregnant-women-from-today-as-second-wave-claims-6/articleshow/84251397.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||For first time in 144 yrs, gajraj will not be part of procession||Ahmedabad: For the first time in 144 years, the Rath Yatra procession will not have any elephants, a moved aim at avoiding crowding and raising the pace of yatra, which has a time limit . “This time, elephants will stand at the gate of Jagannath temple where they will be worshipped and one of them will garland Lord Jagannath, Lord Balbhadra and Devi Subhadra,” said a Jagannath temple source. Earlier, 16 to 18 elephants used to be part of the yatra. Historically these majestic animals, which normally lead the procession, form a major part of the rath yatra, whether it is at Puri or in Ahmedabad. In 1985, it was difficult to carry out the yatra due to communal tension. Government agencies tried to dissuade people from holding the yatra. “An elephant started pulling the Lord’s rath out of the temple premises. It gave confidence to other devotees and amid the roars of ‘Jai Ranchhod’, the procession began, recounts a temple volunteer. Even today, the first invitation for yatra is sent to the Ganesh temple in Jamalpur, which holds the samadhi of the first elephant owned by the temple.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/for-first-time-in-144-yrs-gajraj-will-not-be-part-of-procession/articleshow/84249068.cms||---
---||Pune||In Pune, over 50 lakh people given at least one dose||PUNE: The district went past the 50-lakh Covid vaccination mark on Thursday, nearly five months and three weeks after the first jab was administered on January 16. CoWIN data showed that out of the 50 lakh beneficiaries so far, around 39.66 lakh beneficiaries have received their first dose and 10.71 lakh have received their second. There’s still a long way to go before a good number of people are covered. Pune district’s target population recently increased from 58 lakh to 87 lakh after authorities added 2020 population data. Officials said they’re confident of good coverage, as long as supply from the Centre remains steady. In Pune district, more than 18 lakh beneficiaries from 45-plus group have received their first jab; 7.91 have received their second dose. In the 18-44 group, more than 15 lakh people have been given their first dose, while some 40,000 have received their second. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, "Our latest target is swift vaccination of the 47 lakh beneficiaries who are yet to get their first jab. Vaccination centres have been instructed to exhaust their stock as quickly as possible to get the next batch. But there is a demand-supply gap. If supply stays steady, we have the manpower and infrastructure to vaccinate a minimum of one lakh beneficiaries every day." Deshmukh said the next batch of vaccines is expected by Friday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/in-pune-over-50-lakh-people-given-at-least-one-dose/articleshow/84249036.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||India||Should limit time for arguments, pages in written submissions: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday said time has come to put in practice allocation of time for each arguing counsel in the courts and limit the number of pages in their written submissions to realise the commoners’ dream of the right of speedy justice. A three-judge bench headed by Justice S K Kaul said this while writing the postscript for the judgment relating to Delhi assembly’s notice to a Facebook official seeking his appearance before its Peace and Harmony Committee. The bench referred to the practice of lawyers competing with each other in elongating their oral arguments and supplementing it by written submissions which are often thicker than the original petitions. The SC said no other constitutional court in any country “allows such time periods to be taken for oral submissions and these be further supplemented by written synopsis thereafter. Instead of restricting oral arguments, it has become a competing arena of who gets to argue for the longest time”. “Delay in judicial proceedings has been the bane of our country and there can’t be a refusal to part ways from old practices especially when they have outlived their purpose. ...it is the need of the hour to write clear and short judgments which the litigant can understand. The Wren & Martin principles of precis writing must be adopted. But how is this to be achieved if the submissions go on for hours on end”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/should-limit-time-for-arguments-pages-in-written-submissions-supreme-court/articleshow/84254644.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

No one was injured in the accident, but the pile-up resulted in a traffic jam on the Mumbai corridor of the expressway. A state highway patrol official in Pune told TOI, “Two cars, a pick-up truck and two trucks were damaged. No one was injured.”The official said an unidentified vehicle went towards Mumbai from Pune around 5.30pm, spilling oil on the expressway. Following some drizzle, the road surface became slippery and the vehicles started skidding. “The five vehicles were damaged after their drivers’ lost control over the wheels,” the officials said. The accident led to the traffic jam situation on the lanes leading to Mumbai for an hour. Police and expressway authorities went to the spot and used soil and foam water to remove the oil from the road surface.The vehicular movement towards Mumbai was restored around 6.30pm after moving the damaged vehicles to the service lanes ahead of the tunnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/five-vehicles-damaged-in-pile-up-after-oil-spill-on-eway/articleshow/84249116.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Mumbai’s daily cases 540; drop not as expected, say officials||MUMBAI: The city’s daily Covid caseload dropped to 540 on Thursday after registering 662 cases on the previous day. The daily toll increased slightly to 13, taking the overall toll to 15,586 so far. The city has so far witnessed over 7.26 lakh cases. The state Covid update for Thursday was delayed due to technical issues and was not issued by the health department till the time of going to press. “We are testing over 30,000 cases every day, and the daily testing rate has been under 1.5% for the last three days. This does indicate that the Covid-19 situation is under control,” said a BMC official. The BMC’s Covid update on Thursday said that 37,802 tests were conducted in the city as compared to 31,994 on July 7 and 30,554 on July 6. The time taken for cases to double in the city has gone up to 858 days, and the rate of recovery touched 96% on Thursday. Even though the cases were on the decline, the state has asked all districts to ensure tests do not drop and share of RT-PCR tests too is consistent. CM Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday said the second wave in the state had not completely ebbed, and it was crucial that citizens follow all guidelines issued by the government, and the administration should ensure there is no crowding and all restrictions are implemented. Officials said even though tests are mostly consistent, the daily detections in Mumbai and the state are not dropping as much as expected. “Cities like Nagpur, Nashik and Pune had all reported a significant surge in cases during the peak, and now most of them have reported a sharper dip than Mumbai. Nagpur is reporting fewer than 100 cases for the last few days,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-citys-daily-cases-540-drop-not-as-expected-say-officials/articleshow/84251448.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra State CID takes over Pardi ‘deemed’ custodial death of challenged man||NAGPUR: The state criminal investigation department (CID) has taken over the deemed custodial death of 40-year-old Manoj Thawkar from city police on Tuesday. Thawkar was physically challenged and visually impaired. Earlier in the day, Thawkar’s postmortem was conducted in-camera by a team of three forensic experts in the presence of judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH). Sources said the postmortem report was inconclusive with the experts ‘reserving their opinions’, referring the case for histo-pathological examination. The preliminary findings only trace some abrasions on his upper right arm and right leg. The city police will now send the footage of the postmortem, along with relevant documents, to the National and State Human Rights Commissions separately, said city police chief Amitesh Kumar, who took the initiative to communicate with the state police headquarters to ensure State CID takes over the case. Thawker was allegedly assaulted by cops at a security checkpoint near Hanuman temple at Pardi, after he tried to flee on his scooter injuring probationer sub-inspector Mukesh Dhoble. This led to an angry confrontation, earning the wrath of the cops deployed at the nakabandi. Three cops, including sub-inspector Dhoble from Pardi police station, were shunted out and attached to control room for a fair probe by city police chief Amitesh Kumar. Two traffic cops from Kamptee division too have been instructed to be shifted elsewhere. Though family members claimed Thawker was never diagnosed with any serious health conditions, like heart problem, to die so abruptly, police said CCTV footage underlines the fact that he collapsed while waiting at the police station without anyone physically manhandling him. “The cops showed us CCTV footage of my elder brother at the police station but we have heard he was thrashed. Some injuries were also seen near his eyes,” said Thawkar’s elder brother Vinod. He said government should consider giving a job to his brother’s wife and compensate the family. Thawkar was pronounced brought dead at a private hospital after collapsing at Pardi police station. Amid furore over allegations that Thawkar was thrashed by cops on bandobast duty, Pardi police registered a case of accidental death. An officer said the CCTV camera at the police station showed Thawkar was seated alone from 6.30pm to 8.30pm without anyone assaulting him. The police sources also said Thawkar had asked for water, after which he collapsed holding his chest. “The officer injured by Thawkar had been dragged for around 200meters but the latter did not stop, which has been captured in CCTV. Two civilians helped the cops chase Thawkar. He probably fell from his scooter in the melee but this is under probe now,” said the senior cop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-cid-takes-over-pardi-deemed-custodial-death-of-challenged-man/articleshow/84251420.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Six deaths in ten accidents in eight days of July||KOLKATA: Seven deaths were reported in the 45-day long period of enhanced restrictions between mid May and June. Yet, there have already been six deaths in as many as 10 accidents recorded in the first eight days of this month when public transport services resumed with the restrictions being eased. Two of these fatal accidents — one involved a bus and the other a truck —saw cops register culpable homicide not amounting to murder cases. “The Red Road accident showed how drivers tend to overlook basic safety measures like breaking speed limits,” said an officer at Lalbazar. Prompted by the sudden rise in accidents, the traffic police have launched special drives on the city’s specific stretches like Red Road, Kidderpore Road, Hastings, AJC Bose Road and CR Avenue along with EM Bypass, using 15 speed guns. In addition, cops are carrying out naka checks for truck drivers at night. Trucks were involved in at least three fatal accidents last week. There will be a special focus on the stretch between Strand Road-Vidyasagar Setu-Kidderpore Road, which witnessed multiple truck accidents. Cops, however, said that their inability to carry out breathalyser tests was hampering effective policing, especially when it comes to checking truck drivers. “We are seeking advice from experts to find an alternative to breathalyser tests after we came to know that both the accused bus driver and the truck driver, who were involved in two accidents on Vidyasagar Setu and Kidderpore Road at night, had been drunk,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/6-deaths-in-10-accidents-in-eight-days-of-july/articleshow/84249089.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Pune||Pune: From paddy to gram, lack of rain ruins sowing across district||PUNE: Just 33% of the kharif sowing has been done in the district since the start of the monsoon. Paddy, green gram, black gram, soybean, groundnut, bajra and maize are among the crops usually sown that have suffered this year because of subdued rainfall activity in the last two weeks. A district agriculture office report said sowing of kharif crops has taken place on 57,825 hectare area till July 5 as against the average area of 1,84,274 hectare across the 13 tehsils. “Subdued rainfall over the last two weeks has affected the sowing,” Dnyaneshwar Bote, district agriculture officer, said . “As per agriculture university recommendation, sowing of black and green gram should take place before July 15. We fear less sowing of gram as the rainfall activity is yet to revive. Overall kharif production may be affected this season,” he said. Average sowing of green and black gram is 13,800 and 1,556 hectare, respectively. So far, green gram is sown on 3,222 hectare and black gram on 514 hectare, the report said. Paddy cultivation has come to a halt in Khed, Maval, Junnar, Ambegaon, Mulshi, Bhor and Velhe. “At some places, paddy plants at nurseries have turned yellow due to less rainfall. In some tehsils, farmers would have to opt for re-sowing of some crops once their areas get rainfall,” Bote added. Pandurang Bhawari, a farmer from Kondwal village in Ambegaon tehsil, said, “Paddy is the main crop here. We started planting, but could not cover the entire farm due to less rainfall. We earn some money by selling ‘pooja items’ at Bhimshankar temple but that is closed for public due to Covid restrictions. So, there is no work in the farms and no income from the side business. We don’t know how to survive. Some farmers might migrate to cities in search of work.” Soybean farmers had a similar predicament. “So far germination is very poor due to less rainfall in our areas. We may have to go for resowing if the situation continues for a few more days,” Sandesh Parkhe, a resident of Aalegaon village in Shirur tehsil, said. Bajra sowing has so far covered 13,714 hectare as against the average 38,760 hectare across the district. Growth of bajra has been badly hit, an official from the agriculture department said. “Only farmers, who have irrigation facility, would get a good harvest of bajra,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/from-paddy-to-gram-lack-of-rain-ruins-sowing-across-dist/articleshow/84249092.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Ultadanga flyover repair nears completion||KOLKATA: Repair work on the single span of the EM Bypass bound flank of Ultadanga flyover is nearing completion as the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) plans to take up post repair load test of the flyover likely within the next few weekends this month. “Presently the crack filling up work is on its last stages and once completed, the repaired surface will be washed and would be given a white coating of paint following which the full design load taking capacity of the flyover will be conducted to check whether the repaired elevated corridor is showing any signs of structural stress or not. Plans are onto take up the load test work in the next weekend or so subject to repair work being fully completed and police permission to shut the flyover for the purpose,” said an official. The authorities recently conducted load test of Chitpore bridge to assess its post repair structural strength. KMDA also plans to repair and surface of the one-way 100 meter long VIP Road to Salt Lake slip bridge by peeling off the existing damaged bituminous surface. The plan is to lay a new concrete surface along with waterproofing to prevent rainwater to sip into the bridge’s surface and damaging it. The bridge is used as a short cut for vehicles to move towards Salt Lake and EM Bypass from VIP Road. Meanwhile KMDA will go for a second call to invite agencies for the proposed EM Bypass to New Town flyover, as the number of agencies who have responded in the first tender call have been found to be insufficient for their technical evaluation. The tender for the proposed six km long four lane flyover was floated on February this year and the last of date of bid submission was subsequently extended till July 7.

---||Pune||Pune: Woman cop lodges extortion complaint against 28-year-old||PUNE: Police on Wednesday booked a man from Beed on the charge of robbery and extorting money from a 28-year-old woman police sub-inspector (PSI). The man had allegedly threatened to display her photographs and videos online after she turned down his marriage proposal in September 2020. The woman also hails from Beed and is currently posted with the Pune police. Deputy commissioner of police (Zone IV) Pankaj Deshmukh said, “The woman PSI and the man, who is unemployed, became close friends after meeting through a common friend in 2018 and decided to get married. But their relationship turned sour when the man started acting possessive and suspecting her fidelity. He would fight with her over trivial issues either in person or over the phone.” Deshmukh said, “The policewoman realised that the man was constantly harassing her and decided to call off their relationship.” The PSI said in her FIR, registered at the Lonikand police station, that though she had decided not to marry the man, he continued to call her relatives and sought their help in finalising the marriage. He even threatened to end his life if his demand was not considered. She alleged that the man offered to pay her money equivalent to her salary for five years, if she left her job for him. When she refused, he snatched her smartphone and threatened to make her photos and videos in his possession viral. He extorted cash of varying amounts from her and continued to demand more money, the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-cop-lodges-extortion-complaint-against-28-yr-old/articleshow/84249155.cms||---

Islampur city police arrested Yogesh Watharkar, who runs the Adhar Health Care hospital at Islampur town. The police have slapped charges under IPC sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery of documents), and 297 (irreverence of dead bodies) against him. The complaint was filed by Salim Hamid Sheikh of Kasegaon village. His 60-year-old mother, Sayra, was admitted to the hospital run on February 24. Salim received his mother's body on March 10 with the discharge certificate mentioning that date. However, when he visited the local health administration to get the death certificate, he found the date mentioned on the certificate as March 8. In his complaint, Salim stated that he was charged Rs 41,289 for the treatment carried out between March 8 and 10, and alleged that the doctor withheld the body despite his mother’s demise two days earlier. Krishnat Pingle, the Islampur deputy superintendent of police, said, “We have arrested the doctor and have received police custody till July 12 for interrogation.” After the complaint was filed, the Islampur police referred the documents to district health authorities who recommended a thorough investigation. The police suspects that the doctor might have indulged in such unethical practices and have appealed to others who may have experienced similar instances to approach them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/doc-held-for-keeping-body-for-2-days-charging-relatives/articleshow/84244563.cms||---

The committee advised both the bidders to revise their bids and place it before the committee again,” said a member of the committee. One of the bidders confirmed to TOI that the committee had indeed asked for revisions to be made during proceedings, but an official communication from the committee was awaited in this regard. The sources said the two bids have been placed by realty firms Mantra Properties and Ashdan Developers, the latter being a consortium led by the developer Solitaire. A third bidder was not considered, since it only wanted to take up a part of DSKDL’s assets. The total bids by each of the parties, including debt owed to various lenders, due homes for homebuyers, and other claims by various parties, are in excess of Rs 800 crore, payable across a period of time. As per the documents made available by the resolution professionals appointed by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), the committee is composed of around a dozen of leading lenders, mainly public sector banks like the State Bank of India, Bank of Maharashtra, IDBI Bank, as well as private banks and non-banking financial companies. Other claimants involve around 770 home buyers and fixed deposit holders, as well as dozens of other unsecured lenders and debenture holders. The resolution process is being handled by Manoj Kumar Agarwal, who is the NCLT-appointed resolution professional.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-bids-placed-before-panel-for-dskdl-resolution/articleshow/84249205.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore residents of CMC Colony protest bid to evict them for flyover work||COIMBATORE: The city corporation’s attempt to evict a section of residents from CMC Colony and clear space to continue Ukkadam flyover work went in vain on Thursday, as residents staged a sit-in against the move. While corporation officials said alternative accommodation was allotted to all the families, residents alleged that some of them were left out from the survey. A source privy to the project said the highways department was in need of 494 cents of corporation land at CMC Colony to construct a loop as a part of the flyover project. “At least 737 families are residing on the land that is to be acquired by the highways department. The Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) had decided to accommodate about 492 families at a housing unit that is proposed to construct at the colony itself and the remaining families in other housing units.” It is to be noted that whenever the TNSCB reconstructs its housing units, it would provide a single-time shifting charge of Rs 8,000 per family for temporary relocation. “To make the relocation easy for the residents, who would otherwise have to hunt for rental houses, the highways department has been constructing temporary shelters for them on the corporation land at Pullukadu. While 247 families would be accommodated there, the remaining families had agreed to stay with their relatives until the completion of the housing unit,” the source said. Explaining that about 70% families had already vacated their houses, the source said the corporation officials visited the colony on Thursday to advise the remaining families to vacate their houses at the earliest, as the flyover work had come to a halt because of the delay in land acquisition. “The residents, however, staged a protest stating some of them were left out from the survey. The officials held talks with them and left the area.” Jothi, a resident of CMC Colony, said 55 families that were in need of temporary shelters were left out from the survey. “The officials had informed us that they would be visiting the colony only to hold talks with us. But on Thursday morning, they removed the doors of a house and asked us to vacate immediately. That’s why we staged the sit-in.” Another resident said they were ready to vacate immediately if all the families were provided alternative accommodation. “In that case, we are ready to extend 100% cooperation to the officials.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/residents-of-cmc-colony-protest-bid-to-evict-them-for-flyover-work/articleshow/84249251.cms||Nivedha Selvam

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Leopard that killed four people trapped in Zawar mines forest region||JAIPUR: A leopard, which allegedly killed four people and injured 14 in the last six months, was captured by the forest department in Zawar mines forest region on Thursday. A massive combing operation with 80 forest staff was initiated after the leopard frequently attacked and became a danger to human life. The male leopard was trapped in a cage that had a goat as the bait. A forest official said, “After examining the pugmarks, we realised that the leopard that killed and injured humans was caught. After seeing the leopard’s pugmarks near the village, the cage was set up to trap the animal. The big cat was shifted to Sajjangarh biological park.” Green activists were elated that the animal was successfully rescued as villagers and their representatives were demanding that the big cat be shot dead. Anil Rogers, who deals with human-leopard conflict situations and wildlife related issues said, “It was observed that one of the canines of the animal was broken, though it’s purely a matter of investigation. History says many leopards and tigers who turned man eaters had similar problems. When they are unable to hunt natural prey, they shift to humans who are easy target for them.” Villagers of Singatwara and Nelatalai also heaved a sigh of relief. Hari Mohan of Singatwara village said, “As the wild cat was on the prowl, we were not able to go to our fields and take cattle out for grazing. This was leading to monetary losses too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/leopard-gthat-killed-4-people-trapped-in-zawar-mines-forest-region/articleshow/84249255.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore corporation axes eight trees in park to construct service reservoir||COIMBATORE: The city corporation workers felled eight trees in a park at Sivaram Nagar near Ramanathapuram on Thursday, sparking protest from activists and residents in the area. The corporation is planning to construct a service reservoir with 24 lakh-litre capacity in the park. As the construction site - 0.1350 square metre - has 23 trees, the corporation had obtained permission from the revenue department to fell them. Environmentalist K Syed said the issue was first brought to their knowledge about two years ago and they raised objections. Subsequently, the issue fizzled out. But around 6am on Thursday, corporation workers started axing the trees even though residents had attempted to stop it, Syed said. By the time he reached the spot and managed to stop the work, eight trees were already chopped off. Most of the 23 trees are decades old, he added. “There are several other reserved sites in the surrounding area. They all remain abandoned. Why shouldn’t the corporation choose one of those sites and leave this site filled with trees. Both the corporation and the revenue officials are to be blamed. The revenue department should not have given permission to chop off the trees,” he added. He said even the highways department, which is carrying out Ukkadam flyover construction work, was considerate and sought assistance to transplant three trees that were located on their construction site at Karumbukadai. But the corporation neither considered the option of transplanting the trees nor heeded to the public request. Seeking the intervention of the district collector in this issue, he said the tree protection committee, which remains defunct, should be revived.  Sasikumar, a resident, said the issue was taken up to the knowledge of the corporation commissioner recently, but nothing changed on the ground. “We are not against the construction of water tank because we also face water shortage during summer season. We just want the development to go in hand with nature.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/corpn-axes-8-trees-in-park-to-construct-service-reservoir/articleshow/84249271.cms||---

He suddenly “seemed to realize that he was short of cash” and said he would withdraw the money from an ATM and come back to pay. Till then, his mother would remain at the shop. That was the last that anyone saw of him. When the man did not return, the shop owner asked the woman about the whereabouts of “her son”. To his shock, the woman said she did not know the man at all. She had simply accepted his offer to give her a lift and was awaiting his return to continue her journey. In a flash, the shop owner knew that he had been duped and immediately summoned police. On questioning the woman, police learnt that her name was Omvati, a resident of Ahmednagar village in Bibinagar Kotwali area of Bulandshahr. She said she was going to Modinagar on Thursday morning, when the man stopped his car and offered to give her a lift. “Before heading for Modinagar, he took me to an electric store which was on our way, and stopped to do some shopping. He told me to wait at the shop as he is coming back with the money,” the woman told policemen. “We were told by the shop owner that when the man didn’t return even after an hour, he asked the woman where her son was? It was then she revealed she was not his mother and had only accepted a lift from the man,” said Vivek Sharma, SHO, Gulawathi Kotwali. He said a case has been registered based on the shop owner’s complaint and further investigation is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/thief-gives-lift-to-woman-uses-her-to-dupe-shop-owner-of-rs-50k-worth-goods/articleshow/84244683.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Chandigarh||Wetlands authority asks UT to discuss sewage issue with Punjab||CHANDIGARH: UT administrator VP Singh Badnore has taken a serious view of untreated sewage flowing from Kansal in Punjab into the forest areas behind Sukhna Lake, which is getting contaminated. In a recent meeting of the Chandigarh Wetlands Authority, Badnore, who is also the chairperson of the body, directed the UT forest and wildlife department to take up the matter with the Punjab government. As per the minutes of the meeting, “There is no treatment plant for the sewage of Nayagaon and Kansal village of Punjab and it is entering the forest area of Chandigarh between Rock Garden and Sukhna Lake, thereby damaging the local ecology of the forest area and contaminating the Sukhna as well. UT has taken up the matter several times with Punjab to construct a sewage treatment plant (STP) so that the waste is not diverted to the forest area of UT…However, no concrete action has been taken on the ground.” Despite repeated reminders from the Chandigarh administration, the governments of neighbouring Punjab and Haryana have failed to stop sewage flowing from their territories into the forest areas. The critical issue pertains to sewage flowing from Nayagaon and Kansal villages of Punjab and Saketri and Madadevpur villages of Haryana, and damaging flora and fauna. To deal with the dirty water of Kansal and Nayagoan, the administration had recently chalked out a proposal to construct a new sewage treatment plant at Kishangarh. In February last year, the UT administration had taken up the matter with the Punjab and Haryana governments during a meeting of the apex committee for coordination of Tricity, besides a letter was also sent to both the states in 2019. In the letter written to the additional chief secretary, forests and environment, principal secretary, urban local bodies, Punjab, the UT chief conservator of forests had stated, “There is no sewage treatment plant (STP) for the sewage of Nayagaon and Kansal…The administration has intimated several times to construct and operationalise STPs for all such sewages so that there is no discharge in the UT forest area.” In a letter to the Haryana government too, the chief conservator of forests had asked for a stoppage of discharge of untreated water. However, no action has been taken by the authorities concerned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/wetlands-authority-asks-ut-to-discuss-sewage-issue-with-pb/articleshow/84249287.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

An investigation officer said the woman, Gangadevi, wife of Srinivasan, was in a relationship with 41-year-old V Muthupandi, a native of Madurai, for the past couple of months. The officer said Muthupandi, who was working in a private firm in Chennai, had separated from his wife and two children two years ago. “He befriended Gangadevi on Facebook in December last year and they developed an extramarital relationship. The duo planned to elope and staged a drama. On Tuesday night, Gangadevi handed over her gold ornaments weighing 19 sovereigns to Muthupandi, who tied her legs and hands using her sari and gagged her, as per her plans, at her beauty parlour,” the officer said quoting her lover. When Gangadevi didn’t return home from the beauty parlour on Tuesday night, the officer said, her husband had gone there to check on her, but only to find her tied down to the floor. “He freed her and when inquired she said she was raped by three guest workers, who made away with her gold ornaments. She requested him not to approach police, stating that would bring her disgrace,” the officer said. Srinivasan, however, consoled his wife and took her to Karumathampatti police station on Wednesday morning. He narrated the entire incident to police officers, who sought a written complaint from the couple, while sending a team to the beauty parlour area to collect footages from CCTV cameras in that locality. “The couple left the station by promising to return with a written compliant. Within a few hours, Gangadevi hanged to death at their house in the abscence of her husband,” the officer said. Subsequently, deputy inspector general of police Muthusamy, superintendent of police S Selvanagarathinam and other police officials held inquiry with Srinivasan. Police registered a case under Section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Code and Section 392 of the Indian Penal Code, and collected the call details of Gangadevi. “We found she used to speak to her daughter and one Muthupandi often. We traced Muthupandi’s whereabouts to Udhagamandalam in Nilgiris district and brought him to Karumathampatti police station,” the officer said. During inquiry, the officer said, Muthupandi confessed their relationship and the drama they staged to elope. “When her husband approached us, Gangadevi was afraid that he would come to know about her relationship. So, she ended her life.” Police have booked Muthupandi under sections 497 (adultery), 498 (enticing or taking away or detaining with criminal intent a married woman), 380 (theft in dwelling house, etc.) and 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code. “We have recovered the woman’s gold ornaments from him. He is remanded in judicial custody,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/police-uncover-love-affair-drama-to-elope-that-forced-woman-to-end-life/articleshow/84249304.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Doctors intensify demand for separate cadre||JAIPUR: Just like Rajasthan Administrative Services (RAS) and Rajasthan Police Services (RPS), doctors have intensified their demand for a separate cadre — Rajasthan Medical Services (RMS). Though they had been demanding a separate cadre for the last 10 years, doctors have started exerting pressure in the wake of first and second Covid wave. “We have been demanding a separate cadre for the past 10 years since 2011. The ministers and doctors had signed an agreement in 2011 in which a separate cadre for doctors was one of the points. The government had agreed to it. A similar agreement on a separate cadre was agreed upon in 2017, but the government was yet to form a separate cadre for doctors,”said Dr Ajay Chaudhary, who was one of the leaders during 2011 agitation of doctors. He said in the wake of the Covid pandemic, doctors are again peacefully demanding implementation of the agreement. The separate cadre is meant for resolving various issues including promotions and postings. “Since we do not have a separate cadre, even senior doctors are posted in community health centres. Also, a separate cadre will ensure selection for promotions for the higher posts on the basis of seniority-cum-merit basis,” said Dr Laxman Singh Ola, a representative of doctors who is taking up the demand with the state government for a separate cadre. On Doctors’ Day, health minister Raghu Sharma said, “The demand of doctors for a separate cadre as per the agreements in 2011 and 2017 is pending. A cadre committee had presented a proposal to the state government in June. The proposal will be examined and decision on it will be taken soon for its implementation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/doctors-intensify-demand-for-separate-cadre/articleshow/84249305.cms||---

The high court has now fixed August 5 as the next date of hearing of the main petition filed by the union. In it, the union has challenged the administration and the Centre’s order of privatisation of UT electricity department. The petitioners submitted, “The respondents (the Union government and the UT administration) are proceeding at an extraordinary hurriedness for finalization of the privatization. In case the matter is not heard in July itself, the respondents will succeed in their mala fide intentions of privatisation of UT electricity department, when continuously for last many years, it is having huge revenue surplus.” The HC on May 28 had stayed the power privatisation process on the application filed by Gopal Dutt Joshi, general secretary of UT powermen union. Thereafter, the UT administration had moved the Supreme Court and challenged the HC’s order. The apex court had stayed the HC’s order on June 28. After SC’s relief, the UT had re-started the process, with the UT adviser Dharam Pal meeting power ministry officials in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/union-seeks-early-hearing-hc-to-take-up-case-on-aug-5/articleshow/84249306.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Ahmedabad||‘Can’t declare runner-up elected after winner dies’||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Thursday rejected the petition filed by the runner-up in a taluka panchayat election, who demanded she be declared elected after the winner died one day before the counting of votes. The HC ruled that the election commission should hold a byelection.The case pertains to the taluka panchayat election for the Pimpan electoral division of Sanand taluka in Ahmedabad district. Voting took place on February 28 and counting was on March 2. Lila Thakor, an independent candidate, secured 2,163 votes and Sonalba Vaghela came second with 1,409 votes. On March 8, Thakore’s election certificate was issued. Unfortunately, Thakore had died on March 1, one day before the counting of votes. Vaghela moved the HC and insisted that a dead person cannot be declared the winner and she should be declared elected.The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice Vaibhavi Nanavati rejected Vaghela’s demand and observed, “We are dealing with an important facet of democratic activity. The rules have to be interpreted in a pragmatic and practical manner, consistent with the larger objective and actual difficulties faced in the conduct of elections.” The court said the runner-up cannot be declared the winner, and the only option with the State Election Commission is to hold a byelection.After discussing the laws, the judges quoted a legal opinion of a US Attorney General in a situation where the highest vote getter passed away or was disqualified. The case involved the application of either the ‘American’ rule or the ‘English’ rule, on whether votes cast in favour of such a candidate can be counted. The HC opined that the ‘American’ rule takes care of the present case, “where on the date of polling itself the candidate is dead but the name of such candidate figures on the ballot paper and people still voted for such a candidate. Here is a case where Lila Thakore was alive on the date of voting, and in such circumstances, the only option now is a byelection.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cant-declare-runner-up-elected-after-winner-dies/articleshow/84249358.cms||---

---||Jaipur||At least 10% mucormycosis cases requiring revision surgeries due to it recurrence||JAIPUR: For some mucormycosis patients, their battle for life is likely to be prolonged as they might need revision surgeries due to reccurrence of black fungus. The reason for it is that despite doctors removing the fungus from the affected part, there are chances that mucormycosis might penetrate the blood vessels and increase chances of reccurrence. Also in some cases, due to conservation approach to save an eye from being removed, mucromycosis may recur requiring revision surgeries. According to Sawai Man Singh Hospital, at least 10% of the mucromycosis patients require revision surgeries. Out of more than 400 surgeries conducted on mucormycosis patients, 40 have undergone revision surgeries. “Mucormycosis infections are characterised by extensive angioinvasion. The fungus enters blood vessels by penetrating it. Doctors scoop out the visible fungus from the infected parts, but in case of angioinvasion, the fungus might recur and require revision surgery,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College. The SMS Medical College has formed a board of 16 doctors of different specialties for mucormycosis. The board is helping patients in treatment. Dr Pawan Singhal, professor (ENT) SMS Hospital, who is one of the doctors performing surgeries for removing mucormycosis said, “We have been reporting cases of recurrence of mucormycosis in some cases due to certain reasons. Inadequate treatment with antifungal drugs followed by surgery may also help the mucormycosis to recur. The patients with decreased immunity, uncontrolled diabetes and thromboembolic phenomenon are risk factors of recurrence of mucormycosis.” SMS Medical College is also conducting a study to find out the actual cause of mucormycosis in Covid patients. Since the second wave was more aggressive, a rise in thromboembolism phenomenon and blood clots were witnessed in Covid patients, the SMS Hospital’s research board suspects. In collaboration with pathology department, the board will conduct tissue biopsy of the mucormycosis patients to find if blood clots due to Delta variant is causing mucormycosis. The result of the study is awaited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/at-least-10-mucormycosis-cases-requiring-revision-surgeries-due-to-it-recurrence/articleshow/84249328.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

They yatra that began from Saharanpur a week ago entered Meerut after covering Muzaffarnagar, Shamli and Bijnor and will “stay on the road in this sweltering heat with the slogan ‘jaati todo, samaj jodo’ (break casteism, unite society) until the whole state is covered”. Speaking with TOI, Azad said, “The message – ‘jaati todo, samaj jodo’ – is of paramount importance that needs to be ingrained in the minds of people as BJP will stop at nothing to attack caste and religious harmony for political gains in the assembly polls next year.” On the allegations that he’s a covert BJP man to fragment Dalit and opposition votes, he retorted, “It is the opposition which has surrendered completely in UP. Haven't you seen the walkover it gave to BJP in the recently held district panchayat president polls? The BSP announced that they won’t contest after the last date of withdrawal of nominations for the post, so that the BJP could easily poach them. These allegations will not hamper our spirit.” Azad feels that his political party never got the time to build its image ever since it came into existence in March 2020, due to the outbreak of Covid 19 but he’s buoyed by its performance and thinks it’s time to hit the road. “ASP came into existence in March 2020 and Covid-19 struck soon afterwards. And even then, the only seat out of seven we fought in UP bypolls in Bulandshahr in November last year, we polled 13,500 votes and came third. Now, in the absence of opposition, we will tell people on the ground how under the BJP regime, everyone – from farmers to students, from housewives to youths – has suffered. There are no jobs, no revision of SAP for cane for the last so many years and continuous escalation in the prices of fuel. There is despondency in every sector. Then there are rapes, murders, subjugation of the downtrodden, Dalits. All this needs to be explained to the voter and we are doing that,” Azad said. On his tactical shift from ‘the Great Chamaar’ image to adopting BSP’s social engineering formula, Chandrashekhar said, “I am following the path of Kanshi Ram and the philosophy of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar which promotes the upliftment of one and all irrespective of caste, colour or creed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/opp-gave-walkover-to-bjp-in-recent-rural-polls-in-up-bhim-army-chief/articleshow/84244713.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||India||New rules usher in era of surveillance, fear: PTI||NEW DELHI: The Press Trust of India has challenged the constitutional validity of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, arguing that the government has introduced “vague conditions” such as ‘good taste’, ‘decency’, and prohibition of ‘half-truths’, which are not clearly defined within the framework of the IT Act, 2000. Perceived non-compliance to the rules or their non-implementation, PTI has added in its petition, will lead to “draconian consequences”, including blocking, modification and deletion of content, compulsory publication of apology, which may be ordered and enforced by the executive (the Centre). “The Impugned Rules usher in an era of surveillance and fear, thereby resulting in self-censorship, which results in abridgment/violation of fundamental rights as enshrined under Part III of the Constitution of India,” the premier news agency’s petition said. Joining a string of news organisations, including the Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA), in challenging the Digital Media Rules, PTI pointed out that the IT Act, 2000, does not, in fact, cover a physical newspaper in the paper format and its exact replica online edition under the Rules. “However, all editions and publications of ‘news and current affairs’ in the digital form (even if done by a media group which brings out physical newspapers) will be covered by the rules as ‘digital media’ and treated as a digital news portal. Significantly, none of these definitions are found in the IT Act and are all brought in by the IT Rules, 2021 with the express purpose of regulating their content,” PTI has argued. Wasim Beg, partner at Luthra and Luthra Law Offices, told TOI that while challenges moved by DNPA and PTI have much the same issues at heart, the news agency’s petition is more specifically focused on Part II of the Digital Media Rules, which the petition says are “antithetical to fundamental rights. Arguing that this portion of the rules is violative of freedom of speech, PTI’s plea said the rules vested private intermediaries with “excessive power in shaping the disclosure of free speech in the country”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/new-rules-usher-in-era-of-surveillance-fear-pti/articleshow/84254733.cms||---

Sawant also reviewed various infrastructural projects in Vasco and Mormugao constituencies. He told reporters, “This project will be one of the best in the state. When we speak of Pernem and Canacona, along with the Manohar Parrikar Canacona bypass, the Varunapuri to Sada highway will also be counted.” Sawant said the project begun in October 2015 but work had slowed down because of issues and these are being sorted out. The project is worth Rs500 crore and is taken up by National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) and the public works department (PWD). The project will help reduce traffic in the main Vasco city since the direct road from Varunapuri to Sada will route vehicular traffic out from the main city areas directly via the highway. Gammon India, vice president, Anant Kadiwal briefed the chief minister of the completed work of major sections under the project as well as bottlenecks affecting its completion. Sawant also reviewed various projects with heads of various departments like water resources department (WRD), PWD, electricity, fisheries, etc. He said, “Vasco has no water shortage problems but there is an issue with the electricity department. Instructions have been given and the work of underground cabling which is pending at Baina will be completed.” Sawant said that the Vasco MLA Carlos Almeida has identified a place for construction of the Mormugao municipality and one more school, and work will begin on the plan. Almeida said , “Many people have died in Vasco due to accidents. This highway will get us much-needed relief. The Varunapuri to Sada highway was also a dream project of late chief minister Manohar Parrikar.” He added that he has also discussed blue flag certification for Baina beach with amenities like park, toilets, etc. He added, “We are not against anybody. We want Baina to be like Calangute and Baga. We will take the fishermen into confidence.” Sawant also said the much-awaited project of KTC bus stand will be tendered in September. The project scope has increased and will be completed in three phases which includes a bus stand and an administrative building. Almeida said, “We need to work together, the councillors, MLA and the chief minister if we want works to be done. Otherwise it’s impossible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-varunapuri-sada-flyover-will-be-completed-by-liberation-day/articleshow/84251694.cms||---

During the inauguration programme, Fadnavis said, “Rise in number of private vehicles is one of the major reasons behind rise in air pollution. Hence, there is a need to have a strong public transport system with eco-friendly buses to reduce pollution,” he said. Initially, the NMC will launch 50 buses on nine different routes. Speaking on the occasion municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav urged Fadnavis to get involved in getting approval from the central government for its approval for procurement of 50 electric buses. In response, Fadnavis said he will immediately approach the Union urban development minister in this regard. Meanwhile, Bhujbal cautioned the NMC that by introducing this service the civic body would have to bear additional expenses and it will have to plan accordingly. “Nashik is known for its pleasant climate. Hence, my focus is on promoting Nashik as an educational hub, tourism destination and boost food processing industries here,” Bhujbal said, adding that he will also make efforts to boost the Nashik metro project. Along with the city bus service, Bhujbal and Fadnavis also launched the logo of the city bus project, mobile application and its website. City residents will be able to book their tickets online through the mobile application along with checking the live location of the buses, the nearest bus stop and time table. The NMC has deployed two private firms to operate the city bus service on procuring, operating, maintaining and managing basis, and will pay the firms on per km basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-city-bus-service-starts-with-50-vehicles-on-9-routes/articleshow/84249375.cms||Tushar Pawar

Manisha Patil, a vaccine beneficiary at KMC’s Firangai Hospital, said, “When we came on Wednesday, we were asked to come at 6am on Thursday to take a token for the vaccine. We took the token early in the morning and waited in the queue for around two hours on Thursday. I finally got my second dose after a gap of 98 days. There was so much rush at the vaccine centre that chances of contracting the infection here were more.” KMC deputy commissioner Shilpa Darekar said, “People are panicking and arguing with the staff saying that they had received a vaccine appointment message. They need to understand that the auto-generated message is received by everyone who has completed 84 days since the first dose. Due to the short supply of vaccines, we have started the token system to at some places to control the crowd. At some places, a prior list of vaccine beneficiaries is prepared and people are called accordingly. In the city area, 27,263 people are awaiting their second dose, but we have received only 7,000 vaccine doses. We will be getting more doses soon and everyone will get their jabs.” Dr Farukh Desai, the nodal officer for vaccination in the district, said, “On Thursday, 9,339 beneficiaries got their second Covishield dose and 1,324 got the first dose.

---||Delhi||Cashless toll causes jam sessions at Delhi border points||NEW DELHI: Soon after the toll concessionaire started implementing the south corporation’s direction to deduct toll fees only online, confusion and huge traffic jams were reported at the border points on Wednesday. The situation went out of control at certain toll plazas as non-commercial vehicles also got stuck in long queues, forcing Delhi Police to intervene. “The long wait resulted into arguments at places such as the Rajokri toll plaza. Seeing the situation, collectors gave certain relaxations on online collection and even accepted cash to avoid jams on Thursday,” an official of South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) said. However, the collectors have been asked to follow the norms and SDMC officials will go on surprise visits to the toll plazas on Friday to ensure that no relaxation is given to defaulters, said the official. Action will also have to be taken against those resisting to get RFID tags installed. In June, SDMC announced that the work for installing the RFID system for toll collection had been completed at all 124 points in Delhi and no vehicle without tag or online recharge would be allowed into the capital from July 1. The order was finally implemented on Wednesday, except for at 11 toll points due to the farmers’ protests. The RFID tag, the official said, was introduced a long time ago and repeated efforts have ben made to implement it. “The tags can be recharged online even at the toll plazas, still commercial vehicles are not supporting the initiative.” Many commercial vehicle owners/drivers create ruckus at the toll plazas or take time in recharging, leading to jams, the official said. To avoid such situations, SDMC had asked Commission for Air Quality Management in the capital to let the corporation double toll fees for the defaulters, but the panel said it had no such power, the official added. Taxi and truck operators, however, claimed the system didn’t function properly due to weak signals at the toll plazas and deducted the environmental compensation charge (ECC) even from essential goods vehicles. An SDMC official said the excess ECC amount was being refunded immediately. According to Sanjay Samrat, president of Delhi Taxi, Tourist Transport Association, “There are many incidents when sensors are not working at toll plazas and we had to automatically pay the amount in cash. Why not SDMC do random checks on these toll collectors and fine them if their system doesn’t work properly?” He added, “Ideally they should connect the RFID tag to our personal accounts and the amount should be deducted directly from that.” After receiving complaints from several taxi operators, the unions had met SDMC mayor Mukesh Suryan on June 30 and submitted a petition to extend the date for making RFID tag mandatory till September-end and resolve the errors in the system. “Unlike past when a slip was issued for the cash payment, now we are not even receiving an SMS once the amount is deducted,” said another taxi operator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cashless-toll-causes-jam-sessions/articleshow/84249460.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Mumbai||NMC proposes Ayush internship post-MBBS||MUMBAI: MBBS students will soon have to undergo internship training in Ayush, along with their other postings. A draft regulation for Compulsory Rotating Internship, 2021, released by the National Medical Commission (NMC), has mentioned that a week’s training should be included in the rotational schedule in any of the Indian systems of medicine—as an elective. In a welcome move, a week’s training each in any two superspecialty disciplines, including cardiology, nephrology, pulmonary medicine, and medical oncology, has also been included in the internship for MBBS students. Of the 17 postings that MBBS students have to complete in rotation over a period of 12 months after graduation, 14 are mandatory while three are electives. The training in superspecialty disciplines and the Indian systems of medicine are among the electives. For Ayush, the NMC has said interns can choose any elective from ayurveda, yoga, unani, homeopathy and siddha sowa rigpa. Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative, said internships are usually done in students’ own specialty. “This (the new rules on internship) will reduce students’ time spent in specialties they are expected to be trained in,” Shenoy said. A senior doctor from a civic hospital said there is no point in persuading students to do this half-heartedly. “They should be aware of AYUSH, but we hope the training will be on awareness only. There was, perhaps, no need to include it explicitly in the regulations,” the doctor said. On the other hand, including superspecialty training in MBBS internship will give better exposure, said an intern from a government hospital. The NMC has also recommended that students complete their internship from the same institute they graduate from, leaving no scope for transfers. Currently, many students prefer seeking transfer from private colleges to government ones for better clinical exposure. They also seek transfers to hospitals in their hometown. Shenoy said students usually prefer to intern in their home cities. Among other changes, medical interns will have to maintain a record of their work in a logbook, which is to be verified and certified by the reporting medical officer. For the first time, the NMC has also spelt out the certifiable procedural skills in each discipline, which must be recorded in the intern’s logbook. Dr Avinash Supe, former dean of KEM Hospital, said including certifiable competency skills in the internship regulation is a welcome move. “Students are expected to learn these skills and document their training, as per the new guidelines. This will ensure that they are not only learning these skills, but are practically competent too,” said Dr Supe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/nmc-proposes-ayush-internship-post-mbbs/articleshow/84283203.cms||Yogita Rao

These were in a bad shape and in some, floors were covered with more than one-foot layer of bird droppings. On June 4, Garg, along with the chief engineer, inspected some of the residential and commercial properties included in the e-tender that were lying vacant for the past 30 to 40 years. Highly disappointed, the CEO said in his note, “There were lots of shrubs and well-grown trees on the roofs of some of the markets. It seems the routine seasonal exercise of cleaning has not been taken up for the past many years, which might have damaged these vacant properties. The rolling shutters of most of the shops could not be opened because these were either damaged due to heavy corrosion or got jammed because of non-operation for decades.” The note stated, “Windowpanes were broken and floors of many houses were covered with heavy layers (at some places more than one feet) of birds droppings and it was difficult to enter the houses. The verbal explanation for the observations given by the officers was that any expenditure on maintenance of these properties would have attracted audit objections because the CHB was unable to get any response in the bidding process. Such an explanation is not acceptable because poor maintenance might be one of the reasons for not getting any response in bidding. This approach has further damaged the properties, resulting in more financial loss to the Chandigarh Housing Board. This approach seems to be clearly against the principle of propriety. A separate view will be taken for appropriate action against the officers concerned, including their supervisory authorities.” After this exercise, the board identified 33 new properties, including residential and commercial, which will be included in the coming auctions. The identifying of vacant and dispute-free CHB properties was recently started after the directions of Garg. The 33 properties include four commercial (leasehold), 15 residential (leasehold) and 14 residential (freehold). Garg has ordered that the reserve price of these properties be fixed by a committee constituted under the chairmanship of the CHB chief engineer. It was also directed that cleaning, whitewash and repair be carried out in accordance with the rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/floors-of-vacant-chb-houses-have-layers-of-bird-droppings-finds-ceo/articleshow/84249370.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Chandigarh||Smart performance gets Chandigarh Rs 46.5 crore boost from Centre||CHANDIGARH: Ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA), Government of India, has released Rs 46.50 crore to Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL). The ministry releases the amount based on performance on works being done under Smart City Projects by various cities. The ministry recently recognised Chandigarh as the best smart city among UTs for its performance under the ambitious project of the Central government. The amount is the revenue share of the Central government to CSCL to carry out projects and their subsequent performance. From time to time, The Central government monitors functioning of works of declared smart cities across the country and releases the amount based on their performance, works initiated on ground and their progress. The amount from the Central government has come after around five years. The first grant of around Rs 196 crore was received in 2016-2017 financial year, right after Chandigarh was declared Smart City by MoHUA. After that, the ministry released another grant to CSCL. The Chandigarh administration also released a Rs 200 crore grant to CSCL in financial years 2017-18 and 2018-19. Earlier, CSCL received around Rs 396 crore grant from both the Central government and Chandigarh administration and with Rs 46.50 crore more, CSCL got a total of Rs 442.50 crore. As per records, CSCL has spent around Rs 309 crore on its project till date and out of total of 38 planned works, 30 are in progress. Many works have been allotted and work on the ground has started. Some of the works are on paper and are expected to start soon. Since Rs 1,000 crore is to be spent on smart city-related projects in the city, Rs 500 crore will be given by the Central government, while the remaining 500 crore will come from Chandigarh administration. Bifurcation of the amount was already decided during declaration of the city under the smart city project in the first term of the BJP government in the centre. MC commissioner-cum-CEO of CSCL KK Yadav said, “As work on many smart city projects has started and we have utilised the fund judiciously, the Central government has released the grant. All the officers concerned have been directed to ensure the pace of the ongoing works is maintained.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/your-smart-city-gets-rs-46-50-crore-boost/articleshow/84249348.cms||Deepak Yadav

---||Chennai||When the govt threatens to curtail freedom of celluloid||By R S Raveendhren & Alifiyah ShabbirIn a rare instance of unity among members of tinsel town, the Indian film industry has come together to voice its concerns over the proposed amendment to the Indian Cinematograph Act of 1952. The amendment proposes to confer the Union government with the power to review a film’s certification by the Censor Board, including the power to reverse the board’s decision. The chief minister of Tamil Nadu has also written to the Union government saying the move smacks of an attempt to encroach upon federal power.The need to control the medium of cinema could be attributed to its power. Cinema in India can also be called the ‘second cradle of democracy’. Closer scrutiny of the political history of India will reveal the role it has played in nation-building right from its pre-independence days. Cinema has helped propagate political ideas, generate reformative policies and disseminate radical thoughts aiding in the transformation of society.To control legal censorship for public exhibition of films, the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) was constituted under the Cinematograph Act. Censorship has always been a thorn in the flesh of free speech and expression since colonial times. A play titled ‘Nil Darpan’ that was produced by Dinabandhu Mitra and staged by the Calcutta National Theatrical Society in 1872 exposed the plight of the Bengal farmers at the hands of the British Indigo plantation owners. It significantly led to the enactment of the Dramatic Performances Act, 1876, giving the British power to prohibit any play in the public space that was likely to incite feelings of disaffection for the government.In the post-independence era, the government has also attempted to arrogate to itself similar powers to meddle with the decisions of the Censor Board. The move was successfully thwarted by the Supreme Court in the case of Union of India vs K M Shankarappa. On the face of it, the proposed amendment may well be an attempt to circumvent the above judgment of the apex court. The Censor Board, itself, has in the past come under heat for banning films or not awarding them U certification. And is seen as a body that has tried to curtail freedom of filmmakers. In addition, the said amendment will empower the Union government, on receipt of any public complaint/grievance or protest, to direct the Censor Board to re-examine the film. In the hindsight, even the recent abolition of CBFC appellate tribunal appears to be a move that was thought out with plans to introduce the contentious proposal. What this means is that even an orchestrated protest by a few hundred people with an agenda can be pushed to review the censor board’s decision. This can amount to legislative overreach since it will negate the board’s decision itself. The move will severely cripple and compromise the independent and impartial working of the board. This is an especially dangerous situation given that there have been a number of instances of motivated tension when films have touched upon faith, history, superstitions, sexual orientation, politics and cultural practices.The inherent danger of accepting the amendment is that self-styled champions of morality and political correctness will conveniently transform it into an opportunistic veto power. The question is whether freedom of expression is subservient to the subjective satisfaction of the state? Can the provision not snowball into a potential roadblock to the freedom of thought, speech and expression?Article 19 of the Universal Human Rights Declaration and the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights confers the right to freedom of expression and ideas through any form of media regardless of frontiers. In India, the right to freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a). There are "reasonable restrictions" listed under Article 19(2) of the Constitution, but it is universally agreed that such restrictions are to be imposed with great care and caution.In K A Abbas vs. Union of India, the Supreme Court had held that the standards that we set for our censorship must make a substantial allowance in favour of freedom leaving a vast area for creative arts to interpret life and society with some of its foibles along with what is good.The unending obsession for exercising control and the legislative overreach to delegitimise any unfavourable expression or thought does not augur well for democracy. The proposed move is an attempt to address a lacuna that does not even exist.It is true that the mere fear of abuse of the proposed provision cannot be a good ground to question the motive behind it. Yet, its uncanny similarity with the provision from colonial times creates valid apprehension about it in the minds of people.The Union government must remember what the founding father of the US, Benjamin Franklin, once said, " When men differ in opinions, both sides ought equally to have the advantage of being heard by the public."(The authors are advocates at Madras high court)Email your feedback with name and address to southpole.toi@timesgroup.com||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/when-the-govt-threatens-to-curtail-freedom-of-celluloid/articleshow/84249409.cms||---
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Heat pushes up body temperature, hundreds of varsity examinees 'fail' Covid gun test||MEERUT: A tad late for the exam, Anshu Kumari raced through the road leading to her college. Then she ran, till the imposing building was in sight. As she reached the college gate, profusely sweating and panting, a guard pointed a temperature gun at her forehead and asked her to step aside. The machine recorded her temperature at 103 °F. She was not alone. Like her, scores of other students were standing outside. And inside, the administration of the city’s Raghunath Girls Post Graduate College was brainstorming on ways to conduct the exam as Covid-19 norms don’t allow people with high temperatures to sit together. Then they came out and asked everyone to stand under the shade of trees and “cool down” for a while. The trick worked. With mercury soaring past 41 degrees Celsius, Thursday was one of the hottest days in the city. It had to raise temperatures. The college’s principal, professor Deepshikha Sharma, told TOI, “We asked students to calm down, sit in front of coolers or under trees and relax a bit. It worked and we allowed them to sit for the exam.” Like the girl’s college, chaos prevailed in several other institutions which were holding the university exam. Principal of Digambar Jain Degree College in Baraut, Virendra Singh, said, “We got very few students on day one. Just 86 were there in the first shift and 53 in second. As they had high temperatures, we made them sit in different rooms for a while. The exam went off peacefully. Heat played havoc with our preparations." Dr Archana Singh from DAV College in Bulandshahr, who was the government invigilator in the city's MS Institute, also said that students’ body temperatures were a matter of concern at the centre. “It wasn’t a great idea to conduct exams in such heat. But as the session is already late, authorities had no other option. But, yes, some chaos prevailed as students landed up with high temperatures, more than 100°F,” said Singh. Registrar of Chaudhary Charan Singh University, who is also the exam controller, told TOI the exam went off peacefully. “Even if the body temperatures were high, it was due to the weather. As per our report, exams were held on time and peacefully,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/heat-pushes-up-body-temp-hundreds-of-varsity-examinees-fail-covid-gun-test/articleshow/84244803.cms||Ishita Mishra

June, however, saw the number of deaths come down considerably. April saw 5,120 fatalities, the highest in a single month since 2,663 deaths in November 2020. May, however, saw 8,090 deaths. Compared with around 171 deaths every day on average in April, the figure went up to 262 in May. Delhi’s fourth wave being the deadliest was reflected in the figures. From the first recorded fatality on March 13, 2020, it t00ook 191 days for the toll to breach the 5,000-mark on September 21, 2020 and another 84 days to cross the grim milestone of 10,000 on December 13 last year. It took 135 days to reach the 15,000-mark on April 27 this year. However, the figure took only 14 days from 15,000 to reach 20,000, with every 500th fatality being added every day or two between April 18 and May 11. For the toll to reach 25,000 from 20,000, it took 56 days. In fact, out of these 5,000 deaths, more than 4,000 occurred in May itself and less than 1,000 fatalities were recorded in the next five weeks across June and July. While June saw 740 fatalities with 24.6 deaths every day on average, the figure in the month of July came down to four. The first week of the month, till July 7, recorded 28 deaths. March 2020 saw two fatalities, which increased to 57 in April and 414 in May. It was in June 2020 that Delhi battled its first Covid wave and the number spiked to 2,269. After that, the month of July recorded 1,221 fatalities and the number further went down to 481 in August. However, during Delhi’s second Covid-19 wave in September 2020, the number again increased to 917 and further to 1,150 in October. It peaked at 2,663 in November, when Delhi saw its third wave. The number of deaths since December 2020 remained on the lower side and dipped to 57 in February 2021, the lowest since April last year. The number almost doubled to 117 in March this year, but grew exponentially as cases and positivity rate witnessed a massive surge in the months of April and May. The two months accounted for more than 13,000 (53%) of all deaths till date. The 8,090 fatalities in May alone are 32.3% of all deaths in Delhi till date. While the number of cases reached an all-time high of 25,986 on April 28, May 3 saw the highest number of fatalities in a single day at 448. While cases dipped below the 10,000-mark from May 14, fatalities remained mostly above 200 every day till mid-June and above 100 till the end of the month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-third-of-all-covid-deaths-in-may-numbers-come-down-90-in-june/articleshow/84251674.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The public health department has begun the preparations to enumerate the people with comorbidities in rural areas and municipalities. An official said the national communicable disease department’s plan was to take up the enumeration with the help of village health nurses and block medical staff in each locality. “They will go door-to-door to survey the number of people in each house, those with comorbidities and their age.” Dr Senthilkumar, deputy director of public health, said the drive would probably start by next week. The health department said they were already having a list of people with comorbidities in rural areas that was prepared before the pandemic. “We will use the drive to update the list and add people, if required. So, the process should be completed in two to three weeks,” the official said. The city corporation had begun the enumeration drive earlier this week with the team of volunteers, who were recruited earlier for the door-to-door survey to identify people with influenza-like illness. Dr S Raja, city health officer, said, “They will enter the data on their android mobile phones. It is a survey form that must be filled with details like the names of family members, sex, age with comorbidity, type of comorbidity, from where they procure medications, whether they were infected by Covid-19 or not, and if they were vaccinated or not.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/health-dept-to-make-list-of-people-in-rural-areas-with-comorbidities-soon/articleshow/84249413.cms||---

Without showing a single instance of misusing that position, or influencing any witness, making baseless allegations of misuse of power is unfair, he said in an affidavit filed before the CBI court in Hyderabad. He was urging the court to dismiss the petition filed by YSRCP dissident MP K Raghu Ramakrishna Raju seeking cancellation of the bail granted to him in the quid pro quo (QPQ) case. Though the principal special judge was supposed to hear the case, the virtual hearing could not be held due to technical glitches. As both parties filed their written submissions on Thursday, the judge adjourned the case to July 14. The CBI preferred to remain non-committal in the episode and conveyed the same to the court urging it to adjudicate the issue on merits. Raju in his written submissions said that scores of accused in the quid pro quo case are being given important positions of power and this will serve as a warning to the listed witnesses in the case. He also said that most of the witnesses were working in the offices headed by several accused. Raju also wanted the court to send Jagan to judicial custody to ensure a speedy trial in the case. Reiterating his primary objection to Raju’s plea, Jagan said that the Supreme Court said that aggrieved parties can approach the court seeking cancellation of bail of the accused. But in the case on hand, Raju does not qualify to be defined as an aggrieved person, nor did he show any circumstances that warrant the courts to act, he said. Since we are seeking his summary expulsion from Parliament by way of a disqualification, he was trying to retaliate, and unfortunately, he was using the judiciary as a platform to do so, Jagan said in his affidavit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/constitutional-post-no-ground-for-cancelling-bail-jagan-to-hc/articleshow/84249436.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The protest started from Sardar Vallabhai Patel statue in the city and went on till Aurangabad revenue divisional commissioner’s office where the office-bearers submitted a written representation. Crediting the central government for unprecedented rise in fuel prices and LPG, the Congress workers stated this is directly making transportation costly and adding up to the basic price of all the goods including vegetables, pulses reaching the commoners. The office bearers also raised slogans against the BJP-led central government and demanded for the withdrawing of unprecedented taxes. Senior office-bearer Anil Patel questioned the silence of union ministers Smriti Irani and Ravin Shankar Prasad on the rising fuel prices. “These leaders used to take to roads even if there was a hike of 10 paisa during the Congress regime. Now, the petrol is being sold for Rs 106 per litre and diesel has reached Rs 96 per litre, but these politicians are no where to be seen.” The workers, during the protest, also raised the issue of LPG crossing Rs 850 per cylinder, silent withdrawal of all the subsidy on the cylinders and cooking oil reaching Rs 200 per litre. Aurangabad city district president Hisham Osmani said, “On each litre of petrol and diesel, Prime Minister Narendra Modi government is levying Rs 18 in the name of road development and Rs 4 for the farming sector.” Citing a series of figures obtained from various sources, he said the BJP-led government has collected over Rs 22 lakh crore through different taxes on fuels including by charging 820% excise duty on diesel and 258% excise duty on petrol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/congress-protests-against-rising-prices/articleshow/84249449.cms||---

Parents said that children are forced to sit in front of screens for about five to seven hours in the name of virtual classes. “It’s high time schools realise that they can’t conduct online classes for a longer duration. They have to keep students’ attention span and their eye health in mind while preparing the time-table,” said Praveen P, whose children are in class 5 and class 1. He said that his elder child developed a burning sensation in the eyes due to online classes and had to skip classes last year and rely more on textbooks and other material to continue education. They said that schools should encourage students to read and write more instead of asking them to sit in front of the system for hours at a stretch. “Schools can also make use of worksheets and other materials for teaching children,” said Lalitha K, whose daughters are in class 6 and class 5. As per Pragyata guidelines, schools can conduct online classes for 45 minutes per day for kindergarten/preschool students, 1.5 hours per day for classes 1 to 5, two hours per day for class 6 to Class 8 students and three hours for class 9 to class 12 students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/most-schools-holding-online-classes-for-longer-duration/articleshow/84249483.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Produce records on judge in Bharadwaj plea, Bombay HC tells state||Mumbai: Bombay high court on Thursday asked the Maharashtra government to produce any additional documents or records to show that a Pune sessions court Judge K D Vadane who granted an extension of time to the police to file its chargesheet against lawyer Sudha Bharadwaj, had the jurisdiction to do so. Bharadwaj is accused of Maoist links in the 2018 Elgar Parishad case. Bharadwaj has petitioned the HC to seek default bail on the ground that the judge was not a designated special judge under the National Investigation Act (NIA) as was necessary, since the special anti-terror law, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, was invoked against her and other co-accused at the relevant time. Her counsel, Yug Chaudhry, said a reply given by the HC registry under the Right to Information Act (RTI) had said the judge was not designated at the time he took cognizance of the chargesheet against her. On Thursday, a bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar noted that the records produced by its registry “matched” with what was given under RTI to her as mentioned in her petition. At the hearing earlier this week, Chaudhry said the Pune judge had worn the cloak of a special judge, but he was not one under law and the HC said it would seek records from the registry and also had sought records from the state. Chaudhry submitted in cases of scheduled offences such as those under the UAPA, a sessions judge has no power to take cognizance, only a “special” court would have jurisdiction and it has to be set up by the state or the Centre. Chaudhry had also asked if at the time other special judges were functioning in Pune. The HC said the records show there were special judges in Pune at the time when the matter came up before Judge Vadane. The HC said to state public prosecutor Aruna Pai: “Show us any document through which principal district judge empowered Vadane to hear the matter.” She sought time. For the NIA, Anil Singh, additional solicitor general, said it was not necessary for only a special court to have handled the case in Pune and as the judge was qualified, he rightly presided over the case there. But Chaudhry said there is a “vast difference” between a judge being qualified to be a special judge and actually being designated as one. Bharadwaj was arrested in August 2018. The NIA took over the probe in January 2020. Singh said the charges against her were serious under the UAPA and it was a question of “national security” and nothing could be more important. The HC will continue hearing her plea on July 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/produce-records-on-judge-in-bharadwaj-plea-bombay-hc-tells-state/articleshow/84246498.cms||---

His three-year-jail term has also been reduced to three months following a plea by lawyer Bushra Yousif Mayoof. Khalid’s brother Hussain Ahmed, who hails from Bihar and lives in Hyderabad, is much relieved now. MBT leader and social worker Amjed Ullah Khan, who took up the issue of Khalid with the ministry of external affairs, said the Indian embassy in Bahrain provided legal help. Bushra Mayoof made an appeal in the Supreme Criminal Appeals Court following which the jail sentence was reduced and the penalty rescinded. Ahmed had also made an appeal to external affairs minister S Jaishankar and the Indian embassy in Bahrain to come to the rescue of his brother. He said in the letter that his brother had stepped out of his accommodation for food on June 7 only after his quarantine period was over but he was penalised and sentenced to jail by a local court for violation of Covid-19 rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jailed-workers-fine-revokedsentence-reduced/articleshow/84249507.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Hyderabad||Freaky weather in Hyderabad this monsoon baffles experts||HYDERABAD: Freaky weather over Hyderabad this monsoon season has baffled weather experts, as the city has seen high humidity levels of over 70 per cent even when it has not rained. Three days ago, the maximum temperature rose to 35 Degrees Celsius, with weather experts attributing it to weakened monsoon activity over Telangana, before it again picked up now. Climate change experts say that overcast skies, coupled with subdued rain and rise in temperature and humidity levels is something people of Hyderabad have to come to terms with now. “This is an unusual phenomena as by July 5, states such as Telangana, Odisha and its neighbourhood witness heavy rains. Matrix of humidity and temperature calculates discomfort level. The easterly and southerly winds blowing from Bay of Bengal increased the moisture level over Telangana,” said explained Mahesh Palawat, vice president, meteorology and climate change at Skymet, an independent weather forecasting agency. Agriculture experts say the ‘breaks’ in monsoon, if continues will disrupt sowing of crops in Telangana. “Fluctuations in rainfall causes long dry spell thereby affecting sowing of crops. Due to subdued rains, farmers have to be dependent on irrigation facilities, forcing many of them to ignore rain-fed crops such as pulses. Most farmers end up sowing paddy and cotton. Owing to this, the state government is forced to purchase other essential crops from other states resulting in a long-term ecological and economic burden,” said GV Ramanjaneyulu, executive director, Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, Hyderabad. Although Telangana has witnessed over 40 per cent of excess rainfall till date, rise in humidity levels and subdued rainfall has also affected the quality of crops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/freaky-weather-this-monsoon-baffles-experts/articleshow/84250929.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Hyderabad||ASCI prepares blueprint for third wave, focus on oxygen||HYDERABAD: With the Covid-19 second wave ebbing and officials heaving a sigh of relief, Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI) says it is high time a regulatory mechanism to control prices of medical devices be put in place. Also, hospitals should be asked to submit a ‘double back-up plan’ for oxygen, while a national oxygen grid should be explored. “Cargo flights should be sent to friendly nations for procuring oxygen concentrators. Oxygen concentrator banks should be created wherefrom patients in home isolation can borrow. The government should draw up long-term plans and build the capacity of oxygen storage on a large scale. In this direction, creation of oxygen national grid should be explored,” ASCI’s Centre for Health Care Management director Dr Subodh Kandamuthan said. This was also specified in a report prepared by ASCI along with Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Telangana council. The need for oil PSU IOCL to play its part in strengthening supply-chain of oxygen by building India’s long-term liquid oxygen storage capacity has been stressed upon. “IOCL, in convergence with ministry of road transport and highways, oil companies and other central and state agencies should monitor allocation, dispatch, and receipt of oxygen. The government should provide oximeters to all patients recovering from home isolation,” the report said. Experts, meanwhile, say that while upscaling infrastructure, an important thing to keep in mind, was to ensure that no white elephants were created. “Since this kind of an emergency could come once in a decade or more, we need to create multipurpose infrastructure. For instance, plants that can be repurposed quickly and can produce both oxygen as well as nitrogen and these plants should be strategically located at places where the need is. Also, when creating the oxygen grid it is important to ensure that it is geographically balanced. Currently, majority of the plants are based in the eastern part of the country and hence we saw scenarios where oxygen had to be airlifted,” Dr Ranga Reddy Burri, professor, School of Medical Sciences, University of Hyderabad, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/asci-prepares-blueprint-for-3rd-wave-focus-on-o2/articleshow/84250981.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘No fee cut offered, say 2/3 int’l students returning to campus’||Mumbai: International students returning to campuses, those who had already enrolled at a university before the pandemic and taken online classes temporarily as well as freshmen who entered in Spring, say universities ought to have offered financial incentives to get them back. A recent exhaustive study shows 67% of current international students had not been offered any kind of incentive to physically return to campuses. A QS (Quacquarelli Symonds) survey found that as thousands of students criss-cross the globe once again for an education, reducing tuition, giving financial assistance during quarantine, campus safety and hygiene and vaccines have been playing on their minds. “While some financial incentives are seen as a measure to encourage the return to international studies, many students see it as a necessary reimbursement given the fact that their higher education experience is, or will be, far from the typical university experience had by so many before them. With graduation ceremonies and social events cancelled, in-person teaching limited and student accommodation left untouched, many feel as though the cost of their university experience should be reduced,” said the study. As many as 81% of prospective international students say tuition fees should be changed if they were asked to start their studies online until they are able to travel for face-to-face teaching. When asked how much they should be discounted, most (21%) said tuition fees should be discounted by 41-50%, with a similar proportion voting for 31-40% (18%) and 21-30% (20%). “The survey really gets down to capturing what students feel. Some of the universities I work with have offered students some financial incentives. But most universities need to do a lot more,” said education counsellor Sonal Parekh-Hariyaa. A small proportion of students was offered financial incentives, including bursaries or scholarships (21%), discounts on their tuition fees (11%), discounts on accommodation during quarantine (6%) and money off international flights (3%). The survey added, “With the coronavirus pandemic likely to be a consistent presence in our lives for some time, and with experts predicting online learning will remain in part after the coronavirus pandemic subsides, universities must work hard to address some of the most common concerns students have surrounding online learning.” Sixty-six per cent of student respondents said online learning is a key feature. Face coverings (59%), ensuring hand gel availability (54%) and putting up signs on how to limit transmission (54%) were common measures at universities. The least common (18%) was creation of apps informing how busy certain areas on campus were. After being asked to quarantine, as 56% of students were asked to do after arriving at their destination, a lot depended on the country’s protocol. If case numbers remained high, students were asked to begin their studies online there. This was the case for 64% of respondents. The responses in this report were collected from 14,987 students across 185 regions between January 1 and June 7, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-fee-cut-offered-say-2/3-intl-students-returning-to-campus/articleshow/84244924.cms||---

In response to a petition filed in Delhi High Court, which seeks changes in the method of calculation of marks of Class X students, CBSE said that no school could take undue benefit of the policy. “The evaluation policy has been formulated under extraordinary circumstances due to Covid-19 pandemic taking a pragmatic view,” it submitted, stating that the school management has no role to play in the evaluation of the students. It has to be done by the resulting committee having external members as well. Further, there are various checks in the form of verification of records by CBSE. “Records to be sealed under the signature of all members of the resulting committee; records to be kept in the safe custody of the principal of the school.” The high court had on June 2 sought response of the Centre, Delhi government, and CBSE on NGO Justice for All’s petition claiming that the policy of the board for calculating marks of Class X students based on the internal assessment by schools was unconstitutional and required to be modified. It said moderating the marks in consonance with the overall average score of the district, national and state average “was unreasonable, illogical and punitive for the students of a school which would appear in the board exams for the first time with no previous data of performance.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/class-x-evaluation-policy-prepared-to-ensure-no-injustice-to-students-cbse/articleshow/84256897.cms||Abhinav Garg

Many other areas such as Mallapur, Begumpet, Kushaiguda, Tarnaka recorded rainfall between 60 and 90 mm. The India Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad attributed the rainfall to stratus clouds — a blanket of uniform and low-level clouds. “Moisture levels over the city have been very high for the past few days.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Bank told to pay consumer for unfair loan recovery methods||HYDERABAD: A district consumer forum directed Kotak Mahindra Bank to pay Rs 90,000 to a consumer for harassment, adopting unfair and unethical means to recover loan dues. The bank was also directed to refrain from harassing the complainant for recovery of the balance amount and follow the process law instead. The complainant, Mohammed Mudasser, had submitted that he has been using the credit card issued by the bank and making regular payments since March 2016. On June 4, 2018, he said that he had received a pre-approved loan of Rs 1.12 lakh on the credit card, which he accepted following which the amount was credited to his account on June 12. The complainant claimed that at the time of loan agreement, he was informed that monthly EMI was Rs 5,694. However, after receiving the statement, he noticed that the bank had imposed several extra charges which added up to Rs 4,500 over the EMI amount. The complainant said that till March 2019, he paid EMIs regularly, but defaulted in the month of April as he had lost his job. He said the bank charged a higher rate of interest rate and made several threatening calls to recover dues. He claimed that he could not perform well in the job interviews because of the bank’s harassment which included use of abusive language, and threats. The general manager of the bank, in his written counter, claimed that the complainant had full knowledge of the charges as they are mentioned in terms and conditions. The bank denied harassing the complainant, claimed that it follows the norms of RBI and would never entertain or tolerate its employees misbehaving with customers. During the trial, the forum considered messages, call logs, payments , and the copy of Kotak Bank terms and conditions as evidence. “There is sufficient proof to show that the opposite party had adopted unfair and unethical means to recover the dues-...which needs to be restrained as the procedure adopted by the bank certainly amounts to unfair trade practice. Such acts of opposite parties might have certainly caused the mental agony and harassment to the complainant,” the consumer forum said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bank-told-to-pay-consumer-for-unfair-loan-recovery-methods/articleshow/84251089.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) had carried out a massive tree plantation drive years ago that keeps the entire premises cool. “After the blueprint is approved we will come to know, what extent of greenery would get affected on the premises of Chest hospital. Obviously, we lose lush greenery, but we will try our best to protect existing trees,” hospital superintendent Dr Mahboob Khan, told TOI. A part from century-old banyan trees, several species of trees can be found at the inside the hospital and around ‘Irranuma palace’ also known as the Pink palace. It was built by a noble, Nizamuddin Fakhr-ul-Mulk in 1888 during the regime of sixth Nizam, Mir Mahboob Ali Khan. Out of 65-acre, a total of 15 structures were built in a 5-acre zone and remaining areas are open space, covered with lush greenery. Over 50 to 80 peacocks can be spotted inside the hospital premises and patients and their attendants enjoy the sight. “The peacocks create a rustling sound, which is almost like a drumroll. Most of us get cured once we reach here. The place is serene and magical,” said S Venkatesh, a patient. Currently, the 650-bed Chest Hospital has been catering to Telangana and neighbouring states of Maharashtra and Karnataka, for more than six decades. According to a new proposal by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, a multi-super speciality hospital and an Institute of Research for chest diseases will come up there. After the cabinet approved the proposal, a high-level team of senior officials, including Telangana Medical and Health Department, and Telangana State medical services & infrastructure development corporation (TSMSIDC) also visited the premises and is preparing a blueprint for implementation of the proposal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lush-green-cover-may-soon-give-way-to-new-erragadda-hospital/articleshow/84251281.cms||Sunil Mungara

Despite repeated complaints to the civic authorities, commuters said that no solution has been found to avoid a rerun of last year’s floods that resulted severe traffic blocks due to the damages and heavy waterlogging on either ends of some of these flyovers. The vents on either side, provided to drain water, could not catch up with the rainfall received. “The RK Puram flyover, which is 600 meters long, is riddled with several uneven patchworks of potholes, causing bumpy rides for commuters. The flyover connects to some of the busiest areas in Secunderabad and yet it is left in the state of despair even as the monsoons have arrived,” said David Raju, a software professional who uses the stretch frequently. “Last year, hundreds of commuters including myself were stuck on the flyover for over one and a half hours, during the heavy rains that lashed the twin cities. Due to the delay in these repairs, we are worried we will have to face a similar situation this year,” he added. The flyover is crucial for the people travelling from ECIL, Sainikpuri, Neredmet and several other parts of Secunderabad. The situation is similar at Moula Ali flyover. Speaking about waterlogging on most of the flyovers during rains, Harish Daga, an activist said, “The rainwater discharge pipes on the flyover are all blocked with bitumen. The civic staff cover these holes while they are relaying these roads with bitumen because of which the water stagnates every time it rains. Some of these vents have nearly one feet of bitumen accumulated in them. None of new SRDP flyovers have good quality vents.” On the other hand, the delay in completion of construction activities of Bahadurpura flyover, Chandrayangutta flyover and Falaknuma bridge which was closed for traffic after a portion of the road caved in due to the rains last year, is leading to massive traffic jams in the surrounding areas. “I think the delayed construction works of these flyovers needs to be taken into consideration immediately as the traffic continues to swell during peak hours. At Bahadurpura, the road that leads to the flyover is filled with construction waste which spreads onto the road every time it rains and make the entire stretch prone to accidents. There are 2 to 3 km long traffic jams on the surrounding roads of both these flyovers,” said Mohammad Areef, a mechanic shop owner, at Bahadurpura. “The delay in works of some of these flyovers, including Bahadurpura, was due to issues related to land acquisition but now work is going on. It might take a year for it to be completed,” said Saroja Rani, chief enginner, GHMC. Asked about pending repair works on RK Puram, Moulali and other flyovers, GHMC chief engineer for maintenance, M Devanand said, “We are getting the repairs done on all the flyovers that fall under GHMC. We will check if there are any pending works and update the status.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rains-set-to-intensify-but-roads-in-twin-cities-still-far-from-ready/articleshow/84250839.cms||Moulika.KV

Nikahs mostly take place in mosques but due to Covid-19 norms, they had been shut and entry of devotees was restricted to prayer offerings only. A bride’s relative told TOI that they were not given permission by mosque authorities, citing Covid-19 norms but they objected as the lockdown has been lifted. “We were not given permission to conduct nikah ceremony at Shahi Masjid Bagh-e-Aam. The reason is not known ,’’ said one of the bride’s relatives, Mohammed Abdul Qayyum. “Such restrictions are upsetting as we (Muslims) generally prefer mosques for performing nikah,’’ he said. Syed Shakir, a qazi who performs nikahs told TOI that there should not be any curbs imposed in mosques to hold nikah. “Written instructions have been placed in the mosque to keep people at bay from carrying out any kind of marriage ceremonies though many call me up every day with a request to perform nikah at Masjid Bagh-e-Aam,” he said. Mohammed Khasim of the minority welfare department officer told TOI that gatherings are still not allowed inside Masjid-e-Bagh E Aam due to the pandemic. “The government has asked to allow only devotees for prayers and prohibit nikah ceremony,’’ Khasim said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-urged-to-permit-nikah-inside-mosques/articleshow/84251033.cms||Omar bin Taher
---||Coimbatore||Heavy rain to lash catchment areas near Western Ghats||COIMBATORE: Weather experts said parts of the district near the Western Ghats were likely to record up to 150mm rainfall during July 10 to 24, thanks to the formation of a low-pressure system over the Bay of Bengal near Andhra Pradesh that would lead to a surge in southwest monsoon activity in the Arabian Sea. While the main city areas and agricultural belts are not likely to receive adequate rainfall, dams are expected to get replenished, resolving drinking water and even irrigation issues to an extent. It is to be noted that the district has hardly received 5% of the predicted 210mm southwest monsoon rainfall from June 1. Weather blogger Santhosh Krishnan said the low-pressure system was expected to pop near Andhra coast and move westwards towards the Arabian Sea. Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist at Skymet Weather Services, said, “The low-pressure system will form between Andhra Pradesh and Odisha coast in the Bay of Bengal from July 11 and it will have a pull effect in the Arabian Sea. The low-pressure system will pull the moisture bearing westerly winds from the Arabian Sea. Hence, a surge in the southwest monsoon activity is expected right from Karnataka coast up to Konkan and Goa.” He said all places near the coast and the Western Ghats could expect moderate to heavy rain for the next two weeks. Krishnan, meanwhile, said the catchment areas in the Western Ghats such as Siruvani, Pillur, Bhavanisagar, Sholayar and Parambikulam, among others, would receive heavy rainfall. “It is the south interior section of the Western Ghats that will receive the heaviest showers. We can expect to receive 15cm to 20cm rainfall by July end.” He said Valparai, Pollachi and western parts of the district were also expected to receive good showers. The rain forecast has revived the hopes of farmers, who were staring at a bleak future in the absence of adequate rainfall. “In Madukkarai, we have received only drizzles so far,” said A Kandasamy, who has planted vegetables on his farmland. “We need some solid rain to replenish the groundwater levels and reduce our dependence on irrigation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/heavy-rain-to-lash-catchment-areas-near-western-ghats/articleshow/84249494.cms||---

The incident took place when the child was travelling by herself one afternoon in 2018 and there were few passengers in the bus. The minor deposed earlier this year and identified the accused, Chandrakant Koli. Among the witnesses cited by special public prosecutor Geeta Sharma to seek the accused’s conviction were the minor and a cop. The court also fined the accused Rs 20,000. “Out of the fine, an amount of Rs 15,000 be given to the victim, as compensation, after the appeal period is over,” the court said. The court suspended the sentence for a month, giving the accused time to move Bombay high court against the judgement. The accused was held guilty under Pocso Act’s Section 12 for sexual harassment. The maximum sentence is three years in jail. The minor in her deposition told the court she was a Class VIII student in 2018. She said on July 24, 2018, after attending her scholarship class, she boarded the bus around 1.45pm. She said the front seats of the bus were occupied so she went and sat at the back. The minor said when the accused came and asked her about the ticket she showed him her pass. “After some time there were only two to three passengers in the bus and they were seated in the front. The accused came near me and sat beside me. He asked me whether I knew anything about sex,” the minor said. She further said she told him not to ask her such questions. The minor said the accused went to the front of the bus but later returned and asked her the same question. Once again, she protested and got off when her stop arrived. The minor said she did not tell anyone at home as she was afraid. On July 26, 2018, she revealed the incident to her friend who in turn informed her mother. The mother then relayed the information to the minor’s mother on July 31, 2018, who later called the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bus-conductor-gets-1-yr-jail-for-asking-13-yr-old-about-sex/articleshow/84245154.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||India||At 1st meet with new ministers, PM says Covid norm violations worrying||NEW DELHI: Amidst ongoing vaccination drive and relief in restrictions, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday expressed deep concern over violations of Covid norms. In the first meeting of the new council of ministers aft-er reshuffle, the PM said, “Over the past few days, we all have been seeing pictures and videos of crowded places and people roaming about without masks or social distancing. This is not a pleasant sight and it should instil a sense of fear in us.” The Prime Minister’s concern was about reports coming from various places, mainly tourist destinations, where streets are seen as crowded. The PM stressed that powered by “our Covid warriors and front-line workers, India’s fight against the global pandemic is underway with full vigour”. “We are steadily vaccinating substantial numbers of our nation’s population. Testing is also consistently high,” he said. He added that there should be no space for carelessness or complacency. “A single mistake would have far-reaching impact and weaken the fight to overcome Covid-19,” he added. The PM said with the numbers being less than what they were in the recent months, people may want to venture out. “However, everyone must remember—the threat of Covid-19 is far from over. Many other nations are seeing surges in infections. The virus is also mutating,” Modi said. He said, “As ministers, our aim should not be to instil fear but to request people to keep taking all possible precautions so that we are able to move beyond this pandemic in the times to come.” He also expressed concern at the persistently high number of cases coming from Maharashtra and Kerala. Sources said the ministers have been asked to focus on work and avoid giving bites to TV channels on diverse issues or trying to catch media attention. “They must be regular in office and reach by 9.30 am. The PM had given similar advisory during his first tenure,” a source said. It was learnt that the new railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has directed that all staff of the minister’s cell will work in two shifts from 7 am to midnight. A circular issued on Thursday said the staff will be on duty in two shifts — 7 am to 4 pm and 3 pm to midnight. Sources said the new railway directive for officers in MR cell means, “Miles to Go before we sleep..!” So much is to be done and every minute counts for the railways on a mission mode, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-1st-meet-with-new-ministers-pm-says-covid-norm-violations-worrying/articleshow/84254828.cms||---

The PIL was filed by NGO Samta Sainik Dal that listed 78 families whose properties were damaged during the cyclone, which hit Gujarat coast on May 17. These families are located in Bhavnagar, Amreli, Gir-Somnath and Junagadh districts. The petitioner’s advocate Hemant Makwana submitted that teams of surveyors visited the villages, but the names of several affected persons did not find a mention in the list of the victims who are to be compensated by the government. Besides seeking inclusion of these 78 families and compensation for the loss caused by the natural calamity, the PIL also sought the high court’s directions to concerned authorities to identify the families affected on account of cyclone Tauktae and allow them to produce evidence before district collectors and to ensure that their names are forwarded to the relief commissioner for benefit of compensation in proportion to the damage caused. The petitioner submitted that for cyclone-ravaged areas, the centre had announced a relief package of Rs 1,000 crore. The state government also declared a package and fixed an amount for compensation towards property damages. The HC has asked the state government to file its reply in three weeks. The petitioner is permitted to file a rejoinder in next one week, and posted further hearing on the issue on August 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/tauktae-hc-seeks-govt-reply-to-pil/articleshow/84249559.cms||---

These buses will be noiseless, environment friendly and offer commuters a comfortable journey. The buses are being procured under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid) and Electrical Vehicles-II (FAME II) programme of the Central government. “In 2020, Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal issued a tender to invite bids for 150 electric buses. Now, MSRTC is going ahead with its plan to introduce 100 electric buses,” said a senior official. Sources said the government was creating a strong charging infrastructure for electric vehicles along the Pune Expressway. There are plans to install eight charging stations on this route, the sources said, adding some of the new buses will ply on the Expressway. A few may also run on the Mumbai-Nashik and Mumbai-Alibaug route, an official said. The MSRTC has a fleet of 18,000 buses, with a majority plying on diesel which is polluting. “We will be glad to run these buses which will reduce the carbon footprint,” said MSRTC MD Shekhar Channe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-msrtc-board-clears-decks-for-100-new-electric-buses/articleshow/84251855.cms||Somit Sen

Buoyed by the success of this programme, the department plans to replicate it in other areas. Anand Reddy, the assistant conservator of forest of Nashik West, had launched the unique initiative in the first week of June. “Children from 68 villages voluntarily surrendered their slingshots to the forest teams after forest department teams convinced them to desist from using slingshots as they can painfully injure birds,” he said. He added that the forest teams worked relentlessly, visiting villages despite inclement weather, on weekends and even at night. They could win over these children and successfully convince them and the village elders that birds are an integral part of the environment system. “These children have promised not to touch the slingshots again,” said Reddy. He claimed that in many villages, the children themselves have now started a movement to see to it that no one in their neighbourhoods uses slingshots to kill birds. Nashik forest officials said that killing of birds using slingshots is a serious issue and there is a decline of various species of bird population in Nashik forest owing to habitat loss and hunting. There are about 250 various species of birds found in Nashik, which houses one Ramsar site and three important bird areas. “Our pilot project at Peth was a success. We are now going to replicate this project in three other forest ranges of Nashik West, including Nanashi, Barhe and Harsul. The initiative will make the gullible villagers, particularly children, understand the importance of the existence of birds. It will see a rise in bird population in Nashik in the future,” Reddy hoped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-children-surrender-590-slingshots-to-forest-team/articleshow/84249540.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Varanasi||LIU, traffic police sys restructured to fix accountability||Varanasi: o enhance the performance and fix accountability along with enhancing professionalism, a complete restructuring of the traffic police and LIU has been started in the city. Under the process, which was started almost three and half months after the commissionerate police system started in the city, the traffic police and LIU have been restructured on the lines of setup of police stations and circles. Each police station and outpost in-charges have also been made accountable for keeping the traffic regulated to solve the traffic woes of the city. Providing details of the restructuring, the commissioner of police A Satish Ganesh told TOI on Thursday, “After a detailed study of the traffic scenario, the traffic police setup and available resources for it we found that instead of circle basis the traffic police and LIU were operating on the zonal system, which did not cover each police station area. Besides, they also lacked coordination with the police at police stations.” The officials found that against the allocation of 200 policemen not more than 50 personnel were performing duty in a shift even in busy hours. While 15% manpower was being used in office works, similar strength was busy in issuing summons and court related works. As 10-15 traffic police remained on leaves and many on VIP duties, the availability of policemen for traffic duties in a shift of eight hour was found to be around 25% of the allocated strength. More shocking was to see the preference of traffic police of getting deployed on the roads connected with highways. With the civil and traffic police communicating on separate grids, quick sharing of information in case of traffic disruptions at any point used to be difficult as even after becoming aware of such problems, the city control room police used to avoid alerting their counterparts in the traffic police. Due to not being stationed in a decentralised way, the traffic police used to reach late at the spot of traffic jams even after being alerted. The CP said that after going through all these ground realities it was decided to restructure traffic police on the basis of civil police. Now, each of the six circles of commissionerate police will have a traffic inspector or traffic sub-inspector to lead the traffic personnel deployed at traffic points in each police station area. Three TI and three TSI were already posted on Wednesday. Apart from them, the police station and outpost in-charges would also be made accountable for traffic jams taking place in their area concerned, he said adding, a strategy for optimum utilisation of allocated manpower in traffic police will be finalised in a day or two. The LIU was also restructured on the same lines as its zonal system has been dissolved and the unit has been restructured on circle basis, said the CP adding that, one inspector has been posted in each of the six circles and they have been asked to coordinate with each police station on daily basis for proper sharing of intelligence. This system will help in covering each police station area with LIU network and also fixing accountability of units personnel in case of failing timely collection of intelligence inputs, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/liu-traffic-police-sys-restructured-to-fix-accountability/articleshow/84251832.cms||---

According to Khammam police commissioner Vishnu S Warrier, in May 2021, Khammam (Rural) police seized 1,000 gelatin sticks, 950 detonators, 30 booster boxes, 35 bags of sulphur and 27 bags of gunpowder from a gang indulging in illegal sale of explosive material to people organising rock blasting. The seized explosives along with some other explosives seized by Khammam II town police have been moved to an isolated place between Tangampadu and Mangalagudem villages near Khammam by the police for disposal as per court’s order. A bomb disposal squad from Hyderabad went there to dispose of the explosives. “The gelatine and detonators were disposed of without any trouble. To dispose of the gunpowder, a pit was dug and sacks of powder were placed in the pit. Water was also splashed on the sacks but when the earth mover’s arm hit a boulder, a spark occurred triggering an explosion. Luckily no one sustained injuries,” a police official from Khammam (Rural) police station said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/explosives-burst-while-destroying/articleshow/84249551.cms||---

According to a memorandum of understanding signed between British Council and the TSCHE last year, the two organisations have decided to identify reforms in curriculum in subjects under social sciences. The British Council and the TSCHE held a meeting with all the newly appointed vice-chancellors of state universities on July 6 to deliberate upon areas of curriculum reform and its impact on employability, over the next three years, on students and teachers. “We will be identifying key subjects offered by Osmania University and Kakatiya University and undertake scope and study on curriculum revision. Eventually, a task force will be constituted with members from two Wales universities -- Bangor and Aberystwyth -- that will evaluate the existing curriculum and propose necessary changes,” said Janaka Pushpanathan, director, British Council (South India). The revised curriculum will be rolled out in more than 1,000 colleges in Telangana at the end of the three-year pilot and will affect more than eight lakh students. “If the project is successful, we will extend it to other courses such as pharmacy, science etc. The idea is to adopt the best practices from British universities,” said Papi Reddy, chairman, TSCHE. In addition to this, the British Council and Global Wales has also launched an exclusive UK scholarship scheme for Telangana students. “Total 16 meritorious students from Telangana for the academic year 2021-22 will secure a scholarship of 5,000 pounds to study at one of the eight Wales universities. The total scholarship fund is 80,000 pounds. The idea is to enhance the mobility of students between the two countries,” said Pushpanathan. As part of it’s bilateral talks, the British Council and the TSCHE are preparing a detailed action plan to not only facilitate students mobility but also capacity-building and exchange programmes for the faculty members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/british-council-to-help-t-revamp-liberal-arts-commerce-curriculum/articleshow/84249543.cms||Preeti Biswas

The surrendered Maoists were identified as Hemula Rama alias Laxman, 27, and Madakam Paiki alias Lakshmi, 26, both natives of Chhattisgarh. Hemula Rama had joined the Maoist party in 2016 and he was Jegurugonda area committee member (ACM) of the party in Chhattisgarh, Bhadradri Kothagudem SP Sunil Dutt said. “Currently, Hemula Rama is working as guard to Jegurogonda divisional committee member (DVCM), Jagadeesh,” the SP said. Madakam Paiki, a member of the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army’s (PLGA) 10th Platoon in Jegurugonda, had joined the Maoist party in 2015. Police said that Hemula Rama and Madakam Paiki have surrendered due to the harassment and threat from senior party members. “When Hemula Rama and Madakam Paiki expressed their desire to leave the Maoist party and start a mainstream life, seniors did not allow them. They were harassed as the leadership is against members leaving the party. Fearing for their life, the two youngsters decided to surrender before police and start a new life,” the SP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-maoists-surrender-before-bhadradri-cops/articleshow/84249536.cms||---

It also said that North Goa MP Shripad Naik’s appointment as the minister of state for ports, shipping, waterways and tourism is a “blessing in disguise” for Goa. Describing the cabinet rejig as a “face-saving exercise”, state Congress president Girish Chodankar said that what was actually needed was a change at the helm of the government. “Natural justice has been done to the betrayer of Goa former Union minister Prakash Javadekar who connived with the chief minister of Goa Pramod Sawant in selling our mother river Mhadei to Karnataka,” said Chodankar. “The need of the hour was to change the pilot and co-pilot of the aircraft when the nation is passing through turbulent times. Changing the cabin crew will not help in anyway,” said Chodankar. Congress said it hoped that Sawant would “get his punishment” soon for playing with the sentiments and emotions of Goa. Though Naik’s appointment as the new minister of state for ports, shipping, waterways and tourism has been viewed as a demotion from his earlier post of independent charge of Ayush ministry and minister of state for defence, the Congress said that the new post will benefit Goa. “It is actually a blessing in disguise for Goa. I hope he will protect the interest of Goans and save Goa’s coastline and rivers from getting into the clutches of crony club of prime minister Narendra Modi,” said Chodankar, adding, “We hope he will take immediate steps to revive the most affected tourism industry in Goa and put an end to ‘mission 30% commission’ of tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar.” The party also welcomed the decision of newly-appointed governor of Himachal Pradesh Rajendra Arleker to resign from the primary membership of BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dropping-javadekar-from-cabinet-is-justice-for-goa-congress/articleshow/84251905.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Vidarbha: Widespread rains ease worries for farmers||NAGPUR: Rains have brought some respite on the farm front throughout Vidarbha. Nearly a week’s dry spell after sowing had posed a risk to the crops. Lack of rains had slowed down sowing in Amravati division, which covers west Vidarbha. Here sowing has been done in only 75% of the farm area. In Nagpur division, which covers eastern part, transplantation of paddy shoots in almost 80% of the area could not take place due to the gap in rains. Sowing of cotton and soyabean was completed in 95% of the area but the dry spell had led to the risk. Senior officials of the agriculture department in both divisions said Thursday’s rains will help farmers in large tracts carry on for another 15 days at least. There are some pockets in Amravati division where the rainfall was low, and it may need a couple of days of additional downpour. However, the overall situation has eased and there is no immediate threat now, said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/widespread-rains-ease-worries-for-farmers/articleshow/84249574.cms||---

However, he did not specify any time frame when the relaxations would be introduced. Nashik is at Level 3 of the restrictions at present. Bhujbal said the pandemic has badly affected economic activities and many people have lost their jobs. There is a need to ease the restrictions further so that commercial activities can be increased. The livelihood of a large section of the people depends on this, the guardian minister said. “Moreover, the government needs revenue to provide services to citizens. The government will start earning revenue only after the economic activities gain momentum. Hence, there is a need to relax the current restrictions on commercial activities,” said Bhujbal. He added that the restrictions had to be imposed in Nashik since the number of active Covid cases had risen to over 48,000, putting the health infrastructure under tremendous stress. “But now the situation is under control as the active cases have reduced to around 1,800 cases. However, the number is not small,” cautioned Bhujbal. There was a shortage of oxygen and the health machinery took all the efforts to provide better treatment to the patients during the second wave of the Covid, he said. “Even though the second wave is under control, the third wave of Covid has already been projected. Hence, people should continue to observe Covid appropriate behaviour to prevent the spread of the infection,” said Bhujbal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/curbs-will-be-eased-further-nashik-guardian-minister/articleshow/84244906.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Varanasi||VPSOA opposes move mandating licence to sell tobacco products||Varanasi: Micro retailers of Banarasi paan (betel) associated with the Varanasi Pan Shop Owners Association (VPSOA) have raised strong objections against the draft proposal mandating licence for selling tobacco products. VPSOA has submitted a memorandum to the mayor and municipal commissioner alleging that provision of licence for selling tobacco products is being brought under pressure from anti-tobacco NGOs, which are conspiring to shift tobacco business to foreign companies, supermarkets and malls at the cost of livelihoods of lakhs of small shopkeepers. VPSOA president Siya Ram Varma on Thursday said, “Against the proposal of department of urban development, government of Uttar Pradesh which mandates separate licences for retailers selling tobacco products including paan, bidi and cigarette, we submitted a memorandum to the mayor and the municipal commissioner on Wednesday. We appealed to them to ensure that this proposal is withdrawn before enforcement as it will impact over 30,000 micro-retailers on whom lives of over two lakh people, including their families depend.” VPSOA alleged that this provision will bring back licence-raj in the state, which will give a tool to the officials concerned for harassing poor and mostly uneducated micro-retailers. “It will lead to a sharp increase in their cost of doing business at a time when retailers are already badly hit by the Covid-19 lockdowns,” said Verma adding that the average pre-lockdown earnings of petty retailer was Rs 4,000-Rs 8,000 per month but it went down to 60%-70% during the frequent lockdown periods. “At a time when these petty retailers needed financial relief, the implementation of such a proposal will break their backbone,” he said. He alleged that on account of the Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply, and Distribution Act, 2003 or COTPA and the rules under it, these small-time traders are already being subjected to daily harassment while the urban development department is planning for harsher provisions. He alleged that no such law should be brought under pressure from anti-tobacco NGOs as they are interested in shifting benefits of tobacco retailing business to foreign companies, supermarkets and malls hurting livelihoods of small shopkeepers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/vpsoa-opposes-move-mandating-licence-to-sell-tobacco-products/articleshow/84251870.cms||---

---||Delhi||Bail for 2 in Red Fort case as involvement in violence not clear||New Delhi: A Delhi court on Thursday granted bail to two persons allegedly involved in the violence at Red Fort during the farmers’ protest rally on Republic Day this year. Additional sessions judge Dr Kamini Lau granted bail to 26-year-old Buta Singh and 30-year- old Maninder Singh in the case on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 50,000 with one surety of like amount each. Delhi Police had submitted that there was no material on record to show that Buta was involved in any kind of violence or attacking the police officers, the court noted in its order. “To my mind, these offences are bailable and 15 accused out of 18 arrested have been granted bail. In fact, the main conspirators as per Delhi Police namely Deep Sidhu and Iqbal Singh have already been granted bail... This being the background and without making any observations on merits of the grounds raised and on the grounds of parity, the applicant/accused, Buta Singh, is admitted to bail...,” the judge said. The police had earlier alleged that Buta was part of an unlawful assembly that had attacked the police, vandalised the Red Fort area and instigated the crowd to violence. However, with respect to the video placed on record in which Maninder was allegedly seen severely attacking and assaulting policemen on duty with his sword, the court said his face was not very clear in it. The court noted in both the orders that when the investigating officer was asked if the presence of the accused at Red Fort was a very grave offence and non-bailable, he was not sure of it. During the course of arguments, the investigating officer had submitted that the videos and photographs only showed the presence of Buta at Red Fort while his co-accused were giving interviews to the media. “Also, I have repeatedly asked the investigating officer if carrying a pharsa or talwar by Sikhs and Nihangs is prohibited upon which they are not very sure,” the judge said in the order on Maninder’s bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bail-for-2-in-red-fort-case-as-involvement-in-violence-not-clear/articleshow/84249687.cms||---

The boy was spotted at Aligarh’s railway platform early Wednesday and his parents were informed after he "willingly" gave information about them. The child, a student of class VI in a reputed public school in the capital, had fled from his Preet Vihar residence and boarded the Kalindi Express train. Luckily for the distraught parents, a passenger thought something was fishy and informed the Railway police about him. Later, police contacted his family and they rushed to Aligarh where there was a reunion. Talking to TOI, the boy’s father, who runs a family business in Preet Vihar, said that he had given the mobile phone to his son for attending his online classes during the lockdown. He said, “My son had downloaded the online battle game and got addicted to it. For updating the game, he needed money so he started stealing from home.” According to Railway Police Force inspector Chaman Singh Tomar, the boy had stolen and sold his mom’s gold chain for Rs 20,000. 'Free Fire' is described as an “ultimate survival shooter game”, where in-app purchases have to be made by the gamer to keep his "arsenal” ready with latest weaponry. The boy's father said his child admitted his crime and had run away from the house fearing that he would be caught. He boarded the train in Delhi but did not buy a ticket. When the train reached Aligarh, he stepped out on platform number 2 and started roaming around and was spotted there.

---||Kolhapur||Death for Kolhapur man who killed mother, fried & ate body parts||KOLHAPUR: A sessions court here on Thursday convicted and handed out a death sentence to a man for killing his mother after she refused to give him money to buy liquor. Additional sessions Judge Mahesh Krishnaji Jadhav held accused Sunil Rama Kuchkoravi (35) guilty of murder under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and referred to the case details while holding it as a `rarest of the rare case' as per the Supreme Court mandate for handing out a death sentence. The death sentence, however, shall be subject to confirmation by the Bombay high court, the judge said while pronouncing the verdict in an open court. The court upheld Kolhapur police's findings that Sunil gruesomely murdered his 63-year-old mother Yallama Rama Kuchkoravi around 2pm on August 28, 2017 (at Makadwala Vasahat in Kolhapur city). He later chopped parts of her body and ate some after frying them on a pan. Public prosecutor Vivek Shukla said, “We had sought the death sentence. There are precedents in ‘rarest of rare’ cases when hanging till death sentence is given. He murdered his own mother and desecrated the body in a way no one would imagine.” Inspector S S More of the Shahupuri police, who investigated the case, took help of DNA profiling in support of the case. “I have seen many murders and dead bodies in my career in Mumbai and in the naxalite areas of the state. This was the most cruel. We carried out stomach-wash, hand-wash and foot-wash and the samples were sent for DNA profiling. All samples matched with the deceased. We had 12 eyewitnesses on our side. Also, the scene at the murder site and the condition of deceased body were sufficient to prove the cruelty of the accused.” District superintendent of police Shailesh Balkawade announced a Rs 15,000 reward for More and his team for taking the case to its logical end. . The court has imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on Kuchkorvi and if not paid, he will have to spend six months in jail. Defence lawyer Vijay Lambore said, “The relatives of the accused are not satisfied with the verdict. They are going to appeal in Bombay high court. We have handed over all documents related to the case to the relatives for further legal steps they may want to take.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-man-sentenced-to-death-for-killing-his-mother/articleshow/84249663.cms||---

The number of active cases has shot up to 94,” block development officer Mahesh Patil said. The rise in the cases was related to social gatherings. “Since the number in Kokankhede village is high (over 15), we have completely stopped entry and exit to the village. This village has population of 1,500 and testing is being done. The affected family lives in the farm and is easily isolated,” said Patil. Kondhane village added 10 covid cases. Taluka health officer Dr Pankaj Thakre said that gram sevaks of 111 villages in the taluka have been asked to be vigilant of any gathering without prior permission. “The gram sevaks have been asked to summon the police-patil or the police station about any illegal gathering or overcrowding. Since such gatherings are on the rise, we have taken a strict stand,” he said. Dr Thakre added that if the norms related to marriages – weekdays till 4 pm only and not more than 50 persons – are not followed, action would be taken against all persons concerned. In the meantime, on the directions of chief executive officer of Nashik Zilla Parishad, Leena Bansod, the gram sevak of Hivarkhede has been issued a show-cause notice for not informing senior officials about a marriage celebration there that had led to rise in the cases on June 27.

The residents have been demanding it for the last two decades. The concerned authorities had turned a deaf ear to their pleas. Velus comes in ward no. 2 of the Valpoi Municipal Council (VMC). An administrative sanction of Rs 30 lakh has been given for the project which includes widening of the existing road and construction of the footpath with pavers over a stretch of 300m. Over the years, widening of the stretch between Kabrastan road till Hanuman Vidyalaya school could not take place due to varied reasons. It was a cause of worry for students who used to tread along this road during the peak time. The problem aggravated last monsoon when the road started flooding, putting the lives of students at risk. “Besides students, travellers were facing the problem while driving their vehicles on this route. So, we have begun the work of constructing footpaths with the help of local MLA Vishwajit Rane,” said councillor Ramdas Shirodkar. He said the work will be completed in two months. “After repeated requests, finally our demand will be fulfilled,” an elated Velus resident said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/road-in-velus-to-get-an-upgrade-soon/articleshow/84251954.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: CNG sales cross pre-Covid levels while petrol prices soar||AHMEDABAD: The sales of compressed natural gas (CNG) in Gujarat have bounced back and even surpassed its pre-Covid levels. Soaring petrol and diesel prices, demand growth after easing of curbs imposed due to the second wave of the Covid-19 as well as addition of new stations by city gas distribution (CGD)companies have pushed up CNG sales. State-run Gujarat Gas Limited (GGL) is currently recording average CNG sale of 13 lakh kilogram (KG) per day across the state, which are 8% higher than the average daily sales of 12 lakh kg in March 2020. The sales had even plummeted to 8 lakh kg a day in May last year amid the nationwide lockdown, according to GGL, which accounts for almost 57% of the around 789 CNG stations in Gujarat. Adani Total Gas Limited’s (ATGL) CNG sales volume across its network in India rose 7% at 75 million metric standard cubic meter per day (mmscmd) in the quarter ended March 31, 2021. The private sector company had registered CNG sales of 71mmscmd in the corresponding quarter last fiscal, ATGL said in its recent investor presentation. “The demand for CNG increased significantly over the past six months, especially since the prices of petrol went up. People often got their new or old cars fitted with CNG cylinders. There is a vast difference in the prices of CNG and petrol and the mileage is also better and therefore, people prefer CNG more, in a bid to save on costs,” said Dhimant Ghelani, general secretary, Federation of Gujarat Petroleum Dealers’ Association (FGPDA). According to industry estimates, CNG offers 60-65% savings as compared to petrol. While petrol prices have shot up and are hovering around Rs 97.35 per litre, CNG prices in Gujarat have remained stable in the range of Rs 52 to Rs 55 per kg in last nine months or so. ATGL on Thursday raised CNG price in Ahmedabad by 68 paise to Rs 55.30 per kg. The saving in CNG, however, is still very high as compared to petrol. The rush for opting CNG could be seen from the fact that about 30 vehicles used to be converted to CNG daily in Ahmedabad in pre-Covid times. As the petrol prices soared, this number doubled to 60 just before the second wave of the pandemic, said players in CNG retrofitting market. Apart from this, CNG usage has surged with people again going about their daily chores following the reduction in cases and easing of territorial restrictions. Given the state and central government’s push to clean fuel, overall consumption of CNG has gone up with CGD companies setting up more and more CNG stations across the country. In fiscal 2021, GGL, ATGL, Sabarmati Gas and Torrent Gas added new CNG stations across India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cng-sales-reach-more-than-pre-covid-levels-amid-soaring-petrol-prices/articleshow/84249679.cms||Kalpesh Damor

I gave him blessings of ‘rashtra deo bhav’ (nation is God). I also conveyed to him that I did not like his ‘DNA’ remark, but he (Bhagwat) did not reply,” Jagadguru told reporters on Wednesday night in Chitrakoot after meeting Bhagwat, who had earlier met him at his ashram. Jagadguru further said that he has been socially active in Chitrakoot since 1978 and had also initiated the formation of Chitrakoot Vikas Board. “However, despite all these efforts, I feel that the people of this place also require mental development which will lead to their social development. This will only be possible by following in the footsteps of Lord Ram,” he added. When asked about the issues which will be discussed in the annual RSS meet, he said neither he has been invited nor he intends to attend it. Earlier, during the hour-long meeting between Jagadguru and Bhagwat, discussions were held on a number of issues. At the meeting, the Jagadguru expressed concern over the division of Chitrakoot between UP and MP saying ‘this is causing neglect of development of the temple town and asked for its unification’. Meanwhile, a number of senior RSS leaders including Champat Rai, Dattatreya Hosabale, Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi, Krishna Gopal have also started arriving at Chitrakoot for the annual RSS meet to be held from July 8 to July 13.

The judge directed law secretary, Delhi government, to hold a meeting with relevant departments for setting up the system and called for a report within four weeks. “This would ensure that counsel are not made to run from pillar to post for submitting their bills, getting the same approved and thereafter, for following up on payment from the department/authority concerned,” the court opined. The law secretary is requested to join the present proceedings virtually on the next date in order to appraise the court of the recommendations made in the report, the court said.

---||Nagpur||Hackers may have targeted SBI ATMs in 10 more states: Nagpur police chief||NAGPUR: City police chief Amitesh Kumar said on Thursday the hackers gang busted by Zonal DCP Noorul Hasan’s team may have targeted SBI ATMs in at least 10 other states. The amount of cash pocketed by the gang from ATMs may run into several lakhs, the top cop said. Kumar said the RBI needs to be alerted regarding the security loophole in a particular brand of SBI ATMs, which is making them highly vulnerable across the nation. The same gang was also behind the theft of cash Rs6.30 lakh from a Solapur ATM through 63 transactions in the past. Hasan’s team on Wednesday netted Iqbal alias Panchhi Khan from Palwal in Haryana, from where two of his accomplices, Anees Khan and Mohd Taleeb, had already been nabbed earlier with the help of Mewat police. After the arrest of Iqbal, police also recovered cash Rs35,000 from his residence. Police said Taleeb had shared his wife’s ATM card with Iqbal and Anees, who had used it in Nagpur between July 14 and 17 to steal Rs6.75 lakh from four SBI ATMs. The gang, whose cellphone call details showed their presence in 10 different other states, would tour Mumbaj, Goa and other places for enjoyment before returning to their native place. An expensive car, worth Rs12 lakh, was also purchased by them. The car, now seized by the cops, was hypothecated to a bank to mislead investigations. Police had managed to trace the gang at Palwal in Haryana with the help of the detailed address and contact numbers furnished to the bank for hypothecation. In the meanwhile, police team with Anees and Taleeb is set to reach Nagpur late on Thursday evening and Iqbal would be brought on Friday by a different team.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hackers-may-have-targeted-sbi-atms-in-10-more-states-police-chief/articleshow/84249705.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC: Why is state human rights panel still headless?||Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Thursday asked the state government why it still has not appointed a chairperson for Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission (MSHRC), a post lying vacant since the last chairperson retired in January 2018.“My predecessor, Chief Justice Pradeep Nandrajog, had recommended three names. More than a year has passed since. Why is it taking so much time?” asked a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni. The state counsel sought time till Monday to respond to a PIL Vaishnavi Ghovale alleging that 50% of the posts at MSHRC are vacant. It was the first hearing. The bench, however, noted that the PIL was filed a month ago and asked what prevented the state from reacting so far. Vaishnavi Ghovale’s PIL, as argued by advocates Yashodeep Deshmukh and Vinod Sangvikar, raised concern that there is no bench available in terms of the Human Rights Act “to address human rights violations”. —Swati Deshpande||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-why-is-state-human-rights-panel-still-headless/articleshow/84251971.cms||---

---||Delhi||Man freed as Delhi cops failed to produce proof after 7 years of probe||NEW DELHI: Seven years after a man was booked for allegedly trying to rob a jewellery shop, a Delhi court discharged him of all the charges when police failed to produce any incriminating material against him. Metropolitan magistrate Nitish Kumar Sharma discharged 28-year-old Lalit Badhani of charges of theft and house breaking. “The accused has disclosed regarding the commission of the present case. However, during the investigation, nothing incriminating was found against him, except the disclosure statement. Keeping in view the facts, no charge can be framed against him under IPC sections 380 (theft in dwelling house), 457 (house breaking by night) and 511 (theft). He is accordingly discharged,” the court said. After the chargesheet was filed in 2014, advocate Manish Bhadauria, appearing for Badhani, had approached the court seeking his discharge on the grounds that there was no evidence and CCTV footage of the incident to prove his guilt. He added that there was only Badhani’s disclosure statement, based on which he was arrested. To this, the court had summoned the investigating officer (IO) and sought an explanation. Seven years later, the IO submitted before the court that nothing could be recovered from Badhani and nothing incriminating was found against him. The IO added that the application for getting the accused discharged could not be moved before as he had sustained some injuries and was bedridden. Badhani was arrested in 2014 after he allegedly disclosed before police about his involvement in the case. He was later granted bail the same year. According to the FIR, complainant Krishan Kumar claimed that, in January 2014, he saw the shutter of his jewellery shop in Khajuri Khas uprooted from one corner and some people were attempting to rob it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-freed-as-no-proof-after-7-years-of-probe/articleshow/84249826.cms||---

---||Mumbai||South Mumbai plot dereserved, mega SRA option opens up for builder||MUMBAI: The state urban development department has removed the reservations for a garden/park and green belt on a prime 2.5-acre Nepean Sea Road plot in south Mumbai, paving the way for full-fledged construction. Nepean Sea is one of the most expensive residential zones in the country, where new apartments command rates as high as Rs 1.25 lakh per sq ft. TimesViewMumbai has a murky history of land dereservation by successive state governments. Whenever public amenity reservations for gardens, parks and playgrounds are deleted, it raises suspicion about whose purpose it serves. The megapolis and its residents require open spaces as these are vital for their very survival and well-being.The sea-facing plot, close to Priyadarshini Park, is encroached by around 650 shanties and is owned by a private developer, Esarac Construction. The notification issued on April 12, 2021 signed by undersecretary Nirmalkumar Chaudhari says the land is reserved for “government staff quarters”, but this is only half the story. The deletion of reservations means the plot can also be redeveloped under the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) scheme. The builder can now avail huge development benefits to raise luxury towers in lieu of rehabilitating slum dwellers free of cost on a portion of the plot. This is the only such change of reservation carried out in the entire D ward—where this project is sited—in the city’s new development plan. “This is the first case in Mumbai where open space reservation of land encroached by slums has been deleted. Earlier, the authorities allowed slum rehab construction on 65% of the plot while leaving the remaining portion for public open spaces. This will open a Pandora’s box,” said property market sources. Due to deletion of reservations for public open spaces, the development potential of the plot is now worth several thousand crores. The urban development department notification said it sanctioned the new plan on the Nepean Sea Road plot after following the process of inviting “objections and suggestions” and consulting the director of town planning. Utsal Karani of NGO, Janhit Manch, said his organization had objected to the deletion of a green belt and a park/garden on the plot. “The green hill slope should be preserved for the stability and greenery of the entire area,’’ he said. In its written objection, Janhit Manch said, “There can be no new construction within 100 ft of foothills across the state. The area will have to be maintained as an open space and reserved as a no-development zone. The state urban development department has directed all civic corporations and councils across Maharashtra to implement the National Green Tribunal order.” Builder Rajat Patel, a partner in Esarac Construction, did not respond when TOI tried to contact him. However, in 2018, when this proposal was first mooted, he had told this newspaper that existing regulations permit a slum rehab scheme on a portion of the hill slope. “By changing the reservation of the plot, redevelopment will be allowed without leaving any open space for the public,’’ said an industry source, adding that owners of all such plots in the city will demand the same concession. “As per existing norms, the government was supposed to frame a policy by which all open spaces reserved in the DP Plan were to be used as playgrounds/open gardens. Slum dwellers were to be rehabilitated elsewhere in project-affected people (PAP) schemes across the city. This would have left the entire 10,000 sq mt plot as a garden for residents of ‘D’ ward,” a source said. The Nepean Sea Road plot was sold to Esarac Construction for Rs one crore in 2004 by the then owner, Mina Movaghar Fusade. The 10,433 sqm plot belonged to a Parsi, Savak Ratanji Bomanji, who sold it to Prince Sayajirao Pratapsingh Gaekwad in 1946. Gaekwad died at Cagnes Sur Mer, France in 1985, leaving behind his last will and testament in which he bequeathed the property to Mina Fusade. When Fusade sold the land to Esarac Construction in 2004, it was already declared a “slum” by the government and reserved for public purposes (recreation ground).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sobo-plot-dereserved-mega-sra-option-opens-up-for-bldr/articleshow/84252049.cms||Nauzer Bharucha
---||Mumbai||Bail denied to actor Ajaz Khan ‘exploiting boys and girls by giving drugs’||MUMBAI: In an order rejecting the bail plea of actor Ajaz Khan in a drugs case, the special NDPS court observed that as a seller, he was dangerous to society and exploiting boys and girls by giving them drugs. Khan had been arrested in March. “Persons involved in drug trafficking, peddling, financing and hatching conspiracy always take utmost care to hide their activities. They use code language and code words for their transactions. CDR and WhatsApp chats of accused also refer the same and the role of accused,” the court said. The court added that at this preliminary stage, it can be held with certainty that he forged prescriptions in his wife’s name. It is alleged that 31 alprazolam tablets weighing 4.5 gm were recovered. This qualifies as ‘small quantity’ of contraband under Narcotics Drug and Psychotropic Substances Act. The court also relied on the statement of an Ahmedabad-based doctor who denied writing the prescriptions. It held that the witness’s statement clearly indicates who Khan is and what is his position in life. The court said that the law and its process help those who approach with clean hands and not those who are motivated to grab a favourable order by hook or by crook. “Granting bail to such [a] person will amount [to] putting premium on the illegal act and unclean approach of the accused which will ultimately convey bad message to the law-abiding society...,” the court said. Seeking bail for Khan, defence advocate Taraq Sayed said that he was falsely implicated. It was also submitted that the tablets were prescribed for his wife. Sayed said the alleged contraband was of a small quantity and bail can be granted. The court noted that in a prescription of January 16, 2020, the volume of tablets is not mentioned in milligrams instead 20 doses are prescribed. The court held that no doctor ever prescribes such tablets without content in milligrams. It said that even handwriting in both prescriptions does not indicate they were written by any doctor. The court held that while prescriptions for his wife are of December 2020 and January 2021, 31 tablets were recovered in March and April 2021. “In my opinion, no evidence is required even to hold prima facie that these prescriptions are forged, fabricated...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bail-denied-to-actor-exploiting-boys-and-girls-by-giving-drugs/articleshow/84252089.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Moreover, a video went viral in Lalitpur district where a BJP candidate from Talbehat was seen snatching the nomination form from his rival candidate of SP in presence of police. As per reports, tension prevailed at Baragaon block since morning when BJP and SP workers came face-to-face during filing of nomination of the latter’s candidate, Rekha Yadav. Party workers along with sticks in their hand were seen shouting slogans and pushing each other on Kanpur highway. Similar scene was also seen at Chirgaon block where party workers from both sides were seen clashing with each other. Police had to resort to mild lathi charge to disperse the crowd. DM Jhansi Andra Vamsi and SSP Shivhari Meena were present at the spot to control the situation. Talking to TOI, DM Jhansi said that they are in process of lodging an FIR against the offenders and will take them on task. Former SP Rajya Sabha MP, Chandrapal Singh Yadav who reached at both the places, alleged that BJP workers were deliberately trying to stop his party candidate from filing nomination. In Talbehat block of Lalitpur district, BJP candidate Vijay Singh was seen snatching nomination form from SP candidate Rajdeep Singh Bundela in presence of police which led to chaos.

---||Aurangabad||Bombay HC orders probe into government medical college and hospital doctor’s attendance discrepancies||AURANGABAD: The Bombay high court bench at Aurangabad on Thursday ordered the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) to conduct a departmental inquiry into the discrepancies in the attendance record of Dr Ashish Bhivapurkar, head of cardiovascular thoracic surgeon department at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Aurangabad. The inquiry is to be conducted by officiating DMER director Dr Dilip Mhaisekar, the court said. The bench Justice Ravindra Ghuge and Justice Sanjay Mehare termed the discrepancies as ‘very unfortunate’ and said the same could be the proverbial "tip of the iceberg in the state health department." The bench was hearing a PIL filed by Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel seeking filling up of vacancies in the state health department. At a previous hearing of the PIL Jaleel had raised the issue of Bhavapurkar not regularly attending the GMCH or performing surgeries despite a huge monthly salary. The HC had then sought the surgeon's attendance details and had expressed its dismay over the surgeon not being a part of the hospital's biometric attendance system despite a state government resolution and guidelines of the Medical Council of India. The bench observed, "Dr Ashish Bhivapurkar after being transferred to the Aurangabad, GMCH, resumed duty after 13 months. On some of the occasions, he has signed on the attendance register for all 30 days while at the same time he missed important meetings in the capacity of HoD." The bench also observed that Dr Bhivapurkar has signed on the attendance register on Sundays, other public and national holidays like January 26 and August 15. It went on to express a strong reservation on certain pages of the attendance register wherein Dr Bhivapurkar first signed the register and later scratched them down. The bench directed the high court registrar to preserve a copy of the attendance record and in a sealed packet. Additional government pleader Sujeet Karlekar told TOI, “We have submitted that the onus of enrolling oneself for the mandatory biometric attendance system and maintaining the same is purely on an individual.” Jaleel had submitted a record citing that Dr Bhivapurkar was first transferred to Aurangabad GMCH in 2014 but he did not report for 11 months, before being retained back in Mumbai. The bench expressed their surprise after it found that this leave was approved as ‘extra ordinary leave’. Jaleel told TOI on Thursday, “Dr Bhivapurkar was transferred to GMCH, Aurangabad second time on June 7, 2017 but he resumed in April 2018. During this period he challenged the transfer order before MAT, Mumbai where the state brought on record the discrepancies in his biometric record and physical record apart from not being available during emergencies and also not being regular to hospital.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-orders-probe-into-gmch-docs-attendance-discrepancies/articleshow/84249756.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Hence people are facing a financial crisis as they do not have any other source of income,” the letter to the PM states. “Most of the businessmen had taken loans for their businesses from various banks, but unfortunately their businesses have been badly hit by the shutdown of the tourism industry making it impossible for all of them to pay the instalments of their loan amounts. Banks are calling upon them and declaring them as ‘NPA’. If they are declared as NPAs they won't be in position to get further loans. Currently it is difficult for the businessmen to survive and therefore there is an urgent need to address this issue for the survival of our Goan brothers,” the letter states. “It is my humble request to kindly look into this matter in the interest of the people of Goa and implement some scheme or moratorium on the loan amount,” Lobo’s letter states. Talking to reporters on Thursday Lobo said, “If there is no immediate relief, the tourism industry here may collapse because businesses will not be able to restart leading to large-scale unemployment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lobo-writes-to-pm-finance-minister-to-help-goas-tourism-sector/articleshow/84252123.cms||---

The study on about 1,000 patients was designed as a two-step tele-interview, based on symptoms recall to a set of questions, they said. Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director of Max Super Speciality hospital said long-Covid occurred in almost 40% of these cases. “Of the 990 patients studied, 31.8% patients had post-Covid symptoms beyond three months, and 11% of the patients continued to have some form of symptoms for as long as 9-12 months from the onset of disease,” Budhiraja said. He added that of the notable findings, fatigue was found to be the most commonly reported with 12.5% cases, followed by myalgia (9.3%). Persistence of breathlessness was also reported significantly more often in those who had severe disease at the onset, Dr Budhiraja said. The patients in the study group also reported neuro-psychiatric symptoms like depression, anxiety, “brain fog” and sleep disorder and persistence of breathlessness. The duration of symptom resolution was significantly associated with severity of illness at the time of admission, according to the study, which has been submitted to a journal for publication. However, there were no reports of severe organ damage from the study group, the healthcare group claimed. It was also noted that more than one-third (37.3%) reported at least one comorbidity at admission; diabetes (23.7%) and hypertension (20.4%) being the most common, the study said.

---||Hyderabad||Indian crew relieved as Ever Given sails||HYDERABAD: The all-Indian seafarer crew aboard ‘Ever Given’ are smiling again with the giant container ship setting sail after nearly four months. The vessel finally sailed on Wednesday after it ran aground in the Suez Canal on March 23. Abdulgani Serang, general secretary of Mumbai-based National Union of Seafarers of India (NUSI), said all the seafarers were in high spirits and thanked every person for the support they received during the turbulent period. “I spoke to the captain as the ship started proceeding on its voyage after nearly four months. All of them have a positive disposition,” Serang said. He said it was a big victory for the Indian seafarers who were professionally discharging their duties. “Their passion and commitment on Ever Given during the entire crisis is well acknowledged,” he told TOI. The crew were in touch with their families all through the period. There were 25 Indian crew members on board the ship. A week after it ran aground, the ship was given a refloat and has been in Egypt since then. With the owners entering into a financial settlement with the Suez Canal Authority (SCA), the ship set sail again on July 7, the NUSI said. Ship owner Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd was also appreciative of the crew. “We would like to take a moment to specially acknowledge the Ever Given’s master (captain of the ship), officers and crew who played a vital role in the safe refloating of the vessel and in her maintenance over the last months. We would further like to acknowledge the families of the crew who have faced the uncertainty of not knowing when their loved ones would return. We thank the crew of the Ever Given. Your hard work and professionalism exemplifies the very best of those who serve at sea,” the company said. Some of the seafarers were allowed to return home to India on medical grounds. The Indian seafarers community said some of those who were relieved were those who had completed their contract period while on ship. When the ship was at the Great Bitter Lake where it was taken to after it was refloated, another captain from India joined the ship. SCA, ship owner and Bernard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), the ship manager, did not give out the names of the captain or the crew of the ship. The authorities in India too chose not to make the names public. “BSM would like to take this opportunity to thank the master and crew for their resilience and professionalism,” Ian Beveridge, CEO of BSM, said. Ever Given will proceed to Port Said, Egypt, where a dive survey of the vessel will be completed. Subject to approval from the vessel’s classification society, Ever Given will then complete her voyage to the next port, the ship owner added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/indian-crew-relieved-as-ever-given-sails/articleshow/84249858.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The freak incident took place at around 11 am during the ongoing Covid 19 vaccination drive in Indra Hata village of Ajnar police station in Mahoba district, wherein Sangam’s mother Sheela along with her son had gone for vaccination at an ANM Centre in Mahoba district. As soon as news of the death of the boy spread, there was chaos all over the ANM Centre. By the time, rescue operation was launched, the victim succumbed to wounds. Angry over the death of the boy, the family members and locals staged a road blockade outside ANM Centre. On coming to know about the incident, SDM Kulpahar Suthan Abdullah and CO Tej Bahadur Singh reached the spot and pacified the agitating family members of the boy and got the road blockade opened. The police thereafter took the body in their possession and sent it for post-mortem. “It is said that Sangam’s mother was supposed to get a second dose of Covid vaccine. Sangam was the youngest of three children. We have assured the victims parents of the recommendation of release of necessary compensation,” said station house officer Ajnar Abhimanyu Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/boy-dies-in-freak-accident-at-anm-centre/articleshow/84252112.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||50:50 weightage to Gujarat CET, XII marks||AHMEDABAD: The performance in Class 12 and GUJCET will be considered equally for admissions to engineering courses. This was announced by the committee finalizing norms for engineering admissions including for those who cleared their Class 12 science with B group or biology subject. Every year a merit list for college admissions is drawn up by giving 40% weightage to percentile obtained by the candidate in GUJCET and 60% weightage to the percentile obtained in Class 12 (science) board exams. This year, the ratio will be 50:50. “The committee has decided to give equal weightage to Class 12 performance and GUJCET results. This new rule will be enforced this year as well as next year,” said Navin Sheth, vice-chancellor of Gujarat Technological University, who is the chairman of the 11-member committee formed recently after the announcement of mass promotion for Class 12 students. The academic performance of Class 12 students is evaluated on the basis of merit-based progression. The state-level exam is held annually for science students seeking admissions to degree engineering, diploma engineering and pharmacy courses in government, grant-in-aid and self-financed engineering institutions in Gujarat. Four members of the committee had suggested giving 100% weightage to GUJCET results. “Some members did suggest giving full weightage to GUJCET results for admission to engineering courses. But it was not a viable option as it would completely do away with the Class 12 results obtained by students by way of merit-based progression,” said Sheth. As many as 15 engineering courses have been shortlisted where students who opted for biology instead of mathematics in Class 12 can enrol this year, he said. They include dairy technology, rubber technology, biomedical engineering, agriculture technology, chemical and bio-chemical engineering, biomedical and robotics, bio-informatics, nano technology and textile engineering, among others. These candidates will have to attend a ‘bridge’ course in mathematics before taking admission in these engineering courses. For engineering courses like mechanical, computer science and civil engineering, students in Class 12 with biology subject will not be able to enrol from next year, according to Sheth. After cancelling board exams this year due to the Covid situation, Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board said it will use students’ performances in Class 12, Class 11 and Class 10 exams in a 25:25:50 ratio to evaluate their Class 12 results. The Class 12 results for science stream students will be announced in the second week of July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/5050-weightage-to-gujcet-xii-marks/articleshow/84249868.cms||---

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said there will be cloudy conditions with light to heavy rainfall in Nashik over the next two to three days. On Thursday, areas like Nashik Road, College Road, Cidco and other parts of the city received light to medium rainfall for 20 minutes to half an hour. Moreover, parts of talukas like Sinnar, Malegaon and Nandgaon also received light to heavy rains. Farmers, meanwhile, are cheering the revival of the monsoon. Bharat Dighole, the president of the Maharashtra onion farmers’ association, said that some villages in Sinnar, Nandgaon and Malegaon talukas received good rainfall, though other parts of the district are still waiting for adequate showers. “But the positive thing is that the monsoon has returned. It has given relief to the farmers who have already completed sowing,” said Dighole. Only 15% of the kharif sowing has been completed in the Nashik district due to the delayed rains. The kharif sowing activities will now gather momentum if the district continues to receive adequate rainfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-city-receives-light-showers-after-a-fortnight/articleshow/84249851.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Ahmedabad||Not inclined to cancel exams for repeaters: Judges||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Thursday said it was not inclined to interfere in the matter of Gujarat State Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board’s decision to hold pen-paper examinations for repeaters and private students of Classes 10 and 12. The president of an association of guardians of school students, Naresh Shah, filed a PIL and questioned the board’s decision of June 22 to hold in-person exams for repeater and private students between July 15 and 28, on the ground that students should not be put at risk amid the Covid-19 pandemic. He also sought cancellation of the exams, citing the board’s decision to grant mass promotion to regular students of Classes 10 and 12. The division bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Biren Vaishnavopined that these students are supposed to be studying throughout the year. They have already suffered by losing one or two years of their career. It said the petitioner cannot claim mass promotion for repeater students. The judges also said that if these students have any problems, they may approach the court. The chief justice said repeaters and private students form a different class. Regular students attended online classes, but these students did not. They need to prove their worth and therefore the test has to take place. The judges also said that children play cricket and the playgrounds of the city are full. When children are out playing cricket, why can’t they take exams. Moreover, the court also commented that the government is to take exams with Covid-specific SOPs in place. The pandemic situation is being closely monitored. If the government takes a decision, it must be conscious of the situation and the decision to hold exams must have been taken after due deliberation. The HC posted a further hearing on the issue on Tuesday, when the petitioner’s advocate has been asked to supply court orders in support of his demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/not-inclined-to-cancel-exams-for-repeaters-judges/articleshow/84249889.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ED gets nod to record Waze’s statement in laundering case||Mumbai: A special NIA court on Thursday allowed the Enforcement Directorate (ED) plea to record the statement of dismissed API Sachin Waze for three days in jail. The ED wants to confront Waze with the statements of former state home minister Anil Deshmukh’s then private secretary Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant, Kundan Shi-nde, in connection with a money laundering case. Palande and Shinde were arrested in June. The ED had recorded Waze’s statement earlier too. It had alleged that Palande had coordinated with Waze, DCP Raju Bhujbal and ACP Sanjay Patil to collect money from ‘orchestra bar’ owners, and hand it over to Shinde. It also alleged that Waze had said he had collected Rs 4.7 crore between December 2020 and February 2021 and gave it to Shinde. “It is apparent that Shinde is instrumental in collecting cash fr-om Waze on behalf of Deshmu-kh and assisted him in money laundering,” the ED had said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-gets-nod-to-record-wazes-statement-in-laundering-case/articleshow/84252190.cms||---

BJP uses pressure tactics against any leader who leaves the party. That is what is happening to Khadse,” said Bhujbal. He was talking to reporters separately after attending a programme in Nashik with former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis for the inauguration of the city bus service. Bhujbal said Khadse has repeatedly stated that there was no wrongdoing in the case but still the ED served him a notice. When any opposition leader joins BJP, the central agencies closes all cases in which the leader was being investigated. Later, Fadnavis told reporters “I am not the spokesperson for ED. The ED is following the law of the land. Moreover, BJP does not have the culture of vendetta politics.” Asked if the induction of Narayan Rane as cabinet minister meant that BJP and Shiv Sena would not come together, Fadnavis only said, “Our Prime Minister Narendra Modi had inducted Rane into the Union cabinet due to his calibre.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bhujbal-attacks-bjp-on-khadse-issue/articleshow/84249881.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||HC suspends externment order of a widow||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court has asked the state government to explain how a widow is expected to earn her livelihood once she is externed from the district over offences of bootlegging liquor worth Rs 60. The case involves one Hasumatiben Makwana (57) from Lakhi village in Bharuch district. She was booked by Bharuch Marine police station on six occasions, mostly for ferrying country liquor in quantity of three-four litres. Only once, she was allegedly caught with liquor worth Rs 1,600. On February 23, a sub-divisional magistrate ordered her to leave Bharuch district for six months. Makwana approached the high court through advocate Amit Chaudhary, who submitted that the widow is poor and lives by doing labour work. Once externed, it would be difficult for her to survive. Moreover, she was acquitted in two FIRs and she is on bail in other cases. After hearing her case, Justice Paresh Upadhayay sought the state government’s response “on the basis of the stakes involved in the matter” that Makwana was ordered to leave the district for six months. The judge also questioned “how the State visualizes the lady to earn her livelihood while being away from her home for six months”. The court also considered that most of the widow’s externment period is now over. But the court thought it fit to suspend the externment order while seeking explanation from the government for apparently being so harsh towards her. The government has been asked to reply by August 6, when further hearing has been posted. Before the high court, Makwana submitted that the magistrate issued her notice on basis of a report submitted by a police inspector. She was called but not given an opportunity to hire an advocate for her defence. Moreover, it was argued that mere registration of FIRs cannot be said to be proof that she is a dangerous person.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-suspends-externment-order-of-a-widow/articleshow/84249927.cms||---

He appeared for a company that owns and operates an online portal which filed a petition to challenge the constitutional validity of the new rules. So did a journalist Nikhil Wagle earlier, through his advocate Abhay Nevgi. Both questioned the rules as being violative of Articles 14 (right to equality), 19 (a) (freedom of speech and expression) and 19 (1) (g) (freedom to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business). Khambata and Mihir Desai, appearing for the owners of The Leaflet, in submissions before the Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni said the new rules would have a freezing effect on the basic fundamental rights of people. “The rules say if news organisations do not follow the code of ethics, then they are open to face prosecution,” Khambata said. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, for the Centre, however said there were multiple petitions across the nation in various HCs and a plea is being made to transfer them all before the Supreme Court. The HC thus adjourned the matters to July 16, as the SC is expected to hear the transfer petition on July 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/new-it-rules-an-assault-on-right-to-freedom-of-speech-hc-told/articleshow/84252369.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It pained us to see a large number of trees cut,” said Amit Pathak, a resident, who took up the matter with the BMC. Pathak said a site inspection was held following which a show cause was issued to the college. According to the notice, a copy of which is with the TOI, the BMC has specified that many trees have been cut from the roots, while the branches of many others have been illegally chopped off.Local corporator Pankaj Yadav said on checking with the college authorities he found that the contractor had “exceeded” his brief. “The trees were cut off unscientifically along with some trees on the roadside as well which were not harming anyone,” said Yadav.When contacted, assistant municipal commissioner Prashant Sapkale, in charge of K east ward, said they had written to the Jogeshwari police to register an FIR against the contractor under the Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, 1975. A ward official said the college had appointed the contractor and given him verbal instructions to trim the trees. The college authorities said they had only taken up trimming of trees, but the contractor hacked them. College principal Dr. Swati Wavhal said they had replied to the civic notice stating it was the contractor who had excessively cut the trees.“Following Cyclone Tauktae several trees and branches were hanging precariously over the staff quarters. Viewing it as a risk, we sought the BMC’s permission to trim them. The contractor cut the trees instead,” Wavhal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-seeks-fir-against-contractor-over-tree-felling-on-college-campus/articleshow/84252225.cms||Richa Pinto

CM Mamata Banerjee will send bhog that will be offered to the Trinity after which the convoy will roll. This is a marked shift from the traditional celebrations where the Rathas would wind over a 9km route and rest at a designated spot on the Maidan, which is treated as Gundicha Temple or the Lord’s aunt’s house, according to popular Vaishnav lore. Last year, too, the Rathayatra was cancelled because of the pandemic and Iskcon organised pujas inside the Albert Road temple and toy rathas were symbolically used. “However, we did not want the 50th year celebrations to pass like this and hence this plan of a convoy with a KP pilot car in front,” said Radharaman Das, vice-president of Kolkata Iskcon.

---||Allahabad||Trial run of cargo booking from Civil Enclave begins||Prayagraj: After receiving the nod form the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) for handling cargo services from Civil Enclave, Bamrauli, the Airport Authority of India (Prayagraj region) authorities have decided to start the service on an experimental basis. Initially, cargo booked from the airport by local businessmen would be delivered at their final destination via passenger planes. A proposal for starting cargo flight connectivity between Prayagraj and other cities in the country was sent to BCAS in November last year. After getting the green signal from the security bureau, the cargo service has now been started. Although the cargo is presently being transported through passenger aircraft only, in due course service providers including Indigo and Alliance Air, a subsidiary of Air India, would be operating sole cargo flights to and from the city. However, this would greatly depend on the volume of cargo that is booked to and for the city. Local businessmen have expressed happiness despite the fact that presently it is a trial run and regular bookings would start from July 15. The airline companies are still making the assessment of the volume of business that the Sangam city would have in offing, depending on which operation of a full-fledged cargo service would be introduced in the city. Presently, the cargo is being transported by passenger flight to cities including Pune, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Raipur, Delhi, Bhubaneswar, Dehradun, Gorakhpur and Bhopal. Besides, Alliance Air is also operating for Delhi and Bilaspur and taking cargo bookings. The cargo facility from the city has been made possible after the active involvement of UP minister for civil aviation, Nand Gopal Gupta ‘Nandi’. “We have started cargo flights from the city. The facility would be of immense benefit for providing new markets, both nationally and internationally, to the products of the region very much on the lines of Varanasi, wherein veggies and fruits have found new markets in the western countries as well,” Nandi said. Regional director of AAI (Prayagraj) Anchal Prakash said, “After the approval from the security bureau, the cargo facility is being handled by service providers operating from the Civil Enclave.” The airport authority also plans to build a separate terminal at Prayagraj’s Civil Enclave to start a regular cargo carrier. The terminal would have all the facilities needed for handling cargo including a warehouse, entry-exit, parking, etc., to keep the goods coming and going from the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/trial-run-of-cargo-booking-from-civil-enclave-begins/articleshow/84252269.cms||---

Another old boy of IIT-Kharagpur, from the 1981 batch, has donated Rs 61 lakhs for a chair professorship to his alma mater on Thursday. This is the 25th year of the 1992 batch and the alumni have chosen to celebrate the occasion by collecting funds for the institute. Apart from the specific request of creating a chair, the batch has left it to the institute to utilise the funds for tech upgrade and remodelling of the infrastructure wherever required. “We are extremely proud of our 1992 batch. It was our 27th batch and how they have come forward to pay back to their alma mater!” said acting director of the institute, Subir Bhattacharya. “We will probably set up hybrid classrooms given the demand of the times. In a hybrid classroom, while some students can be attending physically, the rest can join from different locations,” explained Manish Thakur, dean (new initiative and external relation) of IIM-C.

---||Goa||South Goa selected for PM insurance scheme for farmers||Quepem: The Union government has selected South Goa for the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana scheme. It aims at supporting sustainable production in agriculture by providing financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/damage arising out of natural calamities like hailstorm, drought, floods, cyclones, heavy and unseasonal rains, attack of disease and pest. Deputy chief minister and agriculture minister Chandrakant ‘Babu’ Kavlekar said that farmers have to pay only 2% premium to the insurance company, and in case of any disaster, the insurance company will pay the balance assured amount. The state and the Centre will bear the insurance amount equally. Future Generali India Insurance Co Ltd, Mumbai in Goa has been appointed for the period from 2019 to 2022. The Quepem MLA urged the farmers to avail various agricultural schemes which are in force including purchase of tractor and other machineries at subsidised rates. He flagged off the awareness drive in the presence of director of agriculture Neville Alphonso at the Quepem municipal building on Thursday. The government has declared insurance cover to farmers for different types of crops in both Kharif and Rabi seasons. Kavlekar also flagged off a special vehicle which will cover all the panchayat areas in south Goa for educating the farmers in respect of insurance schemes. During kharif season 2021, farmers have to pay Rs 1,335 as premium for rice crop and the sum insured is Rs 66,750. The premium for groundnut crop is Rs 950 with the sum insured of Rs. 37,500, while Rs 6,000 as premium for sugarcane with the assured sum of Rs 1,20,000. The last date for enrolment is July 31, 2021. Alphonso said that out of 2,518 farmers, only 658 farmers have been the beneficiaries of the insurance scheme so far. The amount received by these farmers for their 1,358 hectares of land is just Rs 13.91 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/south-goa-selected-for-pm-insurance-scheme-for-farmers/articleshow/84252304.cms||---

On Tuesday evening, the doctor found that the bulbs in her bedroom and bathroom of her shared quarters were not working. When an electrician unscrewed the bulbs, he found wireless spy cameras in the holders. The cameras had battery backup and were installed with memory chips. The doctor immediately approached the police on Wednesday morning. “We are working on some clues after questioning a few people on the premises. Our investigation is on the right track and we will soon nab the culprit,” deputy commissioner of police (Zone II) Sagar Patil said. The hospital’s deputy medical director told TOI, that they have instructed staff living in the quarters to start using their own locks and not the ones provided by the hospital. “We have also ordered CCTV surveillance in the corridors and on the premises. There is adequate security deployed in the staff quarter areas,” the deputy medical director said. Senior police inspector Jagannath Kalaskar said the complainant shares the quarters with another woman doctor, who had left for duty well before the complainant left at 9am on Tuesday. “We suspect the culprit must have entered the quarters sometime between Tuesday evening. We are trying to ascertain how the culprit gained access to the quarters. We cannot rule out the possibility of the culprit possessing a duplicate key,” senior inspector Kalaskar said. “The security guards manning the quarters did not notice anyone moving in a suspicious manner around the premises or any outsider entering the premises,” Kalaskar said. The police have registered a case under the provisions of the Information Technology Act and under Section 443 (house trespass) of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/doctor-finds-spy-cams-in-bathroom-bedroom-of-her-quarters-in-hospital/articleshow/84250037.cms||---

The incident was reported around 10.30am on Thursday from the Shahid Colony area close to Paikpara under Chitpore police station area. Police have identified the victim as Moon Moon Das (36). She had married the accused, Sanjoy Das, when both were minor. “It seems there were some personal disputes between the two. We are not yet certain if there was any suspicion of an illicit affair behind the murder,” said an officer. The couple’s son, Shubam Das, who works as a delivery boy for an e-commerce major, had left the home early. Sanjay, who plies an auto between Pyarabagan and Sinthee Crossing, was still at home. “Moon Moon was getting ready to leave for work. She worked at a cake shop outlet. It was then that Sanjay strangulated his wife, ensured her death and started out for Chitpore police station. It was around 11am when he walked inside the police station and told the duty officer that he had murdered his wife,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/auto-driver-kills-wife-walks-to-police-station-to-surrender/articleshow/84247734.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: JNPT lifts veil over mangroves, says it has 913.6 ha in RTI reply||Navi Mumbai: The Jawaharlal Nehru Port at Nhava Sheva has 913.6 hectares of mangroves under its jurisdiction, said JNPT in an RTI reply, and denied reclaiming land for its SEZ. This is a breakthrough, said environmentalists, as the exact quantum of mangroves within JNPT, the country’s largest container port, is now known. The port has been under pressure from the state government and activists to hand over the mangroves, decared reserved forest, to the forest department. “We filed the first appeal under RTI as JNPT had said earlier it had no record of the mangroves under it and deleted the reference to the sea forest from its website,” said NatConnect director B N Kumar. “I guess the forest department can now take over the 913.6 hectares of mangroves for conservation as a reserved forest.” JNPT, facing a contempt petition filed by Vanashakti for its alleged failure to transfer the mangroves despite a Bombay high court order, says it is the forest department which has not yet taken possession. In response to another RTI query, JNPT informed NatConnect that it has been allotted 277.4 hectares for its port-based SEZ project and it had reclaimed ‘zero’ land. “We sent photographic evidence of debris being dumped on mangroves and lush green areas converted into man-made deserts,” Kumar said. The environment department has said MCZMA has not given any clearance for road development on mangroves at Ulwe and landfill at Sawarkhar. NatConnect, Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan and traditional fishermen’s forum Paaramparik Machhimar Bachao Kruti Samiti have approached the CM over, what they call, destruction of mangroves in the ecologically sensitive Uran taluka. “We are not against work that ensures local socio-economic development, but these projects are impacting the lives and livelihoods of the people who have been living here for ages,” the activist said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-jnpt-lifts-veil-over-mangroves-says-it-has-913-6-ha-in-rti-reply/articleshow/84252339.cms||Vijay Singh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Cops to write to BJP on fake counsel’s claims||KOLKATA: Police will write to Bengal BJP and the Centre to understand whether Sanatan Ray Chaudhuri faked his political links and to know if he was at all a CBI special counsel at any point of time. Investigators questioning lawyer Sanatan Ray Chaudhuri, who is reportedly practicing at Calcutta high court and Supreme Court and arrested by Gariahat Police for alleged cheating and impersonating a standing counsel of the state government as well as a CBI special counsel, have now stumbled upon his two email IDs that show his attempted correspondence with several political leaders, central agency officials and government employees. Based on the findings, Gariahat Police, who have been interrogating him for the past 72 hours, now plans to get in touch with the state BJP unit to ascertain whether Chaudhuri indeed was a primary member of the party as he had claimed. They will also ask if Chaudhuri held any portfolio in the party. “It is not that we will be writing to BJP alone. We are also writing to the central ministry of labour and justice if he was indeed a standing counsel for the central government. He has made similar claims about the state government too and their reply is equally important. CBI has already informed us that he was never a special counsel for the agency,” said an officer. BJP has already denied such links and has blamed the ruling party for allowing these cheats to prosper. “When the money from Sarada dried up, Trinamool leaders set up a factory to make fake officers. The result is bogus officers across the state,” said BJP leader Joy Prakash Majumdar. Given the importance of the email IDs, cops plan to write to Google for help, a step already undertaken in the fake vaccine accused Debanjan Deb’s case. This technical evidence, along with the analysis of his bank accounts and the financial transactions, will help them learn about the financial condition of Chaudhuri. This will also help establish the money trail. Tirthankar Roy, Chaudhuri’s lawyer, has challenged the state to prove documentary evidence of Chaudhuri’s alleged crimes. “There is little evidence against him. A property-related civil case is being turned into a criminal one,” said Roy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-to-write-to-bjp-on-fake-counsels-claims/articleshow/84247779.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Allahabad||Bijli sakhis realised Rs 49L power dues in less than 5 months||Prayagraj: Move to rely on women power to realise electricity dues from rural residents is paying off. Select groups of rural women engaged as ‘Bijli Sakhis’ (a state government’s initiative) has resulted in collection of power bills worth over Rs 49 lakh from rural areas of the district. This amount has been realised from areas like Soraon, Koraon, Meja, Karchana, Mauaima and Pratappur development blocks in Prayagraj between February 1 and June 15 this year, despite the raging pandemic. Around 102 women working in ten groups managed to realise the whopping amount from 5,274 consumers, and in turn, earning Rs 2.5 lakh as commission for themselves. Ranjana, a 30-year-old resident of Dhokari village in Phulpur development block and mother of two kids aged 10 and 7, is busy doing her job as a bijlee sakhi these days. Every morning, she quickly finishes off the household chores and leaves for her government job. Starting from 10 am, Ranjana visits home after home walking long stretches under the scorching sun, reading electricity meters and generating bills on a smart device hanging around her neck. After collecting the billed amount, she deposits it at the local power department office on all working days.  “The experience is new but empowering. Before this, my home was my entire world. Looking after the needs of my two kids and my husband Shauki Lal, a vegetable seller, was all I have done for the past 11 years now. I completed my BA but never worked,” shared Ranjana. NRLM’s district mission manager, Amit Shukla, expressed happiness over the performance of the rural women. “We had given training to 115 women to work as bijli sakhis in Prayagraj, and 102 out of them have already started reading electricity meters, generating bills and collecting due amounts. The fact that they have earned a commission of Rs 2.5 lakh for themselves in less than five months despite the Covid-19 is pandemic is worth applauding,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/bijli-sakhis-realised-rs-49l-power-dues-in-less-than-5-months/articleshow/84252317.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Job racket cuffs on ex-constable||KOLKATA: The anti-rowdy section of the detective department has nabbed a gang of four — including a former Kolkata Police constable — who was running a “police recruitment centre” in a hotel at Chandni Chowk and passed it off as the DSP office from where they issued fake appointment letters in the name of Bengal Police and the Kolkata Police. The accused even supplied khaki beret cap and belt to pass the letters as original. The gang had cheated several youths during the Covid period of Rs 35 lakh. The accused have been identified as Rabi Murmu (40), Masud Rana (24), Subhro Nag Roy (44) and Paritosh Barman (50). A resident of Gazole in Malda, Murmu has been identified as the former Kolkata Police constable who was suspended in 2011 for indulging in fraud practices. Rana hails from Ranitala in Murshidabad, Roy from Gaighata and Barman from Pingla in Midnapore. “We are ascertaining how this group was formed in the first place,” said an officer. Amongst the accused, Rana had claimed himself to be the DSP of the West Bengal Police Recruitment Board and moved in a car marked as “government of West Bengal”. Barman acted as the linkman between job aspirants and the gang, charging Rs 6.5 lakh from each. Around Rs 1.9 lakh in cash, documents like fake police ID cards in the name of Rana, fake appointment letters, khaki beret caps and belts were seized from them, said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. A case of cheating was recorded at the Bowbazar police station on Thursday soon after the accused were nabbed on the basis of a complaint by one Samaresh Mahato (20), a resident of Salboni in West Midnapur. “The accused brought the aspirants to Kolkata to hand over their fake appointment letters. The gang told the victims that they will be sent for training to Halishahar. When days passed and they were not asked to report there, the victims decided to approach the police,” claimed a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/job-racket-cuffs-on-ex-constable/articleshow/84247758.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Goa||Goa: Deadline till July 19 to bid for Dona Paula convention centre||PANAJI: The state government has once again extended the last date to receive bids for construction of the mega convention centre at Dona Paula to July 19 due to the pandemic. The estimated cost of the project is over Rs 800 crore. The state government received responses from 15 companies at the pre-bid meeting. “We will open technical bids on the same day,” a senior officer said On January 14, the public-private partnership (PPP) cell of the state government held a virtual pre-bid meeting with companies and answered their queries related to the project. Over five years after outlining plans to construct the 5,000-seating capacity convention centre, the state government floated a tender in December to set up the facility. In the first phase, along with the convention centre, a multiplex and a five-star hotel has been proposed at Dona Paula in an area of around 97,000 sqm. Earlier, the project was proposed in 2.9 lakh sqm land, which was earmarked for setting up the Rajiv Gandhi IT Habitat. The first phase of the project will cost around Rs 800 crore, and depending on further expansion plans, the cost will increase and it will be borne by the bidder. Recently, the state cabinet approved the re-engagement of Knight Frank (India) Private Limited as the project consultant. Initially conceptualised in 2015, the project went through a lengthy bureaucratic process and was shunted between departments before landing with the PPP cell. In 2018, when the Economic Development Corporation (EDC) was responsible for the project, 25 firms had shown interest. These included ITC, Inorbit, Strong Australia, Dempo Group, HKS-US, Essel, Hiranandani Group, Chowrangee Group, L&T, Amanora, Zee and Feedback Infra. EDC’s proposal, estimated at Rs 1,400 crore, had also included an indoor film shooting shed, Entertainment Society of Goa office, Iffi office since Goa is the permanent venue for the festival, and the smart city centre of excellence. The land for the project is already in possession with the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/deadline-till-july-19-to-bid-for-dona-paula-convention-centre/articleshow/84252375.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune vax testing lab to go live ‘in two weeks’||PUNE: The two new labs set up by the Centre to assess quality of Covid vaccines will soon be ready to start their tests, a top official has confirmed. Renu Swarup, secretary, Department of Biotechnology said the lab at the Pune-based National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS) will be ready to start testing vaccine batches in the next two weeks. It will be joined by a unit at the Hyderabad-based National Institute of Animal Biotechnology (NIAB), which is set to start testing vaccines by August, she said. The government has set up the NCCS and NIAB labs as Central Drug Laboratories (CDLs) for quality control of vaccines via batch testing. Since the start of the Covid outbreak last year, the country has been relying on only one CDL — at Kasauli in Himachal Pradesh — for the testing and pre-release certification of immunobiologicals (vaccines and antisera) meant for human use in India. Once testing begins at the NCCS and NIAB, it will help rapid release of more vaccines, Swarup said. Vaccines are tested for each batch, not for the number of doses. The number of doses depends on the batch size for each vaccine and the capacity of the manufacturer. Both the upcoming facilities can test up to 60 batches of vaccines per month which could be scaled up, Swarup said. Vaccine expert, Gagandeep Kang, said, “It is good to have more labs to lessen the load on CDL, Kasauli. The addition of two facilities will ensure faster approvals at a time when many companies are producing vaccines or planning to do so.” She added that new labs should maintain standards that are “internationally acceptable for testing vaccine batches”. “There should not be any haste to create more vaccine testing facilities over what India currently has, because it is important to maintain quality and high standards,” Kang said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-vax-testing-lab-to-go-live-in-2-weeks/articleshow/84250058.cms||Neha Madaan

The current weekly positivity rate is 4.9% in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC areas and 5% in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) areas. Both the rates are slightly down from what it was in the previous weeks (see graphic). However, the weekly positivity rate in the rural areas is 7.3%. A district administration official said it seemed unlikely that the levels of relaxations would change this week, as there was no marked decline in the weekly positive rate from the last week. “The final decision will be taken by the elected representatives at the meeting to be headed by the deputy chief minister,” the official said. A senior PMC official said, “The restrictions are as per the state’s directives. It has put all the major cities in the Level 3 category. More relaxations in the civic areas are unlikely.” PCMC chief Rajesh Patilsaid, “The weekly positivity rate is still around 5%. It needs to dip further. Till then, the citizens must ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour.” Federation of Trade Association of Pune president Fatechand Ranka said, “We want to operate from 11am to 7pm and have raised the demand” Technical adviser to the state Dr Subhash Salunkhe said there has not been any significant dip in cases and the curbs were unlikely to be eased. Joint CP Ravindra Shisve said many often cited reasons for visiting medical and other essential shops.

Tope told TOI, “We have issued directions to districts to increase laboratory set-ups or get more mobile laboratories to enhance RT-PCR tests. All the laboratories have been directed to optimise the capacity to at least two lakh tests per day.” Health officials said all districts had been asked to ramp up testing facilities by connecting with nearest districts. “Under Pune division, Solapur and Sangli have requested for more collection centres so that they can use laboratories in Pune,” a health department official said. In the first week of July, Rapid Antigen Tests (RATs) comprised 53% of all the Covid tests conducted in the state. Just 14 districts conducted more than 50% RT-PCR tests. Most RT-PCR tests were conducted in Parbhani (85%), closely followed by Nagpur (83%), Pune (63%) and Mumbai (61%). Solapur district conducted the lowest RT-PCR tests — just 13%. State public health officials stressed that the districts of concern remained those conducting less than 25% RT-PCR tests. (See graphic) Tope, the health minister, sought real-time update of the test reports on the public health portal. He also said the hospitals overcharging patients would face action.

The authorities are now planning to put the massive waste generated by these animals to good use as clean energy, by setting up biogas plants that will convert dung to electricity to power villages in the region. In the first phase, the Centre has sanctioned Rs 35 lakh for the first such plant in Gaurikund. Located at 6,000 feet, the plant will be able to process 1,250 kg of dung per day to produce 50kW of electricity, enough to power 25 houses and provide them with cooking gas, said officials. The electricity from the plant will also power lamp posts enroute the Himalayan shrine for better visibility. At present, the waste generated by animals is littered across the trek route until rains carry it into the river Mandakini that flows through the area. The green initiative is also aimed at keeping Mandakini clean. “With the biogas plant, we can achieve the twin objective of effective mitigation of pollution and conservation and rejuvenation of river Ganga and its tributaries like Mandakini,” Rohit Jayral, monitoring and evaluation officer, Namami Gange (Uttarakhand), told TOI, adding that more such plants are in the pipeline. A private agency will build the plant and operate it with the help of local residents who will be hired to collect waste and deposit it in the plant. Currently, officials of the Namami Gange are in Kedarnath to generate awareness about the initiative among local residents. Residents and environmentalists have welcomed the move. Director in charge of GB Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment (NIHE), Kireet Kumar, said, "The project should be rolled out across the ecologically sensitive Himalayan belt." He added that such projects were required to protect our environment and also to generate income and livelihoods for those living in remote regions. Soni Devi, pradhan of Gaurikund, added that she had previously highlighted the mule waste problem to the Namami Gange authorities. “We had approached them to find a way to get rid of the litter which was spoiling the aesthetic beauty of the route. We are very happy with this solution,” she said. Rudraprayag district authorities said the plant would pave the way for sustainable growth. District magistrate Manuj Goyal said, “Kedarnath has a small hydel plant but soon the electricity demands of the area will be met via sustainable means like a biogas plant.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/green-energy-at-6k-feet-mule-dung-based-biogas-plant-to-power-villages-en-route-kedarnath/articleshow/84245542.cms||Shivani Azad

The cut-outs of the two players have been put up at the entrance of the general manager’s office of NCR and at the gate of the DRM office. Locals can be spotted taking selfies with these cut-outs and cheering for the team. “In order to boost the enthusiasm of our players, Gurjit and Nisha, who have brought laurels from across the world in the game of hockey, NCR has started installing their cut-outs at several places. This has been done with the intention of promoting the game and instilling courage and zeal in the players,” said chief public relation officer (CPRO) of NCR Dr Shivam Sharma. This initiative is being carried out by all the three divisions of NCR at the stations under their jurisdiction, he added. Similarly, a selfie point has been made at Prayagraj Junction so that people can take selfies with the cut-outs of both the players. Cut-outs will soon be installed at other important stations of the NCR as well, including Kanpur Central, Etawah, Tundla, Aligarh and Mirzapur, besides Prayagraj Chhioki of Prayagraj division. Gurjit from Ajnal village of Amritsar (Punjab) is a senior clerk in the personnel department of DRM office in Prayagraj division, and Nisha from Sonipat (Haryana) is a senior clerk in the commerce department of DRM office, Prayagraj. “It’s a proud moment for us because both these players are posted in our city. Locals are happily taking selfies, and many are even making the selfies as their DP on social media platforms, This way, they are celebrating the achievements of these players even before the start of Olympics,” said public relation officer of Prayagraj division, Amit Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/ahead-of-oly-residents-take-selfies-with-cut-outs-of-women-hockey-gems/articleshow/84252404.cms||---
---||Delhi||Work Hand In Hand Or Side BySide: SC To AAP Govt & Centre||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday expressed its anguish over the constant bickering between the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi and the Centre, saying no governance model requiring collaboration can work “if either of the two sides take a ‘my way or the highway’ approach, which both seem to have adopted”. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy said the hybrid model of governance for Delhi had worked well for many years even with different political dispensations in power at the Centre and the state. “But the past few years have seen an unfortunate tussle on every aspect with the state government seeking to exercise powers as any other assembly and the central government unwilling to let them do so,” it said. “We may record that the central government and the state government have been unable to see eye to eye on governance issues in Delhi. This has been responsible for a spate of litigation, and despite repeated judicial counsel to work in tandem, this endeavour has not been successful,” it said. The bench referred to several rounds of litigation between the Centre and the Delhi government for equitable sharing of constitutional power and jurisdiction and said that it was amply reflected in the genesis of the impasse over the assembly’s peace and harmony committee, headed by Raghav Chadha, allegedly straying into issues of law and order. This was also reflected in issues relating to Delhi Police concerning Delhi riots, it said. “We may note that the long and repeated battles between the state and the Centre appear to have cast a shadow even over the well-meaning intent of the committee to assess peace and harmony as reflected in the terms of reference,” it said. Turning to the AAP government, the SC said: “The political dispensation which is in power in the state has to recognise the constitutional scheme of division of powers in Delhi which circumscribes their ability to work only within those powers. When they got elected, they knew what they were getting elected for – not what they thought should be the division of powers.” Addressing the Centre, it gave a similar suggestion: “On the other hand, the central government is required to work in tandem, albeit with a different political dispensation. Maturity is required from both sides and we have to reluctantly note the absence of such maturity in this important inter-relationship. To work well, the central government and the state government have to walk hand in hand or at least walk side by side for better governance.” “The failure to do so is really a breach of their respective electoral mandates. The seven Lok Sabha seats are all held by the powers-that-be in the central government but a very different result came in the assembly elections. This has seen a repeat. It’s a reflection of the maturity of the electorate which has chosen to put one dispensation in power at the Centre while seeking to choose another in the state as the roles are divergent. The concerns are different,” said the SC. “The two powers unfortunately do not seek to recognise this aspect, and that is the bane of this structure requiring collaboration and concurrence. Unfortunately, it has become an endeavour to score points over the other. Some prior discussion and understanding could easily solve this problem instead of wasting large amounts of judicial time repeatedly arising from the failure of the two dispensations to have a broader outlook. In fact, the current round is, in our view, arising from the petitioners (Facebook) seeking to take advantage of this divergence of views and their inability to see a common path,” the SC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/work-hand-in-hand-or-side-byside-sc-to-aap-govt-centre/articleshow/84250119.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Yadav’s to-do list: End labour pain, ensure greener world||NEW DELHI: Bhupender Yadav, the new environment minister, took charge of his ministry on Thursday amid challenges to deliver on multiple fronts. Earlier in the day, the minister took charge of the labour and employment ministry. As environment minister, Yadav will have to focus his attention on taking strict air pollution abatement measures in cities, striking a balance between development needs and environment protection, and ensuring India reaches its goals under different global commitments on biodiversity and climate change. After taking charge, Yadav, a member of the Rajya Sabha, said he would make all efforts to deliver on the responsibilities given to him by the PM Modi. Before assuming charge, he planted a sapling inside the premises of environment ministry at Indira Paryavaran Bhawan in Jor Bagh in south Delhi. “Before taking charge as Union minister, had the privilege of meeting BJP President @JPNadd ji. Also, met my organisational colleagues. I offer my thanks to each one of them for their trust and guidance,” he tweeted. Yadav, who replaced Santosh Kumar Gangwar as labour minister, joined the ministry along with his deputy Rameshwar Teli. Yadav joins the environment ministry at a time when it is facing flak for diversion of wildlife habitat and forest lands for different infrastructure works during the pandemic-hit year when movement was restricted to assess the ground situation before taking any key decision. “The government is committed to sustainable development,” he tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/yadavs-to-do-list-end-labour-pain-ensure-greener-world/articleshow/84254901.cms||---

We are stocking the vaccines before we begin vaccination again,” said a senior Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) hospital. In all, 24.99 lakh individuals have received their first dose while 6.16 lakh received their second vaccine dose.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BJP broadens community reach for BMC polls with Rane, Kripa||Mumbai: After the induction of former chief minister Narayan Rane into the Union cabinet and former Congress strongman Kripashankar Singh into the BJP, the party has begun preparations for next year’s BMC polls. With Rane’s elevation, the BJP will look to keep the Shiv Sena in check by wooing its Konkani voters. Singh’s entry should help the BJP consolidate the North Indian vote. Both these voter groups play a significant role in the BMC election and can swing close to 100 of the 227 seats. While the BJP already has a strong support base among the Gujarati and Marwari community, the party is expecting to deploy Rane and his MLA son Nitesh against the Shiv Sena and Singh against the Congress. The BJP already has Malabar Hill MLA Mangal Prabhat Lodha as its city chief to make sure its grip on the Gujarati and Marwari community remains intact. In the 2017 BMC polls, the Shiv Sena had swept the Marathi heartland of Dadar, Parel and other localities in central Mumbai. The Shiv Sena also did well in Maharashtrian pockets in the western and eastern suburbs. Political observers said that with the Ranes and Singh on board, the BJP will look to give its campaign a targeted push. “The elevation of Narayan Rane and induction of Kripa will surely have an impact on the BMC election,” Birju Mundra, a political analyst, said. “Both netas will be deployed by the BJP. However, the BJP will have to tactfully ensure that its own bench strength is utilised. The BJP will have to get the insiders and outsiders together and stake a balance. If this is not done, then there will be widespread infighting and the party may face rebellion.” Singh, a face of the North Indian community, is known for his reach and mass networking within the voters from UP and Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-broadens-community-reach-for-bmc-polls-with-rane-kripa/articleshow/84252437.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Delhi||Late Evening Showers Give Delhi Respite||New Delhi: Delhi recorded yet another heatwave day on Thursday, with hot and humid conditions in the first half sending the maximum temperature beyond 44 degrees Celsius in parts of the capital. However, a duststorm and light showers later in the day brought slight respite in some parts of the city. A spell of rain is predicted from Friday to Wednesday. Met officials say mercury will start dropping from Friday, owing to a change in the wind direction and an increase in rainfall activity, with the southwest monsoon forecast to cover Delhi on July 10. After recording some rain in the evening, Delhi also saw a duststorm and another spell of light rain in some parts on Thursday night. India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted the maximum may drop to around 34 degrees Celsius over the next few days. A senior Met official said the forecast on the arrival of the southwest monsoon on July 10 was on track, with no heatwave days expected in the coming week. “There will be a change in the weather from Friday. The maximum will drop to around 39 degrees Celsius by Friday and to 37 by Saturday. Light rain is expected from Friday evening and night, while light-to-moderate rain is expected on Saturday,” said the official. If the monsoon indeed hits Delhi on July 10, it will be the slowest onset in the last 18 years, since 2002 when it had reached the city on July 19. The normal date is June 27, meaning the monsoon has been delayed by almost two weeks. IMD had earlier forecast an early arrival, by as early as June 15. However, the progress was halted in the second week of June and its movement in north India has been extremely slow. Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station, recorded a maximum temperature of 41.8 degrees Celsius, five degrees above normal, on Thursday. Najafgarh was the hottest location, touching 44.1 degrees Celsius, followed by Mungeshpur at 43.6. Gurgaon recorded a maximum of 43.7 degrees Celsius. The high maximum temperature combined with high humidity levels, which oscillated between 35 and 59% through the day, made any outdoor activity uncomfortable. Between June 29 and July 2, Delhi had recorded four consecutive heatwave days, with the maximum crossing 45 degrees Celsius in parts. IMD considers a heatwave day when the maximum temperature is 4.5 degrees or more above normal. The delayed monsoon has meant July is recording a rain deficit so far, just as June did. While Delhi has only received 24mm of rainfall so far this month, the normal mark until July 8 is 38.6mm, marking a deficit of 38%. June, too, saw a deficit of over 30%, with scattered spells of light rain seen across Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/late-evening-showers-give-delhi-respite/articleshow/84250305.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Max Corporate didn’t have valid documents, still allowed to do tests by Kumbh mela administration: Haridwar DM||HARIDWAR: Initial investigation in the Maha Kumbh Covid-19 testing scam has indicated that the mela health department allowed Max Corporate Services, the firm accused of conducting over 1 lakh fake tests, to come on board even though it did not have valid documents. This was revealed by Haridwar district magistrate (DM) C Ravishankar to TOI on Wednesday. Speaking about the progress of the probe, the DM said, “It has been found that the firm, Max Corporate Services, was not eligible to get empanelled for conducting Covid tests during the Kumbh but was given the contract. The mela health department’s role is suspicious in this regard and is being thoroughly probed.” The health departments of the district administration as well as the Kumbh mela administration had together empanelled 22 path labs for Covid tests during the mega event that was held from April 1 to 30. The Kumbh mela health department had in late December last year issued an advertisement for empanelment of path labs that were ICMR-approved. Max Corporate Services had applied in response to this advertisement and had submitted an expression of interest (EoI) on January 11. According to the DM, Max Corp Services’ EoI should not have been entertained by the Kumbh mela health department since the firm is not an ICMR-approved entity. Kumbh mela health officer Dr Arjun Singh Sengar, when queried about the issue, said, “The empanelment of Max Corporate Services was done in a proper manner as they applied along with Nalwa Laboratories and Dr Lalchandani Labs, both of which are ICMR-approved labs. The scam happened because the district administration, which had the responsibility to check the test details being filed by the path labs on the online portal, failed to do so.” Meanwhile, opposition Congress has alleged that documents related to the scam were being "manipulated" by officials and demanded that those under whose watch the scam happened should be replaced at the earliest to ensure a fair probe. Congress leader Sanjay Paliwal told TOI, “Without the replacement of the officers of the mela and district administration, a fair investigation is not possible as important documents are being distorted to influence the probe.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/max-corp-didnt-have-valid-docus-still-allowed-to-do-tests-by-mela-admin-dm/articleshow/84245569.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Dehradun||In Uttrakhand politics, shift in power balance to Kumaon after Ajay Bhatt becomes part of Modi cabinet||DEHRADUN: The balance of power in Uttarakhand politics has shifted to Kumaon region from Garhwal with Nainital MP Ajay Bhatt’s inclusion in Modi cabinet on Wednesday, days after Khatima MLA Pushkar Dhami, also a Kumaoni, was made the CM. Garhwal and Kumaon are the two major regions of the state and there has always been a sense of competition between the two areas. Since the past few years, the political heavyweights in the state have been from Garhwal. With the exit of Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, who hails from Pauri in Garhwal from the Modi cabinet and the ouster of Trivendra and Tirath Rawat – both of whom also hail from Pauri – the political spotlight seems to have shifted from Garhwal.  Incidentally, BJP has placed its bets on Kumaon after a period of nearly two decades. Bhagat Singh Koshyari was the only leader of the party from Kumaon who made it to the CM’s chair in 2001. The party’s other five CMs —Nityanand Swami, BC Khanduri, Nishank, Trivendra and Tirath — hailed from Garhwal. In contrast, the Congress stalwarts have hailed from Kumaon. These include Narayan Dutt Tiwari, the only CM in the state to complete a full tenure of five years from 2002 to 2007, as well as Harish Rawat, who was CM for three years from 2014 to 2017. Vijay Bahuguna was the only Congress CM, who was from Garhwal. In Tirath's brief tenure, Haridwar MLA Madan Kaushik was made the state chief. It resulted in the CM and the state chief coming from the same region. “There are several factors behind the focus on Kumaon by the BJP. Trivendra announced Gairsain commissionerate and made Almora a part of it. This led to a strong resentment in Almora. Secondly, a number of party MLAs were not pleased with the developments in the last four years and had even approached the party’s national leadership. Thirdly and more importantly, Harish Rawat has been active in Kumaon belt and in the last few months, built a strong momentum for the Congress. Therefore, the move to give key posts to Dhami and Bhatt may be an effort to strengthen the ruling party in Kumaon,” political analyst Jay Singh Rawat said. He further pointed that the Garhwal region has remained a strong forte of the BJP “but there were some concerns in Kumaon as far as electoral gains are concerned”.  .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-ukhand-politics-shift-in-power-balance-to-kumaon-after-ajay-bhatt-becomes-part-of-modi-cabinet/articleshow/84247850.cms||Kautilya Singh

Speaking to TOI, he said that he had raised concern over the issue at the online meeting with all collectors and commissioners. “We should assess why there is a high positivity rate when the state has increased vaccination in these districts. Officials said that more cases have been reported from Kolhapur from among those below 45 years. They said that many people above 45 years have been vaccinated and they are now focusing on inoculation of those above 18 years,” said the health minister.“The public health department and the state task force are studying the situation in Kolhapur, Sangli, Ratnagiri, Raigad, Sindhudurg, Palghar and Pune (rural),” said state task force member Dr Shashank Joshi .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/task-force-focus-on-areas-with-high-infections-after-most-jabs/articleshow/84250118.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Dehradun||We will talk less and perform more: Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami||In one of his first media interactions after taking over charge of the state, Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami spoke extensively to TOI about his priorities for the state and how he is planning to tackle dissent within the party from seniors, many of whom were reportedly unhappy over his elevation. Excerpts: You have limited time at hand —just a few months are left before assembly elections happen. How are you planning to make the most out of your tenure? In the next few days, I will start my tour to different parts of the state to take first-hand account of the work that needs to be done. Let me be clear. We will not stop at laying foundation stone but will complete projects within the next couple of months and dedicate them to the people of the state. I come from a humble background. I was born in the border district of Pithoragarh and my work area is Khatima on the India-Nepal border. I have stayed in almost all districts and covered all blocks. I want to send out the message that we will not work like a ‘sarkar’ but rather as a sajhedar (partner). I know the steps that need to be taken to reach the last village in border districts. We will speak less, perform more. What led to changing three chief ministers in an election year? Do you think that will reduce your party’s prospect of winning? Some situations arose which led to these changes. However, only the face has changed, the dedication towards people and development still remains the same. It needs to be remembered that it was and still is a BJP government. A large number of development works have either been completed or are underway. No one can ignore these facts. The work started by Trivendra Singh Rawat and Tirath Singh Rawat will be continued and completed in my tenure. We are committed to providing a corruption-free, transparent government. Did you have any inkling that the party would be selecting you for the top job? Honestly, I was not aware of it till the time the BJP legislature party meeting started to select a new leader. But yes, I was aware that my name was being considered. Now that I have been given this opportunity, I will ensure I do a good job There was some resentment amongst senior ministers after your name was announced as CM. How are you preparing to tackle that?  I have an extremely experienced team, which is a major bonus. All of them are experts of different sectors and have been in politics for a long time. We had a meeting, and it was decided that the focus will be on time-bound completion of projects. There are no disputes or differences between us. We will work together to usher in an era of development in the state. You are the youngest CM of Uttarakhand. What are your plans for the welfare of the youth? In the very first cabinet meeting, we have approved 22,000 jobs for the youth. The initial target is to provide employment to 13,000 people and then increase the target to 25,000 jobs. Our focus is on employment and self-employment. Due to Covid-19, some recruitment exams were cancelled or postponed or people could not apply. Keeping these factors in mind, we have decided to give a one-year age limit relaxation to aspirants applying for government jobs. We will soon pass a proposal to this effect in the cabinet. It will immensely help a number of job aspirants. What are your priorities and immediate focus areas? People have lost their jobs due to Covid-19 and it is important to provide them relief. Besides, Char Dham Yatra has to be resumed, we will file a review petition in the High Court for a phase-wise start to the yatra. The pilgrimage is a major source of earning for lakhs of people and we are making efforts to open it for pilgrims at the earliest. When Uttarakhand was created, tourism and energy were the two major sectors for revenue. Tourism has been adversely affected by Covid-19. Therefore, it is extremely important for us to revive tourism and start the yatra for pilgrims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/we-will-talk-less-and-perform-more-uttarakhand-chief-minister-pushkar-singh-dhami/articleshow/84247895.cms||Kautilya Singh

They have challenged the state government’s decision to register FIRs against 799 such doctors for not reporting for Covid-19 duty, when they were called in the first week of May following a surge in Covid-19 cases.The doctors’ counsel, Sanjay Hegde, cited an example of famous boxer Mohammed Ali, who had refused to draft himself for military service and invited the wrath of the US government. He further submitted that Ali was a conscientious objector, but there is no law here binding the doctors, who can either serve in rural areas or pay the amount of bond. He raised a question whether the government can ask them to join Covid-19 duty.To this, the chief justice immediately commented, “More than the government, your fellow countrymen need that you come and serve this time. Can you say that I will not serve the society when I have taken the benefits... and today when government is making request for one-year service and you are saying no.”The senior advocate argued that many doctors are serving patients in their respective fields. By leaving their patients and by joining Covid duty, they might be doing injustice to the society. The chief justice said that they could have accepted the request and then challenged it. They could have expressed their preferences, which the government might have considered. “Your resistance of not even coming forward is what troubles us…at least tell the government that I am not running away from serving the government, why showing the resistance and not coming forward is not very acceptable and warranted.” He said that the resistance is not appreciated.Justice J B Pardiwala of the bench questioned the state government whether it still requires the services of the bonded doctors on emergency basis, when Covid-19 cases have gone down and conditions have improved.The court asked the state government to file a reply to various petitions and posted further hearing on July 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/troubled-by-bonded-docs-resistance-to-covid-duty-hc/articleshow/84252731.cms||---

Surprisingly, four fake Gram Rakshak Dal jawans attended work at Aslali police station in Ahmedabad district for around a month and nobody knew about it till their identity card numbers were found to be duplicates. According to an FIR filed at Aslali police station, where these four persons worked, a cop suspected that the accused — Sunil Parmar, 27, Vishal Parmar, 22, Hardik Parmar, 24, and Mahesh Parmar — all residents of Vatva, had been working with fake identity cards. An armed head constable of the GRD, Jalusinh Chauhan, went to Aslali police station and checked their details. It was then revealed that they were serving at the police station using fake identity cards. “When their registered ID card numbers were put in our system, four other GRD cops were found to be registered with the same numbers. Police personnel questioned the four about their credentials and learned that they got the identity cards by paying Rs 15,000 to a man named Jashwant Makwana,” said an Aslali police cop. He said that apart from Makwana, a resident of Vivekanandnagar, Manish Prajapati, 30, a resident of Sanand, Amit Raval, 25, who had earlier worked as GRD and Home Guard jawans, allegedly provided details of their identity cards and got printed them at a government press. Another accused, Jitu Parmar, 22, a resident of Mahij village in Kheda district, helped the accused to pick a police station. “The four had been ‘working’ for a long time, between 20 days and a month, and also got paid their daily wage of Rs 230. They were even used in bandobust atLambha temple during a fair,” said a cop. GRD jawans are used as additional forces at police stations under a district headquarters. They are deployed at traffic points, during bandobust for social, religious and political gatherings and also at check posts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/4-fake-grd-jawans-work-at-police-station-for-a-month/articleshow/84252719.cms||---

We, thus, wish to give quietus to the case,” observed a division bench comprising Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh. The bench, however, has placed on record its appreciation for senior advocate Rupinder Khosla, who examined various issues and assisted the court as amicus curiae and senior advocate Anupam Gupta who had appeared in a related matter. In March, the HC had taken cognizance of the issues regarding the facilities and infrastructure available in the states of Punjab, Haryana and UT Chandigarh to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. On March 25, the HC had appointed senior advocate Rupinder Khosla as amicus curiae to assist the court. Since then, various directions were given by the HC from time to time as the situation demanded and as per assistance/suggestions given by amicus curiae and other lawyers. “We are happy to note that the directions were carried out and as per Khosla, learned amicus curiae, inhabitants of the states under jurisdiction of this court got much needed relief,” observed the bench while closing the petition. During the hearing of the case, the bench also refused to pass any order on an application in which a lawyer of the HC was seeking directions on the similar issue. The HC, however, turned down his plea but he was insisting on hearing of his plea. On this, the HC, on the previous date of hearing of the case, had asked the advocate general (AG) Haryana to inform the court about the antecedent of the petitioner lawyer. When the matter came up for hearing on Thursday, Haryana AG B R Mahajan apprised the court that the applicant had never espoused any social cause and on the other hand, he was a “habitual litigant”. HC was also informed that in a case, while dismissing his LPA, a division bench of the HC had imposed Rs 50,000 cost on him. “However, as we have given a quietus to the main case, we do not wish to pass any further order in the application,” observed the HC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cases-down-hc-closes-petition-on-managing-covid/articleshow/84250205.cms||---

Earlier this week, the civil aviation ministry increased domestic flight capacity from 50% to 65%, notwithstanding a potential third wave. The total daily flight movement from Pune is expected to increase from 54 to more than 60, a source at the airport told TOI. “A new flight will connect Pune with Nashik and Belagavi (Karnataka) from July 12,” an official said. Another flight will connect Pune with Surat from July 16. “This flight will fly four days a week. Pune will have fresh connections to Ahmedabad and Gwalior from the same day, three days a week,” the official added. Pune airport director Kuldeep Singh said airlines will soon share their plans. Around 108 flights (both arrivals and departures) were planned to and from the Pune airport during the summer schedule, which came into effect on March 28. “The airport is operating half the flights planned in the summer schedule. Flight movements reduced drastically in May compared to earlier months due to the second wave. However, there has been a 100% increase in monthly passenger traffic in June,” another official said. Currently, Pune has direct and connecting flights to Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Kochi, Prayagraj, Jabalpur, Lucknow, Darbhanga, Patna. Passengers have sought more flights to popular destinations. “With travel stabilising, airlines should look at restarting flights to popular destinations,” working professional Nimish Kamte said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lohegaon-airport-to-get-5-new-domestic-flights-this-month/articleshow/84250211.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Delhi||Delhi man’s son writes to Noida DM on ‘hate crime’||NOIDA: The son of a 62-year-old Delhi resident, who has alleged he was subjected to communal abuse during a loot incident in Noida last Sunday, has approached the district magistrate Suhas LY, seeking his intervention to curb “hate crimes”. Kazim Ahmed was on his way to Aligarh and had got into a car believing it was a private shuttle, but was robbed by the occupants. Ahmed alleged they pulled his beard and stripped his pyjamas during the assault. Police had, however, described the communal abuse allegations as an “afterthought”. “It is a criminal incident, which is being given a communal colour. There are many things that seemed to have come out as a result of afterthought,” additional CP (law and order) Love Kumar had told TOI earlier this week. Ahmed’s nephew Aamir Khan said they had sent a complaint to Sector 39 police station in Noida and also to the police commissioner. Noida police said they have a general diary entry of the incident and no FIR has been filed. No case has been filed under sections of loot (IPC, 392) or causing hurt (IPC, 323) either for the robbery. In the complaint to the DM, Ahmed’s son Arham Mustafa has stated that his father was brutally beaten up and abused over his beard, attire and religious identity. “However, the police behaved very insensitively as they didn’t do anything, forget about acting on his complaint and taking him to the hospital for medical treatment. They just left him by asking his name, address and father’s name. My father is 62 and he has not been properly heard, not even given basic treatment on humanitarian ground. Somehow, he reached home and we treated him. We ourselves took him to the local hospital for MLC on July 5 (sic),” reads the complaint. “My father is traumatised and he couldn’t go to the police station for the FIR. Somewhere, his trust is shaken due to police’s insensitive attitude when reached out to them just after the incident despite his injuries,” Mustafa said. The complaint also seeks action against the cop deployed near the robbery spot for negligence and not taking following procedural protocols. Police say they have received a written statement from Jamia Nagar police station in Delhi in which Ahmed has not mentioned he was robbed of Rs 1,200 after he boarded the car near the Sector 37 bus stand on Sunday morning. Additional DCP (Noida) Ranvijay Singh said the complainant had been giving conflicting statements. “We have received a formal police record from Jamia Nagar police station, which recorded his statement. In that statement, there is no mention of loot of any money or belongings and it only talks about how he boarded the vehicle and was assaulted. We have made a general diary entry and are conducting an inquiry as the complainant is giving conflicting statements to the media and police. We condemn it as they are trying to give a different colour to the issue.” Singh said. The DM told TOI he will forward the complaint to the police when he receives it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-mans-son-writes-to-noida-dm-on-hate-crime/articleshow/84250232.cms||Shikha Salaria

---||Nagpur||Forest secretary asks Chanda officials to prepare roadmap for stalled projects||NAGPUR: Principal secretary (forests) B Venugopal Reddy on Thursday asked Chandrapur forest officials to prepare a roadmap to expedite stalled projects in Chandrapur, including relocation of villages from Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR). Reddy is on a three-day visit to the city to review various projects and ongoing schemes being implemented by the forest department. On Thursday, he visited Chandrapur and took first-hand information on Bamboo Research Training Centre (BRTC), botanical garden on Ballarpur Road and forest academy. Recently, former minister Sudhir Mungantiwar had voiced concerns over the state government scuttling projects like botanical garden, forest academy and BRTC by not releasing additional funds for them. Sources said the projects were lingering due to cut in funds in the last two years due to Covid-19. The forest secretary asked officials to take fire safety measures and to submit what they want from the government. As forest minister, Mungantiwar had released over Rs 118 crore for the botanical garden, Rs 74 crore for BRTC and Rs 150 crore for the academy. But he said the MVA government was not releasing sufficient funds for these projects. Sources said Reddy also visited Karwa village on the fringes of Tadoba to discuss its relocation. Karwa is an island and doesn’t have any human habitation in its 10km radius. If the village is relocated, Tadoba will be one of the best tiger reserves in the country as tigers will get more space, and help curb man-animal conflict. The secretary also called to expedite the relocation of Rantalodi and Kolsa, both villages in the core area of the park. On May 24, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had called to expand Tadoba by expediting relocation of one village from the buffer zone and two villages inside the core. While Kolsa relocation is being still discussed, Rantalodi spot has been decided. Sources said, “Though the land area which Tadoba will gain from Karwa’s relocation will be around 250 hectares, its ecological value will be far more as relocation will stop poaching, illicit felling and conflict. The village has already given its consent two years ago.” On Friday, Reddy will visit Gorewada and will discuss the Forest Conservation Act in road development and wildlife issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/forest-secy-asks-chanda-officials-to-prepare-roadmap-for-stalled-projects/articleshow/84247969.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Pune||Reinfection rare, immunity lasting in those who contracted Covid-19, finds Pune study||PUNE: Long-term follow-ups of over a 1,000 people from Pune, who have recovered from Covid, suggest that reinfection after recovery is rare and natural immunity after illness could be long-lasting. The research (still in pre-print) by epidemiologists and community medicine experts from D Y Patil Medical College and Hospital tracked 1,081 residents of the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) from last September — when they had shown SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during a sero survey — to June this year. Live: Coronavirus pandemicOnly 13 of the 1,081 study participants went on to test positive for Covid again during the nine months of study — a 1.2% reinfection rate, the research found. Importantly, the second bout of Covid in all 13 was mild and they went on to recover fully. Read also: Post-vaccination mistakes that put you at the risk of reinfectionExperts said such studies have important implications for countries that have had a high number of Covid cases but limited vaccine supply. By giving priority jabs to those who haven’t yet contracted Covid — people without the natural immunity — governments can achieve herd immunity faster, at minimum expense, they said. “The bottom line is, given the low rate of reinfection, people who have recovered from natural infection should be at the back of the queue in the vaccination programme,” said clinical epidemiologist and the study’s lead investigator, Amitav Banerjee. Sero survey reports from different parts of the country, including the latest one from PMR, indicate IgG antibodies in 70-80% of the population. “So, we should first target the remaining 20-30% people, which will save a lot of resources and, at the same time, help achieve 100% population-level immunity,” Banerjee said. As to the possibility of a third wave, Banerjee said, “Given the level of almost 80% seropositivity in the population after the second wave, we should not expect a third wave immediately this year.” Commenting on the Pune study, Delhi-based epidemiologist Sanjay Rai, professor of community medicine at AIIMS, said, “The evidence shown here is in line with evidence available from global studies.” Infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari, member of the National Task Force on Covid-19 said, “The results are in line with emerging data on reinfections from around the world. Reinfections are rare among those who have recovered from Covid-19.” More studies are indeed needed to accurately determine risk of reinfections, especially in the context of new variants. “Until more data is available, individuals who have recovered need to adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour and get vaccinated in due time,” Pujari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/reinfection-rare-immunity-lasting-in-those-who-contracted-covid-19-finds-city-study/articleshow/84250238.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Police said that the criminals slit the throat of the elder man identified as Madar Yadav when he was sleeping outside the house. Reports said that the slain elderly man after having dinner had gone to sleep outside the house on Wednesday night. In late-night hours, after the family members heard the cries of the elderly man, they rushed to the spot and spotted three to four men surrounding Yadav. The elderly man was found bleeding profusely and the unidentified persons found at the spot also pelted stones on Madar Yadav's family members, after the family members tried to catch them. Initially, police investigations revealed property disputes might be the reason behind the killing of the old man. Locals told police that family members of Yadav had a dispute with some people over the construction issue on disputed land a few days back and police had warned both the parties. However, Yadav's murder created panic in the village, and locals have demanded police higher-ups to crack the incident at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/elderly-man-murdered-in-pratapgarh/articleshow/84252521.cms||---

He asked the officials to co-ordinate with their counterparts in neighbouring states after which a final decision would be taken. The Uttar Pradesh government has already announced that it will allow the yatra from July 25.  As reported by TOI, UP CM Yogi Adityanath had spoken with Dhami earlier in the week and requested the latter that kanwarias from his state should be allowed in limited numbers to travel to Haridwar to collect water from the Ganga. Subsequently, Dhami called the meeting on Thursday in which a detailed discussion was done regarding the yatra. In the meeting, attended by chief secretary SS Sandhu, director general of police Ashok Kumar and other senior officials, the CM said that all factors, including Covid-19, should be kept in mind, while deciding on the conduct of the yatra. The officials present at the meeting gave a detailed presentation to the CM on the expected number of pilgrims, key routes, security arrangements and other factors. Notably, the Tirath Singh Rawat government had suspended the yatra in the wake of the Covid-19 scare. The yatra was suspended last year, too, due to the coronavirus situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kanwar-yatra-likely-from-july-25-dhami-asks-babus-to-prepare-talk-to-other-states/articleshow/84245744.cms||Kautilya Singh

Meera of Mali Mohalla of Tonk, who makes mud utensils, also sells the products in Rajivika mart and the colectorate canteen to support her family after her husband lost his job because of lockdown. In a first-of-its-kind for women empowerment, Tonk collectorate has started mahila canteen and mart where women can sell their home-made products such as soaps, pickles, masala and other products under Rajivika mission of the state government. The canteen is run by women to promote small-scale women groups. To participate, self-help groups even from Devali, Uniyara and Malpura are coming to sell their products through Rajivika mart and canteen. “We have decided to market these products so that the handicraft of Tonk and even eatables reach different parts of the country,” added Suresh Gupta of Tonk Vyapar Mandal. District project manager of Rajivika, Mukesh Chawala, said the mart was now providing things like bathing soaps, pickles, porridge, cereals, utensils made of mud and even spices. “The trend is good and businessmen are purchasing things in bulk,” added Chawala. Tonk zilla parishad CEO Sumya Jha said they were looking for more platforms to markes such items as a lot of women are interested in selling their homemade products in the mart and canteen, which were launched on July 1. “There is a enthusiasm in women as they were starting their own work. Importantly, most officials of the district are women and therefore they understand the feeling of women in need,” added Jyoti of panchayat samitti Kankod. She added that previously women were not having any such platform and therefore they lost interest in homemade products and were trying to search employment in the construction sector. “Now we are working as our own boss,” said Kavita of Malpura self help group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/selling-homemade-goods-tonk-women-become-their-own-boss/articleshow/84250247.cms||---

Speaking on the five-year journey, Dr Gill said, “Five years ago, Jaipur was a relatively new space for us as far as healthcare was concerned, but as a group we were not new to healthcare. Our flagship hospital, CMRI, Kolkata, is 51-year old and the BMB Heart Research Center is more than 30-year old. This was the expertise we brought in, when we set up this hospital. The journey has been an interesting one.” On the eve of the 5th anniversary, the hospital gave a platform to people, who were treated for Covid, to speak about their experiences in the presence of physicians who treated them. “My compliments to the entire doctors and nursing team because stories like these are what motivate us to keep pushing towards excellence, despite facing multiple challenges,” added Dr Gill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rukmani-birla-hosp-to-invest-in-tech-coo/articleshow/84250279.cms||---

Interested applicants can apply from July 12 on the official website of the municipal corporation. The last date of filing online application is August 3. The 200 newly-advertised posts of firemen are beyond the 81 firemen posts, which were advertised earlier and for which the authority received 16,508 applications. Besides, there are 46 posts of drivers beyond four posts advertised earlier, against which 125 applications have been received. Three posts of station fire officers (SFO) are beyond the single SFO post advertised, against which 78 applications have been received. “Since the sanction of these new posts came later, after the decision of posts advertised earlier, they have been advertised now. Exams for these posts will be conducted along with the previously advertised posts. Since these are new creation of posts as per requirement, qualification and other requirements are the same as those advertised with earlier posts. Those who have already applied for these posts need not apply again,” a senior official said. Terms and conditions for all the posts, including reservation criteria, age, educational qualifications etc will remain the same as those advertised earlier. These have been sent to PU, which will conduct the exams. Almost all departments are struggling with manpower crunch but the fire and emergency services department is the worst affected. Since there was no recruitment of regular firemen to tackle fire cases, the department, looking into related aspects since 2010, had to hire people on outsource basis against vacant posts. There is also a huge dearth of clerks in majority of the wings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/staff-crunch-in-fire-dept-200-firemen-46-drivers-posts-advertised/articleshow/84247994.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: ‘Dead’ man walks to cops, wife held for Rs 18 lakh insurance fraud||AHMEDABAD: A 45-year-old woman from the Kathwada area of the city forged her husband’s death certificate and obtained Rs 18 lakh insurance amount after dumping him three years ago saying that he is an unemployed man and he does not have any right to stay with him. The woman Nanda Marathi and a doctor from the Satellite area of city, Harikrushna Soni, a resident of Sushmita Apartment on the Judges Bungalow Road in Satellite, were caught by the city crime branch for fraudulently obtaining the death certificate of the complainant, Nimesh Marathi, 48, a daily wager from the Saijpur Bogha area. Police said that Nanda Marathi first approached another wanted accused in the case Ravindra Kodekar, a resident of Sardarnagar, who introduced her to the doctor. She obtained a death report from the doctor which stated that Nimesh died of cardiac arrest on March 6, 2019. Nanda and Kodekar then obtained a death certificate from Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and later in August 2019, she got insurance amount from the two private insurance firms, said a police officer. In his FIR with the detection of crime branch (DCB) police, Nimesh said that he had bought two life insurance policies around 15 years ago and his wife Nanda was the nominee in both the policies. “Around three years ago, after both of our daughters got married and settled at their houses in Ahmedabad city and Bhavnagar city, my wife told me to go to my native place in Burhanpur of Madhya Pradesh as I did not have any regular income,” said Nimesh before the cops. Nimesh added that his wife told him that they were living in a rented house and it would be difficult for them to pay the rent as he was not earning money. “I accepted her proposal and went to Burhanpur whereas my wife went to my daughter’s place in Kathwada. When I returned around three months later, she did not allow me to enter the house and pushed me out of our place taunting me that I am an unemployed man,” he said before the cops.

---||Rajkot||Rajkot Municipal Corporation clueless on how many did not get jabs||RAJKOT: The mandatory vaccination deadline for traders and factories draws nigh, but the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) is blissfully ignorant of how many staff could not be vaccinated because of shortage as it has no data. Forget data, it does not even have a category of this kind generated during the survey conducted last year on how many people were to be vaccinated! The government defined super spreaders and mandated factories to make jabs compulsory or face closure in order to arest the spread of virus. It put a deadline of July 10 by which employees working with traders and in small scale factories in GIDC areas were told to take vaccination. All roadside vendors too fall in the mandatory vaccination category. “There is no category of super spreaders in our list and because of that we have no data to show how many of them are vaccinated and how many are not,” a senior RMC officer told TOI on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, owing to shortage of vaccines, centres in Rajkot were reduced to 32 from 62 and all the camps planned by social organization and trade association too were postponed. Rajkot Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RCCI) on Thursday shot a letter to the state government asking to extend the deadline till July 31. Parth Ganatra, vice president of RCCI said “The authority should help us to get our people vaccinated rather than issue mere mandates to get people vaccinated. The authorities should vaccinate our people on the spot who are yet to be vaccinated rather than taking coercive action.” There is resentment among traders as they have to give compulsory leave to employees who are not vaccinated. Process is closed in the entire state for three days which is giving them a feeling of helplessness. Divyesh Patadiya, president of Rajkot jems and jewellery association, said, “We are asking the authority to organize a camp for our association. We will provide all facilities so that all those who are left out including our workers can be vaccinated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rmc-clueless-on-how-many-did-not-get-jabs/articleshow/84245775.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||SPV formed for running six colleges under NEP||Ahmedabad: As outlined in the New Education Policy (NEP) 2020, a special purpose vehicle (SPV) — Shri K K Shastri Government Colleges Confederation — has been formed for running six colleges at Maninagar in Ahmedabad. “Shri K K Shastri Government Colleges Confederation is a pilot project and one of the first of its kind in the country to implement the recommendations of NEP,” according to a government press release. These six colleges will continue to be affiliated with Gujarat University. Admission, examination, result and degree will be awarded as per rules and regulations of Gujarat University. The New Education Policy (2020), aims at the implementation of student-centric learning in the field of higher education through restructuring and consolidation of the existing institutions of higher education. The policy aims to deliver education to students through a holistic approach where the goal is to provide job-oriented courses. In order to implement this, the department of higher education passed a resolution on June 2 for creation and registration of Shri K K Shastri Government Colleges Confederation as a SPV under the Company Act 2013 Section 8 (not for profit). The colleges to be run under the confederation include Sri K K Shastri Government Commerce College, Government Arts College, Government BBA College (self-financed), Government Science College (self-financed), Government BCA College (self-financed) and Government Law College. “Due to the present constitution of the confederation, all the existing colleges will operate in one geographical campus. This will ensure that those colleges which have a small strength of students can benefit from the larger confederation. Thus multi-disciplinary and career-oriented courses, value-based research, effective leadership and management will be feasible,” according to the media statement. All facilities under the colleges such as housekeeping, security services, library, sports, laboratories, parking, ground and classes will come under the umbrella of a common pool which will again benefit all the students on campus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/spv-formed-for-running-six-colleges-under-nep/articleshow/84250260.cms||---
---||Ajmer||Rajasthan: Selling homemade goods, Tonk women become their own boss||AJMER: Praveena (36) of Tonk, who passed through an acute financial crisis during lockdown, makes pickles these days and sells those in Rajivika mart and the collectorate canteen to support her three children. Meera of Mali Mohalla of Tonk, who makes mud utensils, also sells the products in Rajivika mart and the colectorate canteen to support her family after her husband lost his job because of lockdown. In a first-of-its-kind for women empowerment, Tonk collectorate has started mahila canteen and mart where women can sell their home-made products such as soaps, pickles, masala and other products under Rajivika mission of the state government. The canteen is run by women to promote small-scale women groups. To participate, self-help groups even from Devali, Uniyara and Malpura are coming to sell their products through Rajivika mart and canteen. “We have decided to market these products so that the handicraft of Tonk and even eatables reach different parts of the country,” added Suresh Gupta of Tonk Vyapar Mandal. District project manager of Rajivika, Mukesh Chawala, said the mart was now providing things like bathing soaps, pickles, porridge, cereals, utensils made of mud and even spices. “The trend is good and businessmen are purchasing things in bulk,” added Chawala. Tonk zilla parishad CEO Sumya Jha said they were looking for more platforms to markes such items as a lot of women are interested in selling their homemade products in the mart and canteen, which were launched on July 1. “There is a enthusiasm in women as they were starting their own work. Importantly, most officials of the district are women and therefore they understand the feeling of women in need,” added Jyoti of panchayat samitti Kankod. She added that previously women were not having any such platform and therefore they lost interest in homemade products and were trying to search employment in the construction sector. “Now we are working as our own boss,” said Kavita of Malpura self help group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/selling-homemade-goods-tonk-women-become-their-own-boss/articleshow/84258262.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Two-wheeler sales revive up after 2-month dip||AHMEDABAD: After declining for two straight months, demand for two-wheelers has begun picking up since the end of June. Some 59,124 two-wheelers were registered in June 2021, according to data from the Gujarat chapter of the Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Associations (FADA). In April and May, registration numbers saw a major fall indicating a dip in demand. As the restrictions eased, according to dealers, demand has picked up and sales look buoyant ahead of the Rath Yatra. Even though two-wheeler registrations grew by 29% against June 2020 (45,716 registrations), overall demand remains 30% below pre-pandemic levels. “While June saw good momentum and a recovery in two-wheeler sales, it was far from pre-pandemic levels. With schools and colleges not reopening, two-wheeler sales have not picked up well because students account for 15% of sales of two-wheelers in Gujarat. In fact, a quarter of June sales every year are from students, as the period coincides with college reopening time,” said Pranav Shah, Gujarat region chairman of FADA. FADA members also say that there has been a great migration of two-wheeler buyers from Gujarat to outside of the state, due to the work-from-home mode of operations. “The biggest impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is on the lower-middle class who faced loss or reduction of income. These people are the core customers of entry-level two-wheelers. Sales through financing have also fallen significantly. For these reasons, sales of two-wheelers have not recovered to pre-pandemic levels,” said Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/two-wheeler-sales-rev-up-after-2-month-dip/articleshow/84252619.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||India||Rijiju’s brief: Fill up judge vacancies, curb pendency||NEW DELHI: Kiren Rijiju, the newly-appointed law minister, took charge of the ministry on Thursday amid serious concerns of rising pendency of cases in courts, which have crossed 4.5 crore as on July 7, and huge vacancies across the three-tier judicial system. Among the major challenges before Rijiju, say officials, is to fill up large vacancies across the Supreme Court, 25 high courts and 24,000 subordinate courts. While the Supreme Court has 21% judges’ vacancies — seven of the 34 sanctioned posts are currently lying vacant— the 25 high courts in the country have 41% vacancies with a record 449 posts of judges to be filled up. The situation is far worse in the subordinate and district judiciary where more than 5,000 posts of judicial officers have remained vacant for several years now. Around 3.9 crore, the highest number of cases, are pending in the subordinate and district courts and have been a major concern for the government which is trying to improve India’s ranking in the World Bank’s ‘Ease of Doing Business’. Senior law ministry officials met the minister briefly soon after he took charge of the ministry. However, detailed department-wise meetings have been scheduled starting Friday. In view of the recent adverse orders of the apex court on judicial appointments, where the government has been served with a deadline to clear all pending appointments, the newly-appointed minister has to concentrate on the task at hand and also win the trust of the higher judiciary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rijijus-brief-fill-up-judge-vacancies-curb-pendency/articleshow/84254927.cms||Pradeep Thakur
---||Nagpur||Bamboo ‘rakhis’ from Chanda slum to hit London streets||Nagpur: Already on the global map for tigers, eco-friendly rakhis and friendship bands made from bamboo in Chandrapur slum will hit the London streets soon for the first time.Rakhis are the bond between brothers by sisters but for bamboo artist and designer Meenakshi Walke (29), it is about a eco-friendly way of earning livelihood for herself and other women dependent on the art.Meenakshi, who stays with her family in a 10x12 room in a slum popularly known as Bengali Camp, has carved a niche for herself by pushing the sale of hand-weaved rakhis and friendship bands to the UK.Global Bappa, an online store founded by an Indian woman entrepreneur Minakshi Dudhe Khodke in London, will, for the first time, have for sale artistic rakhis from Chandrapur. Khodke, who has settled down in the UK, hails from Ballarshah near Chandrapur.Khodke told TOI, “Global Bappa is not for creating profits but to nurture our heritage and traditions associated with Indian festivals. We have hand-picked our suppliers and artisans who create a complete bundle of joy. Meenakshi Walke is one of them. This is a bid to keep the Indian traditions alive in our mind, body and soul and for future generations living far away from our motherland.”Even as Walke is delighted to see her rakhis heading straight to London, she says, “It is still a long-drawn struggle to achieve goals. Bamboo rakhis may be in the market, but the ones created by me are completely eco-friendly in the real sense. To decorate them generally plastic is used but I use tulsi and rudraksha beads. Even the thread is of khadi.”Last year, a beautiful eco-friendly rakhi by walke was sent to PM Narendra Modi by former forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar. “Even during the lockdown, she created over 10,000 rakhis giving direct and indirect employment to many. She is a good artist,” says Mungantiwar.Walke’s creative journey had many hurdles. Her dream was to become a civil engineer, but her parents — both brick kiln workers and living in poverty — married her off at 22 forcing Walke to dumping her dreams.After her marriage in 2014, Walke used to spend her leisure time making household artefacts from plywood. Already into creative art, a 70-day training in October 2018, at the Bamboo Research & Training Centre (BRTC) in Chandrapur, honed her artistic skills. She turned a new leaf by launching a start-up firm Abhisar Innovatives in the name of her son.Apart from rakhis and friendship bands, the firm produces 50 types of products like flowerpots, jewellery, baskets, lampshades, candlestands out of bamboo. The cost of the products varies from Rs 25 to Rs 2,500.Walke was conferred with the National Nari Shakti Award-2018 for her startup venture. In 2019, she was also felicitated by Burad community women, who are traditional bamboo craftsmen, for her contribution. In 2021, on World Women’s Day, the Indo-Canadian Art & Culture Society presented her ‘Woman Hero Award’ virtually.Walke’s husband Mukesh, a former environment journalist, handles her social media account to boost business. After quitting his job, he too supports the family by marketing toothbrushes made of bamboo and other eco-friendly material sending a message to go green.After winning accolades over social media for her talent, Walke was approached to conduct a training workshop at Jerusalem but could not make it as she could not manage the finances. “Weaving is the most difficult part of bamboo art and hence the Israeli agency wanted to learn the same,” she said.Even as Walke continued with her creation, the ‘Miss Climate-2019’, a beauty pageant held in Delhi for the planet as an effective tool to create awareness of climate change worldwide, changed her fate overnight.“Looking at my bamboo art, organizers approached me requesting to make beauty crowns for winners. Without any previous experience of making crowns, I agreed. These bamboo crowns were applauded by one and all. I was not only invited to Delhi to attend the pageant but also felicitated,” says Walke.Last year, Walke’s rakhis were sought in Dubai but as there were no flights due to the pandemic, it couldn’t materialize. Yet, the couple sold 7,000 bamboo rakhis.This season Meenakshi hopes to make good sales with lockdown restrictions being relaxed. She said, “We plan to be part of various exhibitions in the state during the festive season that has already kickstarted. We used lockdown to create many articles and stock them.”“Right now, we are busy producing rakhis and friendship bands in bulk to fulfil the orders we got from all over the country. Both the events will be celebrated in August,” said Walke.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bamboo-rakhis-from-chanda-slum-to-hit-london-streets/articleshow/84273259.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The PSGPC president, Satwant Singh, informed TOI on Thursday that he had sent invitation letters to both SGPC chief and the jathedar to visit Gurdwara Darbar Sahib. He also claimed that the Covid-19 situation was totally under control in Pakistan. “We will make all arrangements for the SGPC delegation and will welcome them at ‘zero line’ to make a new beginning of ‘corridor of peace’,” said Satwant. It was on March 16, 2020, when India announced to temporarily suspend the day-long Kartarpur pilgrimage to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Subsequently, online registration for Kartarpur Sahib pilgrimage was also stopped. The Pakistan government had also stopped the pilgrimage from its side. On October 2, 2020, it announced to unilaterally open the Kartarpur pilgrimage for Indian devotees, but New Delhi denied reciprocating the gesture stating that decision to re-open the Kartarpur corridor would be taken in accordance with the protocol relating to Covid-19 and easing of restrictions. For the past some time, the SGPC as well as the Akal Takht had been demanding from the Centre to reopen the Kartarpur pilgrimage on the lines of other religious shires across the nation. “The PSGPC welcomes the demand of the SGPC for immediate reopening of the Kartarpur corridor and we reassure that we will make all arrangements for the Indian devotees during their pilgrimage to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib,”said the PSGPC president. He added that they were looking forward to an early decision by the Indian government with regards to the reopening of the Kartarpur corridor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/psgpc-invites-akal-takht-jathedar-sgpc-chief-to-kartarpur/articleshow/84250292.cms||Yudhvir Rana

In this connection, a report has been sought from all the urban local bodies to examine cases who have applied for land conversion. An official said, “The local bodies will submit the report within 10 days. The UDH will also examine the petrol pumps maps approved by the petroleum companies. Based on that, rules will be formulated to enable smooth process of giving approvals.”The moves comes in the wake of the urban development and housing (UDH) department recently framing new guidelines to set up petrol pumps in the state following the directions of the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The permission to set up pump stations will not be granted in a 50-metre periphery of schools, hospitals and residential areas, however. As per the new guidelines, retail outlets shall not be located within a radial distance of 50 metres from schools, hospitals (10 beds and above) and residential areas designated as per local laws. Moreover, no high tension line shall pass over the retail outlet. An official said, “After witnessing the negative impact of petrol pumps on environment, directions were issued. Adhering to it, the state has also issued the directions.” At the central level last year, an expert committee was set up on the directions of the NGT which is seized of a plea seeking a cap on the number of petrol pumps so as to avoid their adverse effects on environment . “The committee recommendation were followed in framing the guidelines for the state,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/petrol-pumps-in-residential-areas-state-to-frame-rules/articleshow/84250293.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Shalimar mall owner alleges being framed in property tax case||Panchkula: Owner of Shalimar Mall, R K Aggarwal alleged that the mayor and MC house were acting in a “malafide manner” against him in relation to property tax on his property. He alleged that he had been named the biggest defaulter, which was not accurate as Shalimar Mall had deposited Rs 7.5 lakh in excess. During a press conference at Press Club in Chandigarh on Thursday, Aggarwal stated that the Panchkula mayor had reported that Shalimar Mall was the biggest defaulter of property tax in Panchkula. He described this as a “white lie.” He said that nearly Rs 7.5 lakh in excess had been deposited in the name of Shalimar Mall as property tax with the MC, Panchkula. “How can I be the biggest defaulter?” he asked. Aggarwal stated that as per the property tax notification of Haryana government in 2013, over Rs 33 lakh was deposited towards property tax but MC Panchkula raised a “baseless” property tax bill-cum-notice of Rs 4,26,25,581 in 2017 in respect of Shalimar Mega Mall. He said this was challenged by the mall’s management before Punjab and Haryana High Court, which directed the mall’s management to deposit Rs 1 crore and file an appeal before the divisional commissioner (Ambala division). He said an appeal was filed before the divisional commissioner (Ambala division) and Rs 1 crore was deposited under protest with the MC, Panchkula. Subsequently, divisional commissioner, (Ambala division) remanded the matter to the MC commissioner for passing a speaking order, which was passed on March 30, 2021. Aggarwal claimed, “MC commissioner, Panchkula, in the speaking order, directed the zonal taxation officer to re-assess the property tax of Shalimar Mall. What’s more, the arbitrary bill cum notice for Rs 4,26,25,581 was also set aside. It was further directed that the amount of Rs 1 crore already deposited by us in compliance with the order passed by high court of Punjab and Haryana be set off by MC, Panchkula as per rules at the time of re-assessment of property tax.” On June 30, MC house formed a committee to re-evaluate the property tax of Shalimar Mall and its report was sought by the house in 15 days. At this, Aggarwal said the committee was constituted with “malice and malafide intentions” to illegally interfere with the order passed by the MC commissioner. “The said resolution is liable to be annulled/suspended/cancelled. My property has been re-assessed after a quasi judicial order passed by the Panchkula MC commissioner and still I have been targeted under this illegal resolution. Why have other similar sized properties been kept out of the purview of this arbitrary resolution despite insufficient payment of property tax in violation of property tax notification? It is clear that the MC house has passed the said resolution with intentions of targeting just my property,” he alleged. Aggarwal also moved a representation to the additional chief secretary (ACS), Urban local bodies department, Haryana and called upon the office to use powers bestowed on it under sections 414 and 415 of Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994 for cancellation of the resolution passed by the MC, Panchkula in their house meeting. “I have also requested the ACS to direct MC, Panchkula to publish a white paper regarding details of property tax received from the date of occupation certificate till date of similar sized commercial properties falling in the same category as well as all other commercial properties to maintain transparency,” he added. Mayor Kulbhushan Goyal said, “It is our motive to save the Corporation money. The committee formed during the house meeting will assess and evaluate the tax and if anything comes to our side, we will take it from the tax defaulter. If anything is paid in excess by any property owner, we will definitely return it to the owner.” BOX: Trouble brews for mall Shalimar Mall remained in news as 110 persons from Panchkula, Chandigarh and Mohali, who had booked showroom spaces inside the Sector 5 based mall in 2004 said despite making payment of over Rs 70 crore, they were neither handed over possession of shops, nor was the money refunded. FIRs were also registered against its owner in the past. The power department also cut its electricity in 2014 and 2015 for non-payment of bill. On allegations that the mall had not been operating from the beginning, Aggarwal claimed that ownership of the mall had a clear title and was free from all encumbrances. He claimed that he still hasn’t got full payments from showroom allottees as per allotment letters. He said even maintenance charges had not been paid, due to which the mall remained in crisis in the past. He said he is doing a facelift of the mall, after which operations would speed up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/shalimar-mall-owner-alleges-being-framed-in-property-tax-case/articleshow/84248038.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Row over DJ song during wedding leads to death of one, six injured||ROORKEE: Six men were booked for allegedly beating a man to death after a scuffle over playing a song on the DJ system in a wedding. The incident took place at Akoda Khurd village under Laksar police station jurisdiction on Wednesday. According to TOI sources, some youths of the bride's village asked the groom's procession to play a particular song as they had come with a DJ system. However, a few men in the groom's procession denied playing the song saying only the songs of their choice would be played on their DJ system. This led to an argument between two groups which soon turned into an altercation. The deceased has been identified as Basant (28), who had come to the village with the groom's procession. The accused were booked under sections 147 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly for committing a common object), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code on Thursday after a complaint by the victim's brother. "All accused on the run will be nabbed very soon," inspector Pradeep Chauhan, in-charge of Laksar police station, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/row-over-dj-song-during-wedding-leads-to-death-of-one-six-injured/articleshow/84248060.cms||Tapan Susheel

The dumper loaded with sand crashed into a rickshaw that the victim Leena Mori was checking. The rickshaw was dragged for nearly 500 metres and the dumper driver then escaped. He was later caught from Sachin area and identified as Badiya Bhuriya, 40, a resident of Jhabua in Madhya Pradesh. After knocking down Mori, Bhuriya abandoned the vehicle a few kilometres away in Unn. He started walking to escape but police nabbed him before he could leave the city. Mori was on duty along with two other cops and home guard personnel. They had stopped two rickshaws for checking. The dumper knocked the rickshaw in the second lane from behind within a few seconds after it was stopped by police. Mori was right in front of the rickshaw when the dumper crashed into it. She suffered severe head injury.  Lok Rakshak Dal cop Govind Vakatar (35) and Ashraf and Chetan, both rickshaw drivers, suffered injuries. Police suspect that the dumper was speeding due to traffic-free road at night and since it was loaded it did not stop immediately. Mori had recently completed a five-year fixed term as lok rakshak and was appointed as a police constable. A native of Aravalli district, Mori lived with her husband and two children aged 8 and 2 years. Her husband is unemployed and her younger son suffers from heart ailment. She had to take him to Ahmedabad for treatment every month.  Mori’s colleagues in Pandesara police station launched a campaign to collect funds for her family since she was the only earning member in the family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/woman-cop-dies-as-dumper-crashes-into-rickshaw/articleshow/84245800.cms||---

The rains also washed away a 48-metre-long concrete bridge at Kulagad on Tanakpur-Tawaghat highway early on Thursday, Dharchula sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) AK Shukla said. The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) has put logs to cross the runlet, he added. Kulagad is around 10 km away from Dharchula. The tehsil administration is in the process of getting a Bailey bridge constructed to resume movement, Shukla further said. Due ot the bridge collapse, three higher Himalayan valleys - Darma, Byas and Chaudas - have been cut off from Dharchula, according to Bhupendra Singh Mahar, the district disaster management officer, Pithoragarh. A 50m road was washed away in 2013 at the same site and later disaster management department and BRO built a bridge to connect the road. Some villagers said that a possible cloud burst at Nagne Bugyal, the runlet source, may be the cause of mud and boulders floating in Kulagad. Scores of villagers and vehicles are stuck on the other side of the road and no vehicular movement seemed possible till the next few days, Rakesh Tiwari, a local resident, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/heavy-rainfall-in-pithoragarh-50-villages-along-nepal-china-border-cut-off-from-road-access-after-bridge-washes-away/articleshow/84248091.cms||Prem Punetha

---||Delhi||Delhi: Discom readies plan to deal with perils of monsoon season||NEW DELHI: While it provides relief from the heat, monsoon brings its own set of problems like waterlogging, strong winds uprooting trees and falling branches damaging electricity installations resulting in outages, etc. Power discom BSES has prepared a monsoon action plan to deal with these problems and to also ensure that there are no incidents of electrocution. A spokesperson of BSES discom said that the company was geared up to ensure reliable power supply to consumers while taking all safety measures that are required during the rainy season. “Consumers can play a very important role in ensuring an incident-free monsoon by following simple safety guidelines,” he stated. He said that to reduce incidents of moisture-related breakdowns, measures have been taken to minimise the accumulation of moisture in the grids and panels. The discoms have increased the height of the foundation of transformers in low-lying areas and created fencing around all plinth and pole-mounted transformers. Due to waterlogging, chances of electricity related mishaps are high during the monsoon and BSES has advised people to stay away from electrical installations like poles, sub-stations, transformers, streetlights, etc. It has also cautioned children from playing in waterlogged parks. “Get entire wiring in your premises thoroughly checked and tested by a licensed electrical contractor. Put off the main switch in case there is waterlogging or leakage observed in the meter cabin,” the spokesperson said. “Install an ‘earth leakage circuit breaker’ to help avoid shocks and mishaps and keep a ‘tester’ at home. If a switch is wet, do not touch it,” he said. “Prune the trees in your garden that are close to electricity wires and cables.” The spokesperson said that theft of power by hooking into an electricity system also posed a serious safety risk during the monsoon months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/discom-readies-plan-to-deal-with-perils-of-monsoon-season/articleshow/84250368.cms||---

The corporation has deployed two teams, which will rush to the area as soon as it starts to rain and send alerts when the rainwater starts to rise, so that all DTC buses on that route are diverted to predetermined alternate routes. Waterlogging below the colonial era bridge has been happening almost since the bridge and the road below it came up after the creation of New Delhi. From vintage public transport buses to the latest low-floor ones, the sight of one bus getting submerged in accumulated rainwater, particularly during monsoon, has become an annual occurrence. In July last year, a 56-year-old man died allegedly due to drowning in water accumulated under the Minto Bridge after a downpour. The Delhi government had taken many measures after the incident, which ranged from engineering solutions to a decision to barricade the roads leading to the bridge if the water level rises to a certain level. To ensure the usual monsoon sight is relegated to history, DTC has formed two separate teams, which would remain alert and rush to the site as soon as it starts to rain and take necessary measures before accumulated rainwater starts rising. A DTC spokesperson confirmed that teams have been deployed for this purpose. DTC has prepared a list of alternate routes for buses that ply on routes like 171, 185, 210, 213, 246, 271, 213, 433, 440, 440 A, 445, 460, 500, 505, 522 (Special), 548, 604, 615, 729, 781, 951, RL-75, RL-77, RL.77A, RL.79, RL-77 Extension, etc. Buses plying on these routes and coming from Connaught Place would instead turn from Barakhamba Road and take the Maharaja Ranjeet Singh flyover to reach Ramlila Ground and then go towards the destination. Those buses plying on these roads and destined towards Connaught Place would avoid Vivekananda Marg or DDU Marg and reach through Barakhamba Road instead. Apart from the Minto Bridge area, DTC has also chalked out plans for diverting buses that ply on routes passing through the Prahladpur underpass in south Delhi near Badarpur border and Zakhira underpass in west Delhi near Sarai Rohilla. The teams deployed would send out alerts as soon as accumulated rainwater gets cleared.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dtc-teams-to-ensure-buses-dont-go-down-under-at-minto-bridge/articleshow/84250515.cms||Sidharatha Roy

However, the campaign had to be stopped mid-way due to surge in Covid cases in the state, followed by the lockdown. The purpose behind the campaign was that it was found that in most cases families are not aware about their rights due to which crimes against children are not reported.

For the last academic year, there was no physical training class or other classes for extra-curricular, however, the ‘Learn with Fun’ programme will have activities related to hobbies and fitness exercises streamed live on the YouTube channel. The Maharashtra State Council of Education Research and Training (SCERT), has designed the activities for online training of extra-curricular activities through the YouTube Channel. Director of SCERT, Dinkar Temkar, said, “In the urban areas, lockdown has had a bad effect on the frenzies or physical activities of students due to lockdown. Many students have not even stepped out of their homes due to fear of infection for months together. The lack of any physical activity may develop many types of physical and mental illnesses among students. Considering this, the SCERT, has designed social science and art and craft syllabus for standards I to VIII.” All students will get online classes on every Saturday called ‘Learn with Fun’ which will begin from July 10. The aim is to endure that students are active throughout the day and apart from fitness, they will also get lessons on gardening and planting trees. The video streaming will take place from 9am to 10am for std I to V and 10am to 11am from standard VI to VIII.

For this, we will run a campaign about good touch-bad touch as well as form groups of 4 to 5 locals in each village who can get ensure that people are made aware about their rights etc.” In February, the child commission had launched an awareness campaign during which the department’s officials visited various districts across Rajasthan to tell people about children’s rights. However, the campaign had to be stopped mid-way due to surge in Covid cases in the state, followed by the lockdown. The purpose behind the campaign was that it was found that in most cases families are not aware about their rights due to which crimes against children are not reported. The campaign also aimed at making them understand that they should not come under societal pressure to not report the crimes. A total of 1,208 Pocso cases were registered in the state between January 1 and May 31, 2021, out of which Udaipur and Bharatpur had the highest number of cases, with 55 FIRs in each district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/over-1200-pocso-cases-in-first-5-mths-this-year/articleshow/84258712.cms||---

Some BJP councillors sought details of the expenditure in the meeting. Municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar informed the members that the purchases were made under the AMC Medical Education Trust. This irked some councillors who insisted that the data should be tabled in the meeting. However, the administrative wing officials were quick to react and stated that the standing committee chairman Hitesh Barot was a part of the board and hence the expenses will be tabled in the meeting. This led to heated arguments. Barot then asked the administrative wing to table the report in the board meeting. When contacted, Barot admitted that the issue was raised but the members were told that the purchase was made through AMC MET and cannot be discussed in the standing committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/storm-in-amc-over-ventilator-purchase/articleshow/84252677.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Death certificates of Covid victims caught in red tape||LUCKNOW: Who will issue the death certificate of a person who is a resident of Lucknow but died of Covid-19 at a hospital in Barabanki? That’s a worry for Ila Singh whose mother succumbed to Covid on April 29 at a private hospital in the neighbouring district. When the second wave was at its peak, Singh ran from pillar to post for mother’s treatment and now for two months she has been shuttling between Lucknow Municipal Corporation and Barabanki Municipality for her mother’s death certificate. "After my mother passed away, the Lucknow Covid Command Centre informed me that the LMC will issue the certificate. But, when we approached the LMC, officers diverted us to Barabanki Municipality. And, when we reached Barabanki Municipality, the staff sent us back to the LMC. For the past 65 days, I have been travelling between Lucknow and Barabanki every week for the certificate. As a result, I have not been able to file the insurance claim,” said Singh, a resident of Faridnagar. When contacted, health officer in Barabanki Municipality Dr Sudhir Chandra told TOI that since the death happened in a private hospital in Banki block of Barabanki, Banki Nagar Panchayat office will issue the certificate. Like Singh, many families of Covid victims are facing problems in insurance claims, and transfer of property or bank accounts and other benefits as they have not received the death certificate of victims so far. As per rule, if a patient dies in a government hospital, the death certificate is issued by the said hospital and the civic body issues the certificate if death takes place in a private hospital. Asif Shaikh (60) of Azad Nagar, a suspected case of Covid-19, died at a private hospital on April 23. His kin, too, have not received the death certificate from the LMC so far. "We need the certificate for the transfer of property and bank account to his wife’s name,” said Sana Shaikh, Asif’s niece. When contacted, LMC health officer Dr SK Rawat told TOI "We have issued orders to expedite the process.” Nipendra Singh of Gomtinagar lost his brother Mahendra (54) to the disease on May 16. He was under treatment at Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences. "We have visited RMLIMS several times, but on each occasion officials say that medical records got misplaced and ask us to come a couple of days later. We need the certificate to transfer his property to his wife." RMLIMS spokesperson Dr Srikesh Singh told TOI, "Normally, such delay doesn’t occur. We will direct staff to attend the case immediately." Raj Kumar Rastogi (59), a spice merchant in Balaganj, succumbed to Covid-19 at RSM Hospital on April 24. "After my father's demise, we could not withdraw money from his bank account. As a result, the business was hit hard. Finally, after running for over two months, I got the certificate on July 3,” said Swapnil, Raj’s son. Meanwhile, medical officer of RSM Sumit Kumar Maharaj said, "The work was stopped for some time in May when the staff got infected with Covid, but things are smooth now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/death-certificates-of-covid-victims-caught-in-red-tape/articleshow/84252693.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

---||Chandigarh||Traffic police to crack down on honk happy drivers||pix with photo section Panchkula: Traffic police will launch an awareness and challan drive as part of the effort to make Panchkula a honk-free city. A fine of Rs 10,000 will be imposed on violators, cops warned. Traffic in-charge, inspector Sukhdev Singh said his team is working to ensure compliance with traffic norms. He said action is being taken by personnel on duty and through CCTV cameras installed across the district. Inspector Singh said that a special challan drive against people not wearing helmet/seat belt is already going on and 110 challans were issued on Wednesday. He urged people not to blow horns near medical institutions, district courts and educational institutes. Doing so could make people liable to fine of Rs 10,000, he said, asking people to cooperate with the traffic police. Issuing an advisory in this regard, inspector Sukhdev said honking unnecessarily is banned and horn should be blown only in case of danger to the driver or someone else, road signs should be followed before blowing horn, horn/silencer in motorcycle or car should not be modified and siren should not be used without government emergency vehicle. Police said another major offence is driving on the wrong side to avoid driving two to three kilometres for a U-turn, which leads to accidents. To solve this problem, traffic cops have been deployed to issue challan to offenders. Making people wear seat belts and helmets is also on the agenda of the traffic police. Do not wear helmet or seat belt for fear of being challaned but wear it for safety, inspector Sukhdev said. According to the police, in most cases, people lose their lives because they did not wear helmet or seat belt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/traffic-police-to-crack-down-on-honk-happy-drivers/articleshow/84248218.cms||Arvind Bishnoi
---||Chandigarh||Panjab University students demand elections, authorities silent||CHANDIGARH: Amid uncertainty over Panjab University Campus Student Council (PUCSC) elections, student bodies are demanding elections in the coming months. Elections to the student council have not been held in the last two years owing to the Covid pandemic. Now that the situation looks like its under control, students have high hopes again. “If the University reopens, elections will have to be held. We will not stop demanding elections,” said Sandeep, a volunteer for Students for Society (SFS). Panjab University Campus Students Council or PUCSC is a students' association comprising department representatives and other office- bearers like president, vice-president, secretary and joint-secretary along with about 123 departmental representatives chosen by students from different departments of Panjab University. Last PUCSC elections were held in 2019, in which Chetan Choudhary from SOI became president. PU authorities have not said anything yet but students are mounting pressure. “Elections must be held in the next two to three months and authorities will have to be supportive. There is no reason for them to not be,” said PUCSC president Chetan Choudhary. “Even if, for whatever reason, elections aren’t held, we will still keep working and helping students as the active council,” he added. Students have also been demanding a representative for the Senate and Syndicate. The Senate and Syndicate are elected decision-making bodies of Panjab University. Students say the decision-making bodies must have adequate representation of immediate stakeholders, which they are. “The Senate and Syndicate do not have representation of students. Our demand is that elected student office bearers must be de facto members of Senate and Syndicate,” said Sandeep of SFS. PU dean, Student Welfare (DSW) Prof S K Tomar said, “Student council elections are all about students and their welfare and since, due to Covid, currently there aren’t many students on the campus, we don’t know for sure when can the elections be held.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pu-students-demand-elections-authorities-silent/articleshow/84248193.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ED questions Eknath Khadse for 9 hours, likely to summon him again||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate questioned former state revenue minister Eknath Khadse for nine hours on Thursday, a day after it arrested his son-in-law in a money laundering case. The ED is likely to summon Khadse again for a further statement after examining the collected details. The ED had summoned Khadse’s wife Mandakini for her statement on Wednesday, but she sought two weeks’ time, claiming she was unwell. ED officials questioned Khadse about the Pune MIDC land deal. Khadse reportedly submitted a few required documents and gave his version related to the land deal. During his previous questioning in January, Khadse had declined to provide any details after stating that the deal was executed by his wife and son-in-law and he had no knowledge about it. Khadse’s lawyer Mohan Tekavde said, “We have provided all land-related documents to the ED. They need some more documents, which we will arrange soon. We are cooperating in the investigation and will appear before ED as and when we are called.” Khadse arrived at the ED office at 11 am on Thursday, and while entering the ED’s zonal office at Ballard Estate, he told mediapersons that the case against him was politically motivated and that it started after he left BJP and joined NCP. He left the ED office at around 8 pm. The ED arrested Khadse’s son-in-law Girish Chaudhari on Wednesday. Chaudhari took all the responsibility related to the land deal and said that he identified the plot for a business through an agent and took a Rs 2 crore loan from his acquaintance to purchase the plot. But he refused to provide details about the person who had extended him a Rs 2 crore loan, allegedly through shell companies. He also refused to provide the details of the agent who helped him to identify the plot. Earlier, the state Anti-Corruption bureau had filed an FIR accusing Khadse, his wife Mandakini, Chaudhari and one Abbas Ukani for land grab of an MIDC plot in Bhosari and causing a loss of Rs 61.25 crore to the government by fraudulently entering into a sale deed. It was alleged that Khadse, as revenue minister in 2016, pressured MIDC officials to manipulate records and helped his kin buy the plot at a throwaway price.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-questions-khadse-for-9-hrs-likely-to-summon-him-again/articleshow/84250487.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Chandigarh||Pay Rs 3 crore to flat owners: Punjab consumer panel to builder||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab state consumer disputes redressal commission has directed the builder of Jaipuria Sunrise Greens residential project on VIP Road, Zirakpur to pay over Rs 3 crore to the apartment owners’ welfare association and to restore the common area to its original condition by cancelling its sale transaction within 30 days. The commission headed by Justice Paramjeet Singh Dhaliwal, while deciding the petition filed by Jaipuria Sunrise Greens Apartments Owners’ Welfare Association, held that the New Delhi-based builder, SMV Agencies, was bound to hand over the interest-free maintenance security (IFMS) of over Rs 2.76 crore earlier collected from nearly 1,000 flat owners to the apartment owners’ welfare association within one year from the completion of the project. Though the residential complex was completed in August 2015 according to the completion certificate, the builder failed to hand over this amount till the filing of the petition in January this year. Therefore, the commission made it clear that the builder will pay Rs 2.76 crore to the welfare association along with interest at the rate of 18% per annum with effect from August 2016 till the amount is handed over to the welfare association. The commission also directed the builder to refund the dues of Rs 20 lakh along with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from August 2016 till realisation to the complainant welfare association, which was collected by the builder from the allottees for day-to-day operations of the housing complex. The builder has also been directed to pay Rs 2 lakh to the welfare association towards litigation costs and other expenses. Accepting the submissions made by the petitioner welfare association’s counsel Arjun Shukla, the commission also directed the builder to restore the common area to its original condition by cancelling the sale transaction at its own expenses and to maintain status quo with regard to further construction thereon. Shukla had submitted that the builder has sold the school building forming part of a common area located in the heart of the complex to Apple Eye School, constructed atop the basement, which has been contributed proportionately by all the apartment owners. On this, the commission said, “It also needs to be emphasised that a buyer applies for allotment of the apartment/unit keeping in view the common area/open spaces, parking areas and parks, which are necessary for comfortable living. These are the main attractions when purchasing an apartment/unit. The open spaces are necessity, not luxury.” The builder has also been ordered to provide all the certificates and complete statutory compliances regarding the complex to the welfare association and to also provide all facilities and equipment in the project as mentioned in the environmental clearance letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-consumer-commission-directs-builder-to-pay-rs-3-crore-to-apartment-owners/articleshow/84250451.cms||Sanjeev Verma

The developer, Shree Siddhi Group, cited losses during the 2020 and 2021 Covid years for backing out of the deal. According to the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), the developer had agreed to enter into the PPP mode with the railways which was contributing another 25% towards the pass. The remaining 50% was being declared by the Gujarat Urban Development Company (GUDC). Now AMC will pay the 25% share. The bridge was to be a two-lane pass over the railway line. The concept of PPP mode was first propounded in 2017. The Chandlodia railway pass was one of the few such projects undertaken under the PPP mode. “A formal proposal will be placed for approval before the standing committee after which the 25% project cost will be borne by the AMC,” said a senior AMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/developer-backs-out-of-rail-bridge/articleshow/84252713.cms||---

The civic officials said a detailed proposal will be sent to the municipal commissioner for approval. More than 20,000 students studying in corporation schools do not have access to online education, as per the civic body’s survey last year. Additional commissioner Vikas Dhakane told TOI that they were awaiting a detailed resolution from the standing committee and then the decision to implement it will be taken. “We are positive about going ahead with the resolution and the distribution of tablets to the underprivileged students,” he added. Jyotsna Shinde, administrative officer at the PCMC, said providing the tablets was on the cards and with the approval of the standing committee, the project will pick up pace. Municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil said after they receive the detailed resolution from the panel it will be approved without delay. Activist Maruti Bhapkar said the decision will help students but it also provides scope for irregularities. “Right from the quotation of the tabs to the company which would be selected for the purchase, there are a lot of chances for irregularities, which need to be looked into properly,” he said. Thousands of students from the civic schools are not getting education due to the unavailability of basic facilities, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tablets-for-students-to-gain-online-education-in-pcmc-run-institutions/articleshow/84250485.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The webinar, to be organised by the department of English and modern Europen languages, has been postponed reportedly after opposition from teachers. However, LU spokesperson Prof Durgesh Srivastava said the event has been postponed since no permission was taken from the dean academics for it. It all started when the invite of the webinar was posted on the WhatsApp group of teachers (TOI has screenshots) after which the Sanskrit faculty pointed out that the concept and the title ‘Indian perspectives. The rise of modern vernacular and death of Sanskrit: Reading Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar’ is incorrect as Sanskrit is one of the most popular languages that has given birth to a number of other languages. They also said that such webinars send a wrong message about the language to students. The lecture was to be delivered by Prof Nandini Bhattacharya of the department of English and cultural studies, University of Burdwan, West Bengal. A teacher questioned why such a ‘deceptive’, ‘misleading’ and ‘ignorant’ title was selected by the English department for the webinar. The other teachers also joined in highlighting the relevance, importance, and popularity of Sanskrit. “If a mother gets old, a child should not call it dead. Sanskrit is among the oldest languages; talking about its death is similar to talking about the death of a mother,” said a Sanskrit faculty. He added it was disappointing that such a webinar to downgrade the language was being held at LU. “LU has given great Sanskrit scholars like late BK Shukla and even the vice-chancellor of this university is tweeting in Sanskrit,” he said. Sanskrit faculty Prayag Narain Mishra said, “A lot of research work has been done globally on Sanskrit. There are so many Sanskrit universities, scholars and literature. Such webinars will give a wrong message to students about our traditional language.” Meanwhile, the English department faculty didn’t answer TOI’s text or calls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sanskrit-faculty-objects-to-title-lu-webinar-cancelled/articleshow/84252765.cms||---

A police team brought the accused to Ramdeora on Wednesday and produced them before a court here on Thursday. The accused have been sent in 3-day police remand. According to the complaint, the accused financiers — Mukesh Bhai and Dilip Bhai — had promised a loan of Rs 10 crore to Sukhdev Khatri, a resident of Ramdeora. The duo, however, asked Khatri to deposit 10% of the total loan amount in their account as part of processing fee, following which the unsuspecting businessman deposited money in different accounts as demanded by the accused. However, even after depositing Rs 90 lakh, Khatri’s loan was not processed for a long time and suspecting cheating, he filed a complaint.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: NCP neta says action is politically motivated||Mumbai: NCP leader Eknath Khadse on Thursday described as politically motivated the ED’s summons to him, while NCP cabinet members Jayant Patil and Chhagan Bhujbal too alleged the ED summons and questioning was Khadse’s harassment for political reasons. “I was probed in the past and again, I was summoned. I had cooperated with the investigating agencies earlier, will do so now and in the future too. I extend my full cooperation to ED, which is probing a non-existing case,” Khadse said. The ED had summoned Khadse in January in connection with the probe into the MIDC land deal involving his son-in-law Girish Chaudhary and wife Mandakini. It was alleged that while the market value of the land was Rs 40 crore, Khadse, who was revenue minister in the Fadnavis government, had misused his official position and purchased it for Rs 3.75 crore. All along, Khadse claimed he was innocent and was being framed in the case. “The land deal was probed by the Anti-Corruption Bureau and a retired judge of Bombay high court. I have been given a clean chit. Even the ACB has submitted a closure report before the Pune court,” Khadse said. Khadse, whose daughter-in-law Raksha Khadse is a BJP Lok Sabha member from Raver (Jalgaon), last year joined the NCP. “I am not at all involved in the land deal, it appears to be a conspiracy,” Khadse said. State NCP president and water resources minister Jayant Patil said the Khadse family is being harassed. Patil said the ED has initiated the probe, but there is absolutely no truth to the charges against Khadse. Public works minister Chhagan Bhujbal said NCP leaders were being targeted by the NDA government. “All efforts are being made to destabilize the MVA government. Efforts are being made to lure NCP, Shiv Sena and Congress members into the BJP and those who do not toe the line are being targeted by Central investigating agencies,” Bhujbal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncp-neta-says-action-is-politically-motivated/articleshow/84250553.cms||---

The closing down of one unit in Ropar and reduction to half load of the remaining one unit of TSPL has added into the state power shortage of around 500 MW (120 lakh units in a day) generation from within Punjab. One unit of Lehra Mohabbat plant also got tripped on Thursday at around 1.30pm due to technical fault, but got operational again after four and half hours. Ropar power plant chief engineer Ravi Kumar Wadhwa said following boiler leakage one out of the four units got shut down and would be operational by July 10 morning. “With the closure of industry up to July 11 and reduced power load from offices, the PSPCL is still facing shortage of power. The position will improve only after the onset of monsoon in the state,” said VK Gupta, All-India Power Engineers Federation (AIPEF) spokesperson. On Wednesday, Punjab supplied 2,929 lakh units with a maximum demand of 12,438 MW. Power supply in the state, despite restrictions, was short by 127 lakh units against the requirement of 3,057 lakh units. There was a shortage of 650 MW during evening peak hours. BBMB powerhouses generated 398 lakh units and Punjab’s share is around 40%. Bhakra powerhouses generated 225 lakh units although the water level in the reservoir is down by 56 feet as compared to last year’s level on the corresponding day. Ranjit Sagar Dam with a low reservoir level is also generating less power. The total gross generation in Punjab on Thursday stands reduced to 4,740 MW against normal availability of more than 5,500 MW. Chairman and managing director of PSPCL A Venu Prasad said, “Punjab is witnessing all-time high demand in the ongoing paddy season due to delayed monsoon arrival. The power availability is also on the lower side this season due to low reservoir levels in dams resulting into less hydro power by about 600 MW. One unit of TSPL has been on forced outage due to turbine breakdown, another developed a technical snag on July 7 and the third one is operating at half capacity due to some technical issue. This has resulted into a shortage of nearly 2,200 MW.” “To tide over the situation in addition to the existing arrangements, PSPCL has purchased extra power of 400 MW from the open market at Rs 12.40 per unit on July 8. Total 1,400 MW power purchased for Thursday at an exchange rate of 5.46 / unit. On the request of the Punjab government, National Load Despatch Centre has agreed to enhance the ATC/TTC limit to 8,000/8,600 MW from 6pm to 9am due to an outage of TSPL unit. PSPCL is utilizing this limit by importing maximum possible power to improve the supply position. Last year the same import limit was only 6,500 MW. The installed capacity of PSPCL from all sources is 13,845 MW out of this about 9,000 MW is being generated. Major reason for lesser generation is due to failure of TSPL, less generation on BBMB,” Venu Prasad said, adding that despite various remedial measures, PSPCL had been forced to impose power regulatory measures on south and border zones to make up for the shortage. However, efforts were being made to continue supplying eight-hour uninterrupted power to AP consumers, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/power-crisis-deepens-as-ropar-plant-unit-also-shuts-down/articleshow/84250525.cms||Bharat Khanna

An expenditure of Rs 21 crore was made on the 1.75 lakh sq mt pond and the surrounding complex but the project was abandoned after the SP lost power in 2017. On a trial basis, light and sound shows are being organised to assess feasibility. “The trial comprises a 13-minute multimedia show where images of the Husainabad monuments – Clock Tower, Bara and Chhota Imambara and Satkhanda, among others – are reflected on water. It is followed by a nine-minute music show where the fountain water dances to musical beats,” said Krishna Yaduvanshi, an employee in the projector room. “The music played during the show includes Ganesh Vandana, Shiv Tandav and Bollywood patriotic songs,” he added. Kinshuk Srivastav, government in charge of the Husainabad and Allied Trust (HAT) under which all monuments of the area come, said: “There has been a delay in handing over of the fountain from Lucknow Development Authority to HAT. In a few weeks, the trial will be done and the fountain will run continuously as it will be under HAT’s control.” When the fountain was initially brought to Lucknow in 2014-15, the plan, as reported by TOI back then, was to showcase the history of Lucknow and its monuments through the show. When asked about some objections regarding the choice of songs used in the trial, Srivastava said, “The original plan has not changed. The show will be on Lucknow only.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/five-years-on-musical-fountain-at-picture-gallery-pond-returns-to-life/articleshow/84252798.cms||Yusra Husain

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: With admins in societies, re-building tensions up||Mumbai: For over a year now the Mumbai Metropolitan Region has been witnessing large-scale appointments of independent administrators in place of housing society managements. This has raised eyebrows among members of hundreds of societies which are due for redevelopment, as many builders and contractors have allegedly taken undue advantage of the situation. People with knowledge of the cooperative sector and officials said administrators have no powers to interfere in major decisions of the society, but still a few are doing so. Such a large number of administrator appointments happened because society elections could not be held for over a year in the absence of election rules since October 2018 and the subsequent government decision to postpone elections till August this year owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. “During this period many committees expired and chairmen and secretaries died. Taking advantage of this, around 10 to 15 administrators have been appointed each by around 45 to 50 registrars in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Over 500 societies have seen appointment of administrators. Builders and contractors interested in going ahead with redevelopment have taken undue advantage of this,’ said Ramesh Prabhu, president of Maharashtra Societies Welfare Association. Prabhu demanded that elections should be declared as early as possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-with-admins-in-societies-re-building-tensions-up/articleshow/84252828.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

The high tourist footfall on weekdays, however, has given hope to local hoteliers and traders who said that they have seen such huge crowds for the first time in the last year and half. Most of the tourist spots in Nainital were filled with tourists throughout the day. Places like Mall Road, Band Stand and Pant Park were brimming with tourists however as hundreds gathered at almost each of these spots people were roaming without masks, standing too close to each other with barely any sanitization. Several restaurants were also full even though the state’s SOPs limit the dining numbers to just 50% of the capacity. “Even though the restaurants are allowed to function only at 50% capacity there is no compliance of these guidelines. Several restaurants are allowing people to sit at a closed distance and many of them are almost full,” said Rajesh Sah, a local. The hoteliers and local traders however said they were happy with the increased tourist footfall adding that they are advising people to carry the Covid negative certificate for without the RT-PCR report no major hotel is renting rooms. “It’s finally some good news for us that after almost a year and half tourism has picked up in Nainital. We are aware of the court’s warning and even asking people to follow the guidelines. We are not giving bookings to people without a negative RT-PCR report,” said Ved Sah, secretary, Nainital hotels and restaurants association. The district officials meanwhile have said that they have stationed police officials across the town to make sure that the Covid norms are followed and to ensure that no one enters the town without an RT-PCR report. “We have checkpoints at each entry into the town where vehicles are being stopped and people are being asked to show their Covid certificates. Even at the railway station we have teams verifying the report and those who do not carry the report are being tested at the stations. We are making sure that the guidelines are followed,” said an official on condition of anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/despite-stern-warnings-from-hc-covid-norms-go-for-a-toss-in-nainital/articleshow/84248265.cms||Prashant Jha

---||Hyderabad||Telangana government to cap revision of non-agriculture land values at 50% for registration||HYDERABAD: The Telangana government has decided to cap revision of land rates at 50% of the prevailing rates for non-agriculture properties registration such as open plots and 100% for agriculture properties. The government had initially considered enhancing land value for property registration up to 200% as the last revision was in August 2013. Sources said there was no further revision for the past eight years because of a series of elections followed by the pandemic. After the government hinted at a steep hike in land rates following approval by the cabinet sub-committee, realtors and developers reportedly expressed their concern this would have on property transactions. Some of them even met ministers and officials. Sources in the registration and stamps (R&S) department said groundwork for revision of land rates has been completed and only needs the CM’s clearance, which is expected after July 10. According to the proposals prepared by the R&S department, minimum value for open plots in Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) (outside GHMC) would be revised to Rs 3,000 per square sq yard from the existing Rs 2,000 per square yard. There would be 50% hike on existing rates if rates are between Rs 1,000 and Rs 10,000 and 40% for rates between Rs 10,000 and Rs 20,000 and 30% hike for properties that have current value of Rs 20,000 and above. In GHMC jurisdiction too, the minimum value would be revised to Rs 3,000 from the existing Rs 2,000. Like HMDA, 50% hike in case of properties having present value between Rs 2,000 and Rs 10,000, 40% on land values between Rs 10,000 and Rs 20,000 and 30% on those above Rs 20,000. As many developers have reportedly urged the government not to increase flat registration values, the department proposed only Rs 100 hike on minimum (basic rates) for flats (apartments). The rate will be Rs 1,800 in GHMC limits and Rs 1,700 in HMDA area outside GHMC. Twenty per cent hike has been proposed for the value of property (per sq feet) up to Rs 4,000 and 30% in case of properties valued above Rs 4,000 per sft. Since the market rates of agriculture properties have witnessed multi-fold increase in the past seven years, the minimum value is Rs 5 lakh per acre from the exiting Rs 2.5 lakh value per acre in HMDA limits. “After formation of Telangana, irrigation facilities have improved in all the districts and land rates also increased. There is a huge variation between the government rate and market rate,” a district registrar of the registration department said. The state has proposed100% hike in existing values of properties between Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh and 40% or Rs 20 lakh, whichever is higher, on values between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 crore and it will be 30% hike or Rs 1.40 crore whichever is higher for existing farm land over Rs 1 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-to-cap-revision-of-non-agri-land-values-at-50-for-reg-/articleshow/84253848.cms||Koride Mahesh

The owners of furnace, rolling mills and other allied units also claim that they have to pay Rs 100 crore to labourers even when there is no work for the almost 10 days of keeping their units shut. According to furnace industry representatives, in the wake of the weekly off orders, more than 500 units have completely shut down since July 1 and will remain so till July 10 when the weekly off ends. K K Garg, president of Induction Furnace Association of North India (IFANI), said, “Earlier, for almost two months, industrial oxygen supply to our factories remained suspended due to which majority of furnaces were closed. Now, the power crisis has forced us to shut down since July 1.” According to Garg, a delegation of the association met PSPCL chairman A Venu Prasad but there will be solution to this forced weekly off. “Already, our units were running on 50% capacity due to less orders, but now due to the restrictions of PSPCL, we cannot even operate our units at half capacity,” According to Dev Gupta, general secretary of IFANI, “There are close to 250 furnaces, 150 rolling mills and equal number of allied units in and around Ludhiana. All these units have power connections ranging from 250KW to 1,500KW or even more. But according to the orders of PSPCL, induction furnace can use maximum of 50KVA load while arc furnace consumers can use 5% of their sanctioned load. Going by the restrictions on usage of load set by PSPCL it is not possible for us to carry out production activity in our factories as huge power load is required to run even a single process.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/will-suffer-production-loss-of-rs-1k-cr-due-to-pspcl-weekly-off-orders-furnace-industry/articleshow/84250577.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Pune||IESA seeks step to check wilful defaulters||Pune: The Independent English Medium Schools’ Association in Maharashtra has threatened to surrender their government permission to operate in the state if the education department does not take steps against wilful defaulters for fees. The IESA, an association of over 1,000 schools in Maharashtra, has suggested that a scrutiny of these defaulters should be carried by the government and if found faulty, then the children should be transferred to zilla parishad schools. Rajendra Dayma, president of IESA, said, “All this while, school managements have been sympathetic to families who have lost chief wage earners to Covid granting them waivers and scholarships. Even those who have suffered huge pay cuts and massive business losses are being helped. Given all these constraints, school managements keep hoping that parents of wards, who are not under financial distress, clear their dues in time. But with confusing communications issued by the government, a substantial number of parents are now reluctant to pay their dues.” The school representatives affiliated to IESA said they were seeking clarity from the government to guide them with ways to deal with belligerent parents who refused to pay. They want the government to suggest ways to stay afloat. The officials at IESA said their problem was about the wilful defaulters who were less than 1% but create a ruckus at the government offices and never approach the school. Dayma said, “The government is planning to make a 15 % fee cut and if this proposal is accepted by IESA and private schools, what actions can institutions take against wilful defaulters? We have suggested that such defaulters be given admission/s in the nearest zilla parishad school to have free education.” The IESA, during the news conference, stated that the affiliated schools to their association were willing to surrender their permissions but the effect would be on lakhs of students and thousands of RTE students and the employment of teaching and non-teaching staff was also at stake. Dayma added, “We would like to work closely with the government in finding a solution. Should the minister still persist in de-recognizing our institutions for initiating action against handful parents who wilfully default, we would like to offer closing them down on our own volition. But we should not be blamed for putting at stake future of several thousand children.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/iesa-seeks-step-to-check-wilful-defaulters/articleshow/84250588.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Nagpur||Fly ash still flying from power plants||Nagpur: Despite penalties and fines being levied on coal-based power plant operators for recurring fly ash breaches in the country, a new study has questioned the effectiveness of monetary compensation as deterrents.The report — ‘Lest We Forget: A status report of neglect of coal ash accidents in India (May 2019 - May 2021)’ — was jointly released by ASAR Social Impact Advisors, Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) and Manthan Adhyayan Kendra. The report is a status update on fly ash breaches at coal-based plants in India during that period.It highlights how mismanagement of fly ash has been a recurring problem in Maharashtra among other states, with cases reported especially across Khaparkheda and Koradi Power plants in Nagpur district. “Cases of leakage from power plants polluting water bodies and affecting livelihood of residents as well were reported from these areas over the past two to three years,” the report stated. The study also takes an in-depth look into eight such incidents across six states including Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.The authors have highlighted that in some cases, fly ash still remains on the fields, and wells within the vicinity of villages, ash rendering it unfit for use even several months after breach incidents occurred. “Power plants have failed at not only removal of ash, remediation of sites, addressing health impacts but also in paying full compensation to affected villages,” the report said.Airborne ash has been leading to tuberculosis cases and breathing issues especially across central India. Impacts also include severe pollution in natural water bodies as ash was dumped directly in rivers, the study recorded. Among major recommendations important for the state, the report calls for the need for criminal action in response to coal ash accidents, mandatory routine technical assessments for ash ponds, increasing transparency and public access to information and continuous collective effort by civil society in holding the relevant authorities accountable. Sehr Raheja, co-author at Manthan Adhyayan Kendra, said that in the context of climate change, it is essential for India to plan a future away from coal at the earliest and also prioritise the focus on pollution due to coal ash. “Consistent monitoring and improvements in the systems related to coal ash management are the need of the hour as accidents discussed in our report are not the first of their kind, and unlikely to be the last,” she said. The report also highlights that while some states are struggling with financial compensation, others are facing a huge ecological crisis. Only 10-20% of the interim environmental damage compensation (up to ₹10 crore depending on the scale of damage caused) has been deposited by three thermal power plants in Madhya Pradesh, with around 80-90% still not deposited to the pollution control boards despite over 18 months from the accidents, the report said.Medha Kapoor, co-author at ASAR said, “All the fly ash breaches are strung by a common thread, which is lack of industrial will towards transparency, accountability, compliance; and a governance system with law enforcement, penalization, and monitoring that routinely fall short.”“Since ash is treated as a waste product and not a raw material that can be used for manufacture of cement and concrete, it is invariably dumped in a haphazard manner. A better way to deal with the problem is to mandate that dry fly ash is stored in silos and transported in air tight containers. This would ensure that the fly ash can be productively used for manufacture of cement, concrete etc,” said Debi Goenka, executive trustee of Conservation Action Trust.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fly-ash-still-flying-from-power-plants/articleshow/84245967.cms||Manka Behl

Jal shakti mission is a campaign inspired by the central government focusing on conservation of rainwater and groundwater recharge and regeneration. The LG also stressed on creation of new rainwater harvesting structures, jal shakti park and setting up of jal shakti kendras besides incentivising conservation and penalizing water wastage as the way forward for ensuring citizens participation. He asked Delhi Jal Board to adopt technologies so as to detect and plug leakage of water at the earliest, on a real time basis and also start putting into place systems that would enable the linking of the water saved, conserved and regenerated through efforts under jal shakti mission, to the water supply system in the city. LG reiterated that there is a need to quantifiably assess the wastage of water prevented and the amount of water generated by such efforts.

Usually after the onset of monsoon, it covers the entire state within seven to eight days. Though the southwest monsoon arrived in Rajasthan on June 18, Jaipur, Ajmer and Bharatpur divisions and parts of western Rajasthan were yet to get their first monsoon showers. According to weathermen, monsoon will resume its activities again from July 10. “Usually, monsoon enters Rajasthan from Kota and Jhalawar between June 18 and June 20 and covers the entire state by June 29. At times, there is a period of monsoon break, which usually lasts seven to eight days. But this year, it has taken a break of 18 days so far,” said Jaipur Met office director Radhey Shyam Sharma. Sharma added that due to cyclonic effects and non-activation of easterly winds, the monsoon break has been longer than the usual. “Things are now conducive for the further progress of monsoon from July 10 onwards. Many places in Jaipur, Ajmer and Bharatpur division are likely to get mild to moderate showers soon,” Sharma added. Asked if the longer break of monsoon will lead to deficit rainfall in Rajasthan, he said, “I don’t think so. It is clear that from July 10 onwards, the districts where the monsoon rainfall is deficit are likely to get normal or more than normal rainfall. All deficit would be covered by the monsoon in its first spell in Jaipur, Ajmer and Bharatpur divisions of the state,” he added. Meanwhile, mercury continued its upward swing across the state. Majority of the places witnessed maximum temperatures on and above 40°C.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/monsoon-arrived-18-days-ago-but-raj-sees-longest-dry-spell-in-10-yrs/articleshow/84250559.cms||Ashish Mehta

---||Pune||Mhalunge TP scheme likely to be implemented by PMRDA: State urban development secretary||Pune: State urban development secretary Bhushan Gagrani has said that the proposed Mann-Mhalunge Town Planning scheme should continue to remain with the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) even though Mhalunge has been merged into the Pune municipal limits. “We are contemplating how to go about it. Ideally, it should remain with PMRDA and then it can be handed over to the PMC,” he told TOI. The principal secretary (urban development-1) said that the PMRDA could be appointed as a Special Planning Authority (SPA) for the project. “We are exploring if the PMRDA can develop the infrastructure and hand it over to the Pune Municipal Corporation as the Pimpri Chinchwad New Town Development Authority used to do in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation limits. It would be a win-win situation for both. We will take a decision soon on this issue,” he said. It has been more than two years since Pune’s first high tech city and town planning scheme was announced by the former BJP-SS ruled state government. The foundation stone laying was held on November 15, 2018.The special town planning scheme was based on the Ahmedabad town planning scheme and the only one among the merged villages. The previous government had showcased this scheme in the Magnetic Maharashtra meet. The PMRDA said that the town planning scheme had been planned on 250 hectares by spending Rs640 crore. It was slated to be completed in the next three years. The scheme was expected to attract Rs21,300 crore investment. According to officials, the arbitration process with the plot owners has been completed and the next step is to get the final town planning scheme sanctioned and the appointment of the tribunal. “Altogether 350 plots have been marked in the 250 hectares plot. According to the scheme, the landowners are to get 50% of developed land back in the scheme,” stated the official As per the plan, PMRDA was to borrow Rs600 crore loan from the Housing and Urban Development Corporation Limited (HUDCO) to develop basic infrastructure like roads and other facilities, before allowing private plot owners to develop their plots. The announcement offered hope for planned development of many other areas and the PMRDA had said that it had plans to replicate similar town planning schemes at 40 other places in their jurisdiction.

---||Hyderabad||Beverly Hills in Budvel! Rs 30 crore luxe villas new address of Hyderabad’s uber-rich||HYDERABAD: Move over Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad’s uberrich have found new addresses for their luxurious homes. Their top three picks -- Narsingi, Gandipet and Budvel – each flaunting price tags of anywhere between Rs 20 crore and Rs 30 crore. Spread over 10,000 to 20,000 square feet (sft) of built-up area, these upcoming premium villas with top-end fixtures, large lung spaces and frills of an upscale community, have found a huge demand among the city’s crème de la creme, say developers. And majority of their buyers are long-time residents of tony neighbourhoods of Jubilee Hills or Banjara Hills, they add. “With multiple streets turning commercial, Jubilee Hills no longer has the charm that it once did. Forget about peace and calm, there’s no place to even go for a walk now,” said a senior executive of an IT firm who’s looking forward to moving into his Rs 23-crore villa in Narsingi, after living in Jubilee Hills for over 12 years. The fact that these homes are only a 20-minute drive away from Financial District, is also a selling point, said a senior IT professional who is trading his Jubilee Hills home for a Rs 20-crore villa in Gandipet. Another attraction: Amenities of a gated community. “That makes these homes more secured while offering all other facilities – parks, gyms, cafes etc. Right now, even if I want to go for a swim, I have to take out my car and go to my club,” said a top official of a pharma major. After spending over a decade in Banjara Hills, he is now waiting for his home in Budvel to be readyto-occupy. “People who can afford it, now want bigger homes with more green spaces around. That’s the USP of our project, ‘The Reserve’, which is planned over 80 acres in Narsingi but will have only 120-130 villas. We intend to have a park behind every row of houses,” said V Aditya Reddy, executive director of Sri Aditya Homes. What’s also working for Pooja Crafted Homes’ ‘Big Homes’ is the location. “The terrain of Budvel is very similar to that Jubilee Hills. That gives customers a sense of familiarity, even as they move away from a place they have lived in for very long,” said Showri Reddy, CEO of the firm. His project — each unit priced at Rs 10 crore to Rs 30 crore — is popular as Beverly Hills too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/beverly-hills-in-budvel-rs-30-crore-luxe-villas-new-address-of-citys-uber-rich/articleshow/84253851.cms||Sudipta Sengupta
---||Delhi||Delhi: From next year, you can take driving licence test any day of the week between 8am and 8pm||NEW DELHI: From next year, the applicants for permanent driving licence will be able to appear for a test on any day of the week and at any time between 8am and 8pm. This facility is to be launched from five of the most busy regional transport offices (RTOs) in Delhi. The transport department plans to start 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, from the automated driving test tracks at Sarai Kale Khan (South zone), Loni Road (North East zone), Shakur Basti (North West zone), Rohini (North West-II zone) and Janakpuri (West zone). These RTOs issue the highest number of licences every year and the 12-hour shifts will also be planned for other RTOs later, depending on the volume. With the completion of work at Lado Sarai, Hari Nagar and Jharoda Kalan, Delhi would have a total of 12 automated driving test tracks by next year and that is also when the department plans to rope in another agency for maintenance and operations of these tracks. The centres will also get electronic queue management systems to avoid crowding and applicants will be taken to the track when their turn comes. The department is going to rope in a private player for printing and despatching driving licences and registration certificates. The entire centre will be covered by CCTV cameras and the live feed will be monitored from the transport department’s headquarters. A site manager will be in charge of the centre and all facilities. The applicants will have to book a slot online and on reaching the centre at the allotted time, driving licence facilitation executives will verify their documents and they will be seated in a waiting area for their turn. The applicants will be taken to the automated track in batches and escorted to the test track by the site manager. A test engineer will ensure that the tests are taken by the automated software and the computerised results will be sent to the motor licensing officer of the respective RTO, which will issue the permanent licence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/from-next-year-you-can-take-dl-test-any-day-of-the-week-between-8am-and-8pm/articleshow/84250700.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Many from 18-44 age group turn up for Covishield, return disappointed||NAGPUR: Even though the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had announced that Covishield won't be available for the 18-44 age group on Thursday but only for those aged 45 years and above, many beneficiaries from the younger population turned up at different government centres. Also, some confusion prevailed among citizens regarding Covishield and Covaxin, which have different schedules for different age groups. The NMC has reserved 50% offline slots for spot registration of the 45+ age group, as these beneficiaries are more comfortable with the manual process, civic officials said. A resident of Laxmi Nagar said he and his wife fall in the 18-44 group and were surprised to know that they were not eligible for Covishield dose on Thursday. “We know some people who tested positive soon after vaccination. Hence, we are trying to avoid crowds. But when we reached, there were no doses,” they said. Free-of-cost Covishield doses won’t be available for any age group at any government centre in the city for the next two days. Civic officials were also unaware if the drive would resume on Saturday in the city. However, the NMC would continue with Covaxin doses at the three designated centres — Ambedkar Hospital, GMCH and Mahal Diagnostics Centre — for all groups. Paucity of doses once again slowed down the vaccination programme, which, a day before had surpassed 63,000 inoculations in the district. Out of 204 vaccination centres, many centres couldn’t stretch their session beyond 1pm, while several others managed not more than 50 vaccinations in the day. The figures plummeted to 22,243 on Thursday. Of these, 16,990 were done in the city and 5,253 were from the rural centres. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said the civic body hadn’t received the vaccination schedule as on Thursday evening. “Covaxin would be available to run three centres for all age groups and both doses. Some centres had to shut down by 1pm as they ran out of doses. Some 18-45 years age-group beneficiaries had gathered at some centres to enquire, though we had announced unavailability of vaccines for them. We are sending alerts a day in advance on social media and in newspapers to ensure people don’t face trouble,” he said. With increased vaccination centres, the civic body now needs at least 50,000 doses everyday for the city, which gets 50% of the district’s allotted doses. But the district is expecting not more than 50,000 doses in the next delivery from the state government, probably by Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/many-from-18-44-age-group-turn-up-for-covishield-return-disappointed/articleshow/84246007.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Hence, only 382 posts of engineers are filled in the department, as per data received from the department. Of these 3,125 posts, the order to fill 2,061 posts of junior engineers was kept in abeyance by the finance department and later the recruitment process of these posts was withdrawn by the rural development department, said an informed source in the department. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot had in the recent past directed officials to complete the recruitment of junior clerk-2013 in panchayati raj department in a phased manner. In the first phase, 4,000 posts will be filled while remaining will be done in the next phase, he said. Rajesh Sharma, president of rural development and panchayati raj engineers association said of the 3,125 sanctioned posts of engineers in rural development and panchayati raj department, only 382 posts are filled. “Currently, only 247 junior engineers are working in the department. Of these, 200 are working as Adhoc assistant engineers (AENs) against the vacant posts of AENs. Hence, only 47 junior engineers are posted. Last recruitment of a junior engineer was done in 2012,” said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/only-12-engineer-posts-filled-in-panchayati-raj-dept/articleshow/84250627.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Proposal to cancel NOCs issued to 8 schools||Mumbai: A proposal to cancel the No-Objection Certificates (NOCs) of eight schools in the Mumbai division that violated the Right to Education (RTE) Act by denying students online learning or by detaining them has been sent to the state education director in Pune. State education minister Varsha Gaikwad had on June 30 directed education officers to take action against schools violating the RTE Act. On Wednesday, following meetings with education officers of the Mumbai division, the eight schools were found to have violated the RTE Act. After the academic year began in June, several parents complained of fee hikes and students being denied online access. Parents also complained of students being denied marksheets and even school leaving certificates. Several parents have also been protesting outside schools. Billabong High International School in Malad and Santacruz was found to have violated section 12 (1) (c) (reserve 25% seats for children belonging to economically weaker sections from the neighbourhood). The Malad school denied online learning to 25 students admitted under the RTE Act, while the Santacruz school prevented four students admitted under the RTE Act from taking online classes. The proposal for taking action was made by the civic education department. The schools offer CBSE, ICSE and IGCSE boards. Six CBSE schools in Navi Mumbai were also found to have violated the RTE Act. The NMMC had sent a proposal to the state seeking cancellation of NOCs of these schools. They were found to have hiked fees, detained students, and denied marksheets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-proposal-to-cancel-nocs-issued-to-8-schools/articleshow/84250670.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Aapli bus passengers irked due to curtailed timings||NAGPUR: With the ‘Break The Chain’ restrictions allowing establishments in the city to remain open only till 4pm, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has curtailed the Aapli Bus timings. From earlier 6am to 10pm, the city bus service is operating only till 7pm. The move has irked passengers, especially workers from industrial areas like Butibori, Hingna, Kalmeshwar etc. “Everyone is out on the field to earn their daily bread after a series of lockdowns. In such times, the NMC should support us by providing bus service across all routes,” said Pardi resident Mahesh Dukre who works in Hingna MIDC. State government directives clearly say that public transport can operate with 100% capacity but without standing, but TOI spotted many overcrowded buses with passengers standing in them. With markets opened, around 46,000 passengers are commuting daily in Aapli Bus service, as per data procured from NMC’s transport department. Some passengers said they are forced to travel standing as they either cannot afford other modes of transport or cannot wait for the next bus. There is complete inconsistency in Aapli Bus service, was their general reaction. The working hours of various industrial areas, private and government offices. There are many who travel for work to Khaparkheda, Pardi, Butibori, Kalmeshwar, Hingna MIDC, Ordnance Factory Ambajhari, Wadi, Koradi, Kamptee and many other places. Almost 90% passengers travelling in city buses belong to the lower to upper lower class. “NMC should empathise with such them. NMC is supposed to spend on welfare of Nagpurians. Instead of thinking it as a business, NMC should run the buses as a service to citizens,” said passengers. Rajesh Kortim, professional and a resident of Bokhara, was of the view that the civic body never takes these factors and convenience of passengers into consideration before curtailing the bus service. By operating only 50% buses (200 are operating currently), citizens are forced to use private vehicles, thereby increasing expenses on fuel charges. According to traffic police, vehicular traffic has increased after easing of restrictions, causing increase in road accidents. They too said the Aapli Bus service should be strengthened. Maya Ojas, who works in Hingna MIDC, said that she is forced to use a two-wheeler due to curtailed city bus service. “And then the government says number of accidents should come down. It is causing criminal waste of petrol and human lives are at stake due to civic body’s attitude,” said Ojas. Additional municipal commissioner Jalaj Sharma said that the Aapli Bus timings have been curtailed due to state government guidelines. “If other cities like Mumbai and Pune were running late night city bus service, NMC will review the timings,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/aapli-bus-passengers-irked-due-to-curtailed-timings/articleshow/84245997.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

However, pregnant women in the state said they are confused about taking the jab. Health experts from reputed medical colleges from across the country, Lady Hardinge Medical College and AIIMS, New Delhi, said pregnant women will benefit from the vaccine. They expressed their views during an online training programme cum review workshop organised by the health department. The Union health ministry, too, says the decision to vaccinate pregnant women was made after it was recommended by the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation saying the advantages outweigh the potential risks. Talking to TOI, several doctors in the state who have been treating pregnant women said they should go for the vaccine as it will reduce the chances of pre-mature deliveries and reduce the risk of severe infection. Noted city-based gynaecologist Dr Sushma Priya said, “In my opinion, pregnant women should take the vaccine after 10 weeks of their pregnancy as during this period, organogenesis takes place. Pregnant women are already immunocompromised and they should go for the vaccine as it will avoid unwanted complications like pre-term delivery.” Another specialist, Dr Archana, an associate professor at the gynaecology department of Rims, said, “I would ask my patients to make an informed choice as it will help in avoiding unwanted complications. I have witnessed maternal deaths due to the Covid infection among pregnant women during the second wave .” On being asked whether the inoculation will have any future impact on the mother and the child, both Dr Priya and Dr Archana said only a scientific study can tell the implications. Meanwhile, Sushmita Pandey, a pregnant woman in her first trimester, raised her apprehension over the vaccine and said, “I am not going to take the jab as I am not sure about the study and the findings yet. I have consulted this with my gynaecologist after which I have decided that I will take precaution to keep away from the infection.” Another pregnant woman, Snehpriya, said, “I do not know whether I should go for the vaccine or not as I feel that the government allowed it at a later stage. There must be some good reasons behind it but I will wait and weigh my options before taking the jab.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-begins-ground-work-for-pregnant-womens-vax-drive/articleshow/84248582.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Jamshedpur||No vaccine drive today as Jharkhand runs out of stock||RANCHI: With Jharkhand running short of Covid-19 vaccines for the second time in the last fortnight, the vaccination drive in the state is to be suspended from Friday. The drive was limited to a single vaccination centre in Ranchi on Thursday even as the state health department diverted around 6,000 doses from three districts for the state capital. The department said a total of 58,443 people were administered the vaccine on Wednesday and had 47,210 doses left for Thursday. The next consignment is set to reach Ranchi on Friday when over one lakh doses will arrive. However, the drive in the district is likely to be disrupted from Friday as distribution and transportation take time. Officer on special duty to the health department, Naman Priyesh Lakra, said, “We are left with only 40,000 doses as on Thursday morning and that did not suffice for the day’s vaccination target. We do not any doses left for Friday.” Lakra added that the state is set to receive over one lakh doses of Covaxin on Friday. “Once we receive the doses, we will send them to the districts. Meanwhile, the department redirected 6,000 doses (3,000 doses from Dumka and 1,500 doses each from Palamu and Sahibganj) for the drive in Ranchi. Still, several beneficiaries in the city had to return home without getting the vaccine. District civil surgeon Dr Vinod said, “We have only one site (AG office complex) active on Thursday as we do not have enough doses. We have been informed that around 6,000 doses have been redirected for us but are yet to arrive.” Neelam Kumari, a resident of Kokar, said, “I had gone to the district hospital for my first dose but I was told that there were no vaccine doses left. I have been asked to visit the centre after two days.” Notably, the state had experienced a similar vaccine shortage between June 29 and July 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/no-vax-drive-today-as-jharkhand-runs-out-of-stock/articleshow/84259178.cms||Gaurav Pandey

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: In a first for Hazaribag, three CPI Maoists lay down arms||HAZARIBAG: The CPM recorded its opposition against the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and termed the death of Swamy a ‘murder’. Those surrendered were identified as Sarita Soren (19) alias Mumta Santhali, Usha Kishku (27) alias Usha Santhali alias Fulmani and Nageshwar Ganjhu (38). They were associated with Mithilesh Singh and Karu Yadav’s gang. The two were zonal commander and sub-zonal commander respectively operating in Hazaribag, Bokaro, Ramgarh and Chatra. Deputy commissioner Aditya Kumar Anand said that all surrendered rebels will get benefits under the state government’s surrender policy. Hazaribag superintendent of police Kartik S, officials of the CRPF were present on the occasion. Karthik said this was the first ever surrender in Hazaribag. He said, “These three Maoists were forced to surrender after the repeated campaigns and raids by police against rebel forces.” He added that among the three, Usha is a prize catch. She joined the Naxal organization in 2009. She and Sarita belong to Harli village under Ango police station of Churchu block of Hazaribag. “Ango was a known Naxal belt for nearly three decades. Usha was active in the bordering areas of Chatra, Bokaro and Hazaribag and six Naxal cases were filed against her in Chatra and Hazaribag districts. The state police headquarters had announced Rs 1 lakh reward on her head.” This amount has handed over to her on Thursday. There were no rewards on the other two but they will get benefits like land, house loan and so on under the surrender policy. Sarita joined the Maoist group in 2015. Nageshwar joined in 2018 and was active in Hazaribag and Chatra districts. “Two cases were lodged against him,” said Karthik, adding that Nageshwar belonged to Katkamdag police station. All three surrendered Maoists said that they didn’t benefit from the Naxal movement and were happy to have returned to the mainstream. The police officer hoped that more active members of Maoists will follow suit in Hazaribag following Thursday’s development. “For bringing Naxalites into the mainstream of society, we have launched a video which is being displayed in the Naxal areas of the district. The theme of the song is ‘wapas aao life bachao aur banao’,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/in-a-1st-for-hazaribag-three-cpi-maoists-lay-down-arms/articleshow/84248647.cms||Abhijit Sen

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Followers of Fr Stan Swamy to gherao Raj Bhavan on July 15||RANCHI: Friends and followers of Father Stan Swamy have decided to stage “Raj Bhavan gherao” protest on July 15 to demand a judicial inquiry into the priest’s death, repealing of the UAPA and release of all political prisoners. Prior to the protest, his supporters would also carry out ‘pathalgarhi’, the tribal ritual of erecting stone tablets on Sunday after receiving the “sacred” soil from St Peter’s Church in Bandra, Mumbai, where Swamy was buried. Hundreds of Swamy’s supporters congregated at Bagaicha here on Thursday in a condolence meeting and deliberated on the future course of action to pay tribute to him. The meeting, organised by the Adivasi Adhikar Manch (AAM), was attended by representatives of political parties, civil society organizations, human rights activists, tribal outfits and members of the Jesuit family. The objective of the meeting was to register a protest for Swamy’s death in judicial custody and to adopt a resolution for a further course of action, the organisers said. Aloka Kujur of AAM said the Jamshedpur Church is coordinating with Bandra Church in Mumbai to bring home the “sacred” soil of Swamy from his burial ground. “Once the sacred soil arrives here, Swamy would be received with both tribal and Christian rituals. Ceremonial 'pathalgarhi' would be carried out on the premises of Bagaicha and his room would be named as Johar Stan,” she said. “Tribal don’t believe in the concept of heaven and for them, Swamy continues to live in another form. So, we are going to carry out the ritual of “chhai ghusana" (bringing home through the ashes),” Kujur said, explaining that ash would be spread in his room and his followers would wait and watch the footprints of a creature. “Based on the ‘chaam’ (footprint), we will revere that creature as Swamy and take a pledge never to harm it,” she added. Attending the condolence meet, filmmaker Meghnad, who was also a student of Swamy at the Indian Social Institute in the 1980s, said Swamy lived like Jesus Christ in service of the people. “He would often laugh when being addressed as father and in return would call me son just because he wanted only to serve people without being distinguished from them,” he said. Noted tribal activist Dayamani Barla said Swamy not only worked from the ground but also wrote extensively to make people aware of the oppression against the tribal and weak communities. “He openly spoke against land acquisition laws, religious conversion bills and mob lynching,” she said. During the meeting, poems written by Swany during his incarceration in jail were read out while Anshu Toppo of the All India Catholic University Federation recited a poem on Swamy that she had composed. The organisers also circulated a brief memoir of Swamy’s life and work. They described the Bagaicha as his ‘karmabhumi’. Sugia, a resident of Bagaicha, said, “He always spoke of conserving nature and people in their vicinity.” The meeting was attended by JMM central general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya, Congress MLA Rajesh Kacchap, former deputy CM Stephen Marandi, Rajesh Yadav of RJD, Suvendu Sen of CPIML, Prakash Viplav of CPM and Ajay Singh of CPI among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/followers-of-fr-stan-swamy-to-gherao-raj-bhavan-on-july-15/articleshow/84248757.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

---||Goa||Marathon meet winds up after midnight at Campal||Panaji: The North Goa public hearing on the draft Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP), at Campal Parade Grounds, saw bouts of protests from participating citizens and political groups. The hearing went on non-stop from 10am on Thursday with no lunch break and continued till after midnight. It began with a presentation by state authorities in Konkani on what the draft plan covered. When it was the turn of participants to speak, protests broke out with speakers claiming poor arrangements. Many demanded that the screen at the venue be used to display their village maps and areas when they make their presentations. Participants said it was difficult for them to explain the shortcomings in their area’s CZMP without the maps. A major complaint was that the plans prepared by individual village panchayats did not reflect in the official draft of the plan. Citizens also alleged that khazans, sand dunes and other natural systems have been wrongly depicted. They said that this was deliberately done by the authorities to favour hoteliers and other commercial interests. Issues were also raised over there being no authorities on the dais when participants were making their presentations, to which North Goa collector Ajit Roy said that two scientists from the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM) — the Chennai-based agency charged with preparing the plan — as well as experts of the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) were present. Around 100 pre-registered and 50 spot registered persons spoke at the hearing. Participant Kashinath Shetye said that GCZMA’s decision to exclude structures from the draft was wrong. He said that all legal structures should be depicted so that the illegal ones are easily identifiable. “In many areas, the high tide line (HTL) is shown in the seawater. When it comes to hotels, the HTL is in the sea, when it comes to the common man the HTL is shown and houses are demolished. Some coastal wetlands are reflected in the plan,” Shetye said. Matias Saldanha from St Estevam said that the WRD is the wrong authority to provide data on khazans, as the department has accepted that it does not have such data and that it only has a record of bunds. “So the khazan data should be referred to a committee on khazans. Similarly, the fisheries department has no data on riverine fishing at all. The NIO data on sand dunes should be used to show sand dunes,” he said. “My ward in Divar has not been marked as a fishing ward in the plan, so how will you protect the livelihood of the fishing community, which is the aim of the plan. There is no mention of the community, but the fish landing jetty has been shown,” Victor Tito Fernandes said. He also said that the Salim Ali bird sanctuary has also not been indicated in the draft. Many participants said that the plan has only been prepared using satellite imagery and that no ground work has been carried out by the NCSCM. “Plans prepared by villages have been thrown in the bin. Not a single person from NCSCM has come to our villages to explain the plans. We are supposed to give suggestions on plans we do not know how to read. It was incumbent on the authorities to explain it and get an informed consent,” Anand Gad from Bicholim said. Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte said that there is conflict of interest as NCSCM comes under the Union environment ministry. “The plan should have been made by a third party. The consultant was paid Rs 3 crore and no ground truthing has been carried out.” Goa Foundation which didn’t attend the public hearing submitted a 500-plus page written submission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/marathon-meet-winds-up-after-midnight-at-campal/articleshow/84250796.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

Participants boycotted the proceedings in protest of the authorities’ decision to continue the hearing without adjourning it for the day. However, as the authorities went ahead, new participants entered the venue much later and the hearing continued non-stop. As the clock struck six, protesters boycotted the hearing citing reasons like lack of public transport to enable the participants to get back home, and lack of food arrangements at the venue. South Goa collector Ruchika Katyal tried to reason out with the protesters, but they stood their ground and dispersed from the venue. Katyal, however, said that the hearing would continue, despite the boycott. “There are virtual speakers who will present their submissions. We have to hear them out too,” Katyal told TOI.The virtual participants also declined to give their submissions in protest. “There are no people out there. Besides, nobody on the panel has any answers to questions being raised. Therefore I don’t want to speak,” one of the participants, who had opted for the virtual mode, told the panel when her name was called out. She was alluding to the objections raised by previous speakers who had protested the refusal of the expert members and administration officials to reply to any of the questions raised by them. “All your objections are being recorded, you please carry on,” was the stock reply every speaker received when he/she persisted with any query, which frequently led to angry outbursts from the speakers and the crowd who jeered the officials. Another virtual speaker, Sidharth Karapurkar ended his brief submission in protest. “None of the authorities bothered to come to the villages to obtain factual data for preparation of the plan. None also, thereafter, came to the villages to explain the plan. So, don’t say that the CZMP is made in the interest of the people of Goa. Say that it is made for the capitalists of India. The experts are dumb and can’t answer any of the questions. With this I end my submission in protest,” he said, which, in effect, summed up the views of most of the speakers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-breaks-participants-walk-out-of-margao-meet-at-6pm/articleshow/84250852.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

A participant, Alvito D’Cruz, when called upon to submit his views, said that he needed a lunch break as he was terribly hungry and had no energy to make his submissions. He refused to begin with his speech unless a break was provided. Faced with a dilemma, South Goa collector Ruchika Katyal attempted to disarm the speaker by empathising with him. She walked up to the speaker, and smilingly thrust a few toffees and chocolates into his hand. Though the collector’s “sweet” gesture had its effect, the demand was pursued by the succeeding speaker, prompting Katyal to announce a 30-minute lunch break.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sweet-gesture-south-collector-uses-chocolate-to-pacify-angry-speaker/articleshow/84250897.cms||---
---||Goa||Protests over refusal to display map||Panaji: The North Goa draft Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) public hearing, held at Campal, was disrupted for nearly an hour by Revolutionary Goans (RG) and AAP supporters. Members of the two organisations vociferously protested against North Goa collector Ajit Roy’s refusal to display the map on the large display screens erected at the hearing venue. Protests broke out yet again at 9.30pm after the authorities refused to let some registered speakers put forth their concerns and representation. Roy’s assurance that all people would be allowed to speak, helped cool tempers. The protesters also prevented other speakers from going ahead, which did not go down well with some of the other participants, who were waiting to speak. “We won’t be able to put forth our point. These cheap publicity hungry leaders are ruining our chance to speak,” said a participant. The protesters also objected to Roy’s refusal to sit on the dais and respond to people’s concerns and queries. RG founder Manoj Parab said that the authorities had created different rules for North Goa and South Goa. Activist Cecille Rodrigues, who contested from Taleigao on the AAP ticket, also protested and said that the public hearing was a farce and a waste of taxpayer’s funds. The anger of the participants was simmering since morning after Roy refused to respond to people’s representations and demands for the CZMP plan to be displayed. “What kind of dictatorship is this that the plan or local map cannot be put up on the screen” said Parab. The participants said that they were unable to voice their suggestions and objections to the GCZMA, authorities and the NCSCM as they could not point out the mistakes on the plan. After a disruption of nearly an hour, Goa Police personnel finally escorted RG supporters away and dispersed the other participants protesting inside the venue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/protests-over-refusal-to-display-map/articleshow/84251097.cms||---
