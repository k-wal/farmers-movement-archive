They also submitted a memorandum addressed to the UP governor to the respective district authorities containing a 16-point charter of demands. The demands included guarantee to farmers that their produce would be backed by Minimum Support Price (MSP), payment of Rs 15,000 crore of cane dues, withdrawal of the farm laws, check price rise, jobs to unemployed, check crime against women, stop harassment of senior SP leader Azam Khan, his son Abdullah, other family members, and other SP leaders and provide proper medical equipment and care at government facilities, besides probing allegations of corruption related to Covid care and compensation to kin of those who died of the virus. In Lucknow, SP workers, including district president Jai Singh Jayant, MLA candidate Anurag Yadav, former MLA Rehan Naim, Pawan Manocha, Pooja Shukla and Dr Ashutosh Verma, along with hundreds of their supporters held protests at different locations across the district. Similar protests were held in all the districts across the state.

---||World||Pressing German-US issues as Merkel meets with Biden||WASHINGTON: Angela Merkel's farewell visit to the White House was shadowed on Thursday by pressing issues as well as good will, as she prepared to sit down with Joe Biden to discuss differences over a major Russian pipeline and national views on China as a rising global power. The German chancellor, who is not seeking another term in September elections, is nearing the end of a political career that has spanned four American presidencies. Merkel started her day with a working breakfast with Vice President Kamala Harris, and Harris' office said the two had a "very candid discussion,`` "In part, this is a farewell visit. In part, she is signaling continuity and stability in the German-US relationship,'' said Johannes Thimm, a senior fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, a think tank in Berlin. Back home in Germany, Merkel's country and neighboring Belgium dealt with the aftermath of heavy flooding that left more than 30 people dead and dozens missing. "My sympathy goes to the relatives and of the dead and missing,'' she said. Officials in Washington and elsewhere are wondering what course Germany might take after the September vote. The chancellor will seek to reassure the Americans that there won't be a huge shift, Thimm said. Merkel's party is leading in polls, but the environmentalist Greens and the center-left Social Democrats are also vying to lead a future government. While the three parties differ in many policy areas, all are committed to a strong trans-Atlantic relationship. One sour note that preceded and outlasted the Donald Trump era of diplomatic discord has been a new pipeline taking natural gas from Russia to Germany. The United States has long argued that the Nord Stream 2 project will threaten European energy security by increasing the continent's reliance on Russian gas and allowing Russia to exert political pressure on vulnerable Eastern and Central European nations. However, Biden recently waived sanctions against German entities involved in the project, a move that angered many in Congress. Biden is expected to raise his concerns about the pipeline project with Merkel, but the White House was not anticipating any sort of formal announcement to come from their talks, according to a Biden administration official who briefed reporters before Merkel's visit. Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, in a letter to Biden on Thursday raised concerns that the pipeline is already having an economic impact on US ally Ukraine. Rubio said that Gazprom, the company that operates Nord Stream 2, "has already started to reduce its use of pipelines in Ukraine" as the new gas pipeline nears completion. "I urge you to convey to Chancellor Merkel that there is broad bipartisan support for preventing the completion of yet another pipeline that bypasses Ukraine,'' Rubio wrote to Biden. "I further call on you to press Chancellor Merkel to support Ukraine against Russia's aggression.'' Merkel has tried to dampen expectations for an imminent breakthrough, but she probably will want to resolve the issue before leaving office. "It weighs on German-US relations and German-EU relations,'' Thimm said. While German officials have been unusually coy about which topics will be discussed during the trip, Merkel's spokesperson confirmed on Wednesday that China will come up. "That can be said with relative certainty,'' Steffen Seibert told reporters. "This also played an important role at the G-7 summit, where the chancellor and the American president last met.'' Germany has strong trade ties with China but has also been critical of Beijing's human rights record. Merkel is keen to avoid a situation in which Germany, or the European Union, might be forced to choose sides between China and the United States. Merkel has insisted on the need to cooperate with China on global issues such as climate change and the coronavirus pandemic, even while then-President Trump was accusing Beijing of having started it. The humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders urged Biden to lean on Merkel to drop her opposition to proposals for suspending vaccine patents. Merkel, a trained scientist, has argued that lifting the patents wouldn't be effective and could harm future research and development efforts. A group of Democratic lawmakers called on Germany to drop its "blockade'' of a Covid-19 related waiver of intellectual property rights under global trade rules. Such a waiver, the lawmakers argued, would help scale production of effective vaccines around the world. The Biden administration has expressed support for the waiver being discussed at the World Trade Organization, but White House officials do not anticipate differences being resolved during Merkel's visit. While there are points of tension, Biden seems eager to offer Merkel a proper farewell. Harris hosted Merkel for breakfast at her residence on the grounds of the US Naval Observatory before Merkel's afternoon meeting with Biden and a joint news conference. The president plans a small dinner in honor of Merkel. Harris greeted Merkel as she arrived at the residence and commended the chancellor for her "extraordinary career.`` Merkel in turn noted the historic nature of the Harris vice presidency. "I can only say that I'm delighted, too, for this opportunity here to meet the first madam vice president of the United States of America," Merkel said before the two leaders stepped into a residence to talk over a breakfast of Gruyere souffle, seasonal fruit, and charcuterie. Also Thursday, Merkel received an honorary doctorate (her 18th) from Johns Hopkins University and spoke at the university's school of advanced international studies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/pressing-german-us-issues-as-merkel-meets-with-biden/articleshow/84453719.cms||---
---||World||Child tax credit starts hitting US families' bank accounts||WASHINGTON: The child tax credit had always been an empty gesture to millions of parents like Tamika Daniel.  That changed Thursday when the first payment of $1,000 hit Daniel's bank account - and dollars started flowing to the pockets of more than 35 million families around the country. Daniel, a 35-year-old mother of four, didn't even know the tax credit existed until President Joe Biden expanded it for one year as part of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package that passed in March.  Previously, only people who earned enough money to owe income taxes could qualify for the credit. Daniel went nearly a decade without a job because her eldest son is autistic and needed her. So she got by on Social Security payments. And she had to live at Fairfield Courts, a public housing project that dead-ends at Interstate 64 as the highway cuts through the Virginia capital of Richmond.  But the extra $1,000 a month for the next year could be a life-changer for Daniel, who now works as a community organizer for a Richmond nonprofit. It will help provide a security deposit on a new apartment.  "It's actually coming right on time," she said. "We have a lot going on. This definitely helps to take a load off."  Biden has held out the new monthly payments, which will average $423 per family, as the key to halving child poverty rates. But he is also setting up a broader philosophical battle about the role of government and the responsibilities of parents.  Democrats see this as a landmark program along the same lines as Social Security, saying it will lead to better outcomes in adulthood that will help economic growth. But many Republicans warn that the payments will discourage parents from working and ultimately feed into long-term poverty.  Some 15 million households will now receive the full credit. The monthly payments amount to $300 for each child who is 5 and younger and $250 for those between 5 and 17. The payments are set to lapse after a year, but Biden is pushing to extend them through at least 2025.  The president ultimately would like to make the payments permanent - and that makes this first round of payments a test as to whether the government can improve the lives of families.  Biden invited beneficiaries to the White House to mark the first round of payments, saying in a Thursday speech that the day carried a historic resonance because of the boost it will give families across the nation.  "This would be the largest ever one-year decrease in child poverty in the history of the United States of America," the president said. "Millions of children and their families, starting today, their lives are about to change for the better. And our country would be better off for it as well."  Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who successfully championed increasing the credit in 2017, said that the Democrats' plans will turn the benefits into an "anti-work welfare check" because almost every family can now qualify for the payment regardless of whether the parents have a job.  "Not only does Biden's plan abandon incentives for marriage and requirements for work, but it will also destroy the child-support enforcement system as we know it by sending cash payments to single parents without ensuring child-support orders are established," Rubio said in a statement Wednesday.  The administration disputed those claims. Treasury Department estimates indicate that 97% of recipients of the tax credit have wages or self-employment income, while the other 3% are grandparents or have health issues. The credit also starts to phase out at $150,000 for joint filers, so there is no disincentive for the poor to work because a job would just give them more income.  Colorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet said the problem is one of inequality. He said that economic growth has benefited the top 10% of earners in recent decades, while families are struggling with the rising costs of housing, child care and health care. He said his voters back in Colorado are concerned that their children will be poorer than previous generations and that requires the expansion of the child tax credit.  "It's the most progressive change to America's tax code ever," Bennet told reporters.  Parenthood is an expensive undertaking. The Agriculture Department estimated in 2017, the last year it published such a report, that a typical family spends $233,610 to raise a child from birth to the age of 17. But wealthier children get far more invested in their education and upbringing, while poorer children face a constant disadvantage. Families in the top third of incomes spend about $10,000 more annually per child than families in the lower third.  The child tax credit was created in 1997 to be a source of relief, yet it also became a driver of economic and racial inequality as only parents who owed the federal government taxes could qualify for its full payment. Academic research in 2020 found that about three-quarters of white and Asian children were eligible for the full credit, but only about half of Black and Hispanic children qualified.  In the census tract where Daniel lives in Richmond, the median household income is $14,725 -almost five times lower than the national median. Three out of every 4 children live in poverty. For a typical parent with two children in that part of Richmond, the expanded tax credit would raise income by almost 41%.  The tax credit is as much about keeping people in the middle class as it is about lifting up the poor.  Katie Strelka, of Brookfield, Wisconsin, was laid off from her job as a beauty and hair care products buyer for the Kohl's department store chain in September as the pandemic tightened its grip on the country. She and her sons, 3-year-old Oliver and 7-year-old Robert, were left to depend on her husband's income as a consultant for retirement services. The family was already struggling to pay for her husband's kidney transplant five years earlier and his ongoing therapies before she was laid off, she said.  With no job prospects, Strelka reenrolled in college to study social work in February. Last month she landed a new job as an assistant executive director for the nonprofit International Association for Orthodontics. Now she needs day care again. That amounts to $1,000 a week for both kids.  All the tax credit money will go to cover that, said Strelka, 37.  "Every little bit is going to help right now," she said. "I'm paying for school out-of-pocket. I'm paying for the boys' stuff. The cost of food and everything else has gone up. We're just really thankful. The tide feels like it's turning."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/child-tax-credit-starts-hitting-us-families-bank-accounts/articleshow/84454713.cms||---

Udupi has recorded the highest number of dengue infections in the state (213), followed by Bengaluru city (195), Belagavi (145), Dakshina Kannada (127) and Ballari (69). The state has also seen 457 chikungunya cases till date. Shivamogga is the worst affected district with 81 cases, followed by Kolar (77). There are multiple dengue patients admitted in Bengaluru hospitals. Though compared to previous years, the number of dengue cases has reduced in the state since the beginning of the pandemic, authorities are on alert against mosquito-borne infections. In 2020, Karnataka saw 3,823 dengue cases and five deaths. Intermittent rainfall patterns are an added concern as it leads to fresh-water puddles, say authorities. Officials, however, admit that the due to Covid-19, the focus was not on dengue surveillance, which took a beating like all other public health measures. Dr Ramesh K Kaulgud, joint director, National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, health and family welfare department, said there are no suspected cases of Zika in Karnataka so far. The department has directed all districts to put in place vector-management plans to prevent outbreak of Zika. Monsoon tends to facilitate the spread of Aedes mosquito, which is a vector for Zika virus. “Dengue cases usually see a surge during monsoon, and health workers across the state have been directed to take up effective survey of larvae breeding to prevent dengue,” Dr Kaulgud said, adding no severe cases of dengue have been seen in the state and no deaths have been caused by it in 2021 so far. “Mosquitoes breed even inside homes and on terraces where there is stagnant water. The best way to prevent dengue is to use mosquito nets, maintain hygiene and make sure there is no larvae production inside the house,” said a senior health official. Dr BK Vijendra, chief health officer, BBMP, said the Palike is monitoring dengue cases and preventive modalities. “As of now, dengue is very much under control. Health officers in the city limits have been instructed to keep a watch on dengue and chikungunya,” he said. BBMP accounts for 15% of the total dengue cases in the state. Dr SM Prasad, paediatrician from north Bengaluru, said the need is to avoid mosquito bites in the morning and prevent water from stagnating in and outside homes. He came across a case of a 13-year-old girl who tested positive for dengue in NS1 antigen test on July 7, which proved current infection. “Acute tiredness, fever and rashes are the typical symptoms of dengue and one must be cautious, especially as monsoon has begun,” said Dr Prasad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/udupi-bluru-face-surge-in-dengue/articleshow/84454591.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Mangaluru||Karnataka: No bridge, villagers carry 70-year-old with broken leg on a stretcher across stream||MANGALURU: For decades now, any medical emergency in Marasanka village of Sullia taluk brings with it an added concern — how to transport the patient to an ambulance first, let alone reach hospital. But viral images of a 70-year-old woman with a fracture being carried in a stretcher across a stream in full flow have driven home the reality like never before. A day after the video made the rounds on social media, panchayat officials visited Marasanka village, about 90km from here, and vowed to step up the demand for a bridge. The villagers are not too hopeful, though. “From panchayat to Lok Sabha elections, only assurances are given,” said Sathish Naik, whose mother-in-law, Devaki, fractured her leg and became the latest “medical emergency” in the village. Admitting the dire situation, Sullia MLA and minister S Angara said a proposal for construction of 23 bridges is awaiting financial approval. “There are 76 villages and all of them have rivers or streams passing by. There is a need for 1,000 bridges, of which 400 have been built so far,” he said. “My mother-in-law, who is speech and hearing impaired, fell and broke her leg on Tuesday. She had severe pain and could not walk at all. Though a doctor visited us, he suggested that she should be taken to hospital,” said Naik. “Crossing the stream that joins Payaswini river is a challenge and during monsoon, the water level is around 5 feet and can increase at any time. As soon as the ambulance arrived, we got the stretcher home and with the help of neighbours, carried her for nearly 300m to reach the ambulance. She is now being treated at the government hospital and will have to undergo surgery,” he said. The village, which falls under Jalsoor gram panchayat, has nine houses and is located 10km from Sullia. Hanumantha Rayappa, assistant executive engineer, Sullia zila panchayat, who visited Marasanka, said the village needs a 15ft-wide bridge with approach roads on both ends which would cost around Rs 40 lakh. “We will bring this to the notice of minister S Angara at the KDP (state development programmes) meeting on Monday. The village is located on a hill and villagers have to travel for more than half a kilometre to reach Sullia-Jalsoor-Kasaragod road. They are willing to give away a portion of the land for bridge construction,” he said. GP member Mahesh Puchchappady, who mobilised funds from villagers of Kamila-Mogra for a 50ft bridge recently, said several villages are waiting for a bridge. “Sullia has remained a reserved assembly constituency, but still, not much development has taken place. Many projects remain on paper,” he said.

---||Bengaluru||Political circles abuzz as Karnataka CM BS Yediyurappa calls on PM Narendra Modi today||BENGALURU: Chief minister BS Yediyurappa’s sudden visit to New Delhi on Friday to meet the party brass has created a flutter in the state political circles. According to Yediyurappa’s loyalists, the CM will meet BJP national president JP Nadda and Union home minister Amit Shah and seeking their permission for a state cabinet rejig. They added that Yediyurappa will also meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi at 7pm to discuss political issues and to formally invite him for the launch of the government’s Khelo India Youth Games to be held in Bengaluru. Yediyurappa had last expanded his cabinet in January by inducting seven ministers. This time, he is planning to take up a similar exercise to mark completion of two years in office on July 26.  “He plans to drop some ministers, including those who have been criticising him in public, and accommodate new faces to put an end to dissidence once and for all,” said his loyalists. “The reshuffle is needed since a handful of seniors are enjoying power for several years,” said Yelahanka MLA and the CM’s pa’s confidant SR Viswanath.  Currently, with the exit of H Nagesh and Ramesh Jarkiholi, there are two vacancies in the cabinet. The chief minister is learnt to have been keen on inducting RR Nagar MLA N Munirathna as he is obligated to reward him for his contribution towards installing the BJP government in 2019. Munirathna is the only defector to be kept out of the cabinet apart from AH Vishwanath and Pratap Gowda Patil, who were defeated in the recent bypolls, while fourteen others were made ministers, party insiders said. Munirathna was not inducted owing to a pending election petition in the Supreme Court and sources said Yediyurappa will make a special request to take him in. However, some MLAs in the anti-Yediyurappa camp begged to differ, saying the CM has been summoned to discuss state leadership issue. “We are all keenly waiting for the party high command’s decision,” said tourism minister and one of the dissidents, CP Yogeeshwara. Karkala MLA V Sunil Kumar said the recent Union cabinet reshuffle has sent a clear message to non-performers in the party. “We will just wait and watch,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/political-circles-abuzz-as-bsy-calls-on-pm-today/articleshow/84454739.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

---||World||California approves first state-funded guaranteed income plan||SACRAMENTO: California lawmakers on Thursday approved the first state-funded guaranteed income plan in the US, $35 million for monthly cash payments to qualifying pregnant people and young adults who recently left foster care with no restrictions on how they spend it.  The votes - 36-0 in the Senate and 64-0 in the Assembly - showed bipartisan support for an idea that is gaining momentum across the country. Dozens of local programs have sprung up in recent years, including some that have been privately funded, making it easier for elected officials to sell the public on the idea.  California's plan is taxpayer-funded, and could spur other states to follow its lead.  "If you look at the stats for our foster youth, they are devastating," Senate Republican Leader Scott Wilk said. "We should be doing all we can to lift these young people up."  Local governments and organizations will apply for the money and run their programs. The state Department of Social Services will decide who gets funding. California lawmakers left it up to local officials to determine the size of the monthly payments, which generally range from $500 to $1,000 in existing programs around the country.  The vote came on the same day millions of parents began receiving their first monthly payments under a temporary expansion of the federal child tax credit many view as a form of guaranteed income.  "Now there is momentum, things are moving quickly," said Michael Tubbs, an advisor to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was a trailblazer when he instituted a guaranteed income program as mayor of Stockton. "The next stop is the federal government."  For decades, most government assistance programs have had strict rules about how the money could be spent, usually limiting benefits to things like food or housing. But a guaranteed income program gives money to people with no rules on how to spend it. The idea is to reduce the stresses of poverty that cause health problems and make it harder for people to find and keep work.  "It changes the philosophy from 'big brother government knows what's best for you,'" said state Sen. Dave Cortese, a Democrat from San Jose. "We've been very prescriptive with that population as a state and as counties go. Look at the failure. Half of them don't get their high school diplomas, let alone advance like other people their age."  But critics like Republican Assemblyman Vince Fong of Bakersfield say guaranteed income programs "undermine incentives to work and increase dependence on government."  "We should be pushing policies that encourage the value of work," said Fong, who abstained from Thursday's vote. "Guaranteed income doesn't provide the job training and skills needed for upward mobility."  Guaranteed income programs date back to the 18th century. The US government even experimented with them in the 1960s and 1970s during the Nixon administration before they fell out of favor.  But recently, guaranteed income programs have been making a comeback. Programs have been announced in New Orleans; Oakland, California; Tacoma, Washington; Gainesville, Florida; and Los Angeles - the nation's second largest city, which has a plan to give $1,000 a month to 2,000 needy families.  The state wants to target the money on programs that benefit pregnant people and young adults aged out of the foster care system to help them transition to life on their own. The latter includes people like Naihla De Jesus, who was removed from her mother's custody at 17 and bounced between living with an aunt, a godmother and a boyfriend until landing in a transitional housing program.  She became ineligible for that program when she turned 24 last year, which normally would have ended her government assistance as a foster child. Instead, the taxpayers of Santa Clara County have been paying her $1,000 a month with no restrictions on how she can spend it, part of a guaranteed income program targeting former foster care children.  De Jesus is also caring for her 9-year-old brother as his temporary guardian while battling anxiety and depression. She said her condition made it hard for her to keep a job because some days she wouldn't have enough energy to get out of bed and wouldn't go to work.  Now, she has a full-time job as a client support specialist with the Bill Wilson Center, where she works with young people who are in situations like hers. She says she doesn't worry about money like she used to, choosing to save most of what she gets from the guaranteed income program. She used some of it to buy things for her brother, whose interest in expensive electronics grows as he gets older.  And she used the money to save for a down payment for her "dream car," a blue Subaru WRX.  "I'm proud of myself, of where I am," she said. "I don't have to stress and then isolate myself and overthink, 'Oh, I'm not going to have enough money to pay my rent or pay my phone bill."  Santa Clara County's program has cost the county $1.4 million so far. Participants get the money on a debit card, which they can use for purchases or to withdraw money from an ATM. County officials ask them to fill out surveys to monitor how they are doing, but they haven't completed a thorough analysis, said Melanie Jimenez Perez, who oversees the program.  An analysis of a guaranteed program in Stockton found full-time employment increased among participants after the first year of receiving the money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/california-approves-first-state-funded-guaranteed-income-plan/articleshow/84455183.cms||---
---||World||US launches online hub to help ransomware victims||WASHINGTON The US government Thursday unveiled an online hub for the victims of ransomware attacks, saying it will make it easier for companies and municipalities to find resources and get assistance if they are targeted by cyber hackers. At the same time, the government also announced it will pay a reward of up to $10 million to anyone who can provide fruitful tips to track down cybercriminals who are backed or directed by foreign governments. The new website, www.StopRansomware.gov, is an initiative led by the Justice and Homeland Security departments. Many of the resources and information that organizations need to deal with ransomware attacks have historically been scattered across multiple websites, which increased the "likelihood of missing important information," the Justice Department said in a statement. The website is "the first central hub consolidating ransomware resources from all federal government agencies," it said. The $10 million rewards, meanwhile, is being offered by the US State Department's Rewards for Justice Program. The department said it has set up a dark web channel to help protect the safety of any tipsters who come forward with information. Reward payments may be paid in cryptocurrency, it added. The launch of the new website and the $10 million rewards come on the heels of a ransomware attack earlier this year against the Colonial Pipeline Co. that led to widespread shortages at gas stations along the East Coast of the United States. The Justice Department was later able to help Colonial Pipeline recover some $2.3 million in cryptocurrency ransom is paid to hackers. About $350 million in ransom was paid to cybercriminals in 2020, a more than 300% increase from the previous year, the department said. “The Department of Justice is committed to protecting Americans from the rise in ransomware attacks that we have seen in recent years," Attorney General Merrick Garland said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-launches-online-hub-to-help-ransomware-victims/articleshow/84453706.cms||---

On a balmy night on July 15, 2016, a rogue faction in the military tried to take over the country, using warplanes and tanks to attack government buildings. Some 250 people, in addition to at least 24 plotters, died and more than 2,000 were injured in the ensuing chaos as Erdogan rallied his supporters out on the streets. "This nation will never forgive treachery, traitors and those who stand behind traitors," Erdogan said during a ceremony in Ankara, paying tribute to the victims. The fateful night's impact has been felt in almost every aspect of Turkish life, including education, the judiciary and the leadership. The crackdown on alleged coup plotters, activists, human rights defenders and political opponents has helped Erdogan tighten the control he has amassed since rising to power in 2003. But it complicated his relations with traditional Western allies and put a dampener on foreign investment due to concerns about the rule of law. Less than a year after the coup attempt, Erdogan held a referendum to transform Turkey's parliamentary democracy into an executive presidency. He narrowly won and wields immense power, often announcing major decisions in overnight decrees. "Erdogan has used the coup attempt to consolidate his grip on power," veteran Turkey analyst Gareth Jenkins said. Yet this has a political drawback when things go wrong, analysts warn, as they did across the world during the coronavirus pandemic. "Having this much power also has its downsides: when things go wrong, like the current economic situation, it is harder to deflect the blame," a Western diplomat told AFP. Turkey suffers from persistently high inflation and the lira has lost two-thirds of its value against the US dollar since the week of the attempted putsch. Turkey claims US-based preacher Fethullah Gulen plotted the coup using members of his network in the military. Gulen denies the charges and insists his Islamic Hizmet movement promotes peace and education. Washington's refusal to extradite Gulen has been a constant irritant between the NATO allies. The post-coup crackdown has also decimated the Turkish military. Defence Minister Hulusi Akar on Tuesday said Turkey has dismissed 23,364 military personnel in the fight against Gulen's network. More than 321,000 people have been detained in all since 2016, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said. Most have been released, but the scale of the detentions has had a chilling effect. Nearly 4,000 judges and prosecutors have been sacked, among over 100,000 public sector workers fired or suspended over alleged Gulen links. The courts have handed life sentences to 3,000 people, according to state news agency Anadolu, while 4,890 defendants have been convicted over links to the coup bid. On Wednesday, Erdogan showed no sign of slowing down. "We will follow (his movement) until its last member is neutralised," he said. Some observers believe Erdogan is now using his ability to survive a coup as the foundation for his legacy. Turkey's current borders were born from the war of independence fought between 1919 and 1923, and led by the founder of the secular republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Erdogan leads an Islamic-rooted party and often refers to the "New Turkey" he is building as part of his own legacy. "The coup does give the foundation for this myth of a New Turkey," Jenkins told AFP. Demonstrating the historical importance Erdogan attaches to the coup bid, he made a series of speeches on Thursday and inaugurated a "democracy museum" looking at the main events of the night which "changed Turkey's fate". July 15 is also a public holiday in Turkey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/turkish-leader-warns-traitors-on-fifth-anniversary-of-failed-coup/articleshow/84455857.cms||---

Ramesh (name changed), a resident of Vijayanagar, told police that a woman, who identified herself as Sonia Singh, called him in November 2020, saying he had been awarded Rs 3.5 lakh under the senior citizen benefit scheme and he should get the money transferred to his account quickly, else it would go back to the government. He agreed to take the money. A few days later, another woman, Anamika Sharma, called Ramesh and took details of his bank account. However, the suspects did not call Ramesh until March this year. In March first week, the suspects contacted Ramesh, saying he will get the money in a week’s time. “First, they asked me to deposit Rs 20,999 towards service charges. I transferred the said amount to a bank in Mumbai on March 10. Then, two persons identified as Abhishek Sharma and Malhotra, called me on March 23 saying my money (Rs 3.5 lakh) had been approved and gave the approval number (AR0079432P). As no money was transferred, I tried to call them, but their phones were busy,” said Ramesh. Ramesh managed to get across to Anamika, who told him the money would be transferred soon. “On May 27, a person who identified himself as Sudeep Tyagi called me saying I was selected for another benefit scheme and this time, I would get Rs 6.2 lakh. Tyagi asked me to deposit Rs 73,000 towards service charges; I transferred the same amount to a bank account given by Tyagi himself. On July 1, a person identifying himself as Malhotra called me, asking me to deposit another Rs 50,000 as clearance charges. Suspecting foul play, I told Malhotra that I wasn’t in need of Rs 6.2 lakh and requested him to return the money I had transferred to them. He immediately disconnected the call,” Ramesh’s complaint copy read. Police said they collected details of the bank accounts and found them to be defunct.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/man-86-lured-with-fake-scheme-duped-of-94k/articleshow/84453427.cms||---

Once the app is ready, landlords will have to upload documents such as visa, passport and rental agreement collected from such tenants. Foreigners have to mandatorily provide these documents, while landlords too should compulsorily collect the same. Police plan to monitor these tenants through the software they are developing. “Foreign nationals staying in the city should intimate FRRO about their address and other details. Also, house owners should provide details of their foreigner tenants to police through the tenant-verification process. But these things are not happening as expected. So, we are developing a software that will help in updating the whereabouts of foreign nationals,” Bengaluru city police commissioner Kamal Pant said. According to sources, the mobile application will be available for landlords to easily upload or update information about their tenants. The application will have separate heads for foreign nationals, people from other states and those from within Karnataka. Landlords will have to upload valid ID proof of their tenants from Karnataka and other states in the application.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/city-police-to-develop-app-to-keep-track-of-foreigners-other-tenants/articleshow/84453506.cms||---

Kona Vamsi Krishna, superintendent of police, Bengaluru Rural, said: “Operating majorly at night, the accused targeted people walking or riding on deserted stretches. The gang used four two-wheelers to commit the crime. They disposed of the stolen phones to locals, mainly to dailywage workers and those working in industries.” The accused are P Sanjay, Isaac, Sandeep Kumar, H Rudrappa, N Manjunath, K Sateesh, Ajay Kumar, Pavan and Ramesh Kumar, of Anekal and nearby areas. According to an investigating officer, an ambulance driver at Anekal was recently found using a stolen mobile phone. The owner, who tracked his mobile, called the ambulance driver and learnt he had purchased it from a youth. The owner brought the matter to the notice of police. The driver told police a youth sold the phone to him outside Anekal government hospital, saying he was in need of urgent need of money for his mother’s treatment. Trusting him, the driver purchased it for Rs 3,000. “The driver made an online payment and this helped us in zeroing on Sateesh Kumar,” police said. 8 bike thieves arrestedPolice caught eight members of an interstate gang that stole high-end motorbikes, including Bullets. “We’ve recovered 25 bikes worth Rs 40 lakh from them. They were resold in different parts of Tamil Nadu after changing the number plates and producing fake documents,” Krishna said. In all, Anekal cops sol-ved 36 cases, arrested 56 suspects, recovered property worth 1.7 crore, including 50 two-wheelers, 100 phones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/gang-held-for-stealing-over-100-cellphones/articleshow/84453431.cms||---
---||World||Two missing from Grand Canyon rafting trip after flash flood||FLAGSTAFF: Authorities are searching for two people who were on a river rafting trip through the Grand Canyon and went missing after a flash flood, a park spokeswoman said Thursday.  Authorities got a call Wednesday evening from someone on a commercial trip on the Colorado River saying people had been injured and asking for emergency help, said park spokesman Joelle Baird. Park crews launched a search from the ground, water and air for at least two people who are missing, she said.  No other information on the identities of the missing people was immediately released.  The flood hit the people on the trip as they were camped at the mouth of a side canyon almost 40 miles (64 kilometers) from where the rafts launched at Lees Ferry near the Arizona-Utah state line. Baird did not immediately know the extent of injuries for other passengers that were traveling on two rafts.  The region that has been desperate for rain after two years of dismal monsoon activity has been hammered lately, with more rain in the forecast. Radar showed about an inch (2.5 centimeters) of rain along that stretch of the Colorado River, the National Weather Service said.  About an hour from the Grand Canyon, floodwaters swept through Flagstaff for the past two days, sending a car floating down a city street. Residents in the shadow of a mountain that burned in 2019 had been somewhat prepared for a major flood with sandbags around their homes and concrete barriers to redirect water. Still, many of them have been digging mud, logs and debris from their front yards.  The threat of flash flooding will remain through next week, the National Weather Service said, though the coverage will be more scattered than widespread.  "The moisture is not going anywhere, and it will heat up as well, so those are perfect ingredients for thunderstorms in the afternoon and evenings in Arizona," said meteorologist Evan LaGuardia in Flagstaff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/two-missing-from-grand-canyon-rafting-trip-after-flash-flood/articleshow/84456391.cms||---
---||World||The US reviewing whether it can help restore internet access in Cuba||WASHINGTON: The White House said on Thursday it is reviewing whether the United States would be able to help Cubans regain internet access in the wake of Cuban government actions following the biggest anti-government protests in decades. Cuba's government has restricted access to social media and messaging platforms including Facebook and WhatsApp amid the protests, according to global internet monitoring firm NetBlocks. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican and US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Robert Menendez, a Democrat, are among those who have called on President Joe Biden's administration to try to reconnect Cuba to internet services. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki called the lack of internet access "a huge issue in Cuba." "We are certainly looking at that to see what can be done," Psaki added, without providing specifics. At a news conference in Miami, DeSantis said the US government should take action to boost Cubans' access to the internet and consider using the American embassy in Havana as a staging ground. Ideas suggested by some US politicians include using satellite-based networks or high-altitude balloons to enable internet access in Cuba. "Time is of the essence here. Every day that the regime has to blackout the truth is a day they can get the upper hand on this," DeSantis said of the Cuban government. US Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, called on Biden "to immediately authorize and allocate additional funding to provide internet to Cuba using the existing capacity of innovative American firms." Menendez told MSNBC on Tuesday that "we should be looking at how we can expand access to the internet, considering satellite feed of internet so that people in the island can communicate with each other." Satellite-based services would require some physical infrastructure in Cuba, US officials said. "It isn't as easy of just moving a satellite and all of sudden it just goes straight to the devices," DeSantis said. Brendan Carr, a Republican member of the US Federal Communications Commission, said on Thursday in Miami that "this is not a technological problem. We have the technology today that can begin to be deployed to provide connectivity into the island." In Havana, there have been regular and atypical mobile internet outages since Sunday, according to Reuters witnesses. Psiphon, an internet censorship circumvention tool funded by the US Agency for Global Media, has helped Cubans access the internet. Daily unique users in Cuba have jumped to more than 146,000 since the demonstrations began, US Senator Marsha Blackburn said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/the-us-reviewing-whether-it-can-help-restore-internet-access-in-cuba/articleshow/84456345.cms||---

Sun Dawu, who led The Dawu Group, has clandestinely supported pro-democracy activists who have been persecuted by the authorities, Kyodo News reported. He has been accused of provoking trouble and disturbing public order, illegal mining, encroachment on state farmland, obstructing public service and illegal fundraising, among other charges. Sun, 66, founded the Dawu Group in 1989 and has since built it into a huge empire spanning agriculture, tourism and health care. The Dawu Group is a major firm that has around 9,000 employees and 28 affiliated enterprises. They are engaged in such businesses as poultry farming, food manufacturing and tourism. In November 2020, local security authorities suddenly started to charge about 30 people involving Sun and his family members. Along with them, executives of Sun's group were prosecuted in May on suspicion of several crimes. Sun is not the first businessman who is facing the heat for criticizing the administration. Alibaba chief Jack Ma also paid for pushing back against Beijing. China imposed a record fine of 18.2 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd after an anti-monopoly probe found that it had abused its dominant market position. The government led by President Xi Jinping has been strengthening surveillance on big private companies, which have been recently growing and could threaten the maintenance of the Communist Party's rule in the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/trial-begins-against-businessman-who-criticized-xi-governments-covid-19-response/articleshow/84456767.cms||---
---||World||Authorities: Wisconsin gas station shooter killed himself||CALEDONIA: A Wisconsin gunman who killed a 22-year-old man who was pumping gas later shot himself in the head after exchanging gunfire with an undercover sheriff's investigator, authorities said Thursday.  John McCarthy, 32, of Hartland, killed himself after confronting the undercover sheriff's investigator at another gas station not far away in Caledonia on Tuesday, the state Department of Justice said in revealing new details about the shooting.  The Racine County Sheriff's Department named McCarthy as the shooter earlier Wednesday.  Both McCarthy and the investigator were struck by gunfire before McCarthy fatally shot himself, the justice department said. The investigator, whose name hasn't been released, is recovering at a Racine hospital from wounds that aren't considered life-threatening.  McCarthy lay in wait for 22-year-old Anthon Griger, of Elkhorn, as he filled up his vehicle at the Pilot Travel Center at 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday, Racine County Sheriff Christopher Schmaling said. The sheriff said McCarthy "executed" Griger.  Officials have not identified a motive for the shooting.  Schmaling said McCarthy rummaged through Griger's pockets before shooting multiple times at another person who was driving through the parking lot. That person was not injured.  McCarthy then drove to a Mobil station about 2 miles (3 kilometers) away, according to authorities. There, with a gun drawn, McCarthy approached the undercover investigator who was pumping gas into his unmarked squad car, Schmaling said.  The two exchanged gunfire. The investigator suffered multiple gunshot wounds that fractured several bones around his pelvis, the sheriff's office said.  Family members posted on a GoFundMe page that Griger's death was all too sudden. Griger was a 2017 graduate of Franklin High School whom family and friends called "Nino."  "There are no words to express the anguish and shock that all of Nino's family and friends are experiencing right now. We pray that he is at peace and in the loving arms of those who have gone before him," a statement read.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/authorities-wisconsin-gas-station-shooter-killed-himself/articleshow/84457291.cms||---

---||India||Supreme Court: Why keep colonial sedition law used against Mahatma Gandhi, Tilak?||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Centre's views on whether the British-era sedition provision Section 124A in the Indian Penal Code, used to punish freedom fighters like Mahatma Gandhi and Bal Gangadhar Tilak to quell dissent and protest, should be retained even when there is continued evidence of its misuse by police without any accountability right till current times. Importantly, the Centre appeared to be on the same page with the SC when attorney general K K Venugopal said the court can lay down guidelines restricting the use of Section 124A in addition to the broad parameters provided by the court in a five-decade-old judgment in the Kedar Nath case as to what constituted "sedition". Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, "The court will find that most of its apprehensions are addressed when the Centre files its response to the PIL." A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices A S Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy said it was of the opinion that the sedition law should be used only for protection of the nation, its security and institutions of importance in a democracy. However, the sedition law, enacted by the British to subjugate the people of India, had been grossly misused since Independence for the last 75 years, much in a similar way to quell dissent. Times ViewThe CJI’s observations are pertinent. A law, once used by the colonial state against the likes of Tilak and Gandhi, really has no place in today’s India. It must be thrown out. Merely issuing fresh guidelines or making minor changes in the law won’t be enough because it has become a vicious tool in the hands of those in power to muzzle and punish any form of dissentThe bench said, "A saw in the hands of a carpenter is a tool to help him make beautiful furniture. If the carpenter turns his saw on the trees, then the forest gets decimated. This section (124A) gives enormous powers for misuse. It is like giving a saw to the carpenter to cut a piece of wood for making furniture. If he uses it to cut the entire forest, imagine the devastating impact." Justice Ramana recalled the SC's March 2015 judgment in the Shreya Singhal case quashing the much-abused Section 66A of the Information Technology Act to arrest people who voiced their criticism against governments on social media platforms. When the bench issued notice to the Centre on a PIL filed by Maj Gen S G Vombatkere (Retd), the solicitor general echoed what the AG had said and reinforced the indication that the government too was thinking on the same lines as the SC to substantially limit the invocation of Section 124A, except in serious cases where the integrity of the nation, its security or its democratic institutions are threatened. Turning to the AG, the CJI said, "Remember how many thousands of people were charged under this law (sedition)? And there is no accountability fastened on police for falsely implicating persons under the sedition provision of IPC. In rural areas, it is even worse. If a person defies a policeman, he would have him booked under Section 124A. There are so many issues that arise and we have to look into all of these issues." Referring to politicians in power using the sedition provision against rivals, the three-judge bench said, "The situation on the ground is worrying. When some particular party, which formed the government in the states, does not want to hear dissent, they resort to Section 124A to implicate the opposition groups and silence them. The law should be used only to protect the nation, its security and institutions of importance in a democracy," the CJI-led bench said. Taking a cue from the CJI's last observation, Venugopal conceded misuse of Section 124A is a serious issue. He said a five-judge bench of the SC in 1962 in Kedar Nath judgment had laid down broad parameters of instances which would amount to sedition. Indicating that the government was open to the court further restricting invocation of Section 124A, Venugopal said, "The SC can lay down further guidelines to restrict its use." The AG also pointed out that two petitions are already pending before the SC questioning the constitutional validity of Section 124A. The CJI said he would take a decision administratively whether all the petitions are to be joined together for a combined hearing on the important issue. Given the fact that the constitutional validity of Section 124A was upheld by a five-judge SC bench in the Kedar Nath case, the CJI may have to constitute a Constitution bench of at least five judges to hear the petitions, including the PIL filed by Vombatkere. Vombatkere's counsel P B Suresh said a statute criminalising expression based on unconstitutionally vague definitions of "disaffection towards government’’ etc is an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right to free expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) and causes constitutionally impermissible "chilling effect" on speech. The petitioner said the Constitution bench of the SC's 1962 judgment upholding the validity of the sedition provision was rendered in an era when the apex court was conservative in interpreting the ambit of fundamental rights. He said fundamental rights, especially the right to free speech and right to life, are given a wide meaning in many subsequent landmark judgments. Vombatkere said the right to free speech and expression got wings with the advent of social media allowing citizens to freely express their opinion for and against the government. The SC never had an opportunity, in the era of transparency and openness, to examine the constitutional validity of Section 124A, which now is often used to silence dissent, he said. "The SC in Kedar Nath upheld the validity of the Impugned Provision and ruled that the very existence of the State will be in jeopardy if the Government established by law is subverted. The Impugned Provision however was read down to mean that only those expressions that either intend to or have the tendency of causing violence are punishable. Despite the reading down, the continued employment of the charge of sedition to silence dissent continued undeterred and has been taken judicial notice of. This prompted the SC to reiterate the Kedar Nath law in 2016 in Common Cause case, directing all authorities to scrupulously follow the Kedar Nath dictum," the petitioner said. While upholding the constitutional validity of Section 124A in 1962, the SC caveated it by saying, "the explanations appended to the main body of the section make it clear that criticism of public measures or comment on Government action, however strongly worded, would be within reasonable limits and would be consistent with the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression." "It is only when the words, written or spoken, etc which have the pernicious tendency or intention of creating public disorder or disturbance of law and order that the law steps in to prevent such activities in the interest of public order. When so construed, the section, in our opinion, strikes the correct balance between individual fundamental rights and the interest of public order," the SC had said.

---||World||Biden, Merkel work to renew US-German ties after tensions under Trump||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden welcomed outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel to the White House on Thursday to discuss disagreements over Russia and China as the two leaders seek to strengthen a relationship that suffered under former President Donald Trump. The United States and Germany are key NATO allies. Biden and Merkel have known and worked with each other for years. But their two governments are at odds over a host of tough issues, including the Nord Stream 2 pipeline being built from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea, which Washington fears will hurt Ukraine and increase European reliance on Russian gas. They also disagree over the wisdom of partnering with China on business projects, restrictions on travel to the United States from Europe and Germany's opposition to temporary patent waivers aimed at speeding Covid-19 vaccine production. Biden, 78, and Merkel, 66, see eye to eye on a string of broader issues, and both want to strengthen the transatlantic relationship that suffered under Trump's frequent, withering criticism of close US allies. "The cooperation between the United States and Germany is strong and we hope to continue that, and I'm confident that we will," Biden said at the start of their meeting in the Oval Office. "I value the friendship," Merkel said, noting the US role in building a free and democratic Germany. They will likely discuss threats to democracy around the world, countering Russian cyberattacks and territorial aggression in Eastern Europe and China's push to dominate advanced technologies, officials in both governments said. Ending the pandemic and curbing climate change are also on the agenda. The two leaders do not have much time to work together on strengthening ties between the world's largest and fourth-largest economies. Merkel, chancellor since 2005, plans to exit Germany's government after national elections in September, meaning she is likely to be seen as a "lame duck" in her final months in power. Polling shows her Christian Democrats are poised to take the lead in forming a government after the election, but it remains unclear which parties would be included in a coalition. Biden's Democratic Party has tenuous majorities in the US Congress that could evaporate in the 2022 congressional elections. John Emerson, who served as ambassador to Germany under former President Barack Obama, said the relationship remains "indispensable" for Washington given Germany's role as the largest economy in Europe and a NATO ally, as well as its importance as a bridge-builder in dealing with Russia, the Middle East and North Africa. Germany hosts some 36,000 US troops on its soil. MAKING AMENDS Merkel started her official day in Washington at a breakfast with Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris' spokesperson Symone Sanders said the two leaders discussed geopolitical threats and challenges. They promised to continue working together on the pandemic, global health and the environment, Sanders said. “We can indeed cooperate very well in order to boost our shared values," Merkel said. Later Merkel will attend a one-on-one meeting with Biden, a news conference with the president and a dinner hosted by the Bidens at the White House. She is also receiving an honorary degree from the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. Merkel's White House visit - the first by a European leader since Biden took office in January - shows the United States is trying to make amends with an ally that was often attacked during the Trump years. "Inviting her to come is important symbolically, but it's also an opportunity to get the relationship back on the right track, and that is clearly happening,” Emerson said. Germany's transatlantic coordinator, Peter Beyer, said Germans were aware that there was only a limited time available to move forward, given the risk that Biden could be weakened after the 2022 congressional elections. Merkel may advise Biden on what to expect in the next German government, said Jackson Janes, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. "I think it will be a sense of saying: 'Thanks for the memories,' and maybe a little bit more about what (Biden) should be thinking about as he deals with the next administration in Berlin," he said of Merkel's likely message on her trip.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-merkel-work-to-renew-us-german-ties-after-tensions-under-trump/articleshow/84457843.cms||---

The leaders set the goal in a joint declaration after a summit meeting in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, the World Bank said in a statement. World Bank member countries normally replenish IDA every three years, setting its previous financing package at $82 billion to cover the 2021-2023 fiscal years. But in April, the bank launched an early replenishment cycle after massive assistance paid out to help countries deal with the Covid-19 pandemic drew down IDA resources. The World Bank aims to complete the 20th replenishment of IDA in December, covering the 2023-2025 fiscal years. The declaration from the African leaders marks the first ever request for a $100 billion replenishment goal. The leaders who met in Abidjan are from Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Uganda, Rwanda, Senegal, Sudan, Tanzania and Togo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/african-countries-call-for-100-billion-for-world-bank-development-fund/articleshow/84458050.cms||---
---||India||Covid-19: Government orders 66 crore vaccine doses worth Rs 14,505 crore||NEW DELHI: The government is placing its largest order yet of Covid vaccines at 66 crore doses worth Rs 14,505 crore to procure Covishield and Covaxin shots that will help it to substantially meet the vaccine availability projections it had made in the Supreme Court. The order is in line with the Centre’s estimate of 135 crore doses being available between August-December as stated in its affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court on June 26. Apart from the order for 66 crore doses, the government has made an advance payment to reserve 30 crore doses of Hyderabad based Biological-E’s Corbevax vaccine, official sources said. Coronavirus live updatesThis means a total of 96 crore doses are expected to be available on account of government procurement during August-December. While the 96 crore doses comprises Centre’s share of 75% of the total manufactured doses, the private sector will also have another 22 crore doses of Covishield and Covaxin available during the period. The order and other anticipated supplies, said officials, will help India remain on track to ensure vaccination for the 18+plus population by the year-end.   The total production of Covishield and Covaxin in August-December is placed at 88 crore doses. Despite a shortfall of around 3.5 crore doses in July, Covaxin production is put at 38 crore in this period, slightly less than the 40 crore mentioned in the SC affidavit. The glitches in its production are understood to have been sorted out. Apart from Covishield, Covaxin and Corbevax, the government’s estimate of 135 crore doses also included Sputnik V and Zydus Cadila’s vaccine. While Sputnik V locally manufactured supplies are yet to start, Cadila’s approval is pending. Ten crore Sputnik and five crore Cadila are estimated to be available this year, according to the Centre's affidavit. Read AlsoDelta+ unlikely to be more transmissible, says studyThe detection of 21 cases of the AY.1 sub-lineage, called ‘Delta-Plus’, in June had stoked fears of increased transmission or even an early onset of the third wave in Maharashtra. A month since the detections though, districts where the Delta-Plus cases were found have not seen any unusual surge in“Government has already made an advance payment 96 doses and another 22 crore doses will be available for the private sector, thus securing a large bulk of the expected supply well in advance,” said an official source. The order assumes significance as it assures a supply of jabs to ensure ramping up of vaccination drive amid fear of a third wave. The government aims to inoculate the entire adult population above 18 years age by December. A total of 39.49 crore doses have been administered across the country till Thursday 7pm. The Centre has indicated availability of 13.5 crore doses during July, which would translate into an average 50 lakh doses per day. While daily vaccinations have been modest in July so far with a little over 5 crore doses given so far in the month, the states have been asked to ramp up sessions along with that in the private sector where pick up has been slow so far. While some states have raised concerns about irregular supplies of jabs, the health ministry has emphasised on advance planning and logistics management to ensure that neither people are turned away nor doses are wasted. The health ministry indicates availability of doses to states 15 days in advance to enable planning of vaccination centres and sessions accordingly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-orders-66-crore-vaccine-doses-worth-rs-14505-crore/articleshow/84458737.cms||Sushmi Dey

The State Law Enforcement Division was in court Wednesday with The Post and Courier. The Charleston newspaper sued the agency, saying it had violated the state public records act by first refusing to release police reports on the killings, then heavily blacking out information in the reports that were released.  The agency is investigating the June 7 deaths of Maggie Murdaugh, 52, and her son Paul Murdaugh, 22.  Alex Murdaugh found his wife and son shot several times outside a home on the family's Colleton County land after checking on his seriously ill father, authorities said.  State agents have released little information on their investigation and a lawyer seemed to suggest the probe isn't focused on any particular person or theory on what could have happened. If the wrong information is released, it might affect the memories of witnesses or prevent agents from catching people they question in lies.  "At this stage of any investigation such as this, it is exceedingly difficult to know precisely what evidence, witnesses, and information are of ultimate importance, and what evidence, witnesses, or information proves to be of little value," the State Law Enforcement Division and the Colleton County Sheriff's Office wrote in court papers.  Colleton County deputies turned the investigation over to state police almost immediately.  The Post and Courier's lawyer argued the state agency was heavy-handed with how it blacked out information in the reports. He said the South Carolina Freedom of Information Act requires the agency to say exactly how any information not released would affect the investigation instead of allowing officials to just say it might cause a problem.  State police released 18 pages of reports last month. All but one page had redactions and some pages were entirely blacked out.  The information that wasn't redacted included details about a deputy asking to get a tent to put over evidence while crime scene technicians worked, another deputy who outlined where he put crime scene tape and other officers asking nearby homes and businesses if they have surveillance cameras pointing toward the road.  "They're not thinking about the Freedom of Information Act," newspaper attorney Edward Fenno said. "They're just redacting as they see fit."  At the end of the hearing, Circuit Judge Bentley Price said he would review the redactions and if he felt they weren't legal, order more information released.  The Murdaugh family is offering a $100,000 reward to anyone who provides information that leads to the killer's conviction and the State Law Enforcement Division continues to promote a 24-hour-a-day tip line for the case at (803) 896-2605.  Alex Murdaugh's father, grandfather and great-grandfather were all longtime elected prosecutors and, along with other family members, have had successful private law practices in nearby Hampton County and the surrounding area.  At the time of his death, Paul Murdaugh was awaiting trial on a charge of boating under the influence causing death in a February 2019 crash that killed 19-year-old Mallory Beach. Whether local law enforcement agencies tried to obstruct the investigation into the boating death is also being reviewed by state officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/police-defend-withholding-details-in-south-carolina-killings/articleshow/84458793.cms||---

The US and Australia kicked off their biennial Exercise Talisman Sabre on Wednesday, Nikkei Asia reported. Defense forces from Japan, the UK, Canada, South Korea and New Zealand will also take part in the drills, while India, Indonesia, Germany and France will participate as observers. "The exercise will further strengthen our co-operation toward a free and open Indo-Pacific," Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told reporters on Thursday. The US, Japan, India and Australia have been promoting a rules-based order in the region through their Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad. Japan is sending a Ground Self-Defense Force unit specializing in remote island defense and tasked with the initial response to a contingency in the Nansei Islands, which include the Japan-administered Senkakus that are claimed by China as the Dioayu. The GSDF will participate in a landing drill with US and British marines and the Royal Australian Army. "Amphibious manoeuvres are critical to defending the Nansei Islands, which is one of Japan's top defence priorities," GSDF Chief of Staff General Yoshihide Yoshida said. "Bolstering our tactical skills will strengthen our defence capabilities." The drills come at a time when the international focus is growing in Indo Pacific. Tensions are also escalating in Taiwan Strait. Japan's Defence Ministry called the Taiwan situation one of its top challenges, saying it must "pay close attention" to the Taiwan Strait "with a sense of crisis more than ever before," in a white paper this week. Meanwhile, a Chinese surveillance ship began sailing toward Australian waters ahead of the exercise, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. "We have been monitoring its approach to Australia for several days as part of Australia's broader surveillance effort," Australian Defence Minister Peter Dutton said of the ship. Indo-Pacific region is largely viewed as an area comprising the Indian Ocean and the western and central Pacific Ocean, including the South China Sea. China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and its efforts to advance into the Indian Ocean are seen to have challenged the established rules-based system. The Taiwan Strait is a 180-kilometre-wide strait separating the island of Taiwan and continental Asia. It is one of the most heavily policed strips of water in the world. The strait is in international waters, however, China claims Taiwan as its own territory and regards the US Navy's presence in the area as a show of support for the island's democratic government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/11-nations-participate-in-massive-us-australia-military-drills-as-tensions-escalate-in-indo-pacific/articleshow/84459021.cms||---

The Brazilian Yearbook of Public Security showed homicides in Brazil rose 4% in 2020, with 50,033 people killed, giving Latin America's biggest country a murder rate of 23.6 per 100,000 people. Meanwhile, the country's police killed 6,416 people, up 0.3% compared with the previous year, the report showed. Violence in Brazil, the country with the world's highest number of murders, fell during the first years of Bolsonaro's administration. He was elected in 2018 with a promise to snuff out violent gangs and end years of corruption among the country's political and business elite. But Thursday's report shows that some of those gains have been erased, as a sharp rise in gun ownership, a measure pushed by Bolsonaro, has coincided with a rise in killings. Nearly 200,000 new guns were registered in Brazil in 2020 after a loosening of restrictions, nearly double the number in the previous year, the data showed. There are now nearly 1.3 million guns registered with Brazil's federal police, the report said, over double the number in 2017. The report, published by the Brazilian Public Security Forum, found that 76.2% of people murdered in Brazil were Black, with the vast majority young men. The numbers for those killed by police were similar, with 78.9% Black and most of them also young men. During the same period, under 200 police officers were killed in the line of duty, it said, less than half the number that died from Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/murders-killings-by-police-rose-in-brazil-last-year-the-report-shows/articleshow/84458489.cms||---
---||India||Delta+ unlikely to be more transmissible, says study||MUMBAI: The AY.1 and AY.2 sub-lineages of the Delta variant are unlikely to be more transmissible than their highly communicable parent, the Indian SARS-Cov2 Genomics Consortium (Insacog) said in its latest bulletin. The detection of 21 cases of the AY.1 sub-lineage, called ‘Delta-Plus’, in June had stoked fears of increased transmission or even an early onset of the third wave in Maharashtra. A month since the detections though, districts where the Delta-Plus cases were found have not seen any unusual surge in cases or deaths in those pockets. In fact, of all the samples sequenced from the state in June, up to 88% were found positive for the Delta variant and not many for Delta- Plus. The Delta-Plus and AY.2 sub-lineages continue to account for less than 1% of genomic sequences carried out from June, said Insacog. Delta (B 1617.2), which was first isolated in Vidarbha and has driven the second wave, continues to be the dominant lineage in the country and one that is also rapidly rising globally. The Insacog update said the Delta sub-lineages AY.1 and AY.2 were declining globally with near zero cases in the last week of June in both the UK and US. “There are no indications of rising trend in the four clusters (in Ratnagiri and Jalgaon in Maharashtra, Bhopal in MP and Chennai in TN),” the update added. Districts corroborated that they have not been flooded with cases or cluster infections as they had feared. Of the 21 cases of Delta-Plus in Maharashtra, Ratnagiri reported the highest (9), followed by Jalgaon (7), Mumbai (2), and one each in Palghar, Sindhudurg and Thane. An 80-year-old woman who was infected with the Delta-Plus strain, succumbed. Of the 1,400-odd June Covid samples processed in the state, as many as 88% (1,195) were positive for the Delta variant. In Ratnagiri, where all Delta Plus cases were found inSangameshwar, officials said they have not been alerted of any new cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delta-unlikely-to-be-more-transmissible-says-study/articleshow/84458992.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||World||Israel proposes new restrictions to combat virus surge||JERUSALEM: Israel is planning tougher health restrictions to combat rising cases of Covid-19 as the Delta variant spreads, the prime minister's office said in a statement on Thursday. If the new plans are approved by the parliament, only those vaccinated or who have recovered from coronavirus will be allowed to take part in indoor events of more than 100 people. They will also have to wear masks, except for eating and drinking. The proposal is a joint plan drawn up by the prime minister's office as well as the health and economy ministries. The health ministry has said it would cut quarantine time for those in contact with infected people and for returning non-vaccinated residents from 10 days to seven, following a negative test. Israel became a pioneer in Covid-19 inoculations after it obtained millions of doses from Pfizer in exchange for sharing extensive health data on their impact. Its initial vaccine rollout of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab was among the world's fastest, delivering two doses of the vaccine to more than 55 percent of the population, including about 85 percent of adults. Case numbers dropped dramatically, and in early June Israel eased many restrictions. But soon after, as cases rose, the health ministry re-imposed a requirement for masks to be worn in enclosed public places. In the past 24 hours, more than 600 cases have been reported, up from around 200 per day on average a week ago. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett on Wednesday called on Israelis to wear masks in closed public places and to avoid travel. "The vaccine is not sufficient to fight against the Delta variant we need the co-operation of citizens to defeat the coronavirus without having to impose a new lockdown," he said, calling on children aged 12 to 16 to get vaccinated as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/israel-proposes-new-restrictions-to-combat-virus-surge/articleshow/84459111.cms||---

The grizzly, along with her three cubs, were released to help biologists learn more about the endangered animals, the state Department of Fish and Wildlife said. US Fish and Wildlife Service biologists captured the bear about 10 miles (16 kilometres) from the Washington-Idaho state line on US Forest Service land. The three cubs ran into the surrounding woods while biologists did a general health check on the mother and fitted her collar, then returned to her when the people went away, the state agency said. ``Grizzly bears once occupied much of the Cascade and Selkirk Ranges, but their numbers were severely reduced as a result of persecution by early settlers and habitat degradation,`` said Rich Beausoleil, a biologist with the state. ``Grizzly bear recovery started in 1981 and it took 40 years to confirm the first known female in Washington.'' Biologists became aware of the bear through images captured on cameras inside the Selkirk Grizzly Bear Recovery Zone in a remote area of the Selkirk Mountains. That is one of six recovery zones in the US identified by the federal recovery plan for grizzlies. Grizzlies in that area roam between northern Idaho, northeastern Washington, and southeastern British Columbia. The population there is considered healthy, and is growing about 3% a year, officials said. Biologists believe the recently collared female lives in the area and is not a bear from outside of Washington state. ``A group of bears - a mother and three cubs - were photographed on another occasion on a game camera in the same area three to four weeks before the capture,'' said Wayne Kasworm, a grizzly bear biologist with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. ``The natal collar - the white ring around the neck - of one of the cubs leads us to believe this is the same family of bears.'' Four adult males were captured in 1985, 2016 and 2018, but this was the first instance of a female capture, the state agency said. ``Currently, there are believed to be at least 70 to 80 grizzly bears in the Selkirk Grizzly Bear Recovery Zone,'' Kasworm said. ``About half those bears live on the Canadian side of the border, with the other half on the US side.'' Grizzly bears are listed as a threatened species under the federal Endangered Species Act and classified as an endangered species in Washington state. The state agency works collaboratively with federal wildlife officials to monitor grizzly bear survival, reproduction, home range use, food habits, genetics, and causes of death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/1st-female-grizzly-in-40-years-collared-in-washington-state/articleshow/84458840.cms||---

While India has repeatedly said that LAC disengagement, and de-escalation, is essential for improvement in ties, Beijing insists that the border dispute should not be allowed to come in the way of overall development of bilateral relations. With China apparently continuing to drag its feet on disengagement in remaining areas in eastern Ladakh, Jaishankar had conveyed to Wang that the border strife is “impacting” ties in a negative manner. China has consistently blamed India for the border tensions though it agreed to move back from the positions it had taken in the finger area of Pangong Lake. In its readout of the meeting, the Chinese foreign ministry said Wang had told Jaishankar that India-China relations remained at a “low point” while the situation at the border had “generally been easing” after the withdrawal of troops from the Galwan Valley and Pangong Lake. However, relations between India and China are still at a low point which is not in anyone’s interest, Wang said. While again blaming India for the stand-off, Wang said “China is ready to seek a mutually acceptable solution to the issues that require urgent treatment through negotiation and consultation with the Indian side”. However, China reflected key parts of the Indian statement, with Wang quoted as saying, “It is important to consolidate the achievements of the disengagement, strictly abide by the agreement and consensus between the two sides, refrain from taking any unilateral actions in the sensitive disputed areas, and avoid recurrence of the situation due to misunderstanding and misjudgment”. “We need to take a long-term view, shift from emergency management to normal border management and control mechanisms, and prevent border-related incidents from causing unnecessary disruptions to bilateral relations,” he added. Wang was also quoted as saying that China-India relationship should not be a threat to each other, but an opportunity for each other’s development. “The two countries are partners, not rivals, and not enemies. The principles of China-India relations should continue to be mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in ...internal affairs..,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/border-row-must-not-be-allowed-to-affect-india-ties-says-china/articleshow/84459425.cms||---

---||India||Use Rs 23,123 crore emergency fund to plug infrastructure gaps, states told||NEW DELHI: In a move to ensure optimum utilisation of the Rs 23,123 crore emergency response fund recently approved by the Centre to deal with Covid-19, the health ministry has asked states to conduct a quick gap analysis for various infrastructure components, while maintaining focus on ramping up test, track, treat and isolate strategy. In a review meeting with states and UTs to implement the scheme, the health ministry underlined the need for governments to scale-up bed strength including for paediatric care and makeshift hospitals in sub-district levels. States and UTs have also been asked to send their expenditure proposals at the earliest to enable expeditious approval and sanctioning of funds from the Centre. The move also assumes significance in the wake of a looming fear of third wave, mainly in rural and remote areas that are more vulnerable to the infection. The ‘India Covid-19 Emergency Response & Health System Preparedness Package: Phase-II’ aims to accelerate health system preparedness for immediate responsiveness for early prevention, detection and management with sharp focus on health infrastructure development. The scheme has two components – the central sector and centrally sponsored schemes. The central sector component will include support for infrastructure expansion at Centre-run hospitals, strengthen the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Epidemic Intelligence Services (EIS) and INSACOG. Under the CSS component, the effort will be aimed at strengthening district and sub district capacity for an effective and rapid response to the pandemic. Of the total fund outlay, Rs 15,000 crore would be contributed by the Centre and Rs 8,123 crore by the states. In the meeting stakeholders were also asked to ensure availability of critical drugs, testing kits and PPEs besides enhancing oxygen availability.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/use-rs-23123-crore-emergency-fund-to-plug-infrastructure-gaps-states-told/articleshow/84459611.cms||---
---||World||Dutch crime reporter dies after being shot outside TV studio||AMSTERDAM: A Dutch crime reporter who was shot in the head in a brazen attack in central Amsterdam last week as he was leaving a television studio died of his wounds on Thursday, his family said in a statement. The reporter, Peter R de Vries, was 64. “Peter has fought until the end, but has been unable to win this battle,” the statement, carried by the Dutch broadcast news service RTL News, said. “We are indescribably proud of him and at the same time inconsolable.” De Vries, a well-known public figure in the Netherlands, was shot on the evening of July 6, an attack that drew widespread condemnation in a country where drug-related crime and shootings have steadily increased over the past decade. European leaders have condemned the shooting, which also raised questions about safety for journalists. The police arrested two men last week in connection with the attack after stopping them in a car on a nearby highway. The police identified the suspects as a 35-year-old Polish citizen and a 21-year-old from Rotterdam. The police have said they believe the younger man was the gunman. Both suspects appeared in court in Amsterdam on Friday and remain in custody. Ferd Grapperhaus, the Dutch justice minister, called de Vries a “brave man” and said his death was “nothing less than a direct attack on our society.” De Vries, who had hosted a televised crime show for nearly two decades and has long been known in the Netherlands for solving cold cases, had said he regularly received death threats. The television show on which de Vries appeared before he was shot last week did not air July 9, after threats from criminals who said they wanted to target the studio using automatic weapons or a rocket launcher, according to Dutch news media. The show has resumed its daily episodes, but will be recorded elsewhere, the network reported. De Vries began his journalism career in 1978 at De Telegraaf, a popular Dutch newspaper. A decade later, he published a book on the kidnapping of beer magnate Freddy Heineken. He covered many high-profile cases, including the 2005 disappearance of an Alabama teenager, Natalee Holloway, in Aruba, a Caribbean island that is part of the Netherlands; and a decade long investigation into the rape and murder of an 11-year-old boy, Nicky Verstappen. His television show, “Peter R de Vries, Crime Reporter,” which began in 1995 and aired for 17 years, was his real breakthrough. Most recently, de Vries had set up a foundation in the hopes of solving the 1993 disappearance of Tanja Groen, a young woman who vanished on her way home from a party. On Tuesday, Dutch public television aired a special program where viewers donated hundreds of thousands of euros to the cause. De Vries, who was also the director of a law office, had been an adviser over the past year to a key witness in a trial over killings said to have been ordered by a criminal organization. The main defendant in the case, Ridouan Taghi, who is accused of leading the organization, was arrested in Dubai in 2019. Derk Wiersum, a lawyer for the same key witness in that trial, was killed in Amsterdam in 2019. The witness’s brother was shot dead in 2018. Amsterdam and other Dutch cities have been the scene of several shootings over the past decade in which criminals have targeted either each other or those interfering in their crimes. The nearby port of Rotterdam is one of the key gateways for importing cocaine into Europe, and the country is a leader in the illegal production of amphetamines and crystal meth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/dutch-crime-reporter-dies-after-being-shot-outside-tv-studio/articleshow/84459602.cms||---
---||World||Biden sees US child tax credit as 'giant step' to counter poverty||WASHINGTON: Some 35 million American families have received their first monthly payout from the US government in an expanded income-support program that President Joe Biden said on Thursday could help end child poverty. Under the Child Tax Credit program that was broadened under Biden's Covid-19 stimulus, eligible families collect an initial monthly payment of up to $300 for each child under six years old and up to $250 for each older child. Payouts to families, covering nearly 60 million eligible children, totalled about $15 billion for July. The payments are automatic for many US taxpayers. Others need to sign up. Biden wants to extend expanded, monthly benefits for years to come as part of a $3.5 trillion spending plan being considered by Senate Democrats, who expect strong Republican opposition to the full bill. "It's our effort to make another giant step toward ending child poverty in America," Biden said in a speech at the White House attended by nine families who will benefit from the relief payments. "This can be life-changing for so many families." The Child Tax Credit has been likened to a universal basic income for children, within income limits, helping families meet expenses from rent to food and daycare. The Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University estimates the expansion can reduce the US child poverty rate by up to 45%. Dominique Spencer, who works at Jubilee Jumpstart, a local early childhood education centre in Washington, said the tax credits would help her pay down debts, cover the cost of books for graduate school and buy needed items for her two children. Ultimately, she said the additional funds could help her family buy a home, a dream that has grown out of reach for more working Americans. “They’ve taken a close look at what people need, and are trying to do their best to help the large number of people who got missed over the last couple of years,” she said. “They’re giving back to working people who hold this country up.” Critics say the expanded credit is expensive and may discourage people from working. Some experts say it may not reach some of the poorest Americans who are not in the tax system, although the Treasury is encouraging non-payers to sign up. The Democrat-backed $1.9 trillion Covid-19 legislation known as the American Rescue Plan enacted in March increased how much is paid to families under the program. The law made half of the tax credit for the 2021 tax year payable in advance by the Internal Revenue Service in monthly instalments from July through December this year. Biden proposed making the monthly advance payments permanent and maintaining expanded benefits through 2025 at least.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-sees-us-child-tax-credit-as-giant-step-to-counter-poverty/articleshow/84459660.cms||---

The company — which has been steadfast in its refusal to share the first source of illegal messages that have often been blamed by the government for incidents such as lynching and other crimes due to fake, viral messaging — said its sweeping action was based on information gathered through technological tools and user feedback. The action in India is significant as it is nearly one-fourth of the global bans that WhatsApp carries out in a month related to harmful behaviour. The disclosure comes as part of the mandate under the new IT Rules, although the company has challenged the traceability provision in the Delhi high court. Earlier this month, WhatsApp’s parent Facebook had reported pulling down as many as 3.2 crore user posts in the same period, and these ranged from spam to adult nudity, bullying and harassment, and content around violent and graphic content. Both the reports, however, gave no data on censures over government orders, or requests by political parties. WhatsApp said it deploys tools and resources to "prevent harmful behaviour" on the platform. "We are particularly focused on prevention because we believe it is much better to stop harmful activity from happening in the first place than to detect it after harm has occurred. The abuse detection operates at three stages of an account’s lifestyle: at registration; during messaging; and in response to negative feedback, which we receive in the form of user reports and blocks.” The company said a “team of analysts augments these systems” to evaluate edge cases and help improve effectiveness over time. It, however, insisted that person-to-person conversations on the platform are encrypted, and thus remain private. WhatsApp said it pays “close attention to user feedback” while also engaging with specialists in stemming misinformation, promoting cybersecurity, and preserving election integrity. "We are an industry leader among end-to-end encrypted messaging services in preventing and combating abuse. In addition to our safety features and controls, we employ a team of engineers, data scientists, analysts, researchers, and experts in law enforcement, online safety, and technology developments to oversee these efforts. We enable users to block contacts and to report problematic content and contacts to us from inside the app." Apart from the bans, WhatsApp said its India grievance officer received 345 user complaints, including on issues such as account and product support, safety and ban appeal. It overturned 63 ban appeals here. Giving its report on user complaints, Facebook said it received 646 complaints in the same period, which included 198 related to ‘hacking of account’, 174 on ‘other issues’, 73 on ‘fake profile’, and 36 related to ‘nudity/partial nudity or in a sexual act’ heading. “Of these… we provided tools for users to resolve their issues in 363 cases… Of the other 297 reports where specialized review was needed, we reviewed content as per our policies. Of those, we took action on 47 pieces of content in total. The remaining 250 reports were reviewed but may not have been actioned due to the reasons explained above,” Facebook said. Similarly, Instagram said its grievance officer received 36 complaints in the period, including related to hacking of accounts (7), and ‘nudity/partial nudity or in a sexual act’ (25). “Of these incoming reports, we provided tools for users to resolve their issues in 10 cases.” Of the other, we took action on 20 pieces of content.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/whatsapp-bans-20-lakh-indian-users/articleshow/84459710.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||India||Top court takes note of delay in release from jail after bail||NEW DELHI: In view of recent cases of delay in releasing accused from jail after grant of bail by courts, the Supreme Court has taken suo motu cognizance of the issue and a bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana will hear the case on Friday. The bench, also comprising Justices L Nageawara Rao and A S Bopanna, will examine what could be done to ensure that the accused are released without delay after grant of bail as it amounts to violation of their rights and also the court orders which normally direct that the accused be released forthwith after fulfilling the conditions. The court may also examine whether some kind of guidelines be also framed. In a case of delay in releasing the accused, the Delhi high court, after granting bail, had to intervene again before Jamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha and JNU’s Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal were released from Tihar jail. They were released 48 hours after the bail order. Despite getting bail from the HC, the trio, who had been arrested in May last year under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in the Delhi riots conspiracy case, had to remain behind bars with Delhi Police raising a red flag on verification of address of the accused and Aadhaar cards of the persons who stood surety for them. In another case, the SC granted interim bail to 13 prisoners lodged in Agra Central Jail on July 8 but they were released after 4 days. The court granted bail to the prisoners who spent around 20 years in prison and were not released despite them being recently declared as juvenile at the time of committing offence. The convicts had not taken the defence of juvenility due to ignorance during the trial and it came to light when their age was examined on the direction of the Allahabad HC. The HC had passed the direction in 2012 and ordered the Juvenile Justice Board to hold an inquiry for determination of the age of such prisoners who were found to be juvenile at the time of committing offence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/top-court-takes-note-of-delay-in-release-from-jail-after-bail/articleshow/84459803.cms||---

In its report tabled before the Calcutta high court, the panel formed by the NHRC chairman on directions of the court, also suggested trial of cases related to the violence be held outside the state. The NHRC committee noted that a very large number of complaints had been recieved, close to 2,000, from 23 districts. Around 35% of the complaints related to murder or homicide and 4% to rape. The percentage of those arrested or in those still in custody is "abysmally low". Less than 3% of the accused are in jail. There were several instance of physical intimidation of women, who were on occasion stripped and humiliated. "Analysis of statements recorded of the victims/complainants, supporting documents, data and other related information collected from the spot enquiries, including camp sittings, registered cases, etc., revealed that a large number of criminals, who enjoy state patronage and support, were responsible for abetting, planning, organising and even committing offences in a systematic and widespread manner," the report states. While the report drew West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s ire over the NHRC allegedly pursuing “vendetta politics” of BJP and “leaking” findings to the media, NHRC countered the allegations as “absolutely baseless and factually incorrect”. The commission said the committee submitted its report to the HC on July 13. “On the further directions of the Hon'ble Court, the Committee provided a copy of the said report to its Advocate in Calcutta, who shared with the Advocates of all the concerned parties in the related multiple writ petitions." In its report, the committee referred to “spatio-temporal expanse of violent incidents in the state of West Bengal reflects the appalling apathy of the state government towards plight of victims.” It noted that “The committee has recommended that grievous offences like murder, rape, etc should be handed over to the CBI for investigation and these cases should be tried outside the state." The committee also referred to the post-poll violence as “retributive violence by supporters of the ruling party against supporters of the main opposition party.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/law-of-ruler-not-rule-of-law-says-nhrc-on-bengal-violence/articleshow/84459847.cms||Swati Mathur
---||India||In big push for drone use, government eases norms||NEW DELHI: Junking its three-month-old drone policy following industry complaints over a plethora of approvals and clearances, the government has come out with a radically liberalised set of draft rules that pave the way for drone taxis and dedicated corridors for cargo deliveries. Given the unlimited potential of drones waiting to be tapped, the PMO had recently reviewed the Unmanned Aircraft System Rules (UAS Rules) that came into force this March. Now, the aviation ministry has sought public comments on a much simplified “Drone rules, 2021” till August 5. After taking the comments into consideration, the final rules are expected to be issued that will replace the stricter UAS rules. Coming after the Jammu airport drone attack, these changes indicate that while the government takes steps to counter rogue drones, it was willing to allow the technology to achieve its potential. Union aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said the draft drone rules 2021 will provide “a major fillip to the drone industry… (and) mark a stark shift from the earlier UAS Rules….” Scindia said the key features of the proposed new rules were: “Several approvals abolished and processes made easier; number of forms reduced from 25 to 5; no security clearance required before any registration or licence issuance; easy process for transfer and de-registration of drones.. no pilot licence required for nano drones (weighing up to 250 gram), micro drones (weighing up to 2kg) for non-commercial use…” The changes have got a thumbs up from the industry. Arjun Aggarwal, MD of drone major Aeroarc, said the change will “give impetus to an ‘aatmanirbhar’ drone eco-system”. Terming the new draft rules as a “paradigm shift from the document-intensive UAS rules of March 21 (that) enable faster and paperless approvals, enhanced traction by foreign OEMs, single window interface… which is in sync with what drones offer — speed, safety, economy and reliability.” Scindia tweeted: “Drones are bringing the next big tech revolution around the globe with reduced costs, resources and time taken for operations. It is upon us to ride on the new wave and facilitate its uptake, especially among our startups.” The fees for using drones will also be cut sharply. Also, now there will be no restriction on drone operations by foreign-owned companies registered in India. The maximum penalty under new rules will be capped at Rs 1 lakh (not including penalties for violating other laws). The draft rules strike a balance in simplifying their use in a manner while ensuring “they do not pose any risk to safety or security of people and assets”. The proposed rules will cover drones weighing up to 500 kg, instead of 300 kg earlier, and cover drone taxis also. And drone corridors will be developed for cargo deliveries. The draft drone rules are “built on a premise of trust, self-certification and non-intrusive monitoring,” said a senior official. Among the radical changes proposed are abolishing several approvals including: getting unique authorisation number, unique prototype identification number, certificate of conformance, certificate of maintenance, import clearance, acceptance of existing drones, operator permit, authorisation of R&D organisation, student remote pilot licence, remote pilot instructor authorisation and drone port authorisation. Safety features like “no permission–no takeoff” (NPNT), real-time tracking beacon and geo-fencing will be notified in future. A six-month lead time will be provided for compliance. Under the proposed changed rules, interactive airspace map with green, yellow and red zones will be displayed on the digital sky platform. Yellow zone is proposed to be reduced from 45km to 12km from the airport perimeter. No flight permission required up to 400 feet in green zones and up to 200 feet in the area between 8km and 12km from the airport perimeter. Under new rules, manufacturer may generate their drone’s unique identification number on the digital sky platform through the self-certification route. The process for transfer and deregistration of drones will be simplified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-big-push-for-drone-use-government-eases-norms/articleshow/84459932.cms||---

The Tollygunge-Panchannagram and Intercepting canals were found to be heavily silted. A part of Intercepting canal near Avishikta crossing has also been barricaded for Metro work. According to a KMC official, a few spells of heavy downpour in the past three weeks led to waterlogging in large parts of south Kolkata and localities off Bypass. “In the monsoon, we need to dredge these canals to give relief to south Kolkata and Bypass residents,” said a KMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/firhad-inspects-2-major-canals-off-bypass/articleshow/84453708.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Man dies of Covid-19 in April, gets second shot of vaccine in July!||AHMEDABAD: A text SMS on his mobile phone has ended up rubbing salt in the wounds of a son who is still grieving over his father's death to Covid-19. Nearly three months after Vershibhai Parmar cremated his father Harji Lakshman Parmar (70) who died of coronavirus on April 23 at a private hospital in Tharad, Banaskantha, the son was shocked to get a message on July 14 congratulating that his father had successfully got second shot of Covid-19 vaccine. Vershi, who feels his father may have still been alive if they got an oxygen bed on time, says the system and its vaccine blunder have added insult to their injury. “My father never went for vaccination. He did not get his first shot,” he says. This is one of the many erroneous vaccination messages sent out through the CoWin vaccine portal in the state in the past where some dead persons and those who did not get vaccinated were reportedly sent messages of vaccination. A man has died because there were not enough oxygen beds available to provide timely treatment. Ironically, the system is vaccinating him against Covid-19. How did they achieve this feat,” asks Vershibhai Parmar reeling under the hurt of losing his father,. Resident of Radosan village in Suigam taluka of Banaskantha district, Vershibhai's father Harji tested positive on April 17 and his condition started deteriorating. “I ran for three days from one hospital to another but there was no bed available. I saw people gasping for breath outside Palanpur Civil Hospital pleading for succour in vain. Finally on April 20, we found a private hospital in Tharad where authorities asked us to admit our father the next day. In the meantime, his oxygen saturation had started dipping to dangerous levels of 70,” reminisces Vershibhai. Within days of hospitalization, Harji succumbed to Covid-19. “The state administration should get its systems checked to ensure the right persons get vaccinated and right people get updates about vaccination,” says Harji's son-in-law Shivram, who works in a private firm in Palanpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-dies-of-covid-19-in-april-gets-2nd-shot-of-vaccine-in-july/articleshow/84454223.cms||Ashish Chauhan

While inspecting the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), he claimed that the health department was regularly monitoring the progress made in proper supply of all the above facilities. Pandey reviewed the ongoing construction of a cryogenic oxygen plant and an oxygen generation plant at the PMCH and discussed their progress with the hospital’s superintendent, Dr I S Thakur, and other officials. After completion the two plants will provide sufficient oxygen to all the wards. The minister also inspected a new 40-bed intensive care unit with modern facilities at the PMCH. “The PMCH, the largest government hospital of the state, has been offering services to patients from across Bihar,” he said and talked about making it a world-class hospital.

---||Patna||Girl’s rape: Court recommends spl training for Madhubani SP, 2 other cops||PATNA: A Jhanjharpur court on Monday recommended special training for Madhubani SP and two others while observing that they don’t have basic knowledge of laws related to offences committed against minor girls. The two other officers are Jhanjharpur SDPO and Bhairavsthan police station SHO. The court found that police filed chargesheet against an accused only under Section 363 (punishment for kidnapping) and Section 366A (procuration of minor girl) of IPC while the case was related to kidnapping, marrying and having physical relation with a 15-year-old girl, who had later become pregnant. It was hearing a regulation bail petition of Balbir Sadai, who is accused of kidnapping a minor girl for marriage after barging into her residence on January 6 this year. The petitioner pleaded that the matter had been settled with the victim after marriage and who was pregnant. The court of ADJ Avinash Kumar-I denied him bail as per the Supreme Court ruling that sexual intercourse with a girl below 18 years is rape regardless of fact whether she is the wife of the person. The court observed that as per the case diary, the girl was medically examined on January 13 and the doctors found her 15-year-old and injury in her private part. It observed that since the SP is an IPS officer, he be sent to National Police Academy for the special training of laws like The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act and POCSO Act. The court also directed to send the order to Union home minister and state DGP to look into the matter, conduct an inquiry and act accordingly. The order was uploaded on Wednesday night. The court didn’t spare Jhanjharpur ACJM-III and issued show-cause notice for its January 13 order that the victim was an adult when no legal, valid documentary evidence or medical report was present to establish it. The court expressed shock over the kind of police investigation in which final supervision was conducted by the SP. It observed that even the SDPO in his supervision note mentioned about the accused marrying a minor victim, but he didn’t apply the POCSO Act, The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act and Section 376 (rape) of IPC in the case and the SP approved it. “The non-application of the said Acts is a grave miscarriage of justice,” it observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/girls-rape-court-recommends-spl-training-for-madhubani-sp-2-other-cops/articleshow/84450383.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Business||Pidilite ropes in new deputy MD||Mumbai: In what is being seen as a leadership succession plan at Fevicol-maker Pidilite Industries, Sudhanshu Vats has been appointed as deputy MD effective September 1, 2021. The term of Bharat Puri, the managing director of the Rs 7,000-crore company, will end in about 4 years. The appointment of Vats as deputy MD is understood to be part of a plan to prepare Pidilite for the future. Given the increasing size and complexity of Pidilite, which has over 15 domestic and international subsidiaries as well as a growing number of verticals, a need was felt to further strengthen the leadership, sources said. The 53-year-old Vats has worked across Unilever, Castrol, Viacom18 and Essel Propack. In a statement, Bharat Puri said Vats’ experience and passion for building a sustainable growth business will be a key asset in building “the Pidilite of the future”. Executive search experts see the trend of two leaders at the helm growing, given the increasing complexities in managing businesses. Executive Access (India) MD Ronesh Puri said, “Having two leaders is a trend that will gain in popularity as it helps the organisation in an increasingly complex environment. The days of one all-powerful CEO is likely to become less popular as too much dependence on one individual can be risky in today’s uncertain environment. It is becoming more a collaborative, interdependent world where the gains of this can be considerable if the two work in close collaboration with mutual trust and respect. Sudhanshu is a very capable leader and it will definitely help Bharat Puri as it will take some of his load. It could also be succession planning as organisations often struggle with proper succession planning.”Joint MDs, as also an MD and deputy MD, is not a new concept though. At one point, Hindustan Unilever had two MDs — one for foods and one for home & personal care. Godrej Consumer Products, which is getting a new MD & CEO (Sudhir Sitapati) in October, has a CEO for India & Saarc (Sunil Kataria). At JSW Steel, where Sajjan Jindal is CMD, Seshagiri Rao is joint MD and Vinod Nowal is deputy MD. Commenting on the appointment of Vats, Pidilite executive chairman M B Parekh said, “Sudhanshu is a welcome addition to Pidilite’s leadership team. His talent and experience will be of great value to Pidilite.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pidilite-ropes-in-new-deputy-md/articleshow/84456998.cms||Namrata Singh
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad’s jab average down 20% in two weeks||AHMEDABAD: The city on July 3 had recorded 45,444 total doses of Covid-19 vaccines — one of the highest in a month. On Thursday, the number dropped to 35,653. It’s despite the fact that the state administration has claimed to have got regular supply of the vaccine, and vaccination being the only sure-shot remedy against the possible third wave of Covid pandemic. But the trend reveals that in a fortnight the city’s vaccination dropped by 20% — from 24,400 to 19,500 average daily vaccinations between June 26-July 2 and July 10-15 according to CoWIN data. Surat however recorded the sharpest drop of 52% — from 26,000 daily vaccines to 12,667 in two weeks. Similarly, Junagadh, Bhavnagar and Jamnagar recorded 42%, 39% and 35% fall in vaccination in two weeks. Similarly, Gujarat reported drop of 38% in daily average Covid vaccination in two weeks from 2.78 lakh to 1.72 lakh. If compared with the 10 states of India with the highest total vaccination (both doses), the state ranked second only after Madhya Pradesh that recorded drop of 47%. In comparison, Rajasthan recorded rise of 9% whereas another neighbouring state Maharashtra recorded a drop of 29%. While Dr Nayan Jani, state immunization officer, was not available for comment, a senior health department official said that the drop could be due to the gap created by four days in the past week where the vaccination had not taken place. “There were no vaccinations from Wednesday to Friday, and this Wednesday due to observance of Mamta Divas. There would again be no vaccination on Sundays, now onwards, to give the vaccination staff a break,” said the official. The state however has included aggressive vaccination as one of the primary thrust areas in preparedness for the third wave and has also set target of 4 lakh daily vaccinations, which was achieved only a couple of times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/citys-jab-average-down-20-in-2-weeks/articleshow/84456450.cms||---

The land in question was bought by the Ram Temple Trust for Rs 3.71crore on March 27, a day after mutation was ordered in favour of Mahant Raghuvar Sharan by sub-district magistrate, Sadar tehsil. On Thursday, Faizabad civil judge, senior division, Sanjeev Tripathi, issued notices to Champat Rai, Mahant Raghuvar Sharan, who sold the temple premises to the Trust, priest Kripa Shankar Das and patron Ram Kishor Singh. The court summoned all parties, including Champat Rai, the Kashi seer and Santosh Dubey, formerly a Babri demolition accused, on August 6. With the probability of the Fakire Ram temple being demolished in keeping with the expansion of the Ramjanmabhoomi complex, counsel for Dubey and Kashi seer, Tarunjeet Varma, sought continuance of rituals and a stay on any move to raze the temple. Talking to TOI, Varma said, “We raised objections before court that no one has the right to sell off a temple as it’s in the ownership of the deity till the existence of the universe and nobody can sell the temple's property or donate it. It was sold to Ram Mandir Trust on March 27 by Mahant Raghuvar Sharan on consent of the priest and its patron. We have also demanded cancellation of sale deed and the mutation ordered in favour of Mahant Raghuvar Sharan. We also pleaded for appointment of a receiver for Ram Fakire temple as sale and purchase of this temple is illegal due to a pending litigation over the mahant title.” The centuries-old Fakire Ram temple campus with 50 rooms and straddling a vast area on the north-eastern flank of Ramjanmabhoomi was the very shrine where the idol of Ram Lalla was hastily shifted when the Babri mosque domes were being demolished in 1992. Also, its mythological importance cannot be dismissed as Lord Ram stayed here for a night before going on exile.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/temple-trust-secy-champat-rai-gets-court-summons-on-purchase-of-350-yr-old-temple-along-ramjanmabhoomi/articleshow/84457222.cms||---

The proposed new factory will come within the existing Hosur complex of the company, which makes motorcycles for both TVS and BMW. This EV plant will have a capacity of around 1,00,000 units a year, which will include both two and three wheelers. TVS would likely pump in around Rs 1,000 crore in the EV plant and the electric vehicle project. The company did not respond to an email questionnaire at the time of going to print. TVS Motor has made initial moves in the e-two wheeler space by launching its iQube scooter besides investing in a startup Ultraviolette Automotive which will build high performance electric bikes. It has recently tied up with Convergence Energy Services to set up charging stations across India. It is learnt that TVS will create a separate subsidiary for its EV business. Two key inductions in the TVS board —former JLR CEO Ralf Speth and Singapore-based Kuok Group scion and founder of venture firm K3 Kuok Meng Xiong — may both have a role to play in the EV venture. Earlier this year the company also inducted Timothy Prentice as VP design and the statement issued at the time outlined that his “experience in designs for high performance electric vehicles will augment the company’s EV lineup design to the next level”. The electric vehicles space in the Indian market is gaining significant traction with new players entering the space. The incentives announced under the FAME scheme are helping the segment with lower prices. Green horn in the segment Ola Mobility, which is building the largest two wheeler factory near Krishnagiri and Ampere is also flexing its muscles to build capacities ahead of an impending boom.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tvs-to-set-up-ev-plant-in-hosur/articleshow/84454513.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

---||Kanpur||Defence min launches grievance mgmt app developed with help of IIT-K||Times News Network Kanpur: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, on Thursday, launched an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered grievance management application in New Delhi, developed by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) with the help of IIT-Kanpur. Minister of State (Independent Charge) for personnel, public grievances & pensions Dr Jitendra Singh, defence secretary Dr Ajay Kumar, additional secretary, DARPG V Srinivas, additional secretary MoD Nivedita Shukla Verma, director, IIT-Kanpur Prof Abhay Karandikar, Professor Shalabh, Professor Nisheeth Srivastava and other senior officials of MoD were present on the occasion. The web-based application has been jointly developed by the department of defence, MoD, department of administrative reforms and public grievances (DARPG) and a team of IIT-Kanpur comprising of Professors Shalabh, Nisheeth Srivastava, and Piyush Rai. This is the first AI, data science, and machine learning-based system developed to improve grievance redressal in the government. The AI tool developed as a part of the initiative has the capability to understand the content of complaint and identify repeat complaints or spam automatically. It can categorize complaints of different categories even when if keywords are not present in the complaint. It also enables geographical analysis of complaints in category including analysis of whether the complaint was adequately addressed or not by the concerned office. User-friendly search enables the user to formulate queries/categories depending on management requirements and seek performance results based on the query. Given that lakhs of complaints are received on the Centralized Public Grievance Redress And Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) portal of DARPG, this application will be of great use in understanding the nature of complaints, geographies they emanate from and policy changes that can be introduced to create systemic improvements to address these grievances. Speaking on the occasion, Rajnath Singh described the application as a product of good governance, which reflects the growing synergy between the government and academia. He said that this initiative is another citizen-centric reform of the government that aims to empower the people at large. The defence minister lauded the department of administrative reforms & public grievances (DARPG) for its role in the reform of the Public Grievances Redressal System, saying that resolving the grievances of people is a great service in itself. He added that the active involvement of reputed institutions like IIT-Kanpur will further bolster the system and resolve the grievances in a transparent and effective manner.  The success of this project in MoD will pave the way for extension of this application across other ministries. The MoD and IIT-Kanpur intend to drive their collaboration forward in the coming years, seeking to better leverage the use of AI for the disposal of citizens’ complaints. The application will be improved with more features in the next three years. A tripartite MoU for the project was signed among the Department of Defence, MoD, Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) and IIT-Kanpur on August 4 in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/defence-min-launches-grievance-mgmt-app-developed-with-help-of-iit-k/articleshow/84452081.cms||---

Addressing a joint meeting of the four academic panels constituted by the Bihar State Higher Education Council (BSHEC) on Thursday, the minister said there was no dearth of talent in the state as many people occupied top positions in all the examinations at the national level. “However, our colleges and universities are not delivering the education that suits the present-day demands. We should, therefore, strive hard to create an environment of quality education and research so that our students do not lag behind their counterparts in other states,” Choudhary added. The minister also claimed that the government had been trying its best to solve all the problems faced by different institutions. He said, “While the Bihar State Educational Infrastructure Development Corporation is providing infrastructural facilities to universities and colleges, the government is recruiting teachers against the vacant posts. A large number of teachers have already been recruited by the Bihar Public Service Commission in the last few years and the Bihar State University Service Commission (BSUSC) has started interviewing the shortlisted candidates for appointment as assistant professors. The budgetary allocations on higher education have also increased considerably.” Choudhary asked the members of the BSUSC to recommend practically feasible steps for raising the quality of teaching and research. “Their valuable suggestions will be implemented by the government,” he promised. The minister also suggested that the heads of universities and colleges should revive the old system of inspecting classroom teaching to gain first-hand knowledge of the real status. He said, “Higher education will improve only when the institutions located in remote localities start imparting quality education to all.” The meeting was attended by BSHEC’s vice-chairman Kameshwar Jha, education department’s principal secretary Sanjay Kumar, and the vice-chancellors (VCs) of Central University of South Bihar and Patna University. With a view to ensuring qualitative improvement of higher education in the state, the BSHEC has constituted four different committees to suggest ways for the much-needed reforms. These include the academic reforms committee, NAAC committee, quality assurance committee and NEP committee and consist of VCs, senior academics and experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/minister-seeks-advice-for-raising-quality-of-education-and-research/articleshow/84451395.cms||B K Mishra

---||Patna||Bihar: RJD’s ‘Lalu ki naav’ to help flood-hit people draws flak||PATNA: After ‘Lalu ki Rasoi’, the RJD has come up with ‘Lalu ki naav’ (Lalu’s boat) to help people in the flood-hit areas of the state. Painted in dark green colour, these boats have RJD election symbol and ‘long live’ Tejashwi Yadav written on the banner. Fourteen such boats have been introduced in the flood-affected areas of north Bihar. RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said the initiative has been taken by party leader Syyed Faisal Ali, who was their Lok Sabha candidate from Sheohar. “Since the government is not able to help people in crises like floods or Covid-19, our party supremo Lalu Prasad ji has asked all the RJD members to provide all possible help to them. This initiative is on his instructions,” Gagan said, adding, “Even Lalu ki Rasoi, which was started the previous year to provide food to the migrants who were returning home hungry, is continuing its services in several flooded pockets of the state.” He said apart from providing such help, RJD MLAs and other members were also visiting the field to see the ground reality. RJD’s another spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari took a jibe at the aerial survey conducted by chief minister Nitish Kumar and said, “CM is in the air and is far away from the ground reality. What is he seeing from the helicopter? It is Lalu ki naav which is taking people stuck in the floods to safer areas.” However, JD(U) state spokesperson Ranbir Nandan said the RJD had always been involved in cheap politics. “There is a saying, ‘Neki kar dariya me daal’. But the RJD people, instead of helping the people, start their advertisement,” he said, adding, “The state government under the leadership of CM Nitish Kumar is providing all help to the people. Bihar had earlier faced more massive floods and CM Nitish managed the situation well. As far as the aerial survey is concerned, we all know it is important to know the real situation.” BJP leader Nikhil Anand said the RJD was copying the government’s ‘Tika ki naav’ initiative through which vaccination was being done in the flood-affected areas. “They had even launched a kitchen in the name of Lalu Ji. That has also failed. These are just the photo opportunities by the RJD. The fact is that Tejashwi is a failed leader and he should acknowledge how PM Modi has resolved the vaccination issue and how the Bihar government is working in case of vaccination as well as in the floods.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjds-lalu-ki-naav-to-help-flood-hit-people-draws-flak/articleshow/84452353.cms||Sheezan Nezami

In the past seven years of Modi government, excise duty on petrol has been increased by 247% and that on diesel by 794%. While in 2014-15, income earned from excise duty on petrol and diesel was Rs17,20,00 crore, it has increased to Rs45,30,00 crore in 2020-21.

The CM said the displaced persons living at relief camps and taking shelter at safe places should be subjected to RT-PCR test for coronavirus and also vaccinated. Besides, he asked the DMs to ensure that relief materials reached the flood victims. Nitish reviewed the flood situation with disaster management department principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit, depattment secretary Sanjeev Hans and the DMs of the seven districts through videoconferencing after conducting an aerial survey of the flood affected parts of Begusarai, Khagaria, Bhagalpur, Madhepura, Nawada and Patna districts. “More rainfall occurred in June and comparatively lesser rainfall has occurred in July so far. Excessive rainfall in the last month led to flood situation in a few districts. We conducted aerial survey of some of those districts a few days ago and seven districts today,” the CM said. He said farming activities have been badly affected due to the excessive rainfall. He asked the officials concerned to make proper assessment of the damages to farmers, in order to provide them timely relief. He also asked the officials to take necessary measures to prevent flooding of the premises of Bhagalpur Engineering College. “Heavy rainfall in Nepal and Jharkhand leads to flood situation in many districts in Bihar. Officials in all districts concerned should be alert for such situation. Inspection should also be done of the taal areas in Patna district (Mokama) and vigil should be maintained for preventing accumulation of excess rainwater there,” Nitish said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-conduct-covid-tests-of-flood-hit-people-at-relief-camps/articleshow/84452187.cms||---

Altogether 2,258 farmers in the district have availed the state government grants for organic farming. Sources said an audit is being initiated before registering cases against the defaulters. District agriculture officer K K Jha said the 2,258 farmers registered in the 24 farming groups spread over seven blocks were provided grants for organic farming. “Organic farming is being done in nearly 2000 acres of land and each farmer gets Rs11,500 per acre per year for buying organic inputs,” he said. The seven blocks where the organic farming has been started are Sultanganj, Nathnagar, Sabour, Kahalgaon, Pirpainty, Rangra and Kharik. Organic farming is the flagship project of CM Nitish Kumar, who has promoted ‘organic corridor’ in 13 districts alongside the Ganga from Buxar to Bhagalpur district for promoting organic farming and also to keep the river clean. “The first instalments of total Rs2.30 crore was provided to the farmers and similar is being done for this year also. We have stumbled upon reports that many registered farmers have taken the grants but neither purchased the organic inputs nor submitted any details of purchases," Jha said. He added: “We are trying to initiate a third party audit regarding purchases and usage of organic inputs for the specific farming purposes for which the grants were allocated. Legal action against the erring farmers will be initiated. Steps like recovery of grant money, cancellation of registration, debarring of benefits from different schemes for farmers besides registering of certificate cases etc will be made soon after the audit report pinpoints the defaulters.” Referring to ‘organic inputs’, Jha said these are bio-fertilizers, composts, green manure, neem-based fertilizers, cow dung manure and organic seeds among others for organic farming and where the farming is done without the use of synthetic chemical fertilizers and pesticides and growth-enhancing steroids or other chemicals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/farmers-to-face-action-for-diverting-govt-funds/articleshow/84452237.cms||Kumar Rajesh

The authorities are in the process of making the necessary modifications in the building rules. NKDA has already developed rooftop gardening in some of its market complexes. NKDA had issued an advisory in March, urging residents to take up rooftop gardening and develop rainwater harvesting systems in their housing complexes, along with a few other measures, like planting trees in all plots, setting up electric vehicle charging points at car parking spaces inside housing complexes and developing waste water recycling systems. NKDA officials said the aim of mandatory provisions for rainwater harvesting and rooftop gardening is to have a green and clean New Town and develop a sustainable environment for the township to keep up with its ‘green city’ tag. New Town has been awarded the ‘platinum-rated Green City certificate’ by the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) for its initiatives on creating a sustainable environment. According to the advisory, a waste water recycling system should be developed in all buildings, including group housings, that have a minimum discharge of 25,000L and above per day for flushing of toilets, gardening, car wash-ing and other uses. The roof area of each building should also have reflecting paint and solar panels to minimize heat absorption. NKDA has also proposed a maximum permissible limit of potable water supply of 120 litres per capita per day for the residential population and 40 litres per capita per day for the floating population. To increase the green cover, NKDA has set a target of planting 10,000 trees this season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rooftop-garden-notice-for-new-town-high-rises-soon/articleshow/84453629.cms||Suman Chakraborti

He added that India’s friendship with Japan is considered one of the most natural partnerships in the entire region. Speaking at a gathering of intellectuals after inaugurating Rudraksh, the ultra-modern International Cooperation and Convention Centre constructed with Japanese assistance, Modi said: “Rudraksh is the result of creativity and dynamism. This centre shows the strong connect between India and Japan.” Further lauding Japan’s effort in helping build the convention centre, Modi said, “India and Japan are of the view that our development should be linked with our happiness. This development should be all-round, should be for all, and should be all-encompassing.” The PM also mentioned former Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe, who was closely connected with Rudraksh. Modi recalled the moment when he had a discussion with Abe on the idea of Rudraksh when the latter had come to Kashi. The PM also recalled that the present Prime Minister of Japan Yoshihide Suga was the chief cabinet secretary at that time. “From then till he became the Prime Minister of Japan, he has been personally involved in this project,” said the PM adding that every Indian is grateful to him for his affinity towards India. A video message of Japanese Prime Minister Suga was also screened on the occasion. The PM said this building has both the shine of modernity as well as cultural glow. “It has the connection of India-Japan relationship as well as scope of future cooperation also.” Modi said that from his visit to Japan this kind of people-to-people relations were envisaged and projects like Rudraksh and Zen Garden in Ahmedabad symbolize this relationship. Lauding the culture of Banaras, the PM said, “Songs, music and art flow in the veins of Banaras. Here on the ghats of the Ganga so many arts have been developed, knowledge has reached the summit and so many serious thoughts related to humanity have taken place. This is how Banaras can become a huge global centre of music, religion, spirit and of knowledge and science.” He added that this centre will be a cultural hub and a medium to unite different people while urging the people of Kashi to preserve this centre. “Kashi has been adorned with so many development projects in the last seven years, how could this adornment have been completed without Rudraksh,” wondered the PM adding, “Now that Kashi, which is the real Shiva, has worn this Rudraksh, its (Kashi) development will shine more and its beauty will increase more.” The event was also attended by UP Governor Anandiben Patel, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Japanese ambassador to India Satoshi Suzuki and authorities of Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/modi-opens-rudraksh-says-japanamong-indias-most-trusted-friends/articleshow/84451455.cms||---

According to the governor, financial inclusion would continue to be a priority to ensure that the post-pandemic recovery is more inclusive and sustainable. Delivering the inaugural address at the Economic Times Financial Inclusion Summit, Das said, “It is quite well known by now that India is among the leaders in the world about development of state-of-the-art payment infrastructure and products leading to wider adoption of digital payments. To give an example, the number of Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs) increased at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 53% from 41 crores in May 2017 to 226 crores in May 2021.” Das said that 91% of prepaid instruments were in the form of e-wallets and the rest in the form of cards. He said the shift to digital has also been accelerated by fast payment systems, such as Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) and Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which provide immediate credit to beneficiaries and are available round the clock. Das pointed out that during June 2021, the payment systems in India processed on an average more than 15 crore transactions each day, amounting to nearly Rs 4.5 lakh crore daily. Of this, UPI alone witnessed over 280 crore transactions. On UPI, Das said that globally, there has been a lot of interest in the locally developed platform. Another innovation was the Aadhaar-enabled Payment System (AePS) that facilitates fund transfers/payments and cash withdrawals through micro-ATMs and banking correspondents (BCs) using Aadhaar authentication, he said. During the pandemic, cash transactions at BC outlets through micro-ATMs witnessed significant surge with more than 94 crore transactions accounting for Rs 2.25 lakh crore during 2020-21. “The pandemic has accelerated the push towards digitalisation with greater adoption of digital payments. It is important to take steps to converge greater digitalisation with goals of financial inclusion,” said Das. He added that all stakeholders must ensure that the financial ecosystem (including the digital medium) is inclusive and capable of effectively addressing risks like mis-selling, cybersecurity and, data privacy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/payments-tech-economys-lifeline-vital-for-financial-inclusion-rbi-governor/articleshow/84456790.cms||---

While power supply will start from two substations at Mahkar (Khizarsarai) and Bakraur (Bodh Gaya) from July 20, the other six would be functional by the end of this year. The power substations are being set up at an estimate cost of Rs4 crore each under the Union government’s Deen Dayal Gram Jyoti Yojana and the state plan. “Each substation would have two power transformers of five MVA each. One transformer can supply power to 50 transformers of 200 kVA each. The new substations are being set up to meet the increasing power requirements as every household has got a power connection in the villages. Every year, the load on transformers is increasing and infrastructure to meet the requirement has to be kept ready. Within the last three years, 24 new power substations have been set up across the district under Deen Dayal Jyoti Yojana and the state plan. Once the new substations become functional, the problem of low voltage and power cuts due to excess load would mitigate,” Bagish said. The other power substations are being set up at Alipur and Bhore (Manpur), Sakardas Nawada and Tarwan (Wazirganj), Dhangain (Barachatti) and Karchoi (Banke Bazar). Those at Mahkar, Bakraur, Alipur and Sakardas Nawada are being set up under Deen Dayal Gram Jyoti Yojana and the remaining from the funds made available by the state government. A consumer, Naresh Prasad of village Bela Khaneta in Belaganj block, said, “"There is only one power substation in our area, at Bela Parao Par. There is problem of low voltage in the area. An additional power substation is needed to mitigate the low voltage problem.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/8-power-substations-in-rural-gaya-soon/articleshow/84452397.cms||---
---||Kanpur||Kanpur: Three bail pleas of accused in cheating cases rejected||KANPUR: Additional sessions judge (Court No. XVI), Jitendra Kumar Dwivedi on Thursday rejected the three bail applications of accused Om Jaiswal, a resident of Awas Vikas Hanspuram, Naubasta in cheating and fabrication of forged documents for loan matters. According to additional district government counsel Dinesh Agarwal, one Santosh Kumar Gupta, a resident of Ghatampur had lodged a report at Swarup Nagar police station that he had purchased a plot measuring 250 square yards in 1999 and he was interested in a bank loan. He met one Gokaran Singh and discussed a bank loan to raise construction on that plot. Gokaran brought on Om Jaiswal at his house on May 26, 2000 and introduced him and claimed that he was influential person and he would get sanction bank loan from Punjab National Bank, Swaroop Nagar Branch .On Gokaran’s advice Om took out a housing loan form of PNB from his bag and brought his signature on some forms and papers and took original deed of plot for mortgage for a loan of Rs 15 lakhs. Santosh in his report further stated that on September 10, 2009 he had received a bank notice in which it was stated that Om Prakash Jaiswal and Gokaran Singh had obtained a loan of Rs 15 lakhs under the name and style of M/s Classic Flour Mills and his plot was placed as guarantee of that loan. He alleged that Om Prakash and bank employees had colluded and misappropriated the loan amount on the basis of forged and fabricated documents. The accused in his bail application claimed that he was an old man of 65 years and victim of high blood pressure and diabetes. He was in jail for a long time. He was ready to furnish his sureties and would not misuse the bail and will appear in the court on fixed dates. The ADGC argued that the accused was a clever man of criminal activity. Three more cases of cheating and fabricating forged papers and misappropriation of funds are pending against him in the court and they were registered at Pheelkhana, Kotwali and Kidwai Nagar police stations. He would violate the terms of bail and try to tamper the evidence, therefore, his bail application should be rejected. The presiding judge, after going through the evidence and documents on the file, observed that the criminal history depicts that the accused was habitual offender, therefore, his bail application was being rejected. The ADGC further informed TOI that Om Praksh’s second bail application was in Kidwai Nagar police station case. In that matter he had cheated one Ajay Nigam on pretext of bank loan and sought loan on his papers from Central Bank of India, Lucknow. The third bail application was in the case of Pheelkhana police station. In that, Ravish Srivastava branch manager of IDBI Bank had alleged that Om Jaiswal had tried to withdraw funds to the tune of several lakhs through cheques from other persons bank account. The ADGC apprised the court that the accused was at present detained at Rajasthan jail and brought here under warrant. The presiding judge rejected the two other bail applications too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/three-bail-pleas-of-accusedin-cheating-cases-rejected/articleshow/84452365.cms||---

Issuers like RBL Bank and Yes Bank and entities like Indigo, Maruti, Flipkart, Tata, Vistara and BookMyShow — which issue co-branded cards — will need to look for alternatives. RBL Bank has informed the stock exchanges that approximately 1 lakh new credit card issuances could be hit. The bank is in talks with Visa, but issuing cards under the new network would take 8-10 weeks. RBL Bank has 30 lakh credit cards and is the fifth-largest issuer with a 5% market share. A large chunk of its cards is issued by Bajaj Finserv through a partnership agreement. A Yes Bank spokesperson said that for new credit card issuances, the bank is evaluating a migration to other platforms for a ‘seamless transition’. It added that its debit cards are also available on Visa and RuPay platforms and new issuances will not be hit. Bankers say that besides the technical integration, a new partnership with Visa will require banks to negotiate all the incentives and offers afresh. The pandemic has changed the dynamics of the payment industry. While discretionary shopping in malls and stores has dropped, online shopping has accelerated. According to a research report by ICICI Securities, the restrictions will help improve market share for respective unaffected incumbents. “The issuance of co-branded cards with Mastercard will also stop due to the RBI restriction. If a particular Mastercard co-branded credit card has a high contribution to the overall mix of a credit card player, it will have a higher impact on the issuer’s business growth,” the report said. According to bankers, Visa will be the primary gainer in market share as banks have been reluctant to issue many RuPay credit cards, because of which its market share is still low. The domestic issuer is, however, the market leader in debit cards in number, but is yet to push spending.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ban-on-mastercard-will-hit-card-issuers-having-exclusive-tie-ups/articleshow/84456756.cms||Mayur Shetty

As a result, the paid-up equity shares of Rs 10 each in the share capital of the company will be consolidated into 250 equity shares of Rs 2,500 each. Dismissing the objection raised by dissenting shareholders to the consolidation, the bench comprising R Sucharitha (judicial member) and B Anil Kumar (technical member) has directed the company to create a trust to deposit the fractional shares of the dissenters. According to the company, the board of directors at their meeting held on September 25, 2019 approved the proposal to consolidate the share capital into shares of a larger amount by increasing the nominal value of the shares from Rs 10 to Rs 2,500 per share so that every 250 shares with nominal value of Rs 10 held by a member are consolidated into 1 share with nominal value of Rs 2,500. It was also resolved that any fractions arising from such consolidation will be reduced under the provision of the Companies Act from the capital of the company. The consideration to be paid for the shares was determined as Rs 14,860 per share. According to the company, the decision was made in view of the large number of small shareholders for the closed held company has become very cumbersome and costly for the company to service the large number of shareholders. It added that consolidation of the shares is expected to be beneficial for all the parties involved. On one hand small shareholders would get an exit opportunity for shares which do not have a ready market, while the company will benefit from significant savings in cost. Concurring with the same, the tribunal rejected the objections of the dissenting shareholders and ruled in favour of the company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nclt-allows-consolidation-and-reduction-of-share-capital-at-simpson-and-co/articleshow/84454379.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: NHRC report on violence sparks political slugfest||KOLKATA: The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) panel examining post-poll violence complaints has said “the law of the ruler” exists in Bengal “instead of the rule of law”. The panel, asked to examine the complaints by a five-judge bench of the Calcutta high court, has recommended in its final report that complaints of “grievous offences like rape and murder” be handed over to the CBI for investigation. “These cases should be tried outside the state. The other cases should be investigated by a court-monitored special investigation team. There should be fast-track courts, a special public prosecutor and a witness-protection scheme,” its report stated. The panel provided a list of 13 “delinquent police stations” in Cooch Behar, Birbhum, South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas and Howrah where the number of arrests was the lowest and recommended action against “delinquent government servants”. The Bengal government has already filed a “recall application” in the Calcutta high court, seeking modification of the five-judge bench’s order as the court gave additional directions to the state government based on the NHRC team’s “brief report” even though the state did not have access to the contents of the report. NHRC panel members made 311 spot visits in 20 daysThe state had also objected to the larger bench’s recording of its response to post-poll complaints as “lukewarm”. “The findings in the interim report are required to be supported by evidence and reasons,” the state application stated. The NHRC report comes at a time when the Supreme Court has issued notices to the Election Commission, the centre and the Bengal government following a PIL urging president’s rule in Bengal. The 50-page report noted the state government’s “appalling apathy” to victims’ plight, adding: “The spate of violence shows a pernicious politico-bureaucratic-criminal nexus. This was retributive violence by supporters of the ruling party against supporters of the main opposition party. It resulted in disruption of life and livelihood of thousands of people and their economic strangulation. The local police have been grossly derelict if not complicit in this violence.” NHRC panel members made 311 spot visits in 20 days and held “camp sittings” in Kolkata, East Midnapore, Howrah, East Burdwan and Murshidabad. The panel examined 1,979 complaints, 57 of which came from the National Commission for Women and 18 from the West Bengal Human Rights Commission, and found the number of accused still in custody “abysmally low”. The NHRC panel sent 582 complaints to the state director-general of police, following which 137 FIRs were registered; it noted 188 instances from its 311 spot visits in which no FIR was registered. National Commission for Women member and NHRC panel member Rajuben L Desai said she found during her visit to three districts that women victims had “come under pressure from the local police to withdraw their complaints”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nhrc-report-on-violence-sparks-political-slugfest/articleshow/84458349.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Business||RBI: Near-term prospects for eco brighter||Mumbai: The state of the economy report published by the RBI in its monthly bulletin has said that the tapering of the second wave, coupled with an aggressive vaccination push, has brightened near-term prospects for the Indian economy. The improvement is already visible in high-frequency indicators of economic activity. However, a solid increase in aggregate demand is yet to take shape. While highlighting that more needs to be done by the government to address the cost-push pressure on commodities, including oil, the report indicated that there was no demand pressure on prices. “Even with a 9.5% GDP growth in 2021-22, there will be substantial slack in the economy and demand pressures may take some more time to become evident,” the report said. With many states lifting restrictions in recent weeks, the report expects Google and Apple mobility indicators to surpass their levels recorded at this time last year. “Electricity generation readings, too, have recovered to levels comparable to the pre-pandemic year, i.e., 2019,” it said. The report said that in India divergent expectations (on inflation) are yet to peak. “Inflation ruled above the tolerance band during June-November 2020 and has again moved above the upper tolerance threshold in May and June 2021. The sense is that inflation will persist at these elevated levels for some months before easing in the third quarter of 2021-22 when the Kharif harvest arrives in markets,” the report said. By reiterating that inflation is transitory and pointing out that there is the absence of demand, the report appears to assuage markets that rate hikes are unlikely despite some analysts turning bearish on government bonds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-near-term-prospects-for-eco-brighter/articleshow/84456938.cms||---

Paras, who is the national president of his faction and LJP parliamentary party leader in the Lok Sabha, named his another nephew and Samastipur MP Prince Raj as the party's Bihar unit president. Incidentally, Chirag had held a virtual meeting with his state presidents in Delhi on Tuesday and Wednesday. Chirag is locked in a legal battle with uncle Paras over the party's supremacy. Besides Prince, Paras nominated Vikas Ranjan alias Pappu Singh and Lalit Kumar Choudhary as the party presidents in Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, respectively. Similarly, Ravindra Garud has been named the head of Maharashtra unit and Rupamkar of Tripura, Birendra Kumar Baing of Odisha and Amit Naresh Rathi of Dadar Nagar Haveli and Daman Diu, respectively. LJP (Paras faction) spokesperson Shravan Kumar Agarwal said the party chiefs in other states will be named soon. "The exercise is aimed at strengthening the party and fulfilling the dreams of LJP founder late Ram Vilas Paswan," he added. Meanwhile, Chirag will visit Araria, Katihar and Purnia districts from July 16 to 18 before beginning the second phase of the yatra. State president of Chirag faction, Raju Tiwari, said preparations for the last leg of the first phase of the yatra were on Tuesday.

The board has asked the schools to follow the marking or assessment policy formulated by it. The circular said upon analysis post uploading of marks by the schools, it observed that some schools have not done the same and bunched the marks in upper brackets of given reference range — instead of distributing theory marks in 70-80 range, marks have been bunched in 77-80 range. “This is unfair to the few actually deserving candidates, whose performance will fall in this range of marks,” it said. The CBSE has sent the list of schools with higher marks exceeding historical performance. These schools include St Michael’s High School, Delhi Public School, Notre Dame Academy, Loyola High School, St Karen’s High School, St Dominic Savio’s High School and different branches of DAV Public Schools. The officials of most of these schools claimed that the board has raised objections to allotting higher marks to the top scorers and they have to reshuffle the marks of all students to avoid injustice to the deserving candidates. Rajiv Ranjan Sinha, city coordinator of the CBSE and principal of Baldwin Academy, said his school name was not in the list as they have followed the marking pattern. He said as per the CBSE guideline, candidates who have been awarded 96 and more marks should be reviewed and revised. Glenda Galstaun, principal of St Dominic Savio’s High School, said the format is called ‘historical report of the last three years’ and, accordingly, the marks were submitted. “So, we have resubmitted the previous report only because there was no child to whom we have given extra marks. Only 2-3 students got 96 marks in some subjects. Otherwise , we have not made much changes,” she said. Gyan Niketan Boy’s School vice-principal Shailendra Mohan Jha said they received the letter from the board on Tuesday evening and uploaded the revised marks on Wednesday. “As per our data update, around 10-15% students out of 408 in class X were getting marks above 95, including theory and practical. We revised the marks and sent them again,” he said. Sharat Kumar Singh, principal of Litera Valley School, said the pattern given by the board has been followed by the school and moderation body. “Most of the schools in Bihar have not taken the internal assessment. We have the documentary evidences to show that the marks are not inflated,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cbse-redo-moderation-of-class-x-marks/articleshow/84451096.cms||Faryal Rumi

At a meeting of West Bengal Heritage Commission on Thursday, a decision was taken to explore options of resuming the auditorium that was once the hub of Bengal’s commercial theatre. The commission has also decided to meet the chairman of iLead Foundation, who has sent in a proposal to renovate or restore Canning House and maintain it on a sustainable basis by converting it into a heritage hotel and a museum. On Wednesday, theatre personality Debesh Chattopadhyay requested the commission to consider giving Sarkarina the importance of a heritage building. In 2003, Chattopadhyay and Suman Mukhopadhyay had personally wanted to take this theatre on lease to stage their experimental productions. However, things hadn’t worked out. “It pains me to see the dilapidated condition of the theatre after the demise of the original owner, Amar Ghosh. The work done by the commission to save cinematographer Subrata Mitra’s residence is commendable. Without the intervention of the commission, I fear this unique auditorium might soon be demolished and turned into a shopping mall or residential complex,” he said, adding that this theatre once saw the likes of Rabi Ghosh, Supriya Devi, Sumitra Mukherjee, Haradhan Banerjee, Sabitri Chatterjee and Miss Shefali performing regularly. “Built in 1976, Sarkarina is the only revolving arena theatre in Asia where the platform moves up and down. Ghosh started theatre with ‘Tushar Jug Asche’. Productions like ‘Raat Bhor Brishti’, ‘Rangini’ and ‘Samrat O Sundari’ were super hits there. The theatre still has the infrastructure to support contemporary experimental plays and should be saved,” Chattopadhyay said. At Thursday’s meeting, it was decided that a commission member will trace the current owner. “We want to do our bit to save this theatre and explore all options of restarting operations,” said commission chairperson Shuvaprasanna. According to him, chairman of iLead Foundation Pradip Chopra will be asked to send in a proposal about what he proposes to do regarding Canning House. “There will be no problems from the government to start this work,” he said. Chopra had recently sent a letter to the commission with the offer to restore the building. "In 2018, I was actively involved in a collective effort to refurbish Prince Dwarkanath Tagore’s tomb at London’s Kensal Green cemetery by installing his bust. If nothing is done to repair Canning House, another remnant of West Bengal’s glorious past will disappear without leaving any trace of the historical value of the place. The restoration will put it on the map of must-visit places,” Chopra said. Built by then governor general of India Lord Canning in 1853 on the bank of Bidyadhari river, the double-storey house was constructed as part of a plan to build a port on Matla river. Lord Canning had wanted to build a port that would be an alternative to Kolkata and a rival to Singapore. According to the official website of the commission, Lord Canning had stayed there several times during the construction of the port. The plan was abandoned due to the loss of navigability of the Matla and Bidyadhari. “I have expertise as a realtor and an academician. Some eight-nine years ago, I have been involved in the restoration of Sir NN Sircar’s house on Elgin Road among others. He was the advocate-general of Bengal and the father of BN Sircar who was the founder of New Theatres. At Canning House, we want to explore how the property can be utilized as part-museum and part-hotel. At our institute, we have introduced a heritage hospitality course and have restoration programmes. Our students will benefit from this endeavour,” Chopra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-heritage-panel-eyes-restoration-of-iconic-sarkarina-theatre-canning-house/articleshow/84453670.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

For 20 months between January 2019 and October 2020, the sovereign investor from Singapore was dormant with no investments, new or follow on. However, since October last year, when it signed a $100 million cheque for Razor Pay, it has been galloping ahead. And in the past 90 days five investments, of which three new and two follow on have been concluded. Investors in the Indian space are broadly three categories viz., opportunistic, PE and strategic. GIC was donning the role of a strategic investor in Indian space, but has now changed its track and looking at the PE investment space too. “GIC has suddenly become active in the investment space. Earlier their bets were more strategic (for example: investing in Bharti Airtel was to help SingTel come into partnership with Bharti), but now they are making financial investments like a PE investor,” said Arun Natarajan, chief executive officer (CEO) of Venture Intelligence, a firm that tracks VC/PE activity. Indian PE veteran Temasek too on its part has sharpened its focus on Indian investments. For instance, over the past three years Temasek has backed 17 companies, of which six were signed over the past 90 days and within which four were new and two follow on. “Normally the roles of investment appeared defined between Temasek and GIC, without any overlap of roles on investments, not anymore,” Natarajan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/singapores-gic-makes-a-strong-comeback-into-desi-startup-market/articleshow/84454474.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli

The court was hearing the bail petition of Duraimurugan Pandiyan Saattai alias Duraimurugan, a resident of Trichy district who runs a YouTube channel named ‘Saattai’. Based on a complaint by a DMK functionary, the Thiruppanandhal police had registered a case against the petitioner and arrested him on June 16. In his petition, the petitioner stated that the case was registered against him due to political vendetta. He said he was the sole breadwinner of his family and had to take care of them. He further stated that his son is presently suffering from illness. Duraimurugan stated that the investigation in the case was already completed and he is in judicial custody for more than 30 days and that both his bail applications were dismissed by the Thanjavur sessions court. He further stated that there was no possibility of tampering with the evidence as it is an electronic evidence which is a YouTube video. Stating that he would abide by any condition imposed by the court, the petitioner sought bail.

The groom was shocked after he came to know about his would-be-bride’s decision wherein she refused to marry him citing his dark complexion and not handsome enough for her at the marriage ceremony in Sarpalpur village of the district on Wednesday night. “As soon as the to-be groom, a native of Gursahaiganj area of Kannauj was apprised that the woman had refused to marry him, he alerted local police, who approached the bride’s family members asking them to convince her, but the woman refused to budge saying that she would not at all marry a dark complexioned man,” Kotwali police station incharge Acchey Lal Pal said. According to police officials, the bride even happily took part in the ‘jaimaal’ ceremony, but later she went inside her house and told her family members and friends that she will not marry because of the groom’s dark complexion. Later, the parents of the groom approached the police for help. “We told them to give a complaint in writing, but they refused and returned empty-handed to their native place with the ‘baraatis’,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/woman-refuses-to-marry-dark-complexioned-groom/articleshow/84452018.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

At a function organised at the college, principal Dr Davamani Christober said they would be honoured to have Sankaraiah as their student even now as he had not completed his final examination due to his arrest for participating in the anti-British agitation 15 days ahead of his final BA examination. He had joined the college in 1937 for BA history. Sankaraiah had recalled how American College, with its predominantly Tamil teaching faculty, provided a conducive atmosphere for students who wanted to participate in the freedom struggle. Sankaraiah was the first secretary of Madurai Student Movement which instilled in students the fire to seek freedom. Subash Chandrabose and Rajaji were among the leaders who addressed students at the behest of Sankaraiah. Food and civil supplies minister R Sakkarapani, an alumnus of the college, who was present at the institute for the celebrations, said he was honoured to know that Sankaraiah had been a student of his alma mater. Madurai MP Su Venkatesan said the fact that an institution was proudly celebrating the birthday of one of its students points to his exemplary and honest political career. American College, especially its Tamil department, had produced outstanding leaders who participated in the freedom struggle. Venkatesan said every Tamil-speaking person should read Sankaraiah’s speech in the Tamil Nadu Assembly when Anna was CM, during the resolution on the two-language policy in the state. Former MLA N Nanmaran also recalled his experiences with the leader. Meanwhile, CPM hoisted the party flag at 100 places in the city and distributed sweets to the public to celebrate the veteran leader’s birthday. A hundred members of DYFI presented a silambam performance and SFI organised blood donation camps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/american-college-hosts-centenary-celebration-of-ex-student-sankaraiah/articleshow/84456343.cms||---

Starting with two CTU buses, the department on Day One covered Dadumajra and Sector 17. UT adviser Dharam Pal has already set a target for the department of covering all 7.12 lakh beneficiaries by August 15. The two buses with a medical team first visited Dadumajra. These were stationed at a spot and the area people were vaccinated with the help of locals. As people queued up, the authorities made sitting arrangements outside the buses. The medical team counselled those who were not jabbed and took them to the CTU buses or nearby dispensaries for inoculation. Later, a bus was sent to Sector 17, where the local traders and the health department team had made arrangements for vaccination of those working in shops. A UT health department official said, “On the first day, Thursday, 442 beneficiaries were vaccinated in Dadumajra. Of them, 393 received the first dose. Of eight people with disabilities, four, who were bed-ridden, were inoculated at their homes. Also, 40 elderly people were offered pick-anddrop service. In the coming days, we will cover other colonies and villages.” The department claimed that 71% of the eligible Chandigarh residents have received one dose so far and 17% are fully vaccinated. The UT adviser said instructions have been issued to cover eligible beneficiaries by August 15. The administration has already engaged different organisations, RWAs, religious groups, traders and industrial bodies to encourage people to come forward for vaccination. The UT is also planning to make at least one dose of vaccination mandatory for certain government services. However, the final decision will be taken soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-turns-ctu-buses-into-mobile-vaccination-units/articleshow/84453890.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Patna||Transporters demand hike in bus fare||PATNA: Residents may feel the pinch as the transportation cost in Bihar is likely to go up. The Bihar Motor Transport Federation (BMTF), an apex body of private transporters, sought a revision in private bus fare from the state government amid the rising fuel prices. The bus fare was last revised in October 2018, when the diesel price was around Rs79 per litre. Several private bus operators would hold meetings in Patna and Begusarari, respectively, on July 16 and 18 to discuss the demands made by them, including a fare hike, for the survival of the private passenger transport business. Uday Shankar Prasad Singh, president of BMTF, told this newspaper on Thursday that the continuous hike in diesel prices and low footfall in buses due to Covid-19 have caused financial crisis to many private bus operators. On behalf of private bus operators, he wrote letters to CM Nitish Kumar, the chief secretary and the transport department to draw their attention towards the issue. “At present, the rate of diesel is around Rs97 per litre and orders have been given to carry only 50% percent passengers to the seating capacity during the Covid-19 period. The toll tax, insurance and fitness charge has been increased while the road tax has also goes up by 10% every year. Permit fee has also been increased 10 times. At the same time, the cost of vehicles and its spare parts and maintenance charges have also increased tremendously. Several bus operators are out of business while many are facing losses,” Singh said. He added: “If the state government will not pay heed to our demand of rise in bus fare, we would go off road in protest.” State transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said a committee has been formed and the process has started considering the hike in diesel prices and other cost and soon they are going to take suitable decision. “The committee will analyse all the facts and take public opinion as well, before taking the final decision about rise in bus fare,” he told this newspaper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/transporters-demand-hike-in-bus-fare/articleshow/84452489.cms||Faryal Rumi

According to reports, the man had tried to stop the fight between his two sons and their friends, but lost his temper and opened fire from his licenced single barrel gun. Police on being informed rushed to the spot and recovered the gun and arrested the accused and his two sons. Triyogi Naraian alias Rakesh, a resident of Ratanpur Colony, was a security guard in a private company a few years ago. About 22 years ago, he had taken a license for a single barrel gun. He has two sons, Sonu and Monu, who work as labourers in the area. According to the police, Sonu had a close friendship with his 25-year-old painter Dharmendra Pal, a resident of the same area. On Wednesday night, Dharmendra was sitting at a shop in the area, when Monu reached there in an inebriated state. Later, Monu entered into an altercation with Dharmendra over some issue following which the latter started thrashing him. When Monu’s brother Sonu came to save him, Dharmendra assaulted him too. On coming across the commotion, Monu and Sonu’s father Triyogi Narayan rushed to the spot and tried to pacify the fight between sons and their friend Dharmendra. However, later when Dharmendra resorted to brick-batting on Triyogi’s house, he brought his licenced gun and opened fire on Dharmendra. The bullet hit Dharmendra’s neck and he collapsed. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where the doctor declared him dead. The police on being alerted reached the spot and took the accused man and his two sons into custody and seized the firearm after recovering it from his house. Police shifted the body to the mortuary. “An FIR has been lodged under relevant sections of IPC and investigations are continuing,” said DCP West Sanjiv Tyagi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/man-shoots-sons-friend-in-panki/articleshow/84451999.cms||---

However, the minister said she was only aware of the explanation the university authorities have given to her. “I’m not aware of any violation of university statute. If there is any such case, I would look into it,” the minister said on Thursday while replying to questions about allegations that the new lexicon editor was appointed in contravention of the university rules. A Sanskrit teacher with Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Poornima is the wife of R Mohananan, a former IRS officer currently working as the officer on special duty at the chief minister’s office. The minister said Poornima’s appointment must be seen only as a stopgap arrangement as the university is taking steps to appoint a full-time editor with all prescribed qualifications. The university authorities have claimed that the decision to use the service of a multi-lingual scholar was taken on the basis of the recommendations of the selection committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/minister-justifies-lexicon-editors-appointment/articleshow/84456482.cms||---

Fake gold biscuits have been recovered from the two — Gulzar Ahmed alias Patel (44) and Deepak Shinde (33) — said officials of the crime branch of the city police. The duo have been booked for forgery. The jeweller, Bharat Singh Rao, had lodged a complaint that some people were trying to cheat him. Rao, who supplies gold jewellery to stores in Zaveri Bazar, told the police that while he was in the jewellery market in south Mumbai Gulzar approached and offered him 100 gold biscuits for Rs 30,000 although their current price would be way higher. Gulzar’s companion, Shinde, showed an original gold biscuit. While Rao ensured it was pure, he suspected it could be part of a booty and informed the police. When Shinde arrived with the gold biscuits in Dahisar, he signalled to a police team that lay in wait. Shinde was held with 20 fake biscuits, said the police. Shinde led the cops to Gulzar. —S Ahmed Ali||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-offer-to-sell-gold-to-jeweller-arrested/articleshow/84458720.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Goa||Only 79% vaccinated as Goa’s own deadline is 15 days away||PANAJI: With fifteen days to go for the state to achieve its target of partially vaccinating its entire population, it has over 2.5 lakh unvaccinated persons. The state government will have to vaccinate 16,000-odd persons each day in order to meet the target it set for itself. As on date 79% of the eligible population of 11.94 lakh, has taken at least one dose of the vaccine. Only 16.2 % is fully vaccinated and 62.7% partially vaccinated (only one dose). Persons who tested positive during the initial days of the second wave have begun visiting vaccination centres to take their jabs. Several others who got infected in May and June are yet to complete the mandatory 84 days before they can get their jab. State immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar said that there remain no pockets of unvaccinated persons in the state. “Overall everybody is getting vaccinated, but if they had to come with more fervour, we would be happy. It’s voluntary, we cannot enforce it from the government’s side. If each institution takes the onus and gets their staff vaccinated, it will be wise, because the government as a rule cannot enforce it,” he said. Around 20 pregnant women have taken the jab. “They are coming in increasing numbers, but the numbers are not up to our satisfaction,” he says. The directorate of health services recently stated that 0.3% of the mortalities in the devastating second wave for whom information was available, were vaccinated, where majority were not. Panchayats were involved belatedly in the exercise of ensuring their population and several booth level officers (BLOs) have now been put on election duty. Door to door vaccination has been carried out in few areas with some health centres offering drive through vaccination which has benefited senior citizens and persons with disability. The state government submitted to the high court that it would see how to proceed with door to door vaccination following which the state’s expert committee headed by GMC dean and Covid hospitals in-charge Dr S Bandekar at the committee’s fourth meeting on July 2 recommended house to house vaccination for bed-ridden persons and those genuinely physically unable to report to vaccination centres provided there were no documented listed contra-indications and in accordance with ministry of health’s guidelines. The persons must be observed for any adverse effects following immunisation post vaccination for 30 minutes, the committee recommended and suggested that the government involve BLOs and health officers to ensure logistics and avoid vaccine wastage. When asked about the progress, Dr Borkar said the ministry of health is yet to give a full go ahead for door to door vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/only-79-vaccinated-as-states-own-deadline-is-15-days-away/articleshow/84458141.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Eyebrows raised as Akola collector, municipal commissioner swap places in reshuffle||NAGPUR: In a unique reshuffle of IAS officials, the state government has transferred Akola city’s municipal commissioner Nima Arora as Akola district collector while the collector, Jitendra Papalkar, to the post of municipal commissioner. The transfer orders, issued by the state government on Tuesday night, have invited controversy. While Arora took charge from Papalkar on Thursday, the latter is yet to take the charge as commissioner. Sources said that being a senior, it’s unlikely Papalkar will take charge as commissioner of a grade C municipal corporation after working as district collector of the same district for more than two years now. It is for the first time that such swap of senior IAS officials has happened. Arora was appointed as Akola municipal commissioner in February 2021. Her transfer was not expected in just five months. Papalkar is an IAS officer of the 2010 batch while Arora is from the 2014 batch. Being in-charge of the whole district, Papalkar had more administrative powers than Arora. Considering the issue of seniority in the cadre, people in the administrative circles in Akola were wondering how Papalkar was appointed as the municipal commissioner. Sources said that Arora had invited ire of some local politicians as she was working aggressively against encroachments in the city. She was transferred under political pressure. But as Papalkar is yet to take the charge, Arora is now shouldering both the responsibilities, as municipal commissioner and district collector. In Amravati, 2014 batch IAS officer Pawaneet Kaur on Thursday took charge as collector from Shailesh Naval, who has been shifted as deputy secretary to Mantralaya. Later, addressing the media, the new collector said that vaccination drive, rehabilitation issues and arresting malnutrition would be her priorities. Kaur has worked as project officer and assistant collector at Jawhar in Palghar district, CEO of Aurangabad ZP, commissioner of Tribal Research and Training Institute and Women and Child Development in Pune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/eyebrows-raised-as-akola-collector-mpl-commr-swap-places-in-reshuffle/articleshow/84448728.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Kolkata||Tomorrow, West Bengal on test as 92,000 students write first physical exam after second wave||KOLKATA: West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination (WBJEE), to be held on Saturday, will be the first physical public exam in the state ever since the second wave of the pandemic struck. More than 92,000 candidates will appear for the tests—scheduled in two halves—at 274 centres. Several safety measures are being implemented to ensure no candidate or invigilator contracts the novel coronavirus. Candidates have to reach the exam centres half-an-hour before the beginning of the tests and their temperature will be checked with thermal guns before they are allowed entry. If any examinee is found to run a temperature, he or she will be asked to sit for the tests in a separate room. All candidates have to carry their own water bottles. Candidates will not be allowed to leave exam centres before the entire exam gets over. WBJEE teams have already inspected the centres to check whether they had spacious halls and classrooms or not to allow the candidates to sit apart. In classrooms that can accommodate 50 students, 20-25 candidates will sit. The number of exam centres has been increased as the numbers of candidates allowed at some of the centres has been halved. Jadavpur University will host 200 candidates, against the earlier count of 500-plus. Jadavpur Vidyapith School, one of the largest centres, will have 450 candidates. The first phase of sanitisation of the centres has been completed, and another round will be carried out on the eve of the tests. “We are ready for the exam that will be held in multiple rooms that have been sanitised. We are following all safety measures,” said Jadavpur University VC Suranjan Das. Principal of Jadavpur Vidyapith Parimal Bhattacharya himself inspected the sanitisation process on Thursday and will repeat it on Friday. Candidates were happy that the WBJEE Board has requested the state transport department to run special buses for them. “Otherwise I would have had to book an auto from my home to the Barrackpore centre,” said Ritam Dey, a student at St Augustine’s Shyamnagar. Abhishek Basu, a student at DPS Ruby Park, will travel from Bhowanipore to JU by the family car. “Many of us who are sharing our vehicles with our friends. Many are sharing hired cars,” he said. STUs, like West Bengal State Transport Corporation, South Bengal State Transport Corporation and North Bengal State Transport Corporation, will run special bus services to ferry JEE candidates. The services will be available from 8am till 8pm. “In the absence of suburban trains, students will be dependent on buses. So we will run a substantial number of buses to meet the demand. The number of buses will be increased or decreased depending on the demands. A full-scale control room will operate,” said a transport department officer. Even private bus operators will run some buses. “We will try to ply some buses to ferry examinees. We have got in touch with police and JEE Board for exam centre locations,” said Titu Saha of City Suburban Bus Service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tomorrow-state-on-test-as-92k-students-write-1st-physical-exam-after-2nd-wave/articleshow/84453915.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: Keeladi inhabitants were skilled in hair styling||MADURAI: A figurine depicting a woman’s face with elaborate hairdo has been unearthed at Agaram, one of the villages in the Keeladi cluster, suggesting that the people who inhabited Keeladi 2,600 years ago dressed aesthetically. The archaeologists also unearthed another ring well, in addition to the one that they had unearthed on July 5, with a double rope design at a depth of 411cm. It has a decoration ring, 3cm thick and diameter of 58cm, on top with thumb pressed and incised dotted designs. The Tamil Nadu State Archaeology Department under the guidance of deputy director of archaeology R Sivanantham is conducting the seventh phase of excavation at Keeladi in Sivaganga district, and the second phase is underway in neighbouring villages Agaram, Konthagai and Manalur which are said to be the Keeladi cluster. Figurines that have emerged in this site have proven that the Keeladi civilization had a lot of aesthetic sense in their designing of pottery, sculptures and even toys, including intricately designed terracotta dices. In the first phase of excavation, a figurine unearthed by the ASI showed the face of an aged woman with sagging cheeks, which had been done in detail. The latest figurine was unearthed at a depth of 60cm, measures 2.9cm x 4.7cm x 2.6cm and is modelled using terracotta. It has bulging eyes, a prominent nose and parted lips. The headgear is beautifully portrayed with elongated ear ornaments. There are also ornaments on the forehead and a huge hair-bun resting on the left side of the head. It is painted with red slip on all sides. Minister for archaeology Thangam Thennarasu took to social media to say that the Tamil woman who had emerged after 2000 years shows that the people of the period were well-versed in the art of hairstyling. Sivanantham said that the key findings in this season at Keeladi, which began on Feb 13, are play things such as dice, gamesman, hop-scotches, weaver’s tool such as a spindle whorl and simple ornamentations such as terracotta and glass bead. There are also ear ornaments and bangles made of shell. More lavish ornaments like semi-precious stone beads and a golden wire were also found.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/keeladi-inhabitants-were-skilled-in-hair-styling/articleshow/84456392.cms||---

A total of 5 lakh sq m of GIDC land, which had been allotted to SEZ promoters is up for auction with the government planning to sell the land by e-auction process. The land is part of the 38 lakh sq mt of SEZ land in possession of the GIDC. “We will be writing to NIC shortly asking to go ahead with the e-auction,” said the GIDC official. Unable to identify a consultant to auction the land repossessed from SEZ promoters through an RFP, GIDC has decided to try and auction at least 5 lakh sq mt of industrial land at Verna through an e-auction platform. In March, TOI had reported that GIDC had moved a proposal to the state government to e-auction 5 lakh sq mt of land through the e-auction platforms of NIC or a public sector bank. The five-member committee that had been appointed to select a consultant for marketing the SEZ land has now been tasked with overseeing the e-auction. GIDC officials said the government-run corporation does not have the capability to conduct an e-auction and get the best value out of the land holdings. GIDC is paying a steep monthly instalment of close to Rs 4 cr to repay the Rs 200 crore short term loan taken from the Oriental Bank of Commerce. It took the loan in May 2019 to pay back the SEZ promoters and reacquire to 38.4 lakh sq mt as part of an out of court settlement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/national-level-team-to-formalise-sez-e-auction-process/articleshow/84458762.cms||---

There are 300 shops on the AMC premises including 104 in the flower market. A few hundred kilograms of waste generated from these shops, which is a mix of bio-degradable and non-biodegradable including plastic waste, had piled up for weeks together. Market-goers say while the stink emanating from the pile is unbearable, it also facilitates mosquito breeding. The market has been witnessing huge crowds of late, resulting in good sales and thereby generating more garbage. G Sethuraman, a resident of Bibikulam, said, “The stink from the garbage is terrible, especially after a rain. There is lot of thermocol and plastic bag waste mixed with the flower waste. The rain water stagnates and provides a fertile ground for dengue-spreading mosquitoes to breed. Officials should take measures to clear it immediately,” he said. S Ramachandran, president of flower market, said they have informed the civic authorities to clear the waste. They would clear it once in a while, but this time they delayed the work. He said the market also lacks clean toilet and drinking water facilities. However, an official of Madurai corporation said it is the responsibility of the agriculture marketing committee to dispose of the waste since they come under the bulk waste generators category. Though they installed an on-site composting centre, they were not using it. They have every resource to do it since they collect rent from the shops. “We were clearing the waste once in a while based on a promise that they would soon resume on-site composting, but they never resumed it,” the official said. An official from agricultural marketing said a private person voluntarily set up the on-site composting facility, but it is not viable for them as they could not market the manure. Moreover, with the market closed due to the pandemic, they had to stop it. The official said they are planning to meet Madurai corporation commissioner with a request to take care of the waste. “Madurai corporation is receiving tax from individual shops. The civic body can consider the shops as individual entities and take up the responsibility of clearing the garbage,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-corpn-amc-pass-buck-as-garbage-piles-up-in-flower-market/articleshow/84456425.cms||V Devanathan
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: BJP turns table on AIMIM, Congress, independent alliance||VADODARA: BJP turned the tables on the alliance of AIMIM, Congress and independent corporators in the Godhra municipality on Thursday. Municipality president and independent Corporator Sanjay Soni deserted the alliance and joined the BJP. The civic polls in Godhra have been dominated by independents and the BJP has had to rely on them to form a majority despite winning a large number of seats. The Asaduddin Owaisi-led All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) that had entered the poll fray for the first time, along with independents, did not allow the saffron party to come to power this time around. In the 44-member municipality, BJP had won on 18 seats, AIMIM bagged seven and Congress got one seat. The remaining 18 seats went to independents. BJP was looking to form a majority with the support of independents, but that did not happen and AIMIM, Congress and 17 independent corporators came together to form an alliance. The group got the majority and Soni was elected as the president. However, earlier this month, things started boiling again when chairpersons of various committees of the municipality were to be appointed. The ruling group decided to postpone the meeting as a mark of respect to late actor Dilip Kumar. The BJP argued that tribute could have been paid in the meeting itself and work could have continued. The BJP members held the meeting and three independents supported the move. It is believed that the real reason for the postponement of the meeting was squabbling amongst the members of the ruling alliance. There were many claimants for various key posts. Sources said that Soni was frustrated with the state of affairs and decided to join the BJP. “I decided to stay away from controversies and joined the BJP,” he said. Soni added that he believed that with the town needed development and he could contribute to it. Soni claimed that some more corporators would join the BJP soon. AIMIM corporator and one of the key members of the party since its inception in the town, Hanif Kalandar, said that he came to know about Soni’s joining BJP only on Thursday. “I have been hospitalised since five days,” he said. The candidates from the minority community prefer contesting as independents in Godhra. In wards dominated by the community, BJP does not put up candidates on its symbol. Congress too contests on a limited number of seats. AIMIM had contested the polls for the first time in the town on eight seats and won seven of them. The BJP already had the support of 21 corporators when it held the meeting to appoint chairpersons of the committees of the municipality. With Soni, it has reached the half-way mark. If Soni can keep his commitment of bringing more corporators, the BJP will return to power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/bjp-turns-table-on-aimim-cong-independent-alliance/articleshow/84453920.cms||---

Police said the four have confessed to the murder of Kannan at Pandarakulam on Monday which they claimed to be in retaliation for the killing of Muthu Mano, 27, inside the prison. Kannan, 33, from Thazhaiyuthu was a relative of Jacob, one of the seven held in connection with Mano’s daring murder in the jail on April 22. Police said that Tirunelveli superintendent of police N Manivannan, who visited the murder spot, formed special teams under the rural deputy superintendent of police Archana. A team led by Thazhaiyuthu police inspector Padmanaba Pillai arrested the accused P Nalladurai, 22, M Sangiliboothathan, 20, V Gurusachin, 22, all from Vaigaikulam, and M Venkatesh, 22, from Melapalayam. They were produced before a judicial magistrate who sent them to prison. It may be recalled that following Mano’s murder, his father Paavanasam had moved the high court seeking CB-CID probe into the death, and refused to receive the body from the hospital. He filed a second petition before HC seeking a judicial inquiry by a sitting judge, a compensation of Rs 2 crore and inclusion of prison officials as accused in the case. It was only after 71 days that he received the body, that too after the court issued an ultimatum in this regard. Subsequently, on July 5, the bench sought response from the state on the progress of CB-CID investigation in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/four-held-for-killing-man-say-they-avenged-murder-in-jail/articleshow/84456438.cms||---
---||Goa||Will coordinate with Kerala, Mizoram to develop tourism in state: Goa governor||PANAJI: Goa governor P S Sreedharan Pillai said he would push for development of tourism in the state and would coordinate with Kerala and Mizoram to give a boost to the industry. “Goa, Kerala and Mizoram, from where I am coming, all three states are topmost in the field of tourism and I can coordinate between them. I have already spoken to Kerala chief minister (Pinarayi Vijayan) about it and Mizoram has a good opinion about me. We will be able to do a lot of developments in Goa,” Pillai, who was sworn in as the governor on Thursday, said. Goa got a full-time governor after nearly a year since Satya Pal Malik was transferred to Meghalaya. Pillai was the Mizoram governor before his transfer to Goa. “Goa is among the finest states in India and a fast-growing one. There is communal harmony in the state and culturally, too, Goa is in the forefront in south India. I will sincerely work for the development of the state,” he said. Pillai said the entire country could study many things from the history and the unity of the people of Goa. “It is an exceptionally important state,” he said. However, he refrained from answering any questions on whether he would be vocal like his predecessor Malik on various agitations going on in the state. “For the time being, silence is golden,” he said. Pillai also refused to be drawn into his role ahead of the assembly elections scheduled for early next years. “As per the Constitution, a governor is bound to take decisions on the basis of cabinet decisions, and I will strictly follow the Constitution,” he said. Chief minister Pramod Sawant said the new governor would be able to give guidance on various issues. “As the state has got a full-time governor after a long time, a lot of things will be put on fast-track, like passing of acts,” he said. Pillai was administered the oath of office and secrecy by Bombay high court chief justice Dipankar Datta at a simple ceremony at Raj Bhavan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-coordinate-with-kerala-mizoram-to-develop-tourism-in-state-goa-guv/articleshow/84458822.cms||---

Madurai district was allotted very few doses in the last two weeks and most of the vaccinations were carried out in special camps in specific places. From Monday, the government facilities received about 500 doses each. On Thursday, there were steady queues in front of the UPHCs right from 6am. Malarvizhi from Anna Nagar said that she had received a token and came early since she did not want to miss it. Most of the people who had come on Thursday said that reports on vaccine shortage was a matter of concern and they wanted to ensure that they got themselves and their families vaccinated when they were available. Those standing in the queue were prioritized after 10am and the staff at the PHCs only allowed people who were in the vulnerable category, and those above 18 years only if they were pregnant, lactating mothers or had other health issues. Minister for Commercial Taxes P Moorthy inaugurated a camp in Iyer Bungalow in Madurai East block of his constituency where he said that they aimed to vaccinate the entire population in a phased manner. “The stringent measures taken by the government had ensured that the number of cases had come down from 1,500 per day to 35 now, and the prevention measures continued,” he said. As many as 6,54,073 people have been vaccinated in the district so far and there were 11,120 doses available for public use for Thursday. The PHCs had 9,520 doses on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/long-queues-for-jab-at-phcs-in-madurai/articleshow/84456463.cms||---

Tendulkar donated on Blood Donor’s Day on June 14 to fulfil a commitment. A spokesperson from his company, SRT Sports Management, said one of Tendulkar’s relatives had a difficult time organising blood before a major surgery a few months back. “Having eventually managed to arrange for blood, Tendulkar wanted to reciprocate and be of help to someone in need, by voluntarily donating blood and inspiring others to do so too,” said the spokesperson. However, Tendulkar was diagnosed with Covid-19 soon thereafter and couldn’t donate blood immediately. His office kept in touch with NGO Think Foundation, which works for thalassaemic children, to organise the drive. “It was finally held on June 14 and we were happy to realise he had motivated his team to donate alongside,” said Think Foundation’s Vinay Shetty. A mobile blood donation van which could accommodate Tendulkar and his team members was the venue for the donation. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-tendulkar-sets-an-example-with-blood-donation-camp/articleshow/84456515.cms||---

---||Pune||50% of Covid tests now RT-PCR across Maharashtra||PUNE: An average of 49.4% of all Covid tests are now being carried out via RT-PCR in Maharashtra, more than 20 days after the state decided to rely solely on RT-PCR testing to decide weekly positivity rates of districts. State officials said the RT-PCR share went up after existing labs were asked to do more tests — by working in three shifts. Officials also deployed more vans to transport samples from rural parts to city centres. “With over 250 RT-PCR-capable labs, the state never had a shortage of capacity. Earlier, there was a dip in testing at these labs,” a health official said. Last month, only 41% of tests were RT-PCR, as most districts deployed rapid antigen tests. After the order to have more RT-PCR tests was passed by the state government in mid-June, testing levels improved to 43%, 44% and finally, to 49% this week. “The districts that were lagging behind are also now improving their RT-PCR share,” the state official said. The official added that the aim is to have more accurate Covid-19 surveillance across the state. “We are not asking local authorities to completely avoid RATs as they have their uses. But RT-PCR tests are more reliable when deciding the weekly positivity rate,” he said. This week, according to data from July 8 to July 14, districts such as Parbhani (85%), Yavatmal (81%), Nagpur (81%), Kolhapur (75%), Gondia (78%) continued to have a better share of RT-PCR tests. Lab personnel said the pressure on them has eased due to the fall in Covid cases. “But if cases rise, it will become difficult again to have more RT-PCR tests,” a lab official said. RT-PCR tests produce much more accurate results than rapid test kits. In early June, an analysis of negative RAT tests that came positive when retested with RT-PCR revealed that the rapid tests had missed up to 33.7% of Covid cases. The study was based on field tests in Mumbai. At the time, more than 60% of the daily Covid-19 testing in Maharashtra was being done using RATs, preferred by citizens and government for ease of use and shorter turnaround time. Public health experts have said that over-reliance on RATs — while testing large population groups can results in surveillance gaps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/50-of-tests-now-rt-pcr-across-maharashtra/articleshow/84456509.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The incident occurred at 11.30pm when the passengers were waiting at Mayur Vihar Phase-I station of Pink Line (Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar). While the trains coming from Hazrat Nizamuddin station from the other side usually go up to Mayur Vihar Pocket-1, they are now terminating at Mayur Vihar Phase-I due to ongoing work of connecting these stations with Trilokpuri. The passengers boarded the train that was not going towards south Delhi and instead destined to be “stabled” or parked. What is unusual is that the train, which had already completed the last journey, moved ahead with passengers onboard. It was not clear if the mandatory announcements were made inside the train and at the station. Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), Delhi Metro Rail Corporation said, the train was to be stabled at reversal side as per the routine operational requirement, and another train had to come on the platform for the last passenger service. “However, five passengers mistakenly boarded this train and had to be deboarded and brought back to the platform to board the designated last train,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/confusion-forces-metro-commuters-to-get-down-on-track/articleshow/84487238.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Lucknow||Only BSP govt in Uttar Pradesh stood for democracy, people’s welfare: Mayawati||LUCKNOW: Lashing out at BJP for the alleged misuse of muscle and money power and government machinery during the recent panchayat chairperson and block pramukh polls, BSP chief Mayawati has appealed to the people of UP to remember that her’s was the only government which was committed to upholding democracy and welfare of people.  Asking people not to be awayed by fancy promises, she said one should cast vote in the upcoming 2022 UP assembly elections by keeping the above factors in mind. “Against the anti-democratic governments of Congress, Samajwadi Party and BJP, which had no respect for people of processes, BSP is the only party under whose government, welfare of the state and the people was a priority. Democracy was fully respected and every election was held without misusing government machinery. People will have to remember this when casting their vote this time. Do not be swayed by fancy promises, religious feelings and inauguration of projects,” she said. Condemning the violence during the panchayat chairperson and block pramukh elections, the former UP chief minister said crime under the BJP government has grown exponentially, leading to “anarchy and jungle raj in the state”. Comparing the “anarchy” to what she said was also witnessed under the previous SP government, Mayawati said to snatch power through any means possible, the ruling party “misused government and police machinery and depended on muscle and money power, which included incidents of kidnapping, cheating and even misbehaviour with women, and later celebrated its sweep in the elections”. “It is known that panchayat and local body elections in UP are rarely ever, if at all, held fairly. BSP itself has had very bitter experiences. In 1993, when SP and BSP were in alliance, BSP workers had to face violence and they were physically stopped from going to file their nomination. In fact, some were even kidnapped, like a woman worker from Faizabad. This, among other issues, was a reason that BSP broke off the alliance with SP in 1995,” Mayawati said. Saying that the law and order situation in UP is in a mess 365 days of the year, the BSP party chief added that it had become common for poor people, unorganised labourers, farmers, small traders, Dalits, Muslims and backwards to deal with harassment and biases routinely and therefore, anarchy and hooliganism was expected during the panchayat polls. “This is why BSP had decided not to contest the panchayat chairperson and the block pramukh elections, even though BSP’s performance in the panchayat elections where people vote for their representatives, was very good,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/only-bsp-govt-in-up-stood-for-democracy-peoples-welfare-maya/articleshow/84457342.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Lucknow||957 teachers who died on Uttar Pradesh poll duty to get ex gratia||LUCKNOW: Like Kalyani and Ravindra, there were at least 957 teachers among 2020 government employees, who died of Covid-19 within 30 days of being engaged in panchayat poll duty. Their families will now be given the ex gratia of Rs 30 lakh each. According to the revised list released recently by the UP panchayati raj department, at least 761 primary teachers and 180 teachers from secondary education department died of Covid-19 during panchayat poll duty. Before making amendments to the defition of ‘death on duty’, the government had said that only three teachers lost their lives in the line of duty and only their families were eligible for compensation. The figure was in sharp contrast with 1,621 deaths, as claimed by teachers’ union. According to old rules, ex gratia could be given to an employee only in case of death on duty or during travel to and from the place of duty. Deaths occurring within one or two days of duty, depending on the distance travelled by the employee, were factored in for compensation. After the amendments, 3,092 applications were received and 2,020 cases were recommended as eligible for compensation. Among the 2,020 recommendations by district magistrates, over 50% are teachers and other staff members of the education department. A rough calculation by the TOI shows 610 permanent primary teachers, 180 secondary teachers, including principals, and 16 from higher education department (inclusive of principals) lost their lives after contracting Covid infection during panchayat poll duty. The list includes names of 151 shiksha mitras and anudeshaks (instructors), appointed on contractual basis, eight block education officers, two lecturers of the District Institute of Education and Training (DIET), and one district inspector of schools (Ayodhya). Names of 115 non-teaching staff including clerk, peon, accountant, librarian, and steno are also on the list. In addition, three administrative officials from education department who succumbed to Covid-19 while on panchayat poll duty have also been found eligible for compensation. Inclusion of more teachers in the list has brought some relief to the Rashtriya Shaikshik Mahasangh, an RSS affiliate. “According to our list, 1,488 teachers and other staff from basic education department lost their lives. There is some satisfaction that the government showed compassion towards teachers. We will push harder for those who couldn’t make it to the list,” said RSM’s spokesperson Virendra Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/957-teachers-who-died-of-covid-duringpoll-duty-to-get-rs-30l-compensation/articleshow/84457305.cms||Isha Jain

These numbers speak for the wrath caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus through its primary (alpha) and mutated versions over the past one-and-a-half years. The bad news here is that coronavirus is not the last one. Evidences suggest that quadrillion individual viruses exist on earth and more than 200 have been identified to be causing diseases in human beings. Some of the impending pandemics may be caused by Nipah, Ebola, Chikungunya, H5N1 and H7N9, yellow fever, Marburg Virus, Lassa fever, Crimean Congo haemorrahagic fever, hanta virus and so on. Experts across the world are of the view that unless people and health systems evolve, viruses can hope to rule the roost and continue to push the human race to the brink. But what can the governments do? Here are some options Predict diseases While genome sequencing is an effective tool to keep an eye on viruses, a number of predictive tools are being developed to identify hotspots, disease pockets and track the vulnerable population. Governments can use their network of institutions and patronise models that enable disease surveillance. Increase surveillance Governments may make use of health infrastructure and human resources to flag diseases. Screening of population in general for various diseases may be increased in smaller pockets. Develop quick response system The government may think of a central agency that works for all the three: disease surveillance, disease prediction and crisis management. The government may form an expert committee comprising sectorial experts and public representatives to work together. Collaborate with private sector As almost 87% healthcare services are being provided by private sector in the country, it makes it an important ally in this fight. Engage and train small public groups Community can play an important role in disease prevention and also solve a number of problems at the budding stage. Training on general disease management and public health concerns may be made a part of curriculum. It may also be incentivised to encourage people to walk the extra mile in public interest. Legislations to make preventive behaviour mandatory Framing laws that make people follow healthy lifestyle and adhere to health prevention protocols is also a way. While laws that penalise those who flout norms (such as fine for not wearing mask) are already there, incentives like tax benefits and doles for those adhering to it also work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-19-is-not-the-last-pandemic-better-to-be-prepared/articleshow/84457511.cms||---

The SP workers tried to enter the tehsil gate but were stopped by the police. They left after handing over a 16-point memorandum addressed to the President of India, to Sadar Tehsildar. On the instructions of the SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, the party workers led by Sahini reached the Sadar Tehsil gate at noon but were stopped there by police. Some party workers tried to climb the gate. After a huge protest they left after handing over a memorandum. “Democracy was unimaginably murdered during the panchayat polls on July 8 and July 10 in the district which is shameful. We have 16 demands in the memorandum including the roll back of the farm laws, pending payment to sugarcane farmers, bringing back law and order situation on track in the state,” said Sahini.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/sp-workers-protest-against-alleged-rigging-in-panchayat-poll/articleshow/84451633.cms||---

But I will never stake claim,” he said. “It is our culture to work according to the party’s instructions. I don’t have any personal claim (to contest next assembly elections), but I will abide by the party’s decision,” Naik said. tnn Earlier, former Goa chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar had thrown his hat in the ring for the assembly elections scheduled early next year and exuded confidence that BJP wouldn’t deny him a ticket. Goa’s lone BJP Rajya Sabha MP, Vinay Tendulkar, had also said that he wanted to contest the next assembly elections and had even offered to resign as a member of Parliament to do so. Both Tendulkar and Parsekar have put their claims before the party over contesting the next assembly elections. Recently, ports minister Michael Lobo had said his wife Delilah, who is sarpanch of the Parra panchayat, would stake a claim for a BJP ticket either from Saligao or Siolim. With several BJP MLAs lobbying for party tickets for their kin to contest the upcoming assembly polls, state BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade had said, “BJP does not have a tradition to give tickets to four or five persons in a family.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ready-to-return-to-state-if-party-needs-my-services-shripad/articleshow/84458539.cms||---

Both Minaz and Masiruddin have been identified by ATS as operatives of terror outfit Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind, an auxiliary unit of Al-Qaeda. The video clips are suspected to have been sent to the two by Jammu and Kashmir based Tauheed and Moosa. Sources said investigations have revealed that Tauheed had transferred money into the account of Minaz for the purchase of a pistol and material for making explosives. The account is also under the police scanner. “We are probing how and under whose influence the two got radicalized,” said an official privy to the probe. Inspector general of police, ATS, Gajendra Kumar Goswami, who is heading the probe, told TOI that some videos showing the bomb making process have been retrieved from the mobile phones of Minaz and Masiruddin. “Now, the police are trying to elicit information from the arrested terror accused about other members of their outfit,” he added. “The probe till now has revealed that Minaz was the mastermind of the gang and he along with Masiruddin planned the strikes around August 15 in different parts, while the three others who were arrested on Wednesday Shakeel, Mustaquim and Moid were assisting the duo,” the officer added. Meanwhile, ATS, Special Judge Yogendra Ram Gupta sent the three arrested accused Shakeel, Mustaquim, and Moid in judicial custody till July 29. The ATS filed an application and also sought the police remand of these accused from the special court. The court has fixed July 16 for hearing this application. During this, the accused will be present through video conferencing from the jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ats-retrieves-clips-of-bombmaking-from-ultras-mobiles/articleshow/84457387.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Vaccination picks up in villages with enthusiasm||LUCKNOW: The vaccination drive against Covid-19 in Uttar Pradesh is now being led by its rural arm. According to data from Union health ministry’s CoWin portal, at least 67% of the total vaccinations undertaken in UP between July 1 and 14 are from rural areas. The assessment showed that over 72.69 lakh jabs were given by health teams across 75 districts. Of these, nearly 50 lakh were in rural sites, while the remaining in urban centres. Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad has also admitted several times that the enthusiasm for vaccination has gone up across the state, which is reflecting on the overall status of the drive. He credited the cluster model for improvement in the vaccination status. “The cluster model of Covid-19 vaccination developed in the state has helped in increasing the general enthusiasm about vaccination in rural people while helping in eliminating the factors causing hesitancy. The result is a self-motivated crowd heading to vaccination centres,” he stated while speaking about the Covid-19 status in the state on Thursday. The ACS information said it is on account of the improvement in vaccination rates in the rural areas that UP’s overall performance has improved. “We are now the number one state in term of vaccination. Credit goes to the hard work put in by every single member engaged in the vaccination activity under the leadership of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who personally monitors the situation on a daily basis,” he said, adding that more than 3.93 crore doses of vaccine have been administered in UP (till 4pm on Thursday). Expressing satisfaction over the trend, health officer, Unicef, UP, said the trend is surely encouraging. “Over 65% of UP’s population lives in the villages and till they embrace a public health programme, the desired outcomes cannot be achieved. The momentum needs to be maintained till the pandemic ends,” he said. Officials engaged with the programme said that there is no time to rest as the target on board is to fully vaccinate at least 70% of the eligible population to achieve herd immunity. Also, the 70% full coverage needs to be maintained as well and duly complimented with covid-19 appropriate behaviour by the people. Meanwhile, data from the Cowin portal shows 3.30 crore people have taken at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, while 62.84 lakh are fully vaccinated. When seen against the target of 13.8 crore population eligible for vaccination, this translates into a 23.4% achievement for first dose and 4.5% achievement in the fully vaccinated category. Data indicated that with 16.76 lakh total doses administered, Lucknow leads among districts. Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad follows next with 13.92 lakh and 12.24 lakh doses given. Agra, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Kanpur Nagar, Gorakhpur and Meerut are the other districts where more than 10 lakh doses have been administered. Sravasti, Mahoba, Sant Kabir Nagar, Auraiya, Kaushambi, Lalitpur, Kasganj and Chitrakoot need to catch up on the count as the total number of doses given in these districts is below 2.5 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-more-hesitancy-covid-vaccination-picks-up-in-up-villages/articleshow/84457576.cms||Shailvee Sharda

---||Kozhikode||IUML slams govt over ratio revision||Kozhikode: IUML has flayed the government’s decision to revise the ratio in allotting scholarship for students from minority communities saying that it amounted to putting an end to the benefits provided to Muslim community on Sachar Committee’s recommendations considering the community’s backwardness. Terming the decision as deceptive, IUML leader PK Kunhalikutty accused the government of trying to create divisions among minority communities and pitting them against each other. He said that IUML had put forward the suggestion at the all-party meeting convened by the chief minister that the issue can be resolved in a simple manner by continuing to grant benefits to Muslim community as per Sachar committee recommendations and announce a new scheme for other minority communities. "As per the cabinet decision, the criteria of backwardness is no longer in consideration in state. What has been announced is a scheme for minority communities on the basis of population. That could have been announced separately. State government has, in effect, rejected the Sachar Committee recommendations," he said. He added that the move raises suspicion that government is being led by the thought that they can reap political dividends by creating a wedge between communities which have been traditionally favouring UDF. Kunhalikutty said that though the government had the option to file an appeal following the HC verdict, it didn’t do so; instead it used the verdict. "It is unfortunate if a particular community is getting deceived always and that is what has happened now. While other states are granting benefits as per Sachar committee recommendations, Kerala government has denied it," he said. He added that the sections which have been receiving the benefits of Sachar committee recommendation will feel that they have been denied their benefits. "The decision is bound to invite opposition as the very criteria of backwardness which was the crux of Sachar Committee recommendation has been totally disregarded," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/iuml-slams-govt-over-ratio-revision/articleshow/84456588.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Ola, Uber drivers get fare hike texts on cellphones||MUMBAI: Ola and Uber drivers, who were threatening to go on strike lately, were surprised to receive text messages along with charts on their mobile phones this week showing per kilometre fares had been “hiked” by 20% to 33%. When contacted, Uber and Ola managements said there was no official comment or statement on any hike in fares and declined to comment on messages received by drivers from their official platforms. Drivers said the messages had been sent from Ola and Uber control rooms. The messages had information on the “hikes” as well as “drop” in fares, depending on the travel distance. Driver partners said they got different charts, with Uber saying it had increased fare per km by 25-33% for an up to 15km journey while the Ola message read it had increased the per km fare by 20% for up to 30km. UberGo, for instance, showed the rate per km was hiked from Rs 7.5 to Rs 10 while Ola Prime Sedan showed a hike from Rs 10 to Rs 13. The fare table received by drivers also showed a drop in rates for longer distances. In Uber, if one travelled over 15km, the rate dropped 6% and 19-33% in Ola for an over 30km trip, a driver said. The drop in UberGO was from Rs 10.60 to Rs 10 and in Ola Mini from Rs 15 to Rs 10. Driver partner Shahnawaz Hussain said, “We were thrilled to receive the fare hike message. But when some of us drove the cabs on Thursday, the fares collected were less than what we expected.” For example, one driver shared trip details with TOI wherein he covered a distance of 32km and got a fare of Rs 240. Another driver ferried rider from Nalasopara to Lower Parel (64 km) and received Rs 742. “If the distances increase, then the fares drop,” Hussain said. Uber and Ola officials declined to comment. Sources said the hike was to cover losses during the Covid-19 lockdown and rising fuel prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ola-uber-drivers-get-fare-hike-texts-on-cellphones/articleshow/84456601.cms||Somit Sen
---||Pune||Mucormycosis recurrence in frontal sinuses a worry: Experts||PUNE: Careful clearance of the damaged sinus tissues in the face’s deeper region, pterygopalatine fossa, is key to prevent the spread of Covid-associated mucormycosis to the eyes and brain. This is one of the crucial points the experts are emphasizing on with patients needing revision surgeries coming up in a sizable number and quite a few of them (20%) confronting disease recurrence days or months after recovery. A substantial number of these patients are needing repeat surgical clearance (debridement) even in areas such as frontal sinuses, where recurrences should not happen, indicating incomplete clearance of the damaged tissues during the first surgery, the experts say. “The recurrence is a rule rather than an exception in mucormycosis. Currently, the incidence of recovered patients requiring a revision operation is around 20%,” said ENT surgeon Samir Joshi, who is the head of the department and professor of ENT at Sassoon General Hospital. The tertiary care referral unit has so far treated the highest number of 391 patients with Covid-associated mucormycosis. Clearing the whole fungus in one go (surgery) is nearly impossible because the fungus in the broader zone between the dead area (damaged sinus tissues) and living area (healthy tissues) is not seen.“That is why post-operative cleaning, care and amphotericin injection at least for two weeks is very vital to avoid recurrence,” Joshi said. Usually, the areas such as frontal sinuses should not see a recurrence. But quite a few patients are coming with recurrence in frontal sinuses which is a matter of concern. “This is because the frontal sinuses are drained by gravity whereas other sinuses like maxilla do not drain by gravity as their opening is at a higher level even after widening the opening for the surgical clearance of the damaged tissues,” Joshi said. The disease recurrence should, hence, not happen if the damaged tissues are cleared adequately at the first surgery, especially in the areas of the frontal sinuses. “That is where the role of expertise and experience is crucial. A surgeon can take the help of a senior colleague, if she or he is not confident of dealing with areas like frontal sinus, pterygopalatine fossa and other areas at the base of the skull,” Joshi said. Many doctors are doing revision surgeries in rapid succession without understanding that surgery is not the only treatment option. It can lead to the spreading of the disease rather than containment, if not done for correct indication. “One has to see the effect of amphotericin and then take a decision of revising the surgery. I have seen that sometimes even the bad interpretation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) report, which is a difficult investigation to interpret, has led to revising the surgery,” he said. Working as a team is paramount to avoid recurrence. ENT, oral, neuro, and eye surgeons, and physicians have a definitive role. “We have done most of the cases in collaboration with ENT surgeons for necrotic tissue clearance from frontal, sphenoid, and ethmoid sinuses. Local debridement and topical fungal medications play a very vital role in the prevention of recurrence,” oral and maxillofacial surgeon J B Garde said. Garde has claimed to have successfully treated 62 patients with zero recurrences so far. The use of drug therapy, including amphotericin B injection, is also a key to prevent a recurrence. “To prevent a recurrence, disease control has to be properly achieved prior to changing amphotericin B to step down therapy with oral posaconazole. Apart from incomplete debridement, breakthrough mucor can occur if optimal drug levels in the blood are not achieved,” said Sanjay Pujari, an infectious diseases expert and member of the National Covid Task Force. Posaconazole levels should be achieved in the blood and should be measured 3-5 days after initiating the treatment, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mucormycosis-recurrence-in-frontal-sinuses-a-worry-experts/articleshow/84456568.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The house resolved that experts from the Punjab Engineering College (PEC), IIT-Ropar and Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, Patiala, will be asked for quotations for the project. Those whose quotations will be technically and practically feasible will be asked to prepare the detailed project report (DPR), based on which tender process will be initiated. The house decided that for wet waste, capacity of the existing composting unit at the garbage processing plant will be enhanced to its maximum. The effluent treatment plant (ETP) will also be upgraded, so that leach and other waste liquid can be managed scientifically as per the pollution control guidelines. Besides the councillors, two technical experts—Shakti Arora from Punjab Engineering College and Rhythm Aggarwal, assistant environment engineer from Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee—were also present in the house and explained the technical and environmental aspects of the project. Arora said waste-to-energy technology was the best, popular globally and suitable for the city. Aggarwal asked the house to follow all pollution-related rules for the project, like controlling air contamination and installing air purifier machines, among others. Councillors said the project should be at least for 30 years and take into account all the futuristic considerations, like the nature of garbage generated and its increase. Unlike the current plant, the project must not hassle residents, they added. An MC team, led by mayor Ravikant Sharma, had visited two garbage processing plants in New Delhi on Wednesday. Both the plants employed waste-to-energy technology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/waste-to-energy-tech-to-run-garbage-plant/articleshow/84453941.cms||Deepak Yadav

The forest department has set up over half-a-dozen cages to capture the leopard that has been targeting people sleeping outside their houses in villages falling under Gir (east) forest division. On Wednesday night, the leopard attacked 50-year-old man Dashrath Padvi when he was sleeping in an open shed on his farm in Chalala village. Padvi suffered injuries on the head and bruises on other parts of his body. Chalala village falls under Sarasiya range of Gir forest region. A 22-year-old woman Ramkayna Vasava and a 10-year-old girl Poonam Bhuriya were attacked on July 13 in Moti Garamali village of Chalala taluka. The village falls in the revenue area on the fringe of the forest. Vasava and Bhuriya too were sleeping in an open shed in a farm. On July 10, two other women — Sangeeta Thakar (30) and Nayna Mal (35) — were attacked by a leopard in Garamali village of Chalala when they were sleeping in the open. Both suffered injuries, but Nayna had to be shifted to Rajkot civil hospital for further treatment. Forest officials believe that one leopard was involved in the spate of attacks on humans over the last five days. Deputy conservator of forest Gir (east) Anshuman said, “We have set up seven cages so far and will put four more to capture the leopard. It’s a sowing season because of which there is more movement of vehicles and people. Hence, pug marks of the leopard get erased. Also, due to rains it is difficult to search leopard based on pugmarks.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rogue-leopard-injures-five-in-as-many-days-in-amreli/articleshow/84451610.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Six months on, 30% health staff yet to be fully jabbed||LUCKNOW: Six months after the vaccination drive was started in the city, about 30% of healthcare staff and 40% frontline workers in Lucknow district are yet to be fully immunized against Covid-19. The target of the drive, launched on January 16, was to fully inoculate all healthcare and frontline workers by March. However, vaccinations are still continuing with many healthcare and frontline workers coming to various centres for the first or second shot daily. Healthcare workers include people involved in delivery of all types of health services, while the frontline workers include officers and personnel of police, security forces, civic agencies, district administration, nagar panchayat and disaster management agencies, among others. According to the log sheet at the office of the chief medical officer, total 77,126 healthcare workers have received at least one dose so far. Of these, 54,324 (70.4%) have got second shots as well. This means that 22,802 (29.6%) people have not taken the second jab. Similarly, about 65,845 frontline workers have got at least one dose till date. Of these, 39,813 (60.5%) have taken the second jab, which means that 26,032 (39.5%) are yet to take the second dose. Significantly, the district health department does not have the exact data of healthcare and frontline workers to be inoculated in Lucknow. At the start of the drive in January, health officers had estimated that there are a total 1.04 lakh beneficiaries in the two categories – 59,000 healthcare staff and 45,000 frontline workers. However, a month later, figures were revised when officers came to know that many institutions had not registered their employees. Even after revision, 50-100 people in the two categories are coming to vaccination centres daily to get their first shot. As a result, nearly 39,000 people in addition to the initial estimate of 1.04 lakh have come forward so far. Officers held several factors responsible for the situation. “In the first three months, some anomalies were in the list of employees given by the institutions. There was vaccine hesitancy in a section of workers. Hence, the turnout was low. However, as awareness grew and workers saw devastation in March and April, more people started registering themselves,” a senior officer said. “Earlier, two doses were given 4-6 weeks apart. The gap was later increased to 12-16 weeks. Hence, those who got the first dose in March-end or April are coming for the second dose now,” he added. Besides, most of the workers coming for the first dose are those who are either new recruits or have been transferred from other districts to Lucknow. “Since vaccination is open for all adults, we have told institutions that their employees can simply walk in and get vaccinated after showing their IDs. There is no need to register in advance in the two categories. Our focus now is to cover the maximum number of people eligible for the jab as early as possible,” said district immunisation officer Dr MK Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/six-months-on-30-health-staff-40frontline-workers-yet-to-be-fully-jabbed/articleshow/84457284.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Khadse kin were not entitled to hold land, MIDC official tells ED||Mumbai: In the ongoing Enforcement Directorate probe into the MIDC land deal involving former state revenue minister Eknath Khadse, a senior official of the MIDC told the investigating agency that the former minister’s wife Mandakani and his son-in-law Girish Chaudhari were not entitled to hold the land and erroneously contended and raised the demand for compensation. The remand application filed in the court seeking extension of Chaudhari’s custody mentioned the official’s statement. Avinash Hadgal, regional officer-1, MIDC, Pune, stated, “Chaudhari and Mandakini wrongly purchased the land from Abbas Ukani, which rightly belonged to MIDC. Chaudhari and Mandakini are not entitled to hold the land and hence the sale is void.” The ED stated that the then deputy collector clearly stated that the land belonged to MIDC. Despite that, a sale deed was made and stamp duty was paid on it. The ED wants to record the statement of MIDC and sub-registrar officials to ascertain facts. The ED produced Chaudhari before a special court on Thursday, and the court extended his ED custody till July 19. The ED had arrested Chaudhari in the case on July 7. Abbas Ukani, whose family owned the land from whom the government acquired it in 1971, issued a public notice in 2010, inviting objections regarding the sale of the land by them again. The regional officer of MIDC Pune objected to the notice. They also sent a letter to the revenue office, stating that the land is already in government possession since 1971, and demanded that the MIDC name be entered into the land record (7/12 extract). Later, Khadse helped his kin to purchase the plot from Ukani illegally, ED said. The ED said that Khadse’s son-in-law was not cooperating in the investigation and not revealing the details of shell companies through which he layered Rs 2 crore for purchasing the MIDC land in Pune illegally. Chaudhari’s advocate Mohan Tekavde said, “His arrest is illegal, as ED had not followed procedure under CrPC.” Chaudhari said he took a Rs 2 crore loan from Ms Benchmark Buildcon as its chief director Om Prakash knew him for years. The ED found that Benchmark is a shell company and has no business. Benchmark received Rs 2 crore from five different suspicious companies -- Proficient Merchandise Ltd, Abjayoni Trading Pvt Ltd, Adamina Traders, Chemexgoods Pvt Ltd and Pearl Dealers Pvt Ltd. Directors of some of these companies are the same persons. After receiving the money, Benchmark immediately transferred it to Chaudhari for purchasing the land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-khadse-kin-were-not-entitled-to-hold-land-midc-official-tells-ed/articleshow/84456624.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||Lucknow||Implement common minimum syllabus in 7 days: Lucknow University to departments||LUCKNOW: The Lucknow University authorities on Thursday directed deans of faculties and heads of various departments to adopt common minimum syllabus (CMS) sent by the higher education department on Tuesday in the next seven working days. The circular has been issued despite the fact that all the departments and faculties have already rejected the CMS following opposition of teachers, describing it against the spirit of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. Issued by the LU registrar, the circular states that as per the directions of the vice-chancellor, all departments and faculties should approve guidelines sent by the higher education department. The guidelines attached with the circular recommend four-year structure for undergraduate courses. It also calls for including 70% of the CMS in the syllabi of various subjects. According to law, only the Board of Studies, comprising teachers and subject experts, is authorised to draft the syllabus of a subject. A similar order issued by LU in May was junked by the board of studies of all the departments. LU Teachers’ Association (LUTA), who had opposed the CMS earlier too, urged the state government again on Thursday not to impose the CMS because it is against the interest of students and would subvert the autonomy of the state universities. On teachers’ behalf, LUTA president Vineet Kumar Verma said, “There is no provision under the UP State Universities Act under which state universities can be asked to adopt a common syllabus. Universities are free to decide their syllabus as per their expertise and local demographic, social and geographical needs.” “The NEP-2020 does not propose CMS anywhere. Rather, it recommends more autonomy for universities. The Prime Minister, during the LU centenary celebrations, had asked the universities to keep local needs in mind. Accordingly, LU’s departments have adopted the four-year undergraduate course structure and drafted syllabus,” added Verma. “Autonomous colleges and private universities are free to make their own syllabus. If there is uniformity in state universities, students will go to private universities that offer variety or to other states,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/implement-cms-in-7-days-lu-directs-depts/articleshow/84457326.cms||---

They also submitted a memorandum addressed to the UP governor to the respective district authorities containing a 16-point charter of demands. The demands included guarantee to farmers that their produce would be backed by Minimum Support Price (MSP), payment of Rs 15,000 crore of cane dues, withdrawal of the farm laws, check price rise, jobs to unemployed, check crime against women, stop harassment of senior SP leader Azam Khan, his son Abdullah, other family members, and other SP leaders and provide proper medical equipment and care at government facilities, besides probing allegations of corruption related to Covid care and compensation to kin of those who died of the virus. In Lucknow, SP workers, including district president Jai Singh Jayant, MLA candidate Anurag Yadav, former MLA Rehan Naim, Pawan Manocha, Pooja Shukla and Dr Ashutosh Verma, along with hundreds of their supporters held protests at different locations across the district. Similar protests were held in all the districts across the state. In Etawah, the protests were led by newly elected district panchayat chairman Anshul Yadav while in Kanpur MLAs Irfan Solanki and Amitabh Bajpayee led the demonstration. In Unnao, former MP Annu Tandon and MLC Sunil Sajan led the demonstrations while in Sitapur MLC Anand Bhadauria led the show.

Private flight operators will connect the Diamond City with various major economic and tourist hubs of the country. While Indigo has planned new destinations from July 23, SpiceJet will be starting flights on new sectors from Friday. Surat will be connected with Pune for the first time as SpiceJet plans to start a morning flight four days a week. Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh will be another new destination with three flights from Surat in a week. Besides these two new sectors, SpiceJet will operate flights to Kolkata via Patna, Jaipur, Hyderabad and Bengaluru. Indigo, on the other hand, will start a daily flight to Hyderabad and flights to Goa, Chennai and Bengaluru thrice a week, official sources in the airport said. Several flights to and from Surat were suspended as the second wave of pandemic wreaked havoc in the country. The daily passenger footfall, which reached 4,000 in a day in March, had dropped significantly, but is currently seeing a steady rise. On Wednesday, 2,016 passengers travelled to and from Surat airport through 18 flights. Airport officials said that after the beginning of new flights, the daily number of flights will increase to 26 on thrice a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surat-skies-to-witness-traffic-once-again/articleshow/84451658.cms||---

Overall, the state is reporting 7,000-8,000 new Covid cases daily and has been seeing a 'plateau' in its graph for over a month now. But these 10 districts' caseload, Tope said, is keeping the state's active count high. "The districts make up for 92% of the state's active caseload. We need to flatten their curve through aggressive vaccination, especially in hotspots. That should be followed by good testing and appropriate protocols," he said. The 10 districts are: Pune, Thane, Sangli, Kolhapur and Mumbai (in the top 5), followed by Satara, Ahmednagar, Raigad, Solapur and Nashik. Tope said he has asked authorities in the 10 districts to make sure all Covid protocols are followed and action is taken against those found violating rules. "There are nearly one lakh active cases in the state. Unless this number reduces, we cannot remove the state-wide trigger," he said. State districts are currently under restrictions marked under level 3, or above. Most businesses statewide are operating for limited hours. Tope said unless the 10 districts see improvement, restrictions cannot be lifted. He added that this point has been conveyed to collectors and commissioners of all regions. He said, "The chief minister spearheads disaster management and all restrictions and relaxations are being carried out as per the Disaster Management Act. The chief minister is reviewing the numbers and he believes unless restrictions are properly imposed, there cannot be relaxations as that may fuel a surge in cases." Key cities such as Pune, Mumbai and Nagpur and districts in western Maharashtra need to make sure their caseload doesn't rise, he said, adding that adequate testing, vaccination coverage and health protocols are vital. State task force members said Maharashtra's second wave has had a 'thick tail' and all efforts are on to ensure cases do not spike again, especially in the 10 districts. "Better containment measures, improved testing and vaccination is the way forward," task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said. Dr Joshi said there's a need to ring-fence these districts before deploying extensive containment measures such as contact tracing, isolation and stricter curbs with reviews every two weeks. He added that the lead variant in state is still Delta, with a small scattering of Kappa and Delta-plus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-cases-hit-plateau-but-10-districts-remain-a-concern-tope/articleshow/84456635.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Based on the study by an eight-member technical team, the board would decide on how many overhead cables can be allowed to be drawn safely through electric poles in the future. Seeking to allay the fears of cable TV operators that the advent of K-FON would put an end to the facility to draw cables using the electric poles, KSEB chairman and managing director N S Pillai said the board has no such plans. “In fact, the study is done to ascertain how much load these poles can bear in addition to its primary purpose of holding the power lines. We cannot allow umpteen number of overhead cables to be drawn using the poles. Once the load-bearing capacity of the posts are arrived at, the board would decide on how many cables can be allowed to be drawn using the poles. KSEB has no plans to give exclusive right to anyone, including K-FON, for using electric posts for drawing of cables,” he said. The state government plans to launch the first phase of K-FON service by December. During this phase, the project would provide high speed internet connection to around 30,000 government institutions, including schools. “Though the outbreak of the pandemic has affected the infrastructure work, the first phase of K-FON service will be available latest by December 25, 2021,” said K-FON project head Moses Rajkumar. According to him, the optical fibre cable (OFC) drawing work has been completed in around 15,000-km stretch. The total length of the OFC cable network of K-FON would be around 35,000km.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kseb-not-to-shut-doors-on-cable-operators-says-md/articleshow/84456655.cms||B S Anilkumar

These departments are at the forefront of the fight against the pandemic. Data provided by the state general administration department showed that of the nearly 11 lakh sanctioned posts in the 29 government departments and zilla parishads, more than two lakh posts were vacant till December 2019—1.5 lakh in state departments and 40,944 in zilla parishads. Data on 16 departments was available only till December 2018. The maximum vacancies of 24,000 were identified in the home department, followed by 20,800 in water resources department and 20,500 in health department. Former chief secretary Ratnakar Gaikwad said 20% vacancies in government departments is a serious issue and can impact day-to-day work. “To anticipate staff requirement, a systematic approach and training in capacity assessment and building is needed. If that happens, then requisition can be sent to the state service commission at the right time to appoint staff,” he said. —Chittaranjan Tembhekar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rti-home-dept-has-max-vacant-posts-in-mumbai/articleshow/84458889.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

The assailants fled the scene after the shooting. While the police are yet to identify the assailants, they said that the motive appears to be linked to a property deal gone wrong. Police sources said that two persons had come from Maharashtra and hired a car to meet the victim, Amar Naik. Police suspect it to be a pre-planned murder. Naik is survived by his parents, two brothers and a sister. He was a small-time businessman dealing in transport and property.  Ward councillor Sudesh Bhosle told TOI, “Naik had gone with his friend from Chicalim, Preetesh Kuttikar for some work and left home at 11am. Kuttikar later informed Naik’s brother of the shooting and we all rushed to the site.” The incident took place behind the Coast Guard at Bogmalo around 4pm. Naik was called to a bungalow in the area for a meeting and the shooting took place when Naik was rushing to his car parked outside the house. Since the bullet was found in the car, police said he was shot at close range. Kuttikar who witnessed the incident was not harmed. He informed Naik’s family and friends about the shooting. Vasco police shifted the body to Chicalim sub-district hospital. Police said the murder did not occur due to sudden provocation but appears to be pre-planned as the accused carried weapons with them to the meeting. After committing the murder, the assailants tried to escape in the rented car which was hired from Calangute. But in doing so, the car landed in a gorge along the road but they fled the scene. Superintendent of police (South Goa) Pankaj Kumar Singh also visited the hospital and the shooting site. He told TOI, “We have made 9 to 10 teams of South Goa police. We have some leads and we are working on it.” When asked if the two accused are from Maharashtra, Kumar said that at this point they would not like to reveal anything as it might create a hurdle in investigations. Police are scanning CCTV footage of the area as the Coast Guard and Indian Navy have cameras installed on the main road for security purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vasco-bizman-shot-dead-assailants-flee/articleshow/84458940.cms||Ruvina Khan

The department issued a public notice asking tourist taxi operators whose vehicle registration numbers end with 0 or 1, to ensure fitment by July 24, failing which their vehicle permit would be cancelled. The high court of Bombay at Goa in orders dated May 6 and July 5 this year directed that the fitment of digital fare meters begin within 15 days and conclude within six months respectively. There are about 300 bookings that have been made for the fitment of digital meters, however, the department estimates that there are many more vehicles that are yet to come forward in the series for the scheduled fitment. The notice reads that the department “had ensured that specific SMS has been sent to each and every motor cab owner whose mobile number was available” with them and that “sending individual notices to every stakeholder is not possible due to the paucity of time as the directorate would run into contempt” if the devices are not fitted as per the schedule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/deadline-set-for-fitment-of-taxi-digital-meters/articleshow/84458900.cms||Nida Sayed

The works will resume in September as rainy and extreme winter seasons are not considered good to lay down new roads. Out of around Rs 38 crore road recarpeting works of the last financial year, the MC is yet to complete those of around Rs 19 crore. Besides, the tender process of Rs 70-crore projects of the current financial year will also start within a month and the work will begin later this year or next year. “Out of the allotted road work of Rs 38 crore, which include 221km roads, only half has been completed so far. Around 110kms have been recarpeted. Though the engineering department is trying its best to complete all roads, the rainy season has started, so the work has been stopped,” sources said. The Rs 38-crore work was allotted in March this year. The contractors had faced a major labour shortage, so the pace of work slowed down initially. The MC engineering department has also prepared Rs 70-crore financial estimates to recarpet around 431km roads across the city. The civic body has been planning to complete the entire tender exercise during the monsoon so that the re-carpeting can be started immediately thereafter. “Unlike last time, we don’t have any dedicated fund yet for the re-carpeting of roads in this fiscal. But since the monsoon period is the best time to complete the tender process, we will do it and hopefully money will also be arranged either from the main budget or the additional fund,” sources said. There are three divisions in the building and road (B&R) wing of the MC’s engineering department. The civic body has prepared the estimates division-wise, so that all the roads can be covered. Sources said some parking areas too need recarpeting. Fund problem:The ongoing and previous road re-carpeting projects are under the deposit works, as the MC received approximately Rs 70 crore from the Chandigarh administration for these in 2019. So there was no financial crunch, besides the UT also released money for more works under deposit works in 2019, which included enhancement of the water storage tank at the Sector 39-based water works, installation of lights at dark spots across the city, development of nine villages, among others. But for the newly-planned road re-carpeting project, the MC will have to manage the funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/monsoon-halts-road-recarpeting-work-will-resume-in-september/articleshow/84454015.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Nagpur||Bail can’t be refused to douse collective anger and society’s outrage: Bombay high court||NAGPUR: Bail can’t be refused either as pre-trial punishment or to cater to or douse the collective anger and outrage of the society, said the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday. “Despite the existence of prima facie case, bail can be granted particularly if the offence is not punishable with death or life imprisonment. Unless there is some material in prosecution’s possession to suggest that the petitioner, albeit under suspension, will flee from the course of justice or will subvert the trial or influence witnesses, there is no purpose in continuing incarceration,” justice Rohit Deo said before granting bail to Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer Vinod Shivkumar. The bench noted that the existence of a prima facie case is not the only consideration governing grant or refusal to provide bail, since accused is not charged with commission of offence punishable with death or life sentence. “The gravity of offence, status of the accused, possibility of him not being available or otherwise to face the trial, the propensity or the potential to influence course of trial, are some of the relevant considerations.” Shivkumar, who was arraigned as prime accused in the suicide of range forest officer (RFO) Deepali Chavan, approached the HC through counsel Firdos Mirza after Achalpur sessions court denied him bail. He was arrested on the basis of three letters sent by the deceased to former additional chief conservator of forest MS Reddy (also made an accused in the case) along with her mother and husband, alleging harassment meted out by Shivkumar, who was her immediate superior. Justice Deo pointed out that no material was brought to his notice to suggest that the petitioner or any other IFS member made any attempt to influence the witnesses. He had asked the prosecution to submit evidence that Shivkumar was protected and helped by other IFS members, and the integrity and impartiality of the witnesses, who are lower in rank, shall stand compromised if he is released on bail. Assistant government pleader Kalyani Deshpande, however, clarified that there is no complaint of any attempt by any of accused’s colleagues of attempting to influence the witnesses “Notwithstanding that the three letters on which prosecution is relying to make out a prima facie case of abetment, if taken at face value, considering that the petitioner is suspended and wouldn’t be in a position to influence the witnesses, and that bail can’t be denied as a pre-trial punishment, I am inclined to hold that a case is made out for grant of bail,” the judge said, while releasing Shivkumar on personal bond of Rs1 lakh with two solvent sureties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bail-cant-be-refused-to-douse-collective-anger-societys-outrage-hc/articleshow/84454030.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The general house decided that either the UT chief engineer or his representative will be part of the technical committee comprising a Punjab Engineering College expert and a Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee member. The step aims at dealing with the energy generation, its disposal and addressing power purchase issues. The electricity wing comes under the UT engineering department. MC hopes to earn money through disposal of energy produced by the plant. “Active involvement of the electricity wing in the technical committee will help address energy-related issues. Therefore, the UT chief engineer or his representative will be a member of the technical committee. Moreover, their assistance will be important in the functioning of the plant in terms of selling power and other related issues,” MC commissioner KK Yadav said during the special general house meeting. One of the reasons for the failure of the current garbage processing plant was non-disposal of refuse derived fuel (RDF) and the issue had reached the National Green Tribunal (NGT). Therefore, the special general house meeting thoroughly discussed energy disposal. Babla tears water bills:Alleging that despite the orders to roll back hike in water tariff, residents were still getting bills on increased charges, leader of opposition and Congress councillor Devinder Singh Babla tore the water bills during the house meeting proceedings. He alleged that the hiked bills showed the callous attitude of the ruling BJP towards the residents of Chandigarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-to-take-help-of-ut-engg-dept/articleshow/84454003.cms||Deepak Yadav

---||Delhi||Delhi: Yamuna rises again, water woes to ease||NEW DELHI: The water level of the Yamuna at Wazirabad barrage has once again reached the normal level of 674.4 feet as 16,000 cusecs of water released by Haryana from Hathnikund barrage has reached Delhi. A senior DJB official said all water treatment plants were now operating at full capacity and regular water supply would resume soon. Earlier, a shortage of 100-120 million gallons per day (MGD) had been reported due to which Chandrawal, Wazirabad and Okhla water treatment plants (WTP) were operating below their capacities. DJB vice-chairperson Raghav Chadha visited Wazirabad Barrage on Friday to examine the water level. The riverbed, which had almost dried up a few days ago, is now once again filled with water. A week ago, the pond level had reached 667.6 feet due to which supply was affected to parts of Delhi Cantonment, south, central, west and north Delhi. The production at Chandrawal WTP had come down from 90 to 55 MGD, at Wazirabad from 135 to 80 MGD, and at Okhla from 20 to 15 MGD. “The daily production at these plants had come down from 245 to 150 MGD. We have now resumed full supply from them,” said the official. DJB has filed a petition in Supreme Court. Subsequently, 16,000 cusecs (8,888 million gallons) of water was released in the Yamuna from Hathnikund barrage on Tuesday. The utility manages about 14,500 kilometres of pipelines to supply water and provide sewerage services to about 20 million people of Delhi. DJB has the capacity of producing 935 MGD water through nine WTPs, ranney wells and tubewells. While the Bhagirathi plant produces 108 MGD potable water, Sonia Vihar WTP cleans 140 MGD under normal circumstances. Both plants are fed raw water from the Upper Ganga Canal. The rest of the raw water comes mainly through the Yamuna, DSB canal and CLC Munak canal, besides subsurface sources. “The thirst of the river and the people of Delhi will be quenched soon. DJB plants will be able to function at optimum capacity to deliver clean drinking water to all households. The WTPs were working at reduced capacity as the capital’s rightful share of raw water was not being released by Haryana,” said Chadha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/yamuna-rises-again-water-woes-to-ease/articleshow/84487333.cms||---
---||Surat||Gujarat: Bihar man held for forcing conversion of married woman||SURAT: A labourer from Bihar, who is currently working in Vapi, was arrested from his native place in Buxar district on Wednesday for allegedly abducting a married woman and her daughter allegedly by luring her with marriage promise and forcibly converting her religion. The accused Javed Ali Alam was booked at Vapi Town police station for kidnapping and under the recently amended Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act based on the complaint filed by the woman’s husband. The woman’s husband had lodged a missing person complaint on July 2 as his wife and three-year-old daughter were missing from their home. A few days later, the man got to know that Alam was also missing and later his wife called him to inform that Alam had taken her and their daughter to his village in Bihar. On July 12, the man lodged a complaint and an offence was registered. Police said their team was sent to Alam’s village and the woman and her daughter were brought back and Alam was arrested. According to police, they reached out to the woman before Alam could forcibly convert her religion. The woman told cops that Alam used to tell her that he will marry her only after she will convert to his religion. “The woman got lured as she was allegedly beaten and harassed by her husband. The accused and the woman worked in the same company so she used to share with him about the harassment and over a period she developed trust in him,” said a police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/bihar-man-held-for-forcing-conversion-of-married-woman/articleshow/84451824.cms||---

---||Chennai||‘We will train people, have special police for tourists’||With travel set to resume as pandemic restrictions are being relaxed, the Tamil Nadu government is starting afresh in marketing the state, says tourism minister Dr M Mathivendan. In an interview with Yogesh Kabirdoss and V Ayyappan, the minister talks about a combination of measures including vaccination drives, creating protocols for health and sanitation, destination-specific master plans and roadmaps to promote different categories of tourism that are being considered to ensure the state remains a top draw among tourists, just like the pre-Covid days. Q:What is your vision for Tamil Nadu tourism for the next five years?The spine of tourism is a policy or a law, but Tamil Nadu has neither. We are working on a policy, which willlook at collaboration of various departments for tourism-related activities. We will take a cue from Kerala and Rajasthan and customise those experiences for Tamil Nadu. The state has diverse landscape and thrust would be on developing local tourism. We would be setting up an academy that would offer courses on tourism. Tourist police for the protection of visitors will also be introduced. Q: Tamil Nadu has the highest number of domestic and international tourists in the country. What are your plans to revive tourism in view of Covid-19?Tourism sector has been the worst hit by Covid-19. We need to take immediate action for a giant leap because we lost all the revenue. Our chief minister has assured that the sector will be given priority and developed. There are hundreds of less-known destinations that local people alone know about. For instance, Kolli Hills has nearly 70 hairpin bends, a pleasure for two-wheeler riders. Still, Kolli Hills does not have prominence on a par with Kodaikanal or Ooty. There are around 300 such sites that are identified to be promoted so that local residents as well as tourists from other states can visit. Q: TN will require additional efforts to attract tourists because all states will be trying to attract domestic tourists. What are the steps under consideration? We are planning to attract domestic tourists on a large scale by promoting cruise tourism and water sports, taking advantage of Tamil Nadu’s coastline. Caravan tourism is another vertical that has tremendous potential and does not require huge investment. What we need is to create facilities such as parking, shops to buy provisions for those looking to make their own food and outlets offering prepared food for the rest. I also had a discussion with the water resource minister regarding introducing TTDC boat services in dams for tourists. Q: What about promotion of Island Grounds in Chennai and revamping the annual industrial trade fair hosted there?The aim is to transform the Island Grounds into a happening place that operates 24x7 and for 365 days. If a person visits Island Grounds, he or she would have enough entertainment for the whole day. Adventure rides like the theme parks are being looked at. Flowers and plants will be planted along the bund of the Cooum River under the River Eco-restoration Project.

His father, Sagar Bhayade said, “We were returning home around 7.45 pm on July 11 after visiting my native in Murud. The caved-in portion was not visible as it was pitch dark. The car plunged about 15 feet into the caved-in portion, but got stuck in a tree. Within minutes, our SUV was filled with water. We started panicking, as the door got locked. I tried to break the window pane on my side, while my son kept kicking the rear windscreen and managed to break it. He got out and opened the door.” Sagar said he carried Shree on his shoulders and pushed him atop the tree branches, which helped him reach the top of the bridge. He sought the help of local villagers even as the rest of the family clung to the tree branches. Locals located the family and guided them to the top of the bridge. “We were stuck in the SUV for about five minutes, but we remained under the bridge in the water holding the tree branches for about 15 minutes. It was a scary experience. But my son’s efforts in helping us come out of the SUV saved us all.” Sagar said his son has been practising karate since he was a three-year-old and the practise came to good use on Sunday. Raigad SP Ashok Dudhe felicitated the boy for his brave act on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-minor-felicitated-for-saving-family-with-heroic-act/articleshow/84456753.cms||George Mendonca
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Gandhian institution against razing Laxmi Vilas for museum project||JAIPUR: The state government's decision to demolish the historic Laxmi Vilas Hotel for the Rs 100-crore Mahatma Gandhi museum project has drawn flak from one of the oldest and leading Gandhian institutions, the Rajasthan Samagra Seva Sangh (RSSS), besides activists and environmentalists. RSSS president Sawai Singh, who had made the museum proposal, has criticised the state government for splurging money and construction of a new building after pulling down the existing one. “In a March 2021 meeting, the idea was floated by us to convert the building into a Gandhi museum. We have strictly expressed our opinion to keep the nature of the building exactly the same. I do not support the government idea to demolish the structure. Such projects to earn money should not be coined in the name of Gandhi,” Singh said. Top officials of the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA), however, said the project would save the public land forever and would not be used for any commercial purpose. Officials claimed that an attempt was made to save the existing structure but it is ‘in shambles’ and all the heritage value has been destroyed by previous owners who converted it into a hotel.JDA commissioner Gaurav Goyal said, “Our plan is to construct a building using eco-friendly material . It will compliment Central Park. The idea of the project is to educate youth about Mahamta's life.” “The building will not be razed till the time plan is finalised. Objections and suggestions from the public will be invited as execution will not be carried out without consent,” Goyal said. Activists associated with the issue also highlighted the fact that the land was acquired for the park and new construction cannot come in the area. Under the Rajasthan State Land Acquisition Act, the Urban Improvement Trust (UIT) had acquired 322 bighas in the Rambagh Complex for public utilities in 1973. As per UIT claims, these two prime buildings were part of the ‘acquired’ land, following which possession was taken by the JDA in 2017 after a long legal battle and declared as a portion of the park. Vimal Chaudhary, the counsel for JDA, said, “The court has specifically given directions to the state government to utilise the land for the purpose it was acquired. Since the land has been acquired for the garden park, it cannot be used for other purposes.” Constructed during the period of Jaipur’s last ruler Sawai Man Singh-II, Laxmi Vilas was originally an estate motor garage which was converted into a hotel by heir Maharaja Bhawani Singh. During the previous BJP government's tenure, it was decided to lease the hotel. “It was dropped due to the judgment of Rajasthan High Court,” Chaudhary said. As per JDA claims, the decision to develop the museum was taken since the land was earmarked as commercial/recreation in the Master Plan 2025. The Central Park Bachao Sangharsh Samiti president Yogesh Yadav said, “The move will not only waste public money but also disturb the sanity of the park due to razing down the old building and constrcuting a new one. The land was acquired for public utility and not for a multi-crore project. It’s an ecological and no-construction zone. Razing the existing structure and constructing a new building is in violation of the Supreme Court order.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gandhian-inst-against-razinglaxmi-vilas-for-museum-project/articleshow/84456817.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt opposes Sudha Bharadwaj's bail, says NIA stepped in later||MUMBAI: The state government on Thursday opposed a petition filed by the 2018 Elgar Parishad case accused Sudha Bharadwaj for default bail and cited a judgment to argue that a special trial judge under the National Investigation Agency Act (NIA) would come into the picture only when the agency starts investigating a case. In this case, the NIA stepped in last January and took over the investigation from the Pune police, and the Pune sessions court had taken cognisance of the chargesheet against Bharadwaj in 2018. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni in his submissions argued that saying all scheduled offences will only go before a special NIA court will render a court as defined in the anti-terror law Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act nugatory. He said there was no need for a special court to be constituted at that time. “My submission is this: the case of the petitioner is fallacious,” said Kumbhakoni before a bench of Justice S S Shinde and Justice N J Jamadar. He cited provisions of the NIA Act and the UAPA including the definitions of the words ‘court’ under the special laws to show that in this case the sessions court under the provisions of the CrPC was sufficient at this pre-trial stage. He said the only question right now was whether a pre-trial proceeding could go before a special court. Citing Section 167 of the CrPC, which deals with the investigation stage, he said that at this point no one can predict if the matter is going to trial. He said Section 11 and Section 22 relied on and cited by Bharadwaj on setting up a special court under NIA have the word “trial”. He said that under Section 2(d) of the UAPA, court “includes a special court … .’’ On July 8 the high court had said the state could produce any additional documents if it wanted to after observing that its records matched with an RTI reply cited by her lawyer Yug Chaudhry that the Pune sessions court judge, K D Vadane, who granted an extension of time to the police to file its chargesheet and who took cognisance of it, was not a special judge under the act. Bharadwaj, an activist and lawyer accused of alleged Maoist links, had petitioned the high court to seek default bail on the grounds that the judge was not designated a special judge under the NIA, as was necessary since the special anti-terror law was invoked against her and other co-accused at the relevant time. Chaudhry had submitted that in cases of scheduled offences such as those under the UAPA, a sessions judge has no power to take cognisance, only a special court would have jurisdiction and it has to be set up by the state or Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-govt-opposes-sudha-bail-says-nia-stepped-in-later/articleshow/84456786.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Vadodara||Baroda loses yet another cricketer, Deepak Hooda quits BCA||VADODARA: Seven months after he got into a fight with cricketer Krunal Pandya, senior player Deepak Hooda has quit Baroda Cricket Association (BCA). Hooda sent an email on July 13 seeking a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the BCA to play for another association. The BCA has granted him the NOC. His exit is a setback for the association as Hooda was one of the mainstays of the team. Hooda was banned by the BCA for one season on disciplinary grounds after he walked out of the team on the eve of a crucial T20 tournament in January this year. Hooda had accused Krunal of abusing him during the practice sessions. “His ban was for one season. We had selected him for the camp last month but Hooda didn’t turn up for some days. Later, he said that he will join the camp on July 10. But on July 13, he sent an email informing about his unavailability and seeking NOC to play from another association,” said Shishir Hattangadi, BCA CEO. Former India cricketer Irfan Pathan posted on his Facebook wall that Hooda leaving Baroda cricket is a huge loss. Hooda has played 46 first-class games for Baroda in which he scored over 2,900 runs at an average of 42.76. He has also played for different teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL). “I humbly request you to grant me a releasing letter/NOC in order to allow me to explore my cricketing career for the 2021-22 domestic season with some other state/association. I have made this decision keeping in mind with regards to future growth in my career and also I feel that my professional services can be utilized in a better manner and to the best of my abilities with a different team at this stage of my career,” Hooda wrote in the email to the BCA. Sources suggest that he may join the Haryana team. On January 9, Baroda vice-captain Hooda withdrew from the team that was to play in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy. He left the bio-bubble and the hotel in which the team was staying after a heated argument with the team captain Krunal Pandya during the net practice sessions. He accused Pandya of threatening him and pulling him down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/baroda-loses-yet-another-cricketer-hooda-quits-bca/articleshow/84451906.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Chennai||Freedom fighter who continues to set an example||By R RangarajVeteran communist leader N Sankaraiah, who stepped into his 100th year, was popularly known as NS. Student leader, freedom fighter and legislator, his term of imprisonment against British rule oppression began at the age of 19. A day before India attained Independence on August 15, 1947, Sankaraiah was released along with several others from prison, and celebrated freedom in more ways than one. From a young age, he was attracted to the self-respect movement of Periyar E V Ramaswami, the nationalist movement of the Congress, and later the Communist party. He was part of the freedom struggle in Madurai in the 1930s and participated in student agitations at American College, Madurai, where he studied history. His hopes of higher education ended as he was jailed just 15 days before his final exams. During his stints in jail, (four years during British rule and four years in free India) he met several leaders of the Congress party including former chief minister K Kamaraj. Life of protest continued in prison as Sankaraiah and other leaders undertook fasts to press their demands. He used the prison terms to provide lessons in history and organisational matters to cadres. NS fought against untouchability, caste and religious differences, and was vociferous in opposing what he called communalism of the Sangh Parivar. Although he took part in the freedom movement of the Congress, and courted imprisonment during protests against arrests of national leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, in later years he fiercely opposed the Congress, mainly on the ground of its economic policies. Even in free India, the woes of the Communist leaders were not over. Police were sent from Chennai to Kolkata to arrest leaders of the Communist party from Tamil Nadu attending the party’s all-India conference at Kolkata on February 28, 1948. M V Sundaram and NS, sensing that Chennai police were tracking their movement and were on the same train quietly got off the train at Cuttack and took different routes to reach Chennai. On March 3, 1948, the Communist party was banned, and thus NS had to remain underground for three years. He hid in the houses of some supporters of the party in villages like Podhumbu and Adhalai near Madurai. He once had to stay in the godown of a laundry, amid a pile of soiled clothes. Since he suffered from rashes and skin infections, he was taken to a Chennai doctor for treatment. NS resorted to disguises to hoodwink police. In 1951, however, NS was arrested and lodged in Vellore prison. NS occupied several important positions in the Communist party, rising from the ranks -- district secretary in 1944 and state secretariat member in 1954. He was one of the 32 national council (NC) members who walked out of CPI and founded CPM in 1964.He was a member of state secretariat from 1964 and state secretary of the CPM from 1995 to 2002. Of the 32 NC members who quit the CPI and later formed the CPM, only two are alive — NS and V S Achuthanandan. He believed in integrating culture into political movements and was instrumental in getting music, dance and folk troupes to perform at meetings of the Communist party. Similarly, he believed that more and more writers of the Left mould should enter into the arena of theatre and films and help take the movement to the masses. Sankaraiah won thrice (in 1967, 1977 and 1980) in elections to the Tamil Nadu assembly from Madurai constituencies. Many of his political opponents were friends, especially those from the Congress party. In the assembly, he was fast and furious, even as reporters struggled to keep pace with him while taking notes. Though he was eligible to receive pension as a freedom fighter, he refused to receive it. He practised what he preached. While he was married to a Christian, Navamani, he also encouraged inter-caste marriages in his family. He would also make appeals to the youth to go in for love marriages. Sankaraiah believed that love marriages, breaking the caste and religious divide, would ultimately create a casteless society, and such a society alone could make all-round progress.

MahaMetro said it plans to join hands with Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd (PMPML), autorickshaw unions, cab aggregators and bus operators in this regard, and said it has signed 14 memoranda of understanding (MoUs) for feeder services so far with various service providers. MahaMetro said talks were also underway with railways, IRCTC and Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) for a seamless switching experience between different transport services. On Thursday, MahaMetro launched the station access and mobility programme (STAMP) for Pune, an initiative led by Toyota Mobility Foundation (TMF) and WRI India Ross Centre aimed at improving multi-modal integration of Metro rail with other modes of transportation in Indian cities. S STAMP is based on a partnership model with the innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystem. Pune is the fifth city to become part of the initiative, MahaMetro said. MahaMetro is developing two Metro corridors in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad — Pimpri to Swargate and Vanaz to Ramwadi. The Metro will connect with railway services at three locations — Pune station, Shivajinagar and Kasarwadi. Atul Gadgil, director (works) at MahaMetro, said they were planning to make Metro services operational on the 5km Vanaz-Garware College section and the 7km PCMC-Dapodi priority stretches by December. “Some works are in the final stages. MahaMetro and the civic body concerned will user-friendly pedestrian and road infrastructure within 500 metres of each Metro station. Separate plans are being made to establish contact with railway services,” Gadgil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mahametro-secures-robust-last-mile-connectivity-deals/articleshow/84454200.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: App for parking slots likely soon||Mumbai: Imagine an app that can tell you the availability of parking slots in an area and spare you the frustrating search for a space to park your car. That scenario might soon be a reality if a decentralised ward parking management plan to be implemented on a pilot basis proves successful. At a meeting of Mumbai Parking Authority (MPA) officials with municipal commissioner IS Chahal on Thursday, it was decided to implement the plan in three wards —D (Grant Road, Malabar Hill), K-West (Andheri West) and S (Bhandup). MPA officials said it would take at least two months before the pilot project takes off. “We are focusing on creating a central database of all parking spaces in a ward. This data will be made available on a mobile application and motorists will be able to check availability of parking slots,” said an MPA member, adding the pilot project will require coordination of the ward office and the traffic police. The online aggregator platform will integrate all on-street and off-street parking spaces to ensure citizens can book any parking slot in the city. The municipal commissioner has suggested that all parking areas belonging to other government agencies must be combined in the city parking pool (CPP). It was also decided that the lowest amount of the current parking pricing policy be implemented in the ward plans to ensure it is inclusive. This means yellow plate vehicles such as autos/taxis/cabs will be charged subsidised rates for parking. The civis body is also in the process of gaining possession of three plots to scrap junked vehicles, said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-app-for-parking-slots-likely-soon/articleshow/84456848.cms||Richa Pinto

The department has warned that the very heavy rainfall activity is likely to continue till July 20. The department has warned that the areas vulnerable to landslides and flooding must be kept under monitoring. “Water levels in rivers may be monitored and necessary precautions may kindly be taken,” IMD said. The IMD had issued a red alert for Goa on Thursday, and the incessant rainfall activity on the day saw 10 rain gauge stations receive more than 100mm of rainfall each. The Pernem station recorded the highest at 190mm by 8.30am on Thursday. It was the only station to almost reach the 200mm mark in 24 hours. Sanguem followed close behind, recording 181mm of rainfall in a day. IMD has attributed the reason for the increase in rainfall in the coming days to certain systems prevailing, such as an East West shear zone above mean sea level tilting southwards, a cyclonic circulation over east Vidarbha and neighbourhood areas extending up to 4.5km above mean sea level and the formation of an off-shore trough off the Karnataka-Kerala coasts. “There are indications by numerical weather prediction models that, after July 15, rainfall activity may increase again by around July 18. The likelihood of very heavy rainfall of 115.6mm to 204.4mm in 24 hours continues over Goa up to July 20 with scattered and isolated spatial distributions,” IMD stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/increased-rainfall-activity-to-go-on-till-july-20-orange-alert-today/articleshow/84459062.cms||Nida Sayed

---||Delhi||SDMC stops lifting biomedical waste from Covid centre||NEW DELHI: Taking note of the fact that there were no patients at Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has discontinued the services for sanitation and lifting of biomedical waste. Former leader of the house Narendra Chawla said that the contract given for the services would be resumed if required. The decision has also been taken as the civic body is running short of funds, he added. “Since there is no patient at the centre and we also don’t have enough funds to pay the concessionaire, the services have been put on hold. We are already facing problems in paying regular salaries and trying to avoid additional burden,” he said. Earlier, in January, the civic body had expressed its inconvenience over continuing the services due to non-payment of the amount incurred on maintenance by the Delhi government.  SDMC had demanded Rs 3 crore for settling the pending bill but there was no reply from the other side, said Chawla.  However, later in March-April, SDMC again issued a contract to a private company for continuing the maintenance work at the centre after the second wave of Covid-19 hit the city. In May 2020, the central government had decided to set up the centre at Radha Soami Satsang Complex in Chhatarpur. “While SDMC was assigned the duty of maintaining housekeeping and sanitation services, it was decided during several meetings and inspections that the Delhi government will bear the cost for housekeeping services. Later, the DEMS department deployed a total of 200 staff through a private concessionaire. But no expenditure was reimbursed,” claimed Chawla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-stops-lifting-biomedical-waste-from-covid-centre/articleshow/84487413.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi schools won’t open till everyone is vaccinated: CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said the schools in Delhi would not reopen for now. “Internationally there is a trend of resurgence of Covid-19 through a third wave; hence, until the vaccination process is completed for everyone, we cannot risk lives of children,” Kejriwal said during the inauguration of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccination programme in west Delhi. The chief minister flagged off the programme at a government polyclinic in Paschim Vihar. Pneumococcal diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the children under 2 years. The vaccine will protect them from diseases like pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis. It usually costs Rs 1,500-6,000, but will be administered for free at Delhi government’s centres. Each child will get three doses at the age of one and a half months, three and a half months and 9 months, respectively. Encouraging parents to get their children vaccinated, Kejriwal said, “Till now, children of Delhi were administered vaccines for 12 diseases. From today, we are administering vaccines for pneumonia that will protect children from the disease.” He added that the vaccine would protect children from death. “Earlier, children under the age of 5 were gravely affected by pneumonia, even deaths were recorded.” The vaccine will be available at 600 vaccination centres across Delhi from Friday. “This is a very expensive injection. It costs between Rs 1,500 and Rs 6,000 and each child needs three doses. Naturally, it is unaffordable for the common public, so Delhi government will provide it for free at its centres,” Kejriwal said. “This is a step forward towards Delhi government’s resolve to improve and strengthen the healthcare system and infrastructure of Delhi.” About the Covid-19 vaccination programme, the chief minister said Delhi government had been vaccinating at the maximum capacity in the capital. “We administer as many vaccines as we can whenever we receive them. As many vaccines as we receive from the central government, we administer them at the earliest,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-schools-wont-open-till-everyone-is-vaxed-kejriwal/articleshow/84454375.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Panjab University stands firm on reforms, says protests are misguided||CHANDIGARH: Despite protests conducted by student parties over the proposed governance reforms of Panjab University (PU), PU authorities, on Thursday, issued a press release in which they reiterated their stand on the issues and maintained that the demands raised in the protests were factually incorrect. Clarifying governance reforms, PU authorities said that in the present PU Act, the state of Punjab is represented in the Senate/Syndicate through various ex-officio positions of state government of Punjab, including the chief minister, the education minister, secretary, higher education/ DPI colleges and two members of the state assembly. In the report, all these ex-officio positions of the government of Punjab have been kept intact and therefore, there is no dilution so far as the participation of the state government of Punjab in the governance of PU is concerned. On territorial jurisdiction of PU being restricted to only Mohali and Roopnagar, PU, in its clarification, stated that the Governance Reforms Committee had recommended the realignment of territorial jurisdiction of PU in such a way that colleges falling in the immediate vicinity of the PU campus could be affiliated to it. This recommendation has been made only for the convenience and benefit of students and research scholars studying/working in colleges situated in Mohali and Roopnagar. Similarly, students in the colleges situated at far off places (more than 200 to 250 kilometres away from PU campus) may get better services from a University situated in their proximity. “This recommendation is not at all restricting or de-affiliating colleges situated in Ludhiana, Khanna, Moga, Balachaur, Nawanshahr, Hoshiarpur, etc. Therefore, the statement that realignment of territorial jurisdiction will limit jurisdiction of PU only to Mohali and Roopnagar is factually incorrect,” said authorities. On the vice-chancellor (VC) being given the power to nominate members of the Senate and Syndicate, PU, in its clarification, said that in the proposed structure of Senate and Syndicate, the power to nominate members to the Senate rests with the Chancellor in the existing PU Act. However, the Governance Reforms Committee unanimously recommended curtailment of the number of nominated members to 18 from the present 36 to put in place a lean and efficient governance structure. It also stated that the existing governance structure of PU was a combination of ex-officio, elected and nominated members. The Governance Reforms Committee has recommended the same structure, with all three components as such. But the Committee has recommended downsizing of these bodies for enhanced efficiency. The existing 93-member body of the Senate has been proposed to be of 47 members. The number of Syndicate members is recommended to be 13 instead of 18. However, PU said such downsizing has been recommended without compromising the democratic spirit of the university as the proposed Senate and Syndicate also have representation of elected principals and teachers of affiliated colleges of the state of Punjab as well as Chandigarh besides the elected representatives of teachers of PU Campus. For the constitution of the Syndicate, the appointment of members has been recommended on the basis of seniority by rotation so that teachers from PU Campus, regional centres, affiliated colleges, including principals are given equal opportunity to participate in the governance of PU in an efficient manner. Regarding “Registered graduate constituency,” PU authorities, in their clarification, said the such a constituency does not exist in any university in the state of Punjab. It was stated that the reason for this is that the election process of this constituency is a very complex and cost intensive exercise. In PU, it involves more than 3.5 lakh voters spread over five states of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and two Union Territories of Delhi and Chandigarh. Moreover, the concept of having registered graduates constituency in universities was relevant only till the 1960s, when PU was conducting matriculation and intermediate examinations. However, ever since the constitution of Punjab State Education Board, such examinations do not fall in the purview of universities, therefore, in the contemporary education system in universities, the concept of registered graduate constituency is no more relevant, said PU authorities. Keeping in view the model of governance structure of other universities of the state of Punjab, it was recommended to have ‘Eminent Alumni’ of PU on the governing bodies of PU instead of registered graduates constituency. The PU spokesman said, “The overall governance structure has been proposed by the Committee to remove complexities of the system and bring about efficiency, keeping in view the contemporary needs of the higher education system of the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pu-stands-firm-on-reforms-says-protests-are-misguided/articleshow/84452012.cms||Arvind Bishnoi
---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh to compensate kin of 1,071 teachers, 949 staff who died of Covid on poll duty||BAREILLY: The UP government will compensate the families of 2,020 of its employees who died of Covid-19 while on panchayat election duty in April and May. Of them, 1,071 were teachers or education staff. In May, the government had said just three teachers had died on poll duty. Prior to the election, the risk teachers were at during poll duty had been taken up in court. The Supreme Court eventually allowed counting to take place following the predetermined schedule after the state government and the State Election Commission (SEC) said precautions would be taken. But just as the election was under way, TOI had on April 24 first reported that several teachers had died after panchayat election duty with Covid-19 symptoms — teachers’ unions put the toll at 1,621 after the polls ended. Initially, the government counted only those who had died within 24 hours of poll duty. The state’s basic education department had then said that election duty “starts when an employee reaches the training centre and ends after he completes the polling or the counting and leaves the booth.” If someone died within those few hours, their families would be eligible for compensation. When that was extended to a 30-day window — Covid-19 symptoms take time to appear — the number of those eligible for the Rs 30-lakh compensation went up. The basic education department said the responsibility of final identification was not theirs. “The applications of beneficiaries were uploaded from every district under the supervision of district magistrates after verification. The basic education department had provided them with a list of employees who died during the election period,” Uttar Pradesh director general of school education Vijay Kiran Anand said on Thursday. “The final shortlisting was done after verification of documents. We don’t have any direct role in finalising the names.” The government, in turn, said the state polling body was accountable. “The announcement of three beneficiaries was made after the SEC found three beneficiaries under the old guidelines,” basic education minister Satish Dwivedi told TOI. “The number of beneficiaries increased after the guidelines were revised. The list of beneficiaries has been forwarded to the UP panchayati raj department. The compensation will be paid by it because the election was conducted for the panchayats. The SEC has sent the final list of beneficiaries. We have no direct role in it.” For those grappling with uncertainty, the announcement has come as a long-due relief. “Our life is in disarray,” said Abhay Deep, 17, whose father Mahesh Prasad had died of Covid-19 on April 25 after his poll duty in Lakhimpur Kheri. “My father was the sole earning member. Even the PF (provident fund) file has not been approved. But now, I think, our situation will improve.” But there are still those who have been left out. Like Anurag Rathore, whose father Ramkaran died in May. “My father didn’t come back after leaving for poll duty (in Shahjahanpur) on April 29. The following morning, we found him unconscious at the venue where ballot boxes had been deposited. He died days later,” Anurag said. “We were told there was no Covid-positive report and we were not eligible for compensation. Was it not the government’s responsibility (to get him tested)?” An influential teachers’ union, Prathmik Shikshak Sangh, which had compiled the list of those who died, will now seek inclusion of those who have been left out. “We are happy that the state has announced compensation for 1,071 teachers but many families are still waiting for what is rightfully theirs. Many people, especially in rural areas, couldn’t get the test done. In many places, there weren’t enough testing centres,” he said. “We will fight for them now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/finally-up-to-compensate-kin-of-1071-teachers-949-staff-who-died-of-covid-on-poll-duty-up-from-3/articleshow/84452016.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Dehradun||Only 13% adult population fully inoculated in Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand has been able to inoculate only 13% (10 lakh) of its total adult population, which is estimated to be around 77 lakh in the past five and a half months, according to data accessed by TOI. Haridwar, which has the maximum adult population (15.7 lakh) out of all the 13 districts, has administered jabs to barely 1.21 lakh (7.7%) beneficiaries. Similarly, Udham Singh Nagar that has around 14 lakh adults, has seen complete inoculation of barely 97,000 beneficiaries. Those involved in the vaccination drive say that the slow pace of delivery of vaccines is hitting the entire exercise and may expose the population in case of a third wave. “Earlier, it was the reluctant attitude of people owing to misconceptions related to vaccination and now it is limited dosage availability that is hitting the vaccination drive,” said SN Jha, chief medical officer of Haridwar. The data accessed by TOI further reveals that till July 12, districts with minimum full vaccination coverage are US Nagar (6.9%), Haridwar (7.7%), Nainital (13%), Pithoragarh (13.6%), Tehri (14.6%), Pauri (16.2%), Rudraprayag (16.5%), Dehradun (16.7%), Champawat (16.8%), Almora (17.2%), Chamoli (19.7%), Uttarkashi (22.9%) and Bageshwar (23.3%). Till date, the state has received around 50 lakh vaccines, and 27.98 lakh adults are yet to receive even the first dose of vaccination. Incidentally, health minister Dhan Singh Rawat is confident that the state will touch 20 lakh jabs per month to meet its ambitious target to immunise everyone by December-end. Experts, though, said that “a lot of micro-level planning needs to be done to reach that point.” To meet its target, the health department has also entered into an agreement with the Azim Premji Foundation to pilot their vaccination drives in four "difficult" parts of the state - mainly areas with minority and tribal population. The fear of vaccines is much higher here. Ambrish Bisht, state coordinator of Azim Premji Foundation in Uttarakhand, told TOI, “Our pilot work aims for micro-level planning in the identified blocks so that vaccine is administered to everyone and both the doses are received within the stipulated time frame.” He added, “Initially, in the first 2-3 months, people were reluctant in Haridwar and US Nagar too, but gradually they overcame their fears, particularly after the 18+ category showed some urgency. The hesitancy among the 45+ age group has significantly reduced now. For instance, in Haridwar, almost 55% of the 45 plus age group has been vaccinated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/only-13-adult-population-fully-inoculated-in-uttarakhand/articleshow/84452014.cms||Shivani Azad

Police said the teens were in a romantic relationship and committed suicide as they were aware that their families won’t agree to the marriage. Bodies of Amita Rathwa (16) and Divyesh Rathwa (15) were spotted by the villagers early in the morning and they alerted the cops. Amita was a Class X student while Divyesh studied in Class IX. They stayed in the same locality called Zer Faliya. Police sub-inspector AM Bariya, who is holding charge of the Rajgadh police station said, “Preliminary investigation had revealed that the boy and the girl were having a relationship. Since they were residents of the same village, it was not possible for them to get married as per the local customs and rules.” Bariya said that the families of the girl and the boy may not have approved of their relationship. The police are still looking into these details.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/girl-studying-in-ssc-class-9-boy-hang-selves/articleshow/84452133.cms||---
---||Pune||First year technical courses to begin by October 25: AICTE||PUNE: Classes for existing technical education courses will have to start latest by October 1, but those for the first-year students will begin by October 25, as per the latest schedule declared by the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) for 2021-22. Students will be able to cancel their admissions and get full refund only if they apply before October 15. Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) officials said that they will be able to follow the schedule if there is no further delay in the Common Entrance Test (CET) and subsequent Centralised Admission Process (CAP) for admission to the technical courses. As per AICTE, the last date of admission for first-year students is October 20. Manohar Chaskar, dean, faculty of science and technology (SPPU), said that while the technical courses will follow AICTE guidelines, the scheduling of the academic calendar comes under the purview of universities. Chaskar said, “Most principals of colleges had written to us that they need some time after the second-semester examinations and declaration of results to start the next academic year. After looking into their demands and the AICTE schedule, we will draw up the academic calendar for engineering students. October 1 is easily doable for us.” “If there is any further delay in CET or admission process, then adhering to the first-year admission timeline may prove difficult,” added Chaskar. Parag Kalkar, dean, faculty of commerce and management, SPPU, said that management admissions will be completed within the time limit prescribed by the AICTE. The final-year exam will be completed by August 1, and the results will be declared by August 15, giving the Directorate of Technical Education enough time to conduct the CET, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/first-year-tech-courses-to-begin-by-oct-25-aicte/articleshow/84454292.cms||Ardhra Nair

Following directions from the state government to stop consumption of alcohol and smoking at religious places, Uttarakhand Police will now check upon tourists coming to Devbhoomi and causing ruckus. A few days ago, a video of tourists sitting with hookah on the banks of the Ganga at Har ki Pauri had gone viral. The local priests and shopkeepers had even got into an altercation with the youths. Director general of police Ashok Kumar said that those found smoking or drinking at religious spots will be immediately arrested and stringent action will be initiated against them. “The tourists coming to Uttarakhand are being welcomed, but they must keep up with the prescribed norms and ensure that it doesn’t affect the emotions of the people and cause damage to the place,” the DGP said. He added that those found littering will be fined under sections 51 and 52 of the Police Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-police-begins-drive-to-check-smoking-liquor-consumption-at-religious-places/articleshow/84452024.cms||Abhijeet Singh
---||Ahmedabad||RIL’s new energy biz may be valued at Rs 2.6L cr in 5 yrs: Report||Ahmedabad: Reliance Industries Ltd’s decision to invest Rs 75,000 crore in solar, batteries, fuel cells and electrolyzer manufacturing near Jamnagar in Gujarat could create valuation of $36 billion (Rs 2.6 trillion) in five years’ time for the new energy business, according to a report by Bernstein Research, a leading Wall Street’s research and brokerage firm. The report published on July 15 states that the company’s new energy business strategy can contribute almost 10% of the company’s total EBITDA by FY26 if all goes as planned. The report ‘Green machine. How much is the new energy worth?’ says that RIL’s strategy is analogous to the ‘pick shovels over mines’ approach. “Many oil companies have tried and failed to become clean energy manufacturing companies and instead focus on clean energy production. RIL focus on manufacturing is distinctive and potentially offers higher margins but is also higher risk given their limited capabilities in clean energy,” it says. RIL will need to find partners to work with them given the technology requirements needed for fuel cells and batteries. Last month, RIL announced its plan to spend Rs 75,000 crore over the next few years for the new energy business. It will spend Rs 60,000 crore to construct four “giga factories” to make integrated solar PV modules, electrolyzers, fuel cells and batteries to store energy from the grid. The site of these plants will be located at the new 5,000 acres Green Energy Giga Complex in Jamnagar. For solar, RIL is planning to enter the solar manufacturing and generation with a target of 100GW of solar energy by 2030. From oil and gas to telecom, to retail & internet, it's hard to think of another company which has re-invented itself as much as RIL has done over the past decade, the report states while calling it a bold move. While it is unclear as to whether RIL will be successful, it is too early to discount them given their track record of successfully disrupting other industries, such as telecom and retail, it adds. Many integrated oil and gas companies have announced plans to invest in solar, wind or hydrogen production as they transition their portfolios away from fossil fuels and towards low carbon energy. “But what is unique about RIL’s strategy is that they are focusing on the equipment required to produce clean energy rather than clean energy production itself. For example, RIL will be manufacturing solar PV panels and energy storage equipment (batteries), rather than investing in solar power,” it said. Here comes the sun The logic of investing in clean energy is compelling as $70 trillion are likely be spent globally on the energy transition over the next 30 years, according to the report. While India has yet to declare a net zero target, the direction towards low carbon is clear. With solar becoming cheaper than coal and hydrogen reaching cost parity with diesel, there are clear economic and energy security reasons to believe that India will transition towards clean energy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rils-new-energy-biz-may-be-valued-at-rs-2-6l-cr-in-5-yrs-report/articleshow/84471884.cms||Maulik Pathak

The bridge was the lifeline of villagers, and army personnel posted at the China border. Now, villagers are facing problems crossing the ravine at Kulagad to go to Dharchula, which is at a distance of 10km, said Salu Datal, a local resident. After the bridge got washed away, the Border Roads Organisation put together a few logs across the nullah. However, the logs also got washed away in the rains and the BRO had to again put some across the ravine to help people cross the seasonal nullah. Although the logs are proving to be a helpful stopgap measure, nevertheless it's scary and dangerous to walk across it with a raging nullah flowing just a few feet under. Climb Beyond the Summit (CBTS), a local NGO, is also helping villagers cross the log-bridge to commute to Dharchula. “Our organization asked the administration for permission to help the villagers cross the ravine at Kulagad as we are trained in mountaineering,” said Kala Baral, a member of the CSBT. The NGO workers have safety harnesses tied to them, and they accompany each person, holding his or her hand, crossing the log-bridge. Older people and children especially need more help while crossing. “Our10-member team has helped more than a 1,000 people cross the ravine since July 12,” Baral added. The NGO workers have also pitched in with transporting ration, petrol and diesel for army and police forces across the nullah which is in spate. Along with the Kulagad bridge, the rains and landslides also damaged roads in Darma and Chaudas valleys. In Darma valley, the roads are so badly damaged that it’s taking locals 24 hours to reach Dharchula instead of the usual five, informed Jaman Singh, gram pradhan, Dantu. “Villagers are wasting a lot of time and money in reaching Dharchula,” he added. “It will take four to five days for the construction of a new bridge at Kulagad. Till then the BRO has put wooden logs at that place to cross,” said A K Shukla, sub-divisional magistrate, Dharchula. “A team of the State Disaster Response Force is posted there and volunteers of the CBTS are also helping people. Orders have been given to various departments to open the roads in the higher Himalayas,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bridges-washed-away-locals-in-upper-himalayan-areas-face-difficulties-in-crossing-ravines/articleshow/84452037.cms||Prem Punetha

In Pune district, nearly 90 schools in Covid-free villages started functioning from Thursday. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) issued a notification on Thursday stating that schools in the corporation limits would remain shut until July 31. Students said that the offline classes will provide a huge respite since they are in crucial years of education and remote learning did not help them understand some concepts as well as they would like. On the other hand, teachers pointed out that initially only 50% students are being called to class on alternate days in order to maintain safety measures. At some villages, getting the requisite permissions from gram panchayats was an issue. Middle school education officer at Pune Zilla Parishad (ZP) Sunanda Thube said, “Schools have been preparing to reopen for one week. Finally, schools began across the district where permission was granted by the gram panchayat.” Most schools in the district had 50% attendance as per government rules. Sanjay Dhote, a school teacher from Ambegaon taluka, said, “We started with Science today and students were eager to be back in class. There was excitement and anxiety among the students. We are planning to complete major topics while we are allowed to have classroom sessions. It will prove helpful to the students.” Meanwhile, president of the Maharashtra English School Trustees Association (MESTA), Sanjayrao Tayde Patil, said that nearly 2,000 schools across the state were not granted permission by the village sarpanch on safety grounds. He added, “The consent from parents to send their children to school is enough. This new rule of permission from village gram panchayat has been posing issues in many schools on day one. The rule should be withdrawn, and parents’ consent should be only a condition.” Pupils turn up to learn all over the state More than 300 of 13,000 schools under Nashik ZP had registered to start classes from July 15 but, as per the education department, only 49 had confirmed that they would conduct physical classes on the first day. SB Deshmukh, president of headmasters’ association in Nashik, said, “Teachers and parents at these schools have expressed their readiness to start physical classes with appropriate safety measures. Gram panchayats have also passed the resolution as per the state government requirement.” Kishore Patole, a parent in Sinnar taluka, said, “My daughter is in Std X. I cannot take a chance with her education, so I have decided to send her to school. The government should take up inoculation of children at the earliest.” Nashik ZP secondary education officer Vaishali Veer said that though some schools have started functioning, others are waiting for clear orders from the education department. “We are evaluating the number of villages that have been Covid-free for at least a month and the data would be presented to the District Disaster Management Authority. The decision taken by the district guardian minister would be conveyed soon,” said Veer. BB Chavan, education officer of Aurangabad Zilla Parishad, said over 850 educational institutions from 446 villages in the district are eligible to reopen. “The remaining schools and junior colleges are also expected to resume their operations after completing necessary formalities,” he said. “The exact number of schools and colleges that have resumed operations would be ascertained in a day or two. Also, there is no official word on resuming schools and junior colleges in urban areas, but their staff are requested to take the vaccine,” Chavan said. Sanjay Vaishnav, principal of the Zilla Parishad School at Chincholi village in Khuldabad taluka, said 18 of 35 students attended offline classes on Thursday. “The joy on the students’ faces was visible. We expect attendance to go up further. We have carried out Covid-testing of all employees and we have ensured proper social distancing in the seating arrangement,” he said. In Kolhapur district, around 1.55 lakh students from 940 schools in 137 Covid-free villages turned up for physical classes on Thursday. Kiran Lohar, the head of secondary education department of Kolhapur ZP said the number includes both ZP as well as private schools. Next week, 200 more schools are expected to open.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/finally-schools-reopen-in-covid-free-villages/articleshow/84454354.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

This was announced by UDH minister Shanti Dhariwal on Thursday. In the rankings of 100 cities in the country, Udaipur came fifth, Kota 10th, Ajmer 22nd and Jaipur 28th. Under the Smart City scheme, new public utility works were initiated in cities such as Jaipur, Udaipur, Ajmer and Kota in consultation with public representatives as per Smart City guidelines. “Time-bound implementation of works, based on critical path method and programme evaluation and review technique (CPM-PERT), has been done and works effectively monitored. The pace of development works has been maintained even during the period of pandemic. As a result, citizens could get the desired benefits and Rajasthan has been able to get the first place in the country,” Dhariwal said. The state has taken the first position beating Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. The rankings are based mainly on the implementation of the project, the financial progress made, utilisation of funds received and providing information to the Centre from time to time. Under the mission, projects worth Rs 3,811 crore have been planned. So far, Rs 1,997 crore has been received for projects in four cities, among others, and an amount of Rs 1,700 crore has been spent on various projects. Against the total amount, Rs 1,078 crore has been released by the Centre, with the state providing Rs 660 crore for the same. Some 161 works, worth Rs 718 crore for 370 projects in four cities, have been completed. And 168 works worth Rs 2,660 crore are in progress and 24 worth Rs 269 crore are under process. The work orders of those under process will be issued soon. Works to be done under the Smart City Mission in the state mainly include expansion of medical and sports facilities, water supply, solid waste management, civic education, works for public needs and strengthening of urban infrastructure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/smart-raj-makes-amission-statementtops-nation-rankings/articleshow/84456908.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Subsidies for fossil fuels still going up, funds for renewables falling||NAGPUR: From Rs15,740 crore in 2017, the total subsidy for renewable energy in India fell by nearly 45% to Rs8,577 crore in 2020, reveals a latest study, which highlights the country’s need to increase financial support for renewable energy to reach its goals for Aatmanirbhar Bharat and clean energy transition. The report ‘Mapping India’s Energy Subsidies 2021: Time for renewed support to clean energy’ was released on Thursday by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) and the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW). The study found that support for fossil fuels has increased, hitting Rs70,578 crore in 2020. “This is over seven times the sum of subsidies to clean energy. Subsidies for coal have not decreased in 2020 and remain greater than those for renewable,” the report stated. According to IISD and CEEW experts, new funding for clean energy is crucial to progress the transition that is already underway in India. They also pointed to positive trends, such as the increasing subsidies for electric vehicles. “Since 2019, electric vehicle subsidies have risen more than 2.3 times, reaching Rs1,141 crore in 2020. This has happened due to growing public demand for electric mobility,” they said. Researchers also noted that full benefits of electric transport can only be achieved if there is a green electricity mix. “Renewable energy subsidies are at a standstill due to a combination of factors, including grid-scale solar and wind achieving market parity, lower deployment levels, and subsidy schemes nearing the end of their allocation period,” the report added. On the other hand, oil and gas subsidies jumped 16% from 2019 to 2020, largely due to financial support for household consumption of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). “However, LPG subsidies were suspended during the 2021 oil price crash and have not yet been reintroduced. This may reduce oil and gas subsidies in future years, but has led to new concerns around clean energy access, as no alternative support for clean cooking has been provided,” the study stated. Experts stressed that reforming fossil fuel subsidies can generate valuable additional resources for economic recovery from Covid-19 and investments in clean energy. “Redirecting a share of coal tax revenues to clean energy and supporting communities, regions, and livelihoods impacted by the transition will help ensure a just and equitable energy transition,” says co-author of the study Prateek Aggarwal from CEEW, adding that the government should also encourage public sector undertakings, which are currently investing more in fossil fuels, to set ambitious targets for high levels of investment in clean energy. Stating that it is hard to imagine achieving clean energy goals without the right support policies, co-author Balasubramanian Viswanathan of IISD said, “It is time for a new wave of support measures focused on emerging technologies such as grid integration and storage, decentralized renewable energy, green hydrogen, and offshore wind. India must deploy historic levels of about 39GW every year to meet its admirable target of 450GW of renewables by 2030.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/subsidies-for-fossil-fuels-still-going-up-funds-for-renewables-falling/articleshow/84454438.cms||Manka Behl

The kids were rescued by police on Wednesday after the mother of one of the children appealed for help at a police outpost. Sub-inspector Ajay Shukla, who was part of the rescue team, said, “The kids were tied to a tree in the compound of a dairy in Baradari area. They were covered in bruises and shivering with fear. The dairy owner had picked them from their homes and accused them of stealing his cellphone." "He was torturing them so he could get a confession. They were taken to the district hospital for first-aid,” the sub-inspector added. A case has been lodged against the dairy owner Avdhesh Yadav, his wife and four of his relatives under sections 363 (abduction), 452 (house trespass), 342 (wrongful confinement), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 504 (intentional insult) of the Indian Penal Code. SP (city) Ravindra Kumar said Yadav was detained for questioning but the other accused managed to flee the scene. “The rescued children belonged to nearby areas and were handed over to their family members after a medical examination was conducted and they were administered first-aid.” According to the complainant, who is a daily wager, Yadav had barged into her house and taken away her son early morning on Wednesday while she was at work. Her neighbours informed her about the incident following which she went to the dairy and found her son tied alongside four others. “The kids were left under the sun for several hours and they said they were given electric shocks on their legs. I pleaded with the man to let the children go but he refused so I went to the nearest police outpost for help. I want strict action against the accused,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/5-kids-accused-of-stealing-mobiles-tied-to-tree-and-given-electric-shocks-6-booked/articleshow/84452084.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The bench of chief justice RS Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma has issued notices to the state government, social welfare department, police and the welfare council of senior citizens asking them to respond to the petition in four weeks. The PIL, filed by Doon-based lawyer Vikesh Singh Negi, argued that the Act was passed in 2007 and the rules were notified in 2011 by the state government. However, the provisions are yet to be implemented. The Act provides for setting up of an appropriate mechanism for providing better medical facilities to senior citizens. It also casts a responsibility on the administration to set up mechanisms for protection of their lives and property and for setting up old age homes. The petition said that RTI replies obtained in Dehradun district have shown that almost no data is available regarding the work done for the upkeep of old age homes. It added that no timely assistance has been provided to the elderly during the Covid pandemic and that even the police department has failed in carrying out its responsibilities. The 2011 rules had mandated that each police station shall keep an updated list of old people living in its jurisdiction and the official should visit these people at least once a month. The PIL added the situation in most of the state's police stations is the same and senior citizens have to face daily troubles due to neglect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-hc-sends-notice-to-state-govt-over-old-age-homes-directs-to-respond-in-4-weeks/articleshow/84452097.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Mumbai||Mumbai:Bhujbal meets Fadnavis on OBC quota, asks him to brief babus on restoring it||Mumbai: Cabinet minister Chhagan Bhujbal called on BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis at his official residence at Malabar Hill to discuss the OBC reservation issue on Thursday. After the meeting, Fadnavis told the media that Bhujbal wanted to understand how to gather empirical data on the OBC community. Recently, the Supreme Court struck down electoral reservations for the community in Maharashtra as the government had not backed it with empirical data. “I explained to him how we had gathered empirical data for the Maratha community which was also upheld by the courts. We are willing to work with the government and there is no politics in this,” said the former CM. Fadnavis said it was crucial to draw up the data and settle the issue of electoral reservation for the OBC community at the earliest as there are major local self-government elections slated early next year. The BMC elections are due in February 2022. Fadnavis has been the loudest voice proclaiming BJP will not allow elections to local bodies unless the reservations are restored. Bhujbal said he had met Fadnavis in his capacity as a leader from the OBC community. “As in the case of Maratha reservation, where all political parties came together, I met Fadnavis to tell him that in this case too, we must all speak in one voice. Fadnavis, through the media, has said OBC reservation can be restored within three months. I have requested him to hold discussions with our lawyers, the advocate general and the Backward Commission to explain how it can be done,” said Bhujbal, adding the meeting will be held on Monday or Tuesday. “The OBC reservation was granted by Sharad Pawar nearly 27 years ago. He is upset about the reservation being scrapped. The chief minister is fully in favour of granting the reservation as also Congress. Fadnavis has said he will come for the meeting,” said Bhujbal. The food and civil supplies minister said the state government has decided to approach the Supreme Court to direct the Centre to share the empirical data on the community with the state to enable restoration of reservations. During the monsoon session, both house of the legislature passed a resolution asking the Centre to share the data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaibhujbal-meets-fadnavis-on-obc-quota-asks-him-to-brief-babus-on-restoring-it/articleshow/84459086.cms||Clara Lewis

He also met chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat and chief of National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) Anil Dhasmana at Uttarakhand Sadan in the national capital. Border area development, drone technology and migration were some of the key issues which came up for discussion in the meeting between the CM and Gen Rawat and Dhasmana, a communique from the CM’s office said. Plans to stop migration, especially from border areas were also discussed. The CM requested the CDS to restart the Army recruitment rallies which could not be held due to Covid. General Rawat assured all possible cooperation in the development of the border areas of the state while the NTRO chief said that assistance will be given to the state for the development of drone technology. Dhami also met Ashwini Vaishnaw, the Union minister of railways, telecom, electronics and information technology, and discussed various projects related to Uttarakhand. For the Deoband-Roorkee rail project, Uttarakhand has till now contributed Rs 296.67 crore. Considering the contribution as “sufficient,” Dhami requested the minister that the remaining funds for the project be provided by the Railways ministry and Uttar Pradesh government. Dhami said that in view of the strategic objective and the need for development of marginal districts, survey of Tanakpur-Bageshwar railway line should be for broad gauge instead of narrow gauge. Besides, he also sought the approval for construction of the Rishikesh-Uttarkashi rail line. Dhami also urged for early approval of the construction of a diversion line at Raiwala railway station to provide direct rail facility from Doiwala to Rishikesh. In addition, Dhami requested for doubling of Haridwar-Dehradun railway line for which a DPR of Rs 1,024 crore has been made. The CM said that the work on Rishikesh-Karnprayag railway line is being carried out at a rapid pace. Dhami also urged for the construction of Dhampur-Kashipur (via Jaspur) railway line and early approval of Corbett Eco-Express from Delhi to Ramnagar. The CM requested for issuing administrative and financial approval of Bharat Net Phase-02 project in Uttarakhand under the “State Lead” model at the earliest. The Union minister assured of all possible cooperation. Later, Dhami met Union tourism minister G Kishan Reddy.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Controversial plaques on Haldighati battle removed||JAIPUR: The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has removed the controversial plaques at Rakta Talai in Rajsamand stating that Maharana Pratap's forces had retreated in the battle of Haldighati in 1576 CE and the Badhshai Bagh one which wrongly claimed to be named after Mughal Emperor Akbar. The move came two days after Union minister of state for culture Arjun Ram Meghwal issued the order for the same. The plaque was removed by officials at 3pm. Two more plaques were removed by the team later at Chetak Samadhi and Haldighati, saying that the content, size and font were not in tune with the standard ASI format. Bipin Chandra Negi, superintendent, ASI Circle Jodhpur, told TOI, “Since the order has been received from the higher-ups, the controversial plaques at Rakta Talai and Badshahi Bagh have been removed and new plaques will be placed at the same spot soon.” These plaques were placed in 1975 during the visit of the former prime minister Indira Gandhi by the state government. Then they were part of the state government. Later in 2003, they were declared monuments of national importance and acquired by the ASI. Of the four sites, the plaque at Rakta Talai sparked major controversy which read the following: ‘Pratap forces retreated and Pratap Ke Sena Ko Peeche Hatna Pada.’ “The new content will highlight the valour and sacrifice of Pratap. It will also state the fact that it was Akbar who had waged the war with Pratap and never succeeded in his ambition of taking over Mewar. The larger aim is to bring the accurate narrative of the historical event, remove controversial/debatable statements and erect the plaque in the ASI format,” said Negi. The demand for its removal was first made on June 13, 2021, on Maharana Pratap's birth anniversary. It soon gained support after newly elected MLA Deepti Maheswari and MP Rajsamand Diya Kumari raised the issue with former Union culture minister Prahlad Singh Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/controversial-plaques-onhaldighati-battle-removed/articleshow/84456959.cms||---

The company said despite the economic downturn in India, they were confident enough in the resilience of the economy in the long-term. “We have bought additional land near our subsidiary WABCO to set up a new plant, primarily aimed at our commercial vehicles business. We feel that the concerns about the economy in India are short-sighted and we must view India from a global perspective. The country is a manufacturing and sourcing hub, there is a lot of talent in the country in engineering and software, as well as services and accounting. We want to take advantage of these strengths of India in the longer term,” said Holger Klein, member of ZF’s management board, who oversees the company’s India and Asia-Pacific operations. The company said it was also encouraged by the shift to BS-VI, as well as the scrappage policy that goes into the effect from the beginning of the next fiscal year. It also highlighted concerns that it had faced over the past year, including spiralling raw material prices. “Last year was a very difficult time, and the industry was in a bad shape. We never thought we would face a situation where prices of raw material, such as steel, would rise by 60-70%. But the recovery was fast once the economy opened up. This year too, there was a two-month impact due to the second wave. But we are getting good orders since the second half of June and the ongoing month, with good exports. Like others in the sector, we are balancing the situation with good exports,” said P Kaniappan, managing director of ZF-WABCO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/200mn-investment-planned-in-india-zf/articleshow/84455280.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Dehradun||In absence of rainfall, drought-like situation prevails in Uttarakhand’s Terai region||RUDRAPUR: Insufficient rainfall, depleting groundwater, and fall in reservoir levels have hit farming activities adversely in the Terai region of Uttarakhand. The drought-like situation has also created a fodder shortage in Udham Singh Nagar. According to RK Singh, a meteorologist at the Govind Ballabh Pant University, the rainfall deficit for the current month has been recorded at 80.8%. Jawahar Lal Bathla, a 51-year-old paddy farmer from the Dineshpur area of the district, said, “The crop should be two feet high by now but it has just come off the ground. There is no growth as there is no rainfall.” Abhay Saxena, district agriculture officer, said, “The average expense of cultivating paddy crops has increased by Rs 2,000 per acre. The underground water level has also depleted by an average of 2.8 metres and borewells dug up to even 150 feet have dried up.” Meanwhile, the long dry spell has also led to water scarcity in Dineshpur, Kichha, Rudrapur, Bazpur and Jaspur towns. Officials have said if there is no rainfall by next week, the situation may worsen. “The monsoon clouds built up in the area several times but due to pressure drifts, they shifted to hilly areas of the state. The southwest monsoon is likely to remain sluggish in the coming days in the Terai region. The situation is grim,” added Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-absence-of-rainfall-drought-like-situation-prevails-in-ukhands-terai-region/articleshow/84452150.cms||Aakash Ahuja

On the inputs of military intelligence, the Crime Branch had arrested an army naik, Paramjit, and one Habib Khan, who was a contractor for groceries at the Pokhran army base. It has come to fore that Paramjit was in touch with Habib since February 2018, an official said. "Earlier, the ISI handlers paid Rs 4,000-5,000 to Paramjit for every set of document. In November 2019, Paramjit got posted in Agra where he had access to more discreet documents and therefore, his payments were increased too," the official added. Apart from payments per document, Paramjit was also paid around Rs 50,000 per month of late, Habib has told cops. Paramjit, cops said, had a loan and so he accepted the offer. Six mobile sets have been recovered from him, which are being analysed. Cops have also launched an investigation to trace a suspect codenamed Kamal who is learnt to be based in Pak High Commission in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-to-conduct-psychological-profiling-of-two-suspects-held-in-espionage-case/articleshow/84487439.cms||---

The UP government told the Allahabad high court, which has been hearing the retired Naik’s case, that “action has been taken” and a preliminary inquiry is being conducted. The high court had in its last hearing said the case “shows a very sorry state of affairs and police atrocities”. TOI had on June 19 reported that Singh — who had served in the Army for 18 years, retired as a Naik with an “exemplary” record and been felicitated for his role in a 2004 Poonch operation that took down six militants — had been allegedly beaten up and sodomised by police officials but ended up facing an FIR himself. “Perusal of the injury reports and first information reports prima facie, shows a very sorry state of affairs and police atrocities. It, prima facie, indicates breach of fundamental rights of the petitioners guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India by the accused police officers,” the July 8 order said. “The matter is serious and requires a serious consideration by this court.” On July 12, at the next hearing, the UP government told the high court the accused police officers, SI Sunil Kumar Sharma and IO Ram Naresh Singh, have been suspended. If the preliminary inquiry finds them guilty, they will be arrested, the court was told. “The SIT was set up in June,” IG Ramit Sharma said on Thursday. “Since the matter is listed in high court, the investigation team has gone to Allahabad.” On May 3, Singh was on his way from Pilibhit to his brother-in-law’s funeral at Lakhimpur Kheri when, around 9am, police officials stopped his car and asked for his papers. “It took some time to sort out the papers,” his petition to the high court said, and the police officials “started abusing” him and his family members — he was travelling with his elderly mother, 82, and two sisters. Singh asked them to stop and told them he was a retired Army man. Inspector Ram Naresh Singh from the Puranpur police station, the petition said, started beating him up with “fist blows, kicks and lathis”. Others with him — inspector Raees Ahmed and unidentified police constables — beat up his mother and sisters. Singh and his family were then taken to the police station where he was “disrobed and then tied up on a cot”, beaten up and then tortured. The cops reportedly threatened to cut his hair — considered sacrilege in Sikhism — after Ram Naresh and the other cops “inserted a danda/lathi inside (his) anus/rectum”, the petition said. At some point, locals stepped in and shot a video which, Singh alleged, was deleted by the police but it managed to stop them from torturing him further. Before Singh could report what had happened, police issued a challan against him. Getting a medical report was difficult because, he said, “doctors did not examine him” at the hospital police sent him to. Eventually, he got himself examined at the Military Hospital in Bareilly. He was in “excruciating pain” by then because of “injuries in his rectum”. On Thursday, Singh said, “I have trust in Bareilly Police but my biggest hope is the judiciary. Police should take the medical report of the Army Hospital into consideration … and quash the case against me, my family and the two innocent men who shot the videos.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/sit-to-probe-police-torture-of-retd-army-man-up-tells-hc-after-it-indicts-sorry-state-of-affairs/articleshow/84452163.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Hyderabad||2 arrested for helping conmen siphon off Rs 1.96cr from bank||Hyderabad: Cyber crime sleuths of Hyderabad arrested two persons from Serlingampally for colluding with an African national in siphoning off Rs 1.96 crore from Telangana State Co-operative Apex Bank’s core bank account. The accused have been identified as Yaseen Basha and his brother Md Rafi from Serilingampally. On Wednesday, S Srinivasa Rao, deputy general manager of Telangana State Co-operative Apex Bank in Troop Bazar, lodged a complaint mentioning that they have noticed fraudulent cyber-transactions in the bank through IMPS channel amounting to Rs 1.96 crore between July 9 and July 13. The fraudulent transactions originated from three customer accounts created in the bank’s branches at Secunderabad and Chandanagar. “There was unauthorised access to the bank’s network and from the core account, the amount was transferred to two of the three accounts created on July 9 at Chandanagar and Secunderabad branches,” the complainant alleged. After a quick probe, police arrested the brothers on Thursday. “The duo said that they were contacted by an African national from Tolichowki area offering to pay 10% commission for opening bank accounts and letting him use the accounts for financial frauds. The accused claimed that after they opened the bank accounts, they transferred Rs 2 lakh into Yaseen’s account and Rs 1.94 crore into another account opened in the name of a woman in Secunderabad branch. An unknown associate of the African man had hacked into the bank’s server and transferred the amount in these accounts. Yaseen withdrew Rs 2 lakh and gave Rs 1.8 lakh to the African after deducting his commission on the morning of July 14. The Rs 1.94 crore in the Secunderabad branch account was subsequently moved to 10 other bank accounts across the country. After a total of 102 fraudulent transactions, the money was withdrawn by the fraudsters at various places,” Cyber crime ACP KVM Prasad said. The woman who opened the account in Secunderabad and the African who identified himself as Wilson are yet to be located.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2-arrested-for-helping-conmen-siphon-off-rs-1-96cr-from-bank/articleshow/84456925.cms||---

He was accompanied by MLAs Glenn Ticlo (Aldona), Jayesh Salgaonkar (Saligao) and Joshua D’Souza (Mapusa), zilla panchayat members, sarpanchs of neighbouring villages, senior officers of PWD, WRD and agriculture. “It won’t be wrong to say that is partly a man-made issue,” said the chief minister after seeing both sides of the highway inundated. As a short term measure, Sawant said that he has instructed PWD and WRD to unclog the water channels. He said that there are many factors for the flooding, including dumping of mud and debris by the contractor undertaking the highway expansion work, land-filling by some people in the vicinity, besides heavy rain and tidal effect. The chief minister said he read news reports on the flooding in Guirim. TOI has highlighted the issue over the past three days, including a front page photo which showed that one cannot distinguish between the highway and the fields. Neighbouring villages are cut off from each other due to the flooding. While some locals said that the area gets flooded every year during heavy rain, however, this time, the situation is much worse. As part of the long-term measures, Sawant said he has directed officers to conduct an inspection of the river so that desiltation can be carried out to prevent such instances in the future. He also asked the agriculture department to assess the damage caused to cultivators. The chief minister expressed regret for the inconvenience caused to people owing to the flooding. “This is a catchment area, so water flows down from Parra, Socorro and Guirim, and accumulates at this spot. Hence, the tributary of Tar river needs to be dredged. This will help prevent flooding at this area,” said Salgaonkar, adding that he held several meetings in the past to resolve the issue, including when he was ports minister. He also said that another reason for the flooding could be due to the illegal land-filling. There were heated arguments as Gurim locals questioned the Saligao MLA over the flooding at the Namoshi junction. In the past two days of heavy rainfall, roads in Guirim, including the stretch road from Namoshi junction to the Guirim panchayat have been submerged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/guirim-flooding-is-man-made-cm-after-site-visit/articleshow/84459168.cms||---

The month of July has so far recorded 330.2 mm of rainfall while the average for the month is 1,332.5 mm. The quantum of rainfall received this month is lesser than what was received in June this year, when the average rainfall was 505 mm recorded in the first 10 days of June. This was a day after the onset of monsoon was declared over the city on June 9 this year. This June witnessed 961.4 mm of rainfall — third highest in the last decade. Officials said that while there is no chance of ‘heavy’ rain over the weekend, only light showers can be expected. Rainfall recorded in the 24 hours ending 8.30am on Thursday by the Colaba observatory was 51.8 mm and at Santacruz observatory it was 37.8mm. On Thursday, the city recorded meagre rain activity with the Colaba observatory recording 0.8 mm and Santacruz observatory recording 3.2 mm. The Met department’s warning for fishermen stays in place due to strong winds expected. “Fishermen are advised not to venture into these areas,” said weather officials. Total rainfall recorded so far by Colaba and Santacruz observatories has crossed the 1,000mm mark till Thursday.

---||Kochi||Highway heist: SIT to submit chargesheet||Thrissur: The Special Investigating Team (SIT) probing the highway heist case is likely to submit the first chargesheet before the court at Irinjalakuda on July 23. According to sources the BJP will have reasons to be relieved as the chargesheet is unlikely to name anyone in the party though the SIT officers have questioned many leaders, including the state president Surendran. Official sources said the chargesheet will cover only the robbery part and will name only the accused related to the case. The investigators will look at the other angles in the case like who owned the looted money and its intended destination in a supplementary chargesheet. If the investigators zero in on some credible evidence linking BJP leaders to the looted money, they may include it in the supplementary chargesheet,. Simultaneously they are likely to give a report to the central agencies, including the Enforcement Directorate. The prosecution seems to be keen to prevent the possibility of the arrested accused in the case getting bail by submitting an initial chargesheet before 90 days of the arrest since the arrest of the first accused. The SIT has arrested 22 people in connection with the case and all of them are lodged in jail as remand prisoners. Various Sections like IPC 395 related to highway robbery case, IPC 201 (destruction of evidence) , IPC 120 B (conspiracy) and IPC 143, 147 (illegal assembly) are likely to be slapped on the arrested persons in the chargesheet, the sources said. The SIT has recovered only about Rs 1.5 crore out of the Rs 3.5 crore believed to have been looted in the case. The robbery had taken place in the wee hours of April 3, however, the complaint was filed only on April 7, and it is not yet fully clear what transpired in between these two dates. Investigations will also have to find out for what purpose the money was transported, the sources added. In the first chargesheet, the SIT is likely to inform the court that further investigations are required to unravel the full dimensions of the case, the sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/highway-heist-sit-to-submit-chargesheet/articleshow/84454516.cms||T Ramavarman

---||Hyderabad||HC slams Telangana govt for poor treatment to teachers of residential schools||HYDERABAD: The high court on Thursday found fault with the state government for playing havoc with the lives of teachers working in state-run residential schools and colleges by resorting to annual terminations and reappointment every year. “When the work is permanent, why cannot you keep them on permanent basis? You are resorting to breaking their careers only to deny them regular jobs,” said Chief Justice Hima Kohli, who along with Justice B Vijaysen Reddy, was hearing a case. The bench was hearing an appeal filed by the state that said the government was aggrieved by an order of a single judge, who ordered regularisation of their services. The bench asked the state to explore possibilities of giving them weightage in the future recruitment of regular teachers and lecturers. The single judge heard as many 116 such teachers who were working as post-graduate teachers, trained graduate teachers, physical education teachers and staff nurses in the residential schools run by Telangana State Residential Educational Institutions Society. All of them had applied to the posts notified by the state education department and the residential schools society between 2002 and 2006. They went through the selection process and were finally selected after the process and all were qualified to hold the notified posts, the plea said. They have been working in their posts for the last 16 years, but the authorities have been terminating them, keeping them vacant for two months every year and were being reappointed to the same posts in the next 10 months. They were getting paid only for 10 months in a year and were suffering a break in service every year, the teachers said. The bench brushed aside the theory proposed by the state that these teachers were not taken in through a regular selection process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-slams-t-for-poor-treatment-to-teachers-of-residential-schools/articleshow/84456960.cms||---

The court has now asked the district administration and the forest department to inspect the site and to inform the bench whether required clearances to fell trees were taken. The bench of chief justice RS Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) on Wednesday which alleged that authorities had granted permission to private respondents for flattening of the land without any field visit. It added that the authorities were informed that there were no trees on the land. The Sal tree (Shorea robusta) is native to India and can easily grow up to 35 m tall. The court directed Dehradun district magistrate, divisional forest officer and sub divisional magistrate (Vikasnagar) to inspect the site. It also said that in case no clearances were taken from the forest department, then the DFO must apprise the court of what action has been taken against those involved for violating the Forest Act and environmental laws. Notices have also been issued to the state, principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) and four private respondents accused of being involved in felling of trees. The PIL filed by Dehradun-based Rakesh Tomar alleged that he had RTI replies which showed that individuals involved in felling the trees have other cases lodged against them for violating environmental laws. All parties have been given four weeks’ time to respond. The next hearing in the matter is on August 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/10k-sal-trees-felled-in-doon-says-plea-hc-directs-admin-to-inspect-site/articleshow/84452186.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Three held for duping retired Panjab University assistant registrar of Rs 48 lakh||CHANDIGARH: The cyber cell of the UT police arrested three persons for allegedly duping a retired assistant registrar of Panjab University of Rs 48 lakh on the pretext of giving a bonus on his matured insurance policy. Police produced both the accused before the local court and obtained their two-day police remand. Cyber police said that the accused have been identified as Atul Abhishek , 37, a resident of Hamirpur, Himachal Pradesh and Hardeep Kumar, 32, a resident of Fazilka, Punjab. Police are grilling them about the involvement of other people in cheating cases in and around the city. During investigations, cyber cell cops found that one account in which the complainant had deposited money was being operated by both the accused. Police used this to trace and arrest them. In his complaint, Tarsem Lal, 70, a resident of Nayagaon, said that he had a life insurance policy and he received his insured amount after maturity of policy in 2013. He said he received a call on his mobile and the caller told him that he was from Davis club company limited and that LIC had declared a bonus of Rs 38.45 lakh in his favour. They told him not to contact LIC as it could claim 40% of the bonus. The accused told him to deposit Rs 25,000 to become a member of the Davis Club and they took Rs 15.82 lakh in the name of advance income tax, approval of bonus money for payment and security etc. In March 2014, he said, the mobile phones of the accused were switched off. The complainant said that he received a call from Jyoti Bhagat and Ganpati Dass on his mobile at the end of March 2014 and they introduced themselves as RBI officials. They assured him that they would get him money back from Davis club within 45 days. They also allegedly got Rs 11.30 lakh invested in the Indus marchant and Mumbai Merchant company. They kept him busy for four months till August 2014, after which their mobile numbers were also switched off. In August,the complainant received another call from one Riya Gupta, and she said that his bonus file was received in the income tax department. She also allegedly took Rs 4.80 lakh from the complainant in the name of advance tax and security in the account. After that, he allegedly received another call from an SBI bank official and she took Rs 4.70 lakh. Thus, the complainant was cheated of Rs 48.46 lakhs over three years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/3-held-for-duping-retired-pu-asst-registrar-of-rs-48-lakh/articleshow/84452190.cms||---

Two more cabinet ministers Bishan Singh Chuphal and Subodh Uniyal were also visible without masks in the photo. The picture is not dated but shows Yatishwaranand, MLA from Haridwar (rural) who is the minister for sugarcane industries, sitting in an indoor meeting with his legs crossed while his face mask is dangling from his toe. The photo was doing the rounds on social media on Wednesday. Congress leader Garima Dasauni shared the picture on her Facebook page while adding that “this showed the minister’s seriousness as he was wearing a mask on his feet, while his face remained uncovered”. All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary, Uttarakhand, Qazi Nizamuddin tweeted the photo with the caption stating: “Uttarakhand ministers have proven that they keep both coronavirus protocols and the coronavirus under their feet.” Congress vice-president Suryakant Dhasmana added that on one hand, the government was telling people to wear masks and follow social distancing norms, but on the other hand, it seems that the rules didn’t apply to its lawmakers. Yatishwaranand was unreachable for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/face-mask-on-foot-ukhand-mins-pic-draws-flak/articleshow/84452192.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal
---||Nagpur||At 2.73 kg waste/house, Satranjipura zone tops in Nagpur's garbage generation||NAGPUR: Residents of Satranjipura zone generate more garbage as compared to those of other 9 zones in the city. Each household generates an average 2.73kg garbage per day, revealed data procured from the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s solid waste management department. As per data from BVG India, which has been entrusted to collect door-to-door garbage, Satranjipura zone has 49,600 property owners. Every day, the firm collects about 135.889 metric tonnes (MT) of garbage from these owners (both residential and commercial). Data of door-to-door garbage collection for June 2021 shows that both BVG India and AG Environ transferred around 1,282.809MT solid waste every day to NMC’s Bhandewadi dumping yard. During Covid-inducted lockdown, the city used to generate around 1,000MT garbage per day and with the opening of commercial establishments, the city’s solid waste witnessed an increase of almost 250MT per day. A senior official from NMC’s solid waste management department admitted that with easing of Covid-19 restrictions, garbage generation of the city has increased marginally. Of the 10 zones, the highest quantity of garbage is being generated by Laxmi Nagar zone. The zone contributes 164.419MT garbage per day. Property owners under Dharampeth zone stood third when it comes to generating solid waste per capita. Here, 65,453 residents and commercial shop owners together generate 2.42kg garbage each, which comes to around 1,58,685kg per day. Residents of Dhantoli zone, considered as a medical hub of central Nagpur, too contribute a huge quantity of garbage. Here, 46,269 property owners generate 1,08,600kg garbage, which means one property owner generates 2.34kg waste per day. Residents of Ashi Nagar, Lakadganj and Hanuman Nagar zones generate lesser garbage as compared to others. As per data, 80,925 houses in Ashi Nagar zone generate 1,34,443kg solid waste and each family dumps around 1.23kg of garbage per day. Similarly, 1.42kg garbage per day per family is being generated from Lakadganj zone and 1.56kg per day per family from Hanuman Nagar zone. Green activist and founder of NGO Green Vigil Foundation Kaustav Chatterjee said in Indian cities, on an average per capita solid waste generation varies from 0.4 to 0.6kg per day. “Collectively, it becomes a significant volume. However, per capita solid waste generation can be reduced significantly if we change our thought process. In today’s world , we are highly inclined towards packaged items, which generate a lot of solid waste including plastic and thermocol,” he said. “Unfortunately, we are too much focused on unnecessary packaging, which gets converted into solid waste within hours. Online shopping which has increased manifold during Covid-19 pandemic adds to household garbage generation. The recent increase in the trend of ordering food online too generates a lot of waste, majorly single use plastic. Plastic ban has gone for a toss, resulting in increased presence of single use plastic in household solid waste,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/at-2-73kg-waste/house-satranjipura-zone-tops-in-garbage-generation/articleshow/84454486.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Pune||5 lakh doses lying unused with private hospitals in Pune, small set-ups suffer||PUNE: Small hospitals and nursing homes trying to procure Covid vaccines through CoWin will not get them until the existing stock with other private health hubs in Pune district, mainly big set-ups, gets utilised. A state health officials’ meeting on Thursday revealed that about 5 lakh vaccine doses are currently lying with private hospitals in the district. As per CoWin, 76,932 beneficiaries were vaccinated across the district on Thursday. “The rationale is simple. As per the vaccine allocation policy, the state government gives 25% stock from its share to private hospitals for vaccination at a fixed cost per dose and uses the remaining 75% at state/municipal corporation-run vaccination centres for free of cost. Until this 25% allocation gets utilised, private hospitals will not get the new allocation,” said Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director, health services, Pune circle. The small set-ups vying to begin vaccination centres on their premises are bearing the brunt of the stock lying unused. This is happening mainly with the big and corporate hospitals. “About 5 lakh doses are lying unused with various private hospitals in Pune. They need to utilise the stock, so that other small set-ups can purchase the stock through CoWin. The state government cannot exceed the 25% allocation earmarked for the private players,” Deshmukh said. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association's Hospital Board of India, an association of small hospitals said, “Many small hospitals are disappointed as they are not getting vaccine doses through CoWin. Many are opting out of the drive due to exasperation.” Small hospitals and nursing homes have a key role to play in expediting vaccination. “Decentralised vaccination is the key to cover the maximum population. Approaching a neighbourhood nursing home is more convenient than trudging long distances to get the shot at big hospitals,” Patil said. Bharati hospital’s deputy medical director, Jitendra Oswal, said, “People opt for free-of-cost vaccines, rather than paying money for the shots at the private hospital. That is the reason why a large stock is lying unused with the private hospitals. We hardly vaccinate about 400 people now and are left with 35,000 doses.” The district on Wednesday (July 13) received nearly 1.08 lakh doses of Covishield, which health officials said would help in providing a major boost to vaccine coverage in the region. “Pune district is likely to get another 25,000 doses on Friday,” Deshmukh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/5-lakh-doses-lying-unused-with-pvt-hosps-in-pune-small-set-ups-suffer/articleshow/84457009.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Dehradun||Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad head pushes from representation of 13 akhadas in the Ram Janmabhoomi Trust||Haridwar: Swami Narendra Giri, president of the Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad (ABAP), has reiterated his demand for having representation of ABAP seers in the Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust constituted to build the Ram Temple at Ayodhya. Speaking to TOI, Giri said that he had discussed the issue with Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) chief, Mohan Bhagwat, at Chitrakoot earlier this week. While he was there for a meeting of senior RSS functionaries, Bhagwat listened to Giri’s demands and said, “the RSS has no role to play in the Trust’s formation.” However, “he promised to bring the demands to the attention of the government,” said Giri. The ABAP is an organisation of 13 Hindu akharas, and also includes the Nirmohi akhara which was the face of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement in Ayodhya. Talking about the demands of the seers’ body, Giri said that two of the Shankaracharyas in the country be nominated to the Trust and the representatives of three different groups (anis) of akhada ascetics be also included in it. Notably, the 15-member Trust, which held its first meeting on February 19, 2020, includes representatives of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), religious leaders of temples in the country, Central government, state government of Uttar Pradesh and Ayodhya district civilians. However, the 13 akhadas, which claim to have played an important role in the Ram Janmabhoomi temple movement spearheaded by the VHP, were not represented in it. Drawing Bhagwat’s attention to this fact, Giri added, “ABAP president and general secretary should be its part, and chiefs of all three akhada traditions (anis), namely, Sanyasi, Vairagi and Udasi, be made its ex-officio members.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/abap-head-pushes-from-representation-of-13-akhadas-in-the-ram-janmabhoomi-trust/articleshow/84452254.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal
---||Jaipur||Cops trek through Chambal ravines to rescue Agra doctor||AGRA: The ravines of Chambal, for long the fabled home to outlaws, had been dormant for years. With the disappearance of a doctor from Agra, the badlands came alive again on Wednesday. For nearly 30 hours, 50 cops from Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh gave chase to the Badan Singh Chauhan gang, crossed the gharial infested Chambal river, clambered through deep ravines and scoured dozens of villages before they found the doctor — he had been “honey-trapped” and held captive for a Rs 5-crore ransom. It began with a rather ordinary police check around 12.30am on Wednesday at Nihal Ganj in Rajasthan’s petty crime capital Dholpur. A car with a UP licence was sneaking through alleys and avoiding checkposts. When police managed to stop it, the driver, Pawan, said it was “doctor saab’s” car. The car’s registration number, which began with “UP 80”, gave police a clue — it was from Agra. The “doctor saab”, Umakant Gupta, 60, who owns a nursing home in Agra, had been reported missing hours ago. “He left on Tuesday evening at 6.45pm. He had taken his phone with him,” his wife Dr Vidya Gupta, a gynaecologist, said. Police in Dholpur got in touch with those in Agra. Pawan told them a woman had been asked to “seduce” the doctor. The woman is a member of the Badan Singh gang, which had abducted another doctor from Agra, Nikhil Bansal, in 2017 — he was released upon payment of an undisclosed amount as ransom. The woman had asked the doctor to meet her at the otherwise busy Bhagwan Talkies. They drove to the desolate Rohta canal, where five men came on three bikes — one of them was Badan Singh, 27 — four of whom overpowered Gupta and drove off with him to the Chambal ravines. Singh left with the woman. “Pawan told us where the doctor had been last seen,” SP (Agra city) Botre Rohan Pramod said. Cops from Rajasthan and UP teamed up for the operation. “The place was 25km from the nearest police station. They had crossed the river. We had to follow, on foot.” The police teams spread out and started scanning village after village, deep in the valley. For hours, nothing turned up. But around 2.30am on Thursday, they finally found him — near Bamroli village, beaten up and shivering. The gang had fled. “I had got to know the woman 15 days ago. She’d come to my nursing home for her brother’s treatment,” Gupta said after his rescue, denying the “honey-trap” narrative. The woman has been arrested and five others have also been booked for abduction. Police have announced a Rs 1-lakh reward for information about Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/agra-doc-abducted-raj-up-cops-search-chambal-ravines-cross-river-on-foot/articleshow/84457003.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

This time the sighting was said to be close to the rocket shop section. The OF here makes the Pinaka rockets, one of the latest weapon systems of the artillery. According to the security personnel on patrol, they spotted the leopard at 3:30am on Thursday. They said the animal could be clearly seen, leaving no doubt for it to be anything else. A team from the forest department that rushed to the spot did not find any pug marks. “It has been decided to lay camera traps in the area and ascertain if the leopard follows the same route,” said deputy Conservator of Forest (Nagpur), Bharatsingh Hada. An OF official said the various sections in the complex are at some distance from each other. The area where the leopard was spotted has thick vegetation and is not directly used as thoroughfare. “But since its part of the factory, workers presence is also there at the rocket section,” said the official. The second sighting has led to scare in the area. The OF management has issued a warning. The residents have been asked not to venture out alone and refrain from doing anything that might provoke the leopard. The locals, including old residents, said that never before there was an incident of big cat sighting in the area. A veteran union leader, Shriram Batwe, said that he has been living in the area since 1969. “Initially, I was in the PWD and later joined the OF. After retirement, I stay close by at Wadi. It was for the first time such an incident had happened,” he said. Hada said there is a likelihood that the leopard may have strayed from the Ambazari biodiversity park. The presence of a leopard has been confirmed there. The forest department has appealed to people to contact the Transit Treatment Centre on 0712-2515306 or helpline 1926 if the leopard is sighted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/scare-after-guards-claim-leopard-sighting-in-of-area-again/articleshow/84454541.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand government amends land use norms, paves way for 55-room BJP headquarters||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand government has approved a proposal that allows national political parties to build their offices on land categorised as “residential” in Dehradun, paving the way for a sprawling new state headquarters for the ruling BJP. The 55-room office — spread across 12,320 square metres — will come equipped with a digital library, four halls and parking space for 200 cars. It will accommodate at least 500 people. The foundation stone for the building was laid by BJP national president J P Nadda last year but the project hit a hurdle after the party found that the Dehradun Masterplan 2025 only allowed office buildings of local bodies, state and Central government and public enterprises to be built on 'residential' land with permission from the development authority. With the cabinet nod on Wednesday, national political parties have also been given similar permission. When asked whether the amendment was meant to clear the way for the BJP office, government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said the cabinet approval applies to all national level parties. “Any national level party can build its office in Dehradun on residential land. The approval is not just for the BJP,” he said. The land for the state office was purchased in Ladpur area on Ring Road in 2010 when Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank' was the chief minister. The bhoomi pujan was held in 2020 during the tenure of Trivendra Singh Rawat with Nadda virtually attending the programme and laying the foundation stone. Construction on the building, however, never started as the approval from the Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority (MDDA) was awaited. In January this year, the vice-chairperson of MDDA submitted a report to the state government, pointing out that some parts of the land fell in the ‘residential use’ category and recommended relaxations in norms to allow construction of the building. Soon after, a proposal was moved by the government to allow national level political parties to build offices on residential land by making changes to the masterplan. The current BJP state headquarters is at Balbir Road, 2km from the proposed construction site. According to a BJP worker, “It’s a small office and accommodating large crowds is a problem. Parking is also an issue. Every time there is VIP movement, it leads to traffic and inconvenience for all.” The opposition Congress has criticised the move. Congress vice president Suryakant Dhasmana said, “The ruling party is changing norms according to its convenience. If the building was not in accordance with rules, then construction should not have been permitted. Instead, the party has changed the rules to suit its purpose.” Dhasmana added that the Congress would review the decision if it is voted to power in the assembly elections due next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-govt-amends-land-use-norms-paves-way-for-55-room-bjp-headquarters/articleshow/84452228.cms||Kautilya Singh

Traffic Police would only accept fines through e-challan machines and cops would not accept fines in cash at the spot. Two teams have been formed and police personnel have been equipped with body cameras to ensure transparency while collecting fines from violators and to ensure that there is no harassment. The drive is aimed at impressing upon people the need to follow traffic rules and letting them know that not paying traffic fines is not an option. Initially, designated traffic police teams would identify habitual offenders with highest number of pending challans against them. According to data available, the traffic police department issued 1,05,794 Traffic Violation Information Slips (TVIS) between March 1, 2020 and June 15 , 2021. Only 34,329 violators paid their challan dues and 71,465 challans are yet to be paid. Police said most of the traffic violation fines were issued for offences like jumping red lights, driving without helmets, violating zebra crossing, and talking over the phone. Most of the violations were caught on police cameras, however, a few challans were issued for cases brought to the notice of the police by locals who uploaded images on the police’s Facebook page or on their WhatsApp number. In July 2020, UT administrator V P Singh Badnore launched an E-challaning system in the city. Now, people can pay their fines online, but only for compoundable offences. Traffic police also sent bulk SMS messages to violators asking them to pay their pending challans online.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-ut-traffic-cops-go-door-to-door-collecting-challan-dues/articleshow/84452234.cms||---

The agriculture department officials said that Thursday was the last day for getting the insurance cover for this season’s kharif crops. Farmers are, however, seeking an extension. Agriculture authorities said the final insurance figures till Thursday evening are likely to register a further surge. Uneven rain in different parts of the region has already added to the worries of the farmers. Some areas along the rivers and waterbodies, especially in Nanded and Hingoli districts, have suffered losses due to the heavy rain fall. Close to 24 lakh farmers, comprising about 96% of the debt-free farmers, have applied under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) — a central government=sponsored crop insurance scheme — which offers cover to kharif crops like cotton, tur, green gram, urad, maize etc. Officials maintained that the assured sum of insurance compensation has been pegged at over Rs 4,600 crore against the premium of Rs 1,300 crore in the eight districts of the Marathwada region. In case of natural calamities and post-harvest damage to the farm produce, farmers are expected to lodge a complaint with the insurance company concerned or the agriculture office within 24 hours.

Addressing a press conference, he said despite holding several meetings on employment, the officials have not arrived at the exact number of vacancies in various departments. He said unemployed youth were getting frustrated and some of them were resorting to suicides. “The government should come clean on this issue,” he said. On the cow protection issue, he said the TRS government had not taken any steps on stopping cow slaughter. “The state government is not acting tough on those responsible for cow slaughter.

Former SP MLA from Gunnaur Ramkhiladi Yadav of Babrala told police that the locks were found broken and Rs 50 lakh kept in a cupboard in a room on the third floor was missing. “The theft came to light when a few family members went home on Thursday morning only to find the locks of the rooms and cupboards broken. We then informed police about the theft,” said Yadav. Sambhal superintendent of police (city) Chakresh Mishra said, “Only the lock of a room and a cupboard, in which the cash-filled bag was kept, was found broken. The main gate of the house and other entrances were intact. We are suspecting the role of an insider, who knew about the cash.” “Other articles, including jewellery, were found intact. Based on the MLA’s complaint, a case was registered at Gunnaur police station under various IPC stations, including theft. We have also roped in the income tax department to investigate the source of the huge cash.

State can’t afford polls now: BommaiThis is the second time the cabinet decided to urge the Election Commission to postpone polls. In April, it had sought deferment by six months after the second Covid wave hit the state. The BBMP, which came under the rule of an administrator nearly a year ago, will not see elections this year too. The EC’s decision to conduct bypolls in Belagavi, Basavakalyan and Maski earlier this year drew sharp criticism after Covid-19 cases shot up in these districts. Law and parliamentary affairs minister Basavaraj Bommai said the state cannot afford elections at this juncture. He said the cabinet agreed to hold elections to the posts of president and vice-president of co-operative societies. “The co-operation minister had said these elections do not involve more than 10-20 people in every society and that it will go a long way in ensuring transparency and accountability,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-asks-sec-to-postpone-all-polls-to-next-yr/articleshow/84460141.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||In a first, scholarships go paperless in Karnataka||BENGALURU: Karnataka is the first state in the country to go paperless in handing out scholarships to 50 lakh students belonging to SC, ST and backward classes from the coming academic year. The government is planning Aadhaar-based attendance mandatory for post-matriculate students to check fake admissions and misuse of scholarships. The state’s e-governance department has developed an integrated state scholarship portal, which will electronically verify documents of eligible students. The government will credit the scholarship amount to student bank accounts seeded with their Aadhaar numbers if the documents are genuine. Govt mulls issuing e-vouchers to collegesIt is an end-to-end paperless system for both students and the authorities. Students must provide Aadhaar number, the registration number of their caste or income certificates and the registration number of their respective schools and colleges. The software will verify the details and the scholarship amount will be directly deposited in the students’ bank accounts,” said Rajiv Chawla, additional chief secretary, e-governance. Chawla said the department has collected data of 1.25 crore students studying in schools, colleges and universities –– both public and private –– in the state. The government will also issue freeship cards to postmatriculate SC students which will act like a guarantee to private schools from the government to pay students’ tuition and admission fees. “This is being implemented on the Centre’s suggestion and we will start issuing cards from next week,” Chawla said. The scheme is already implemented in Gujarat. The freeship card is a proof of eligibility of a student for scholarship and colleges will be obliged to give admission to students without prepayment of fees. The government is also mulling issuing students’ evouchers to colleges so that the latter can cash it towards fees of these students. “This is being done to address the apprehensions of private institutes that students may not pay the fees if the scholarship amount is credited to their bank accounts. This is being done on a trial basis,” Chawla added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/in-a-first-scholarships-go-paperless-in-ktaka/articleshow/84460148.cms||Anil Gejji

---||Pune||Maharashtra lags on vaccination coverage, races against time to avoid health crisis||PUNE: Maharashtra is slightly behind Covid vaccination leader Uttar Pradesh in doses administered so far — 3.8 crore vs 3.9 crore — but its second-dose coverage is the highest. However, six months into the vaccination programme, only 10% of Maharashtra’s target population has been fully inoculated and the slow pace has got experts worried. In fact, lakhs of Maharashtra’s healthcare workers (HCWs) — first in line when the vaccination programme began on January 16 — are still in the process of getting their shots. While 8.72 lakh HCWs have received both doses, 12.83 lakh of them have got just the first shot. In the general category, 1.72 crore people aged over 45 in the staet have been given their first jab. Only 61.02 lakh have received both doses. Public health experts said the state, and country, are now racing against time to prevent a major health crisis. Swift vaccination has emerged the only way out. “It’s now clear people are not following Covid-appropriate behaviour, even to protect themselves. The only possible intervention for the government is vaccination. The Centre has been promising adequate doses; it should keep its word. Unless we vaccinate 70% of the population at the earliest, we are heading for a major public health challenge,” state task force member Dr Subhash Salunke said. State immunization officer Dr D N Patil said they are prepared to administer 10 lakh doses a day, but the Centre needs to release such a volume. “We have done over eight lakh vaccinations daily and are ready to do so again. The Centre needs to release an adequate number of doses for Maharashtra. The stock we’re receiving now gets over within a day or two,” he said. The districts of Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Nagpur and Nashik are administering the highest number of doses. But the coverage is way lower in Wardha, Washim, Gadchiroli, Hingoli and Sindhudurg. In ten districts in the state — Jalna, Parbhani, Ratnagiri, Nandurbar, Wardha, Washim, Osmanabad, Sindhudurg, Gadchiroli and Hingoli — less than one lakh people have received both doses. Patil ruled out variations in vaccine distribution or hesitancy in some regions. He said the state is determined to vaccinate everyone. Data shows that in Mumbai, as many as 50.03 lakh people have received their first dose and 14.33 lakh have been given both. The figures are 41.83 lakh (first dose) and 11.92 lakh (both doses) in Pune district; 23.1 lakh and 6.5 lakh in Thane; 15.05 lakh and 4.81 lakh in Nagpur; and, 12.56 lakh and 3.56 lakh in Nashik. Salunke said districts with low vaccine coverage will have to speed things up. “These districts need to adopt all possible public outreach programmes and increase the number of vaccination centres to achieve the target of inoculating 70% of their population, for herd immunity,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maha-lags-on-vax-coverage-races-against-time-to-avoid-health-crisis/articleshow/84457081.cms||Swatee Kher
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Hand over all Gunthewari layouts to NIT, NMC told||NAGPUR: The state urban development department has asked the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to hand over all Gunthewari layouts to the Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT). Along with seven schemes, NIT would be responsible for development and improving basic amenities in these layouts. “In accordance with the state government’s order, the NMC will hand over all Gunthewari layouts to NIT,” said municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B. The Maha Vikas Aghadi government had first restored the powers of NIT for the seven schemes (localities) by reversing the decisions taken by the Devendra Fadnavis-led government. An Urban Development Department notification on April 9 this year notified NIT as a development authority for seven street schemes as specified in Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966. In 2019, the process had started for transferring all the schemes and Gunthewari layouts to NMC after the Fadnavis government dissolved the NIT. Subsequently, all NIT layouts including seven street schemes were handed over to the NMC. After the dissolution of NIT, between 2019 and 2021, NMC completed process of regularization of layouts and plots under Gunthewari Act which came under the civic body during this period. According to the statistics of NMC’s town planning department, from December 19 to July 2021, the civic body received 10,583 applications for regularization under Gunthewari Act. “Of these, the NMC regularized 4,490 applications after the citizens paid the demand raised by the NMC,” said a senior official from the NMC’s town planning department. In 2019-20, the NMC had regularized 831 plots and earned Rs14.42 crore from building plan sanction and Rs5.24 crore from sanction of layouts under Gunthewari Act. Similarly, in 2020-21, the civic body had regularized 3,354 layouts and sanctioned building plans and generated Rs49.88 crore from sanctioning building plans and Rs 16.14 crore from layout sanctions. In the current financial year, the NMC has okayed 305 Gunthewari layouts and earned revenue of Rs17.65 crore and Rs 1.21 crore from building plans and layouts, respectively. The municipal commissioner clarified that applications regularized by the NMC under the Gunthewari Act do not require re-approval. NMC will hand over all documents of regularized plot holders to the NIT and no individual need to visit the civic agency again, he said, as NMC has completed the process legally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hand-over-all-gunthewari-layouts-to-nit-nmc-told/articleshow/84454612.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

I enquired about it and got information that he was never relieved from his duties and continued his work till now.”The officer was suspended on the report of Kishanpole zone deputy commissioner Sohan Lal Chaudhary as the sanitation condition in Ward 72 was not found to be satisfactory. In the report submitted by Sohan Lal Chaudhary, many orders for improvement of sanitation condition, cleaning of drains, garbage cleaning were given but nothing was implemented.Hence, in a surprise inspection by the DC, on March 18, many discrepancies were found in the attendance register and bad sanitation condition of the ward. Based on this report the sanitation inspector was suspended.Kishanpole zone DC Sohan Lal was a bit surprised when the matter was discussed with him. “It’s very shocking that he is still working in the ward. We will see if he was suspended and then re-instated or else how is he working in the same ward. We need to look into the matter and will investigate.”Discrepancies in the attendance register is not a new phenomenon. Many cases have come across in which sanitation inspector will fill up false attendance of workers who are not present. Usually, this is done in lieu of money which the sanitation worker pays to the inspector to be relived from his duties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/suspended-sanitation-officer-flouts-rules-continues-work/articleshow/84457056.cms||---

The defacto complainant had stated to the police that Rs 25 lakh was looted by the culprits.

---||Mumbai||Work on Borivli-Thane twin tunnel to start in March: State||Mumbai: Work on the underground twin tunnels passing through Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), a protected area, connecting Borivli and Thane will commence in March next year, announced Shiv Sena leader and state urban development minister Eknath Shinde on Thursday. However, the project has still not received a single forest/wildlife clearance from the Union ministry of environment and forests and climate change. The announcement comes in the backdrop of the BMC elections to be held in February 2022 and promises to cut down the commute time between Borivli and Thane from the 60 minutes to 15 minutes. The 11.8km stretch comprising 10.2km double tunnel will have six lanes and connect the Western Express Highway (NH3) and Ghodbunder Road passing through Tikuji-Ni-Wadi. The project is likely to be completed in 5.5 years. The estimated Rs 11,235.43-crore project, which has been on the drawing board for over two years now, requires 100 acres (40.4 hectares) from SGNP and another 42 acres (17 hectares) of private land. “The Thane-Borivli subterranean tunnel’s Detailed Project Report is completed and land acquisition has begun,” said a press release issued by Shinde’s office. The acquisition is being carried out by the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation that is executing the project.According to sources at the SGNP, the proposal was forwarded to the additional principal conservator of forests, Nagpur for diversion of forest land under the Forest Conservation Act (FCA). It was also forwarded to the chief conservator of forests (wildlife) for his clearance over a year ago. “Both the proposals are still under process. If the approvals come under the FCA then it will go to the regional office of the MoEFCC at Nagpur for its clearance and it has the authority to allow diversion of up to 100 acres which would then be the final clearance. In case the CCF (wildlife) clears the project then it will need the approval of the State Board for Wildlife and then that of the National Board for Wildlife,” said sources.Environmentalist Anish Andheria said without the forest and wildlife clearances no construction can start on forest land. G Mallikarjuna, director of SGNP, said though the tunnel will run underground, the land will continue in the possession of the forest department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/work-on-borivli-thane-twin-tunnel-to-start-in-march-state/articleshow/84457128.cms||Clara Lewis

---||Agra||Top Uttar Pradesh surgeon rescued after 30-hour operation||AGRA: The ravines of Chambal, for long the fabled home to outlaws, had been dormant for years. With the disappearance of a doctor from Agra, the badlands came alive again on Wednesday. For nearly 30 hours, 50 cops from Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh gave chase to the Badan Singh Chauhan gang, crossed the gharial-infested Chambal river, clambered through deep ravines and scoured dozens of villages before they found the doctor — he had been “honey-trapped” and held captive for a Rs 5-crore ransom. Dr Umakant Gupta (TOI Photo)It began with a rather ordinary police check around 12.30am on Wednesday at Nihal Ganj in Rajasthan’s petty crime capital Dholpur. A car with a UP licence was sneaking through alleys and avoiding checkposts. When police managed to stop it, the driver, Pawan, said it was “doctor saab’s” car. The car’s registration number, which began with “UP 80”, gave police a clue — it was from Agra. The “doctor saab”, Umakant Gupta, 60, who owns a nursing home in Agra, had been reported missing hours ago. “He left on Tuesday evening at 6.45pm. He had taken his phone with him,” his wife Dr Vidya Gupta, a gynaecologist, said. Police in Dholpur got in touch with those in Agra. Pawan told them a woman, Mangla Patidar, 30, had been asked to “seduce” the doctor. Patidar, who is from Maharashtra, is a member of the Badan Singh gang, which had abducted another doctor from Agra, Nikhil Bansal, in 2017 — he was released upon payment of an undisclosed amount as ransom. Patidar had asked the doctor to meet her at the otherwise busy Bhagwan Talkies. They drove to the desolate Rohta canal, where five men came on three bikes — one of them was Badan Singh, 27 — four of whom overpowered Gupta and drove off with him to the Chambal ravines. Singh left with Patidar. “After an hour and a half of questioning, Pawan told us where the doctor had been last seen,” SP (Agra city) Botre Rohan Pramod said. Cops from Rajasthan and UP teamed up for the operation. “The place was 25km from the nearest police station. They had crossed the river. We had to follow, on foot.” The river is up to 7km wide in places. Just as they were crossing the river, they saw a few men running towards the valley. By the time police crossed the river, they had disappeared. The topography of the Chambal ravines, cutting across Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, has long been considered the reason it provided safe refuge to bands of brigands. “They were probably informers,” Pramod said. The trail was lost. And it was getting dark. The police teams spread out and started scanning village after village, deep in the valley. For hours, nothing turned up. They were close to giving up. But around 2.30am on Thursday, they finally found him — near Bamroli village, beaten up and shivering. The gang had fled. “I had got to know the woman 15 days ago. She’d come to my nursing home for her brother’s treatment,” Gupta told the media after his rescue, denying the “honey-trap” narrative. “She had called me up and asked me to meet her. She got into my car, said I was in trouble and asked me to do as she said. It was only the second time I had seen her.” Police said she had introduced herself to Gupta with a fake name, Anjali. Dr Umakant Gupta's clinic in Agra. (TOI Photo)Based on what Pawan had told the police, Patidar was traced. She, too, has been arrested. Five others — Badan Singh and other unnamed accused — have also been booked for abduction at Etmaddaula police station in Agra. Police have announced a Rs 1-lakh reward for information about Singh and Rs 25,000 for the other accused. “A letter demanding ransom of Rs 5 crore was found at the doctor’s house. It will be sent for forensic analysis. CCTV footage of the area is also being checked,” ADG (Agra zone) Rajeev Krishna said. The additional chief secretary (home) and the UP DGP have announced a Rs 2 lakh for each cop in the rescue team.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/chambal-hosts-outlaws-again-top-up-surgeon-rescued-after-30-hr-op/articleshow/84452350.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

He alleged that the local police had tried to protect the accused in the case and did not collect evidences in the case. The CBI had taken over the investigation following a high court order in April 2021. The 13-year-old girl was found hanging in her house on January 13, 2017, and the postmortem report said that the girl was sexually exploited. Her sister, a nine-year-old, was also found hanging in the same way in the house on March 4, 2017. Her postmortem report also indicated about the sexual abuse. There were four accused in the case. The third acquitted in the case was granted bail by the high court. The fourth accused, who was acquitted in the case, had committed suicide at his native place in Cherthala in November last year.

---||Delhi||Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal calls cabinet meet amid LG-govt row over lawyers||NEW DELHI: A cabinet meeting will be convened by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday to take a call on whether Delhi government’s or Delhi Police’s panel of lawyers would argue the cases related to the farmers’ stir, including the violence that took place on January 26. Claiming that the central government had openly come out against the farmers, who are agitating against the three agri laws, the AAP government on Thursday said lieutenant governor Anil Baijal had refused to let the panel of lawyers constituted by them contest the cases. In a statement, Delhi government claimed, “The LG has asked Delhi government to convene a cabinet meeting and pressured it to take a decision in favour of Delhi Police’s lawyers.” Earlier, home minister Satyendar Jain had rejected Delhi Police’s proposal to appoint lawyers. Police had lodged 48 FIRs against farmers for the violent stir on Republic Day. On February 26, Delhi Police had requested the Delhi government home department to appoint 11 special public prosecutors (SPP) to argue bails, trial, appeals and other matters connected with the FIRs. Jain rejected the proposal and sent a list of lawyers deliberated upon by the AAP government to the LG. However, the LG refused to give his nod to it. In a meeting between Jain and Baijal on July 1, the LG expressed his disagreement at the home minister turning down the request of Delhi Police. In a subsequent letter to the CM, the LG asked for convening a cabinet meeting and deciding upon the disagreement for the appointment of lawyers at the earliest. LG office sources, however, said the matter pertained to Delhi Police’s request for appointment of SPPs for arguing cases related to violence, disrespect of the national flag and blatant disregard of the rule of law on Republic Day and it had nothing to do with the farmers’ protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-calls-cabinet-meet-amid-lg-govt-row-over-lawyers/articleshow/84454720.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Patole comments no threat to MVA, say Thorat, Malik||Mumbai: Nana Patole on Thursday asserted he had the backing of the Congress high command. He said, “I am sure my statements will have no adverse impact on the MVA government’s stability. I am working for the party, while for government, there is a coordination committee comprising two cabinet members each from the Congress, NCP and the Sena.” Patole, who was formerly with BJP and joined Congress after attacking PM Modi, has courted controversy ever since he resigned from the assembly speaker’s post without informing Pawar or the CM. The Sena’s contention was that courtesy demanded the Congress should have briefed Thackeray. This was followed by Patole’s announcement that in view of the bitter experience with NCP in the 2014 assembly elections, the Congress would go solo in the 2024 assembly elections. When Pawar was asked to comment on Patole’s statement, he declined, saying he will not react on the statement of “a small man” but would comment “only if Congress president Sonia Gandhi is making a statement”. Patole said there was nothing wrong with his claim that Congress would contest on its own. “Even Uddhav Thackeray has asked his party workers to be prepared for polls, the NCP too is working in that direction. Then what is wrong if I, too, am prepared for contesting the elections independently?” he said. Revenue minister and ex-MPCC president Balasaheb Thorat defended Patole, saying his intentions were honest but it appeared his statements were “twisted”. “Patole has been given the task of expanding the party and he is doing so judiciously. On occasions he has used harsh words. In my opinion, the need of the hour, particularly when we are part of a government of ideologically different parties, is to observe restraint and ensure colleagues are not hurt. I don’t think there is any threat to the government’s stability,” Thorat told TOI. Thorat felt certain issues raised by Patole could have been discussed at a party forum or coordination committee meeting to avoid bitterness. “Party and government are different entities. I am associated with the government and he is with the party,” Thorat said. NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said it’s a fact that Patole’s statements are uncalled for, but they will have no adverse on the MVA’s stability. “Patole is not part of the government, he is head of a political party, so he is well within his jurisdiction to take steps for expansion of the party. So far, no cabinet member of the Sena, Congress or the NCP has raised objections on Patole’s remarks,’’ Malik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-patole-comments-no-threat-to-mva-say-thorat-malik/articleshow/84459274.cms||---

The upward revision of water charges — from Rs 1,800 to Rs 4,050 — had been opposed by the corporators cutting across party lines during their tenure in the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) that ended in April 2020 (Fresh elections are still due). The administrator-ruled local civic body, however, has decided to go ahead with the revised water charges. Prashant Washikar, a resident, said it made no sense to increase the water charges when supply is so erratic in Aurangabad. “We are getting water only once a week and are, therefore, reluctant to pay the hefty water bill. The civic body cannot enforce unjust decisions on the public,” he said. While water charges within the municipal limits of Aurangabad are considered the highest among all municipal corporations in Maharashtra, citizens get water for only about 48 to 60 days every year in stark contrast with other cities. Civic activist Rajendra Datey-Patil said the existing rules and regulations pertaining to water charges were framed when the Aurangabad City Water Utility Company Limited, a private firm, was at the helm of affairs. “The firm has been outstated and the rules and regulations need to be framed afresh. The civic body is expected to submit a revised proposal to the state government on water charges. That has not taken place for long,” he said. Aparna Thete, the tax recovery in charge at AMC, said the government has given a go-ahead to the civic body to increase water charges by 10% every year. On AMC levying the costliest water charges, she said the lifting of water from remotely located Jayakwadi dam and its distribution against gravity has a bearing over water charges. She said the upcoming water supply scheme would improve the frequency of water supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-city-residents-oppose-costliest-water-charges/articleshow/84449805.cms||---

The state directorate of education (higher) had issued an order to this effect which was applicable to both aided and unaided institutions. The concession in fees was expected towards gymkhana charges, activity charges, library fees, laboratory charges among others, that were said to be unavailable to students during the current pandemic. The order concerned, specifically asked the colleges to return the fees charged towards hostels stating such facility was not used by students during the current pandemic. The directorate had also asked complete waiver in fees for students whose parent died due to Covid-19. Educational activist Tukaram Saraf said, “The management council and other decision making bodies of the state universities need to carry out official resolve at their end towards ratifying the government order. It is unfortunate that the university has not issued any order to this effect in past 15-days,” he said. Bamu public relations officer Sanjay Shinde said the management council of the university was scheduled to have a meeting shortly. “The proposed meeting would discuss how all possible help to students can be offered during the current pandemic,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/students-await-fee-concession-amid-pandemic-situation/articleshow/84449779.cms||---

The ACB officials said that Bhairon Singh is the husband of a Rajasthan Public Service Commission (RPSC) member and they wanted to speak to him following the arrest of one Narendra Singh Poswal. “Poswal claimed he was an aide to Bhairon Singh. We wanted to speak to Singh to ascertain Poswal’s claims. But Singh’s lawyers told us he is a former cop and respects the law and the ACB, therefore, he would help the agency in all possible manner but he is currently unable to because of his travelling schedule,” an official said. ACB on July 9 arrested Sajjan Singh Gurjar, a junior accountant of RPSC posted in Ajmer, for taking a bribe of Rs 23 lakh by promising higher marks in the recently concluded interview for Rajasthan Administrative Service (RAS) exam 2018.

---||Mumbai||5,947 schools reopen in rural Maharashtra, welcome 4.2L students||MUMBAI: Nearly 4.2 lakh class VIII to XII students in rural Maharashtra attended physical school as offline classes started on Thursday, a month after the new academic year began. No school in any of the villages in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) conducted physical classes. The figures released by the state goverment showed that 5,947 schools in 25 of the 35 districts reopened on Thursday. Kolhapur saw the maximum attendance with nearly 1.6 lakh students in 940 schools. In Aurangabad, 631 schools welcomed 21,599 students, while in Pune, 90 schools opened their gates to 3,505 children. State data showed that none of the 2,150 schools in Thane district could have physical classes. Villages have to be Covid-free for a month to start offline schools. On July 7, the state had issued a government resolution directing Covid-free villages to start the offline academic year 2021-22 from July 15. A seven-member committee, comprising the village sarpanch, health officer, revenue officer, school authorities, were to decide on reopening schools. Parents consent was mandatory. Villages in the MMR, barring Mumbai, that have been Covid-free for over a month were reluctant to reopen schools as parents’ approval to send their children was not forthcoming. A survey conducted by the State Council of Educational Research and Training early this week had over 81% of parents in favour of sending their children to offline schools. The differences of opinions among ministers added to the confusion, said village heads. While education minister Varsha Gaikwad of Congress gave the nod to reopen classes VIII to XII, higher education minister Uday Samant of Shiv Sena was against reopening degree colleges. State health minister Rajesh Tope of NCP too said that schools will open only after colleges. Sarpanchs of Covid-free free villages were not willing to give the no-objection certificate to start physical classes. “Parents want us to guarantee that their children will not get infected. So, the decision on schools reopening is pending,” said the sarpanch of a village in Kasa. When schools for higher classes had reopened in Thane, Palghar, Navi Mumbai from November to March, several tribal students had tested positive for Covid-19. In Mumbai, all schools were shut last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/5947-schools-reopen-in-rural-maharashtra-welcome-4-2l-students/articleshow/84457201.cms||Sandhya Nair

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Kin, neighbours of kid electrocuted in park stage protest against govt||JAIPUR: A day after a 10-year-old boy was electrocuted at a park in Swarn Path area of Mansarover, angry family members and residents staged a protest by blocking the road with the kid’s body. Gaurav Keswani was playing in the park when he came in contact with electric wires protruding from a high mast light. “I saw from the distance that Gaurav was falling down. We rushed to help him but he was not responding. He died due to the negligence of the administration,” said Kaushliya Soni (55), a neighbour. The resident said almost all parks in the area are littered with dangling electric cables. “How many more kids have to die before the municipality wakes up?,” asked Dheeraj, a resident who was part of the protest. Gaurav KeswaniGaurav’s mother Anita was inconsolable when her son’s body was taken out of their house for cremation. “My father died about three years ago, since then my mother has been selling spices door-to-door,” said Gaurav’s elder brother Himanshu (15). Himanshu told TOI that every evening, he would take Gaurav to the park located barely 100 metres away from their house. “He used to enjoy cycling in the evening. But on Wednesday, I stayed home to complete some work. He went out alone, there was no one to warn him of the wires,” he said. The family said despite repeated efforts, Anita could not get her widow pension. Himanshu said her father owned a little tea shop near Muhana, and after his death, the family rent out the shop to support the family. “The family has been limping from one crisis to another. Anita was determined that she would not let her problems come in the way of her children’s education. But with Gaurav’s death, she has lost all hopes,” said Divyani, a relative. The protest continued for several hours before the officials assured adequate compensation and investigation into the matter. “We agreed for the cremation after speaking to officials,” said the victim’s cousin, Sonu. The residents said they had earlier warned the authorities that electric wires could lead to a major accident. “The officials did not pay any attention to our pleas, Gaurav’s death could have been averted,” a resident said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/kin-neighbours-of-kid-electrocuted-in-park-stage-protest-against-govt/articleshow/84457140.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi govt to roll out oxygen tankers, tasks DTC with buying 15 initially||NEW DELHI: When the capital was gasping for breath during the recent upsurge in Covid-19, bringing liquid medical oxygen to Delhi from other states had proved to be a big challenge due to the paucity of cryogenic tankers to carry the gas. In its preparations for a likely resurgence of infections, Delhi government has included, therefore, the creation of its own fleet of tankers. Delhi Transport Corporation has been entrusted with the responsibility of procuring and operating oxygen cryogenic tankers for transportation of liquid oxygen. Government officials said that to begin with, 15 tankers will be procured by DTC, which will include five tankers each of 10-, 15- and 20-tonne capacity. The bus company will choose the suppliers that can deliver three tankers in each category within 30 days of the award of contract, another two tankers of each within 60 days and the rest of the tankers within 90 days. The supplier has to ensure that the tankers are certified by the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation and fabricated as per the norms under the Static and Mobile Pressure Vessel (Unfired) Rule, 2016. The rolling chassis has to meet BS-VI emission norms. At this peak, the currently declining wave of Covid infections, saw an exponential increase in the number of Jpositive cases and fatalities. Also, unlike the previous Hwaves, this time a large number of patients complained of depleted oxygen saturation levels. While the capital’s health infrastructure was stretched by the enormous increase in the number of patients with severe symptoms, hospitals also started sending SOS messages when their oxygen stocks were exhausted. In April-May, Delhi faced the peak of the surge and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal claimed at the time that the oxygen allotted to the capital by the central government wasn’t reaching the city in entirety. A major problem in the supply structure was the shortage of tankers capable of carrying liquid oxygen. Even when the government did find oxygen, transporting it to Delhi proved a hurdle because of the lack of tankers. Transporting the additional allocation of oxygen to Delhi, generated in plants located more than 1,500 km from Delhi in areas such as Durgapur, Rourkela and Kalinga Nagar, proved to be a big challenge. Delhi government also strengthened the supply of oxygen in April and May through containerised cargo movement via Indian Railways, which was deemed a more efficient way to bring in liquid oxygen. Unlike tankers, trains don’t face road congestion or face breakdowns or other mechanical issues. However, oxygen cryogenic tankers are still needed to transport the liquid oxygen from the plant to the nearest railhead and from the nearest unloading point in Delhi to the hospitals. Keeping a likely new wave in mind, Delhi government has augmented oxygen production in the city, having brought 21 ready-to-use oxygen plants from France and 6,000 oxygen cylinders from China, which can be used by individuals or to equip 3,000 oxygen beds. Delhi government also started an oxygen concentrator bank to provide oxygen concentrators to patients who are either recovering under home isolation or who might require post-recovery oxygen. Each of the 11 districts of Delhi were provided with more than 200 oxygen concentrators in May, which can be transported to patients within two hours. The total stock of oxygen concentrators is around 3,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-to-roll-out-o2-tankers-tasks-dtc-with-buying-15-initially/articleshow/84454732.cms||Sidharatha Roy

A suspicious youth had hurriedly entered the building about 30 minutes before the murder took place. Seema Meena, a resident of Mandawari village of Dausa district, lived in Sharma Colony with her brother Aman Meena. At noon, one of the other tenants of the building found blood pouring out of her room and spilling into the gallery. The tenant alerted the landlord about the incident and informed the Pratap Nagar police station. There were at least two injuries, one at the back of her neck, right above the ears. Another wound was on her head. The wounds indicated murder by a sharp weapon. The circumstances of the crime suggest that the killer may have been an acquaintance, rather than an intruder because no signs of struggle were reported. Pratap Nagar police station SHO Shri Mohan Meena said that Seema worked at a private company in Jaipur. Her parents and relatives arrived here on Thursday evening. Seema’s brother Aman said that her sister lived with him in the rented room. He had left for work at around 8am and was informed about the incident at 12.30pm, Meena said. He said that both worked at different private companies in the city. “He had gone to work while Seema was present in the room when the accused murdered her.” The sources in the city police said they were examining the call detail records of Seema’s phone along with CCTV of nearby areas. Seema’s room number 201 was located on the first floor of the house, right in front of the stairs. On the left side of her room is a hall with several other rooms where other tenants live. The police did not confirm if Seema had cried for help when the accused attacked her. The work for a borewell construction was underway in the house due to which some of the house owners were sitting outside on the porch. “The landlord said that they had seen one youth hurriedly entering the building, when they asked him, the youth said he had come to deliver some items to one of the tenants,” a police official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dausa-woman-found-killed-in-her-rented-room-in-jaipur/articleshow/84457150.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Early warning systems to prevent man-elephant conflict in Gudalur||UDHAGAMANDALAM: The forest department is installing early warning systems in Gudalur division of forests to detect the movement of wild elephants and curb man-elephant conflicts, which have claimed 25 lives in the past three years in the division. Four people were killed in elephant attacks in Gudalur division of forests so far this year. As per the data available with the forest department, wild elephants had claimed eight lives in 2018, six in 2019 and seven in 2010 in the division. The victims were mostly tea estate workers or the people living in villages along the forest fringes or migratory paths of wild elephants. Most of the conflicts, as per the data, occurred either in the early morning hours or late in the evenings. Omkaram Kommu, district forest officer, said the man-elephant conflicts in Gudalur division of forests was a matter of concern. “Of the six forest ranges in the division, Cherambadi and Nilambur are very vulnerable to the conflicts as they house most of the elephant migration paths.” He said they were in the process of installing early warning systems in all the forest ranges in Gudalur division. “We have identified vulnerable spots of conflicts in all the six forest ranges in the division. Camera traps are also fixed to study the movement of elephants.” Mounted atop a pole, the early warning system has sensors to detect the movement of wild elephants within 30ft radius. If the device detects the elephant movement, it would sound an alarm that could be heard for a distance of 1km to alert the locals in the area about the animal’s presence. At least 25 such devices have already been installed in places close to tea estate workers’ quarters and tribal hamlets in the six forest ranges. A senior forest official in Chennai said the early warning systems would reduce the severity and seriousness of man-animal conflicts. He said they were also using drones for pepper spray or producing honeybee sound to chase away wild elephants. The district forest officer, meanwhile, said they would continue to adopt traditional methods to chase the elephants that stray into human habitats and tea estate areas away into forests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/early-warning-systems-to-prevent-man-elephant-conflict-in-gudalur/articleshow/84454742.cms||---

Sambhajiraje, in the letter, has warned the government that the silent sit-in protests would be resumed across the state. On June 16, Sambhajiraje had led a protest in Kolhapur and was called by Thackeray for talks the next day. Demands were made to provide relief to the community that had lost the reservation granted by the state government after a Supreme Court order. “On June 17, the discussion took place and we were told the government is in favour of our demands and had sought one-month to make necessary administrative provisions for the same. However, one month is about to end, and so far, the demands have not been met. We want the CM to take cognizance of our letter and summon the progress report from officials for each of our demands. Otherwise we will have to resume the agitation,” Sambhajiraje wrote in the letter. The five demands were mainly related to scholarships to the students, benefits at par with those received by the OBC students, making funds available for SARTHI and increasing the limit of non-collateral loans for the Maratha youths to start business. After the June 16 meeting, a special meeting was held with deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar who approved another demand to set up the sub-centre of the SARTHI in Kolhapur. Sambhajiraje had earlier stated that if the government remains indifferent towards the demands for the Marathas then he would hit the streets and hold a march from Pune to Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/sambhajiraje-writes-to-cm-over-maratha-quota-demands/articleshow/84449824.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Security upgrade in Maidan zone||KOLKATA: More cops to keep a watch on miscreants and assure walkers and joggers that help is at hand; additional CCTV cameras for wider coverage; an emergency response plan to meet any crisis — these were some of the key decisions taken at the meeting on Maidan at Kolkata Police headquarters on Thursday, a day after two snatchers had stabbed a jogger there and robbed two others at gunpoint. The additional police deployment will happen between 5am and 7am, the busiest hour at the Maidan when it buzzes with morning walkers, joggers and players. At least 45 cops will be present in the area, including a patrol vehicle, two motorcycles and one team of anti-rowdy squad (ARS). On Thursday, four pickets have been set up at Red Road-Mayo Road Crossing, Fort William South Gate, Outram Road and Kidderpore Oval. They are strategically located so that people, who need to reach out to the police, can easily find a picket. While Maidan police station deploys cops at the Maidan, the additional force has been drawn from Lalbazar and South Division. Recognising the steps taken by Kolkata Police a day after Har Govind Vyas (24) was stabbed multiple times for resisting a robbery bid, his father Sunil hoped that the miscreants would now stay off the area. He required 81 stitches to heal the wounds. He plans to speak to the police and seek the slapping of an attempt to murder case on the accused for the vicious assault on his son. “There was no one around when my son was stabbed and he lay bleeding there for several minutes. A gentleman returning from Ranchi heeded to the requests of my son and called us from his phone. At least now, more cops will be visible,” said Sunil at his Posta residence. Traffic cops are also increasing their presence and setting up new CCTV cameras. "Our presence will help local cops keep tabs on the area. In addition, we will not allow illegal parking,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/security-upgrade-in-maidan-zone/articleshow/84454703.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Two elephants have terrorised the residents of Devarde, Madyal, Masoli, Haloli and Velvatti villages as the two have destroyed several acres of farmlands and uprooted many trees. Smita Dake, the range forest officer, said, “To avoid man-animal conflict, the forest department team tried to send the elephants back into the forest by bursting firecrackers and creating smoke. One of the elephants has a broken tooth and was born in the area while the other, the bigger one, has travelled from the outside and causes more nuisance .” Dake said, “In the last two to three days, these elephants created a lot of menace in the area and our team took efforts to send them back to the forest. Since Thursday morning, we haven’t received any complaint so it seems that the elephants have gone into the forest land in Gavase region”. The villagers in the region, who are fed up with these routine losses, are demanding a permanent solution. Ajit Patil, a resident of Devarde village said, “Since the last 10 years, we have seen tusker menace. Out of fear, we are not cultivating on our land next to the forest land. The elephants hide in the sugar cane farms during the day and go in search of food at night while destroying several farms. Our sugar cane and paddy cultivation have been destroyed. A trench should be created between the forest land and the villages so animals cannot come to the village area. ”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/tusker-menace-in-kolhapur-villages/articleshow/84449850.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

The Maloli bridge, which was built during Portuguese era, is connected to six rural villages of Sattari— Satrem, Nanoda, Vaiginem, Kodal, Maloli and Bambar. Maloli comes under the jurisdiction of Nargargao panchayat. The bridge is on the verge of collapse and for the last six years, the locals have been demanding the panchayat to repair the bridge. Maloli locals said that every day hundreds of vehicles travel on the bridge including tourists who come in large numbers to visit waterfalls. “If this bridge is not repaired in time then it will collapse,” a villager said. On Thursday, assistant engineer of Valpoi division of PWD (roads), Devendra Velingkar and Nagargao sarpanch Prashant Marathe inspected the bridge. Velingkar has written to the deputy collector of Sattari asking for permission to divert the traffic from Maloli internal road via Dhangarwada to the main road. Nagargao panch member Parag Khadilkar said, “Due to rain it is very difficult to carry on the repair work, so we have done a temporary arrangement of diverting the traffic from the alternative internal roads.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/part-of-sattaris-portuguese-era-bridge-collapses/articleshow/84459326.cms||---
---||Delhi||Centre asks Delhi govt to give details on O2 buffer||NEW DELHI: The Centre on Thursday told Delhi High Court that it has asked the Aam Aadmi Party government to furnish details of efforts made till now to create a buffer stock of medical oxygen. The oxygen’s shortage had led to several deaths during the Covid-19 second wave. Its reply came in response to a query from the court earlier about what the Centre is doing to ensure there is proper supply and availability of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) in Delhi. While monitoring Covid management of Delhi on a PIL filed by advocate Rakesh Malhotra, the court had warned that another “shortage” would not be tolerated. The Centre said that in order to examine the preparations of the AAP government on creation of buffer storage of LMO as well as requirement of cryogenic tankers, the ministry of health and family welfare had written to the state government on July 14 seeking details of such preparations. “Further, the ministry is also organising a meeting with the concerned authorities of Delhi government along with other concerned stakeholders to discuss the details of preparations and to assess the adequacy thereof,” the reply stated. The Centre further informed Delhi High Court that it has roped in AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria, who is also the chairperson of the sub-committee on oxygen requirement for Delhi, to examine the study report prepared by IIT Delhi on the oxygen supply chain management. The high court had last week asked the AAP government to file a status report on the buffer stock and give details of the locations of storage tanks and how much quantity of LMO is being stored there. It had then also asked the Centre to file a status report in response to recommendations made by IIT Delhi on oxygen storage in the national capital. IIT-D, in its report, has proposed certain steps to be taken by the central government. The AAP government had earlier given details of steps taken to augment LMO, claiming it now has 419 metric tonnes as buffer. It said 171MT buffer stock had been installed and it was in the process of installing another 150MT. Since there was no response yet from the Centre on the matter, the court had recently asked about the steps taken in terms of the Supreme Court’s April 30 order on a buffer stock of LMO in Delhi, saying it has been pending for a long time and the city must be prepared for a third wave. The high court also stressed that during the second wave, “the problem/bottleneck was LMO reaching Delhi.” “Authorities must work towards ensuring a proper supply, storage and availability of liquid oxygen in the city.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-asks-delhi-govt-to-give-details-on-o2-buffer/articleshow/84454749.cms||Abhinav Garg

Significantly, during the Shiv Sena-BJP rule from 1995 to 1999, Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray was described as the remote control of the government then led by Shiv Sena leader Manohar Joshi. “Indeed, he is the remote control of the MVA government. He is a big leader and he has played a bigger role in the government. In fact, he is the architect of the MVA government set up in a critical situation. He is a guide for all constituents of the MVA government,” Patole said.

Taking a cue from the video, Parmar had executed a robbery in a jewellery showroom in the Khodiyarnagar area of the city on Wednesday. The crime branch sleuths arrested Parmar and his three accomplices late on Wednesday night and recovered the three robbed gold chains too. Pinkesh told he police that his three accomplices were under debt and hence they decided to rob Vallabh Darshan Jewellery shop that is located on the ground floor of Shreeji Plaza. “We scanned the CCTV footage of the incident and noticed that the customer sitting inside didn’t give react at all when Pinkesh entered the shop and robbed the gold chains. We grilled him for some time and he spilled the beans,” said Jaydeepsinh Jadeja, DCP (crime). One of the accomplice Kaustubh Kinekar told police that he and three others including Parmar, Akshit Chavda and Mayank Parmar had planned the crime. “Priyank and Mayank had chalked the plot as they were under Rs 50,000 debt. They roped in Kinekar and Pinkesh and the four began hatching a plan 10 days ago. The accused did recce of the jewellery shop several times,” Jadeja told TOI. Pinkesh came up with the idea of throwing chilli powder in the shop owner’s eyes and robbing the gold chains. According to the plan, Kinekar walked in the shop at about 12pm and asked shop owner Ronak Soni to show him some gold chains. Kinekar deliberately sat near the shop’s door and kept the gold chains at the end of the counter so that Pinkesh could easily rob them.  Hiding his face with a hoodie, Pinkesh walked in the shop at 12.30 pm, threw chilli powder in Soni’s eyes and fled with three gold chains in two-and-half seconds flat. Pinkesh does credit card marketing for a private bank, Priyank works in a call centre, while Mayank and Kaustubh do odd jobs for a living. The motorbikes without license plates that were used by the accused for committing the crime too have been seized,” Jadeja said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/insta-reels-inspired-debt-ridden-youths-to-rob-jewellery-showroom/articleshow/84452482.cms||---

While Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) did not give a date, India’s biggest airline, IndiGo, said on its website T2 would resume operations from next Thursday, July 22. “Flight numbers 6E 2000-6E 2999 will arrive and depart from Terminal-2, Delhi, starting July 22, 2021. Please check your flight number and terminal before leaving for the airport for a hassle-free journey,” the IndiGo message stated. DIAL officials said T2 could open within this month. “We were handling a peak 1.2 lakh passengers daily (domestic and international) this February, the highest since the Covid outbreak in March-end last year. During the second wave, this number crashed to 30,000, but we are currently at around 60,000 passengers daily,” said an official. DIAL had suspended operations at T2 on May 18, 2021, and T3 alone was being used at Indira Gandhi International Airport for all international and domestic passengers, like April-September 2020. Now, despite talks of a third wave, the traveller numbers are picking up. Some states have begun relaxing RT-PCR requirements for fully or partially vaccinated domestic travellers, easing travel. Maharashtra on Thursday dropped it for both domestic and international flyers if both jabs are taken at least 15 days before the arrival. “The time interval of the validity of the RT-PCR test for all other persons will now be 72 hours instead of 48 hours,” the order states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/domestic-flights-from-t2-may-finally-resume-from-july-22/articleshow/84454773.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Two-month wait for a Metro ends today||KOLKATA: The city’s commuters can’t seem to wait for their lifeline to get back on track. Hundreds of them flocked to the Metro stations on Thursday, 24 hours before Metro was due to resume operations after a 61-day hiatus. This was the second time since March 2020 that services were suspended because of Covid-induced restrictions. Metro is resuming operations on Friday with 192 services along the north-south line and 48 along the less travelled line 2 or the East-West Metro. Services are from 8am till 9pm, with the last trains leaving the terminal stations at 8pm. There could be more trains from Monday to ensure social distancing on board. On Thursday, maintaining distancing became a challenge on the staff specials. Metro Railway general manager Manoj Joshi said, “We may add more trains from Monday even as we are starting our regular operations with 192 on Friday. If there are more trains catering to more commuters, crowding will be much less.” From Monday to Friday, everyone can use the Metro with smart cards. On Saturdays, essential workers can avail the staff specials, with their ID cards and smart cards. The validity of smart cards that had expired between May 15 to July 15, stands extended till August 16. Officials said crowding won’t be an issue because when the second wave struck, Metro was barely registering 1.5lakh daily ridership, against its pre-pandemic 6.5lakh daily footfall. “Barely 500 were on a train at a point of time,” Metro spokesperson Rupayan Mitra said. Kalighat resident and eatery executive Biswajit Khastgir tried to make the most of the “last” weekday staff special train on Thursday. Ever since the carrier put brakes on public services from May 16, Metro Railway has been running these essential-worker specials on the north-south corridor. The specials will now be available only on Saturdays. “These special trains helped people commute all the way from Dakshineswar till Kavi Subhas,” said Aparna Ganguly, Bally resident and nursing home receptionist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2-month-wait-for-a-metro-ends-today/articleshow/84454777.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Govt schools reopen without nod, private institutes unhappy||JAIPUR: Several government schools in Ajmer, Bassi and Chaksu have allegedly resumed classes without permission from the state government. Videos of schools operating at Rampura and Dudhli Sujhanpura in Bassi, Vatika and Tootli in Chaksu and six others places in Ajmer district were received on social media showing students being called to attend classes by teachers. These videos were shot by members of School Shiksha Pariwar, an association of private schools in the state. Reacting to this, School Shiksha Pariwar chief Anil Sharma said if no action was taken on the government schools being opened, then private schools will also start functioning. “We have shot these videos and showed it to government officials that without their permission government teachers are calling students to school. If no action is taken against such teachers, then we will also start our private schools and government will not be able to do anything,” said Sharma. On Wednesday, a similar video of students studying in government school in Bassi was put on social media. District educatiton officer Ram Chandra Pilania has sought a report of this incident from the education officer of Bassi by Friday. The government teachers’ association has said that students were not called for full-fledged classes but to distribute homework to them. Vipin Sharma, vice-president of Rajasthan Primary and Secondary Government School Teachers said, “Government teachers have to photocopy the homework and distribute it to students at their doorstep. However, no money for photocopy is provided by government. So, students were called just to give the assignment in school and to clear doubts. Teachers have no intention to break law and put children’s life in danger.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-schools-reopen-without-nod-pvt-institutes-unhappy/articleshow/84457185.cms||---

Some districts are up to 70% short. Monsoon in MP is calculated from June 1 to September 30, but July and August are the wettest months. Rainfall activity sharply tapers down in September, as monsoon reaches its tail end. July has been pretty dry, and into its third week more than 65% of the state has received below average rain. The first fortnight of June was good for MP, but it’s been a dry run since then.’ MP was 117% rain surplus in the first fortnight of June, but was 17% deficient on July 15. The state has received 214mm rain since June 1, while the average for this period is 259mm, according to the meteorological department figures. Eastern MP, where monsoon arrived first is 17% short -- it has received 246.6mm while the normal is 297mm. Western MP us deficient by 18% -- it has got 188.8mm rainfall against the usual 229.8. Bhopal still surplus in rainThe rainfall deficient districts are Anuppur, Balaghat, Chhatarpur, Damoh, Dindori, Jabalpur, Katni, Mandala, Panna, Sagar, Satna, Seoni, Tikamgarh, Umaria, Agar Malwa, Alirajpur, Ashok Nagar, Barwani, Bhind, Burhanpur, Datia, Dhar, Guna, Gwalior, Hoshangabad, Indore, Khandwa, Khargone, Mandsaur, Morena, Rajgarh, Shajapur, Sheopur, Shivpuri and Ujjain. Meteorological officials say up to 20% less or more rainfall is considered normal but it takes substantial rainfall to fill such a deficit. In nearly 30 districts, shortfall ranges from 20% to a shocking 70%. Among the four main cities, only Bhopal is rain surplus while Indore, Gwalior and Jabalpur are rain deficient. As per the Met department, 990mm rainfall is considered normal for the state and 1,090mm rain is the yearly normal rainfall for Bhopal. Officials said that early arrival of monsoon, and back-to-back systems developed in the first fortnight of June, making MP rain-surplus. Despite the shortfall, it’s still not too late for a turnaround. Fresh weather formation are expected next week, and if it rains well in August, the deficit will be more than made up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/drought-scare-looms-35-dists-rain-deficient-in-mp/articleshow/84454782.cms||Ankur Sirothia

He said all governments must take required action to check the spread of Covid-19. After unveiling a commemorative stone and portrait of Chipko movement leader Sunderlal Bahuguna at Delhi assembly, Kejriwal sought Bharat Ratna for the environmentalist and said he would write to PM Narendra Modi demanding the highest civilian honour for him. The CM also participated in a tree plantation drive in his memory. The CM presented a cheque of Rs 1 lakh to Bahuguna’s family in honour of the vast legacy he has left behind. “If such a towering personality is honoured with Bharat Ratna, it will be an honour for the award itself. This will inspire the youth of our country to realise the struggle he undertook in his life,” added Kejriwal. “I’m extremely delighted that on behalf of Delhi Legislative Assembly and the people of Delhi, we are unveiling a portrait and commemorative stone in his memory. His fight and struggle, along with the dedication of giving back to society, will not just be remembered but also continue to motivate and inspire generations of citizens of the entire country,” Kejriwal said. Highlighting that people today realised the importance of Bahuguna’s foresight, Kejriwal said, “We now realise that if we continue to tamper with the environment, there will be a time when the entire humankind will cease to exist.

---||Kolkata||25757: This ID gave vaccine scamster entry into Kolkata Municipal Corporation||KOLKATA: Conman Debanjan Deb, who had claimed to be a joint commissioner of KMC and held fake vaccination camps in the city, used the KMC employee ID number of a former civic market department sub-inspector. Deb used to flaunt the fake KMC ID card with the number 25757 to masquerade as a functionary of the civic body. Following the queries sent to the KMC top brass by the special investigating team (SIT) on the ID card and other crucial documents that were found in Deb’s possession, a TOI investigation revealed that the ID number in question had been allotted to Subhas Pal who was posted as a sub-inspector at the KMC-owned Sisir Market in Sealdah and had retired on October 31, 2020. On his last day in office, he had surrendered the ID card as per rule. Pal, a resident of Naihati, was shocked to have learnt that the conman — who had hit the headlines after a fake vaccination camp was busted at Kasba last month — had been using his ID card number. He wondered whether Deb had any inside knowledge that the ID card with that number was not in use or he had randomly picked up the number that coincidentally turned out to be the former KMC employee’s ID card number. “This is preposterous,” said Pal, who has been suffering from heart-related ailments. The SIT had on July 13 written to the civic authorities, seeking information about the documents bearing KMC seals or insignia that had been confiscated from his office in Kasba. The KMC secretary, Harihar Prasad Mandal, said the civic body had received the queries sent by the SIT and they would send the answers soon. “We have already asked a senior official to prepare answers to the queries based on the documents that we possess in this regard. We will soon send a reply,” said a senior official in the KMC administration. The SIT officers have also asked the civic body whether 120 unused holograms of the KMC emblem — ‘Purosree Bibardhan’ — had been ever handed over to the accused or any other person than a KMC employees. Another query was whether KMC had issued any work order on December 14, 2020 to Leaser Holograms Pvt Ltd located at 9, Indian Exchange Place for the procurement of holograms. According to a KMC official, this is the address where the conman had placed orders for bulk procurement of holograms exhibiting KMC purchase order. The SIT officers have also asked whether the civic body has an office in the name of KMC Sports Federation at 170, Shanti Palli, Kasba. This is the address where Deb used to operate an office with the KMC logo and board with the signage KMC Urban Planning and Development and heritage departments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/25757-this-id-gave-vax-scamster-entry-into-kmc/articleshow/84454843.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Pup strays 30ft into electric duct, flushed out to safety||Mumbai: A month-old stray puppy that had got caught about 30 feet inside an electrical conduit in Virar was rescued by firemen after about three hours. The puppy possibly entered one of the four tubes—used to protect and route electrical wiring to buildings—to take shelter from the rain, said sources. Around 6 pm on Wednesday, a resident of Cosmos Legend building, Global City, Virar (west), heard the cries of a puppy from one of the pipes. She alerted honorary district animal welfare officer Mitesh Jain. After efforts to bring the puppy out failed, locals, along with Jain, called the fire brigade around 8pm. After zeroing in on the tube in which the puppy was stuck, the firemen began to dig beneath the pipe. Within an hour of digging, the screams of the puppy stopped, said Jain. A flashlight helped the rescuers spot the puppy, around 30 feet inside the tube. The firemen then used water from their hose pipe to get the puppy out. “The force of the water helped the puppy out of the tube by around 11 pm,” said Jain. The rescued puppy was then placed beside its mother for feeding. The mother and three of her pups strayed around the electrical conduit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pup-strays-30ft-into-electric-duct-flushed-out-to-safety/articleshow/84457236.cms||Sandhya Nair

During the hearing, CCP in its reply stated that the work was carried out under the order of the Disaster Management Act passed by the collector on Wednesday. CCP stated that the structure is in a precarious condition and could collapse. Sudin Kamat and Govind Kamat , through their advocate Sahish Mahambrey, submitted to the high court that they were not given any intimation earlier about the status of the building and about its identification for demolition. They added that the portion of the building where the shop exists is strong, constructed with laterite stones and cement. Mahambrey said that instead of clearing the debris, the CCP went ahead and demolished a portion of the structure 4m ahead. The bench questioned the petitioners, who said they were not issued notices, and said people couldn’t be left to die in the meanwhile. The court stated that a meeting could be held between the petitioners and the authorities to sort out the issue The petitioners were using their shop as a godown and stated that they had stock of electrical goods worth more than 12 lakh comprising geysers, sodium vapour lamps, street light fittings, main switches, cooking range and busbar chambers. Mahambrey said that they couldn’t take out their stock due to the presence of heavy security at the site.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/shop-owners-from-collapsed-bldg-move-hc-against-ccp/articleshow/84459422.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

And with this, she set off on a journey to be a force to be reckoned with in a society, which treated her with humiliation, for her caste, for her job and for her being an estranged woman. “This all gave me strength that I have to become something in life and give a befitting reply to society, which still distinguishes. And this was possible only through education”, said Asha. Asha was deserted by her husband just five years after her marriage and she decided to bring up her two children single handedlyShe was married off in 1997, but that did not work and she was dumoed by her husband in 2002. It took her a long time to overcome the trauma of a broken marriage and then she decided to begin the course of education. Beginning with school level, she completed her graduation in 2016 and with a view to find her own ground, she unhesitantly, appeared for the examination for sweeper with Jodhpur Municipal Corporation and succeeded. “But this was just a phase. All these years passed hearing that you are not a collector, whenever, I asked for something or demanded something. Also the eyes of society bearing humiliation due to my caste and work, were quite intolerable”, she said. “So, alongside my job, I began preparation for RAS and attempted the preliminary part in 2018 and when I passed, I knew no difference in day and night in preparing for the final part”, she said. Since her appearance in the final part in October 2018, she continued awaiting the result and continued sweeping the roads of the city until the result was declared on Tuesday. “Though, it was a tough journey and I suffered a lot but now, I consider myself in a position where I wish to do something for the underprivileged and those subjected to injustice”, said Asha with a gleam in her eyes. As an achiever, she sat beside the two mayors of the city on Thursday, where both of them along with other officers, felicitated her and wished her to be in an administrative role in the same organisation she worked as a sweeper. Not willing to talk about her turbulent phase of life, Asha said she had always been forward looking and wanted to attempt IAS but age was a constraint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/jodhpur-sweeper-is-now-an-ras-officer/articleshow/84457209.cms||---

While Patole had said last week that both the CM and the deputy CM had asked law-enforcement agencies to keep track of his movements, on Thursday he described Sharad Pawar as the “remote control” of the government. Further, Patole declared that he will address a rally of OBC workers in Baramati, Pawar’s hometown, on July 29. The question is: Do Patole’s statements have the backing of the Congress leadership, particularly Rahul Gandhi? Reacting sharply to the question, he told TOI, “I have the support of the high command. I’ve been appointed PCC chief not for locking the party but to expand it. As part of that strategy, I said the Congress will contest the 2024 state polls solo. I’ve not changed my stand.” Asserting that he had the backing of the Congress high command, Patole said, “I am sure my recent statements will have no adverse impact on the MVA government’s stability. I am working for the party, while for the government, there is a coordination committee comprising two cabinet members each from the Congress, NCP and the Sena.” Patole, who was formerly with the BJP and joined the Congress after attacking PM Modi, has courted controversy ever since he quietly resigned from the assembly speaker’s post without informing either Pawar or the CM. The Sena’s contention was that courtesy demanded the Congress leadership should have briefed Thackeray on Patole’s decision. This was followed by Patole’s announcement that in view of the bitter experience with the NCP in the 2014 assembly elections, the Congress would go solo in the 2024 assembly elections. When Pawar was asked to comment on Patole’s statement last week, he declined, saying he will not react on the statement of “a small man” but would comment “only if Congress president Sonia Gandhi is making a statement”. Patole said there was nothing wrong with his claim that the Congress would contest the elections on its own. “Even Uddhav Thackeray has asked his party workers to be prepared for polls, the NCP too is working in that direction. Then what is wrong if I, too, am prepared for contesting the elections independently?” he said. State revenue minister and former MPCC president Balasaheb Thorat defended Patole, saying his intentions were honest but it appeared his statements were “twisted”. “Patole has been given the task of expanding the party and he is doing so judiciously. Of course, on occasions he has used harsh words. In my opinion, the need of the hour, particularly when we are the part of a government of ideologically different parties, is to observe restraint and ensure our colleagues are not hurt. I don’t think there is any threat to the government’s stability,” Thorat told TOI. Thorat felt certain issues raised by Patole could have been discussed at a party forum or coordination committee meeting to avoid bitterness. “Party and government are different entities. I am associated with the government and he is with the party,” Thorat said. Endorsing the views expressed by Thorat, NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik said it’s a fact that Patole’s statements are harsh and uncalled for, but they will have no adverse on the MVA government’s stability. “Patole is not part of the government, he is head of a political party, so he is well within his jurisdiction to take steps for expansion of the party. So far, no cabinet member of the Sena, Congress or the NCP has raised objections on Patole’s remarks. It is for the Congress high command to take note of Patole’s statements," Malik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/patole-at-it-again-pawar-is-govts-remote-control/articleshow/84459360.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

He was granted bail in a case registered under the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act on Thursday. Kathiriya was arrested in February following an alleged argument and clash with members of Bhartiya Tribal Party (BTP) during Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) elections. He was booked at Kamrej police station for rioting and under sections of Prevention of Atrocities Act. A group of around 50 PAAS members gathered outside the Lajpore Central Jail to receive Kathiriya. Hardik Patel, Dinesh Bambhaniya, Dharmik Malaviya and other PAAS leaders were also present. Earlier, PAAS had requested its supporters not to come in large numbers at LCJ to celebrate the release due to Covid guidelines. Kathiriya later went to Umiya Dham on A K Road and Khodiyar Mata Temple in Lal Darwaja area. He also visited the statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at Mini Bazaar. Kathiriya was also welcomed by members of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders. “PAAS will continue its fight and demand for withdrawal of cases against PAAS members that were registered during the movement. I do not have political plans and our team will take appropriate decisions in future,” said Kathiriya. “Kathiriya came out of jail after four months and it is a big relief for all PAAS members. He did not get bail due to a case registered under Prevention of Atrocities Act,” said Malaviya. He was granted bail by the High Court on Tuesday. In recent municipal elections, PAAS played a key role in ensuring victory of 27 AAP candidates from the Patidar dominated area. In previous elections, Congress candidates had won municipal elections from these areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/pass-leader-gets-bail-accorded-rousing-welcome/articleshow/84453181.cms||---
---||Delhi||Sharjeel seeks bail in Delhi riot, CAA sedition cases||New Delhi: Sharjeel Imam, the Jawaharlal Nehru University student booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for allegedly giving inflammatory speeches during the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens, claimed before a Delhi court on Thursday that he hadn’t called for violence but was only trying to sensitise people to the new laws.Police have charged Imam with giving the provocative speeches against the central government at Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University in December 2019. The police case against Imam alleges he was part of a common conspiracy to escalate “disruptive chakka jams” to “violent riots” in northeast Delhi last year. He has been booked under sections 124A (sedition), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups based on religion, language, race etc) and 505 (public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 13 (unlawful activities) of UAPA.On Thursday, Imam, through his counsel Tanveer Ahmed Mir, claimed in the court of additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat that police selectively took portions from his speech and gave them an illegal context. Mir said the question was if the state was empowered to book somebody for sedition if that somebody was a critic of a constitutional policy. Citing the passage from Imam’s speech where he had talked of “cutting off some cities”, Mir asked, “He asked for blocking of roads. It was not seditious. When a rail roko call is not seditious, why is the call for bringing the country to a standstill seditious?” The advocate added, “Where is the call for violence? How does sedition come into play?”The counsel argued, “If the intent of person is to cause riots, he would have said, ‘Jab tak aap carein, busein nahi jalayenge, tab tak koi nahi sunega (Unless you set cars, buses on fire, no one’s going to listen to you)’, but he didn’t say so. He was only sensitising people to the new laws.” In the case related to the northeast Delhi riots of February 2020, Imam’s bail plea, filed through advocate Admad Ibrahim on Thursday, claimed, “The investigation has created a narrative of religious extremism around the accused by conflating purported discussions of issues affecting a particular religious community that need to be highlighted and given attention on a public platform with an (i) intention to cause discord with another community or with (ii) the intention to commit any kind of violence — neither of which intention is borne out in any of the materials collected in the course of the investigation.”It further alleged that while casting such “wild aspersions”, prosecution had absurdly taken recourse to Imam’s MPhil thesis and his academic expressions on leading digital media platforms. “The prosecution in its unholy quest to somehow implicate the applicant has absolutely blurred the line between the constructive criticism of laws/judgments/measures taken by the government and religious extremism,” said the plea. The judge sought the reply of police and scheduled the matter for August 6.Co-accused Tasleem Ahmed also alleged he was attacked in jail and there was a threat to his life. The court asked his counsel to file an appropriate application. Former JNU student mar Khalid sought bail on the ground that he had been falsely implicated. The court sought police’s reply and slated the next hearing for July 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sharjeel-seeks-bail-in-delhi-riot-caa-sedition-cases/articleshow/84454848.cms||Usha Das

In a notification on Wednesday, the higher education department instructed state-run universities and colleges to open online admission portals on August 2 and publish merit list by August 31. First-semester classes will start on October 1. The entire admission process will be held online and no screening or physical counselling of students can be held this year. Even this time, no application fee will be charged, allowing candidates to apply in as many subjects and colleges they want. “The circular this year is identical to the one issued last year, with minor changes in dates,” said the principal of a south Kolkata college. “Even last year, the department had given us a time frame, but what unfolded was totally different with admissions continuing till January of 2021. This year, too, we fear the same thing would happen as the government has set a deadline without addressing the main issue.” By the “main issue”, most principals meant waiving of application fees and the absence of a concrete method of examining candidates’ aptitude for the subjects would impede a smooth process. Like last year, most feared, hordes of students, by dint of their high scores from the “pandemic calculations”, would apply in all the subjects they would be eligible for and then, would not take admission as they might not be genuinely interested in studying those subjects. Later, high-scorers on merit lists did not take up seats and deserving candidates had to wait for weeks, and even months, before their turn arrived. Principals and VCs felt filling all UG seats within the government-prescribed timeline would be difficult even this time. “How will we fill seats when applicants making it to merit lists don’t turn up for admission?” said another principal. “Last year, many secured seats in subjects they were not interested in. But a majority of them did not take admissions, forcing colleges to publish multiple lists. It derailed the process,” said a principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/college-principals-wary-of-sept-30-govt-deadline-for-filling-ug-seats/articleshow/84454907.cms||Zeeshan Javed

We will dismiss with costs,” said a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh on a PIL by Dr Siddharth De. “Are you aware of any procedure? How are doses fixed? Who is fixing the doses? We will have to alter the procedure if at all we have the power to do so,” the court questioned the counsel for De, advocate Kuldeep Jauhari. Jauhari responded that there was a Covid working group and other expert groups, which looked into the aspect. He added that based on studies conducted by scientists in the UK, there was a need to reduce the dosage interval in view of the new variants of Covid-19. However, the court said, “You are unable to convince us. Just for the sake of arguing you are arguing.” While Jauhari claimed that the petition was an honest PIL, the court responded that it had no doubt regarding the honesty of the plea and dismissal was not a certificate of dishonesty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-refuses-to-entertain-plea-to-reduce-covishield-dosage-gap/articleshow/84454953.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Halt power generation from irrigation water: KRMB to Telangana||HYDERABAD: A day after Andhra Pradesh moved the Supreme Court on drawal of Krishna waters by Telangana, the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) wrote to Telangana Genco director (hydel) to stop water drawals from Srisailam Left Bank Canal, Nagarjuna Sagar and Pulichintala projects for hydel power generation. KRMB member (power) LB Muanthang, in a letter to TSGenco on Thursday, said they had requested Telangana earlier also to stop further releases of water through Srisailam left powerhouse except in case of extreme grid exigency. “Once again, we are requesting the state to stop further release of water from Srisailam, Nagarjuna Sagar and Pulichintala. It was agreed before that quantum of water drawn for power generation purpose is incidental to irrigation and drinking water needs. It is imperative to follow the water release orders issued by the KRMB,” Muanthang said. Both Telangana and AP have been at loggerheads over water sharing and hydel power generation for the past one month. AP had earlier complained to the KRMB to restrain Telangana from generating hydel power from projects on Krishna river. AP CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy wrote letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in this regard. But, the Telangana government directed the Genco to generate power at full capacity. Genco started generating 1,400 MW from all its units. The government has been arguing that the state had been drawing its rightful share of water from the Krishna and said Srisailam is primarily a hydel power generation project. The Telangana cabinet also insisted that water allocation should be 50:50 for Telangana and AP. With tensions rising, police forces were deployed at the hydel power generation units at various projects. Meanwhile, the Centre has decided to finalise the jurisdiction of both Krishna and Godavari boards and release gazette notifications on Friday mainly to finalise water allocations in a day or two.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/halt-power-generation-from-irrigation-water-krmb-to-t/articleshow/84457386.cms||Koride Mahesh

The civic body has now initiated an awareness campaign called ‘Safai Mitra Suraksha Challenge’ wherein the workers at these bhavans are being told to follow guidelines for cleaning these tanks.NDMC officials say that the drive is aimed at minimising the chances of mishaps. The wider objective includes 100% underground sewerage connectivity, phasing out septic tanks and ending manual cleaning of manholes or sewers. “We are also ensuring that all safai mitras wear proper PPE kits during the exercise.”The officials claim that except for two or three bhavans, all of them have septic tanks and NDMC can connect them to sewer lines only when they apply. “We are holding meetings and awareness campaigns to inform staff at these places that manual cleaning of tanks is banned and punishable as per norms. The staff at state bhavans or other agencies should contact us at the 24x7 toll-free number 1533 for help, information or any complaint. We are also motivating them to arrange for direct sewer connections,” said an NDMC official.Last year, Union minister Hardeep Puri had launched the campaign, which was aimed at ensuring that no person needs to enter a sewer or septic tank, unless absolutely unavoidable in the interest of greater public hygiene. The initiative encourages use of mechanised cleaning to ensure that no sewer or septic tank cleaner loses his life because of ‘hazardous’ cleaning methods.“It will be one of the indicators in Swachhta Rankings this year for smart cities. They will have to explain in detail initiatives regarding cleaning of sewer lines, septic tanks and deep drains in their areas, and also efforts made to ensure safety of workers,” said the official.“Apart from this, a dedicated helpline number is also required to be set up to register complaints and provide real-time solutions on desludging or sewer overflow. On-ground assessment will be done for the participating cities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/septic-tanks-at-state-bhavans-safety-drive-on/articleshow/84454912.cms||Vibha Sharma

While the theft at the soil lab at the civil engineering department was discovered out on Wednesday, that at the Bengali department was reportedly detected some time earlier. Cops at the Jadavpur police stations said investigations had started. DC (SSD) Rashid Munir Khan said, “Two computers have gone missing from the civil engineering lab.” An investigating officer said, “We will talk to the administration. Among the items missing from the two departments are computers, electric cables, taps and a host of similar items.” The anti-theft wing of the detective department, which is is assisting in the probe, visited the campus on Thursday. Bengali and civil engineering departmentsJU registrar Snehamanju Basu said the theft at the civil soil lab was major. “On Wednesday, the main lock was found broken. Inside the lab, all the equipment was smashed and thrown around. Several brass parts of the equipment are missing. I asked the head of the department to lodge a complaint. After alerting VC Suranjan Das, I got an FIR registered. Police visited and collected evidence. Lalbazar cops also visited the civil engineering department,” said Basu. Police suspect the two thefts did not take place the same day. “From what we found at a north Kolkata college and a teachers’ training institute in the south, the thefts took place over time. The thieves took advantage of the campus shutdown,” said an officer. Drug addicts could be behind the thefts. “Drug addicts usually steal expensive metallic objects to sell them for a quick buck. The role of an insider is possible but there is no evidence,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/locked-down-ju-depts-report-thefts/articleshow/84454916.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

According to K Amulraj, 50, of Kongadai village, he came out of the house around 3am as stray dogs were barking continuously. “I was shocked to spot a wild tusker in front of my house. I immediately closed the main door and went inside.” He said the elephant walked around the house for a few minutes, before damaging the roof of the front side of the house. “We had stored jackfruits in the house. It seemed the elephant was trying to reach them. The tusker later damaged the SUV that was parked outside the house. I had kept a few jackfruits in the vehicle to take them to the market in the morning for sale.” Meanwhile, other villagers came to Amulraj’s house and attempted to chase the tusker, which was eating jackfruits, away by bursting fire crackers and some other means. “After two hours of struggle, they succeeded to chase the tusker away into the forest,” Amulraj said. Amulraj alerted the Bargoor forest range officials, who have registered a case and initiated inquiry. “We will take necessary steps to compensate Amulraj for his loss,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/erode/tusker-damages-house-suv-to-eat-jackfruits/articleshow/84454968.cms||---

Forty women cops from the city armed reserve police force were deployed at the reception desks of 15 law & order police stations, three all women police stations and two traffic investigation wing stations on Thursday as part of an initiative launched by city police commissioner Deepak M Damor. The cops underwent a two-day training programme conducted by additional deputy commissioner Silambarasan. “People visit police stations to find solutions for problems including quarrel with neighbours, family dispute, theft and burglary. They would understandably be depressed. The receptionists should treat them with compassion and address their grievances,” a senior police officer told TOI. The receptionists have been directed to get the petitioners in touch with sub-inspectors and inspectors. Once inquiry is over, the officers will decide whether to register an FIR or provide a community service register (CSR) to petitioners. Two receptionists have been appointed at each station.

Covid has taught them not to rely heavily on guest workers. “An appropriate mechanism for skilling existing potential workforce inside the state has to be urgently identified and implemented in a phased manner for self-reliance,” says president of the Coimbatore District Small Industries Association (Codissia) M V Ramesh Babu. “The existing schemes should be revisited and new schemes should be planned.” Coimbatore had about 1.5 lakh guest workers, a large section of whom have left for their native states. Industrialists, who met state labour welfare and skill development minister C V Ganesan during his recent visit to the city, briefed him on the challenges they faced. Besides creating a domestic workforce, subsidies should be provided for building hostels for guest workers so that they are ensured of a proper accommodation during crisis period like the Covid pandemic, they said. They want the state government to allocate funds for skill development and bear the expenses of accommodation for rural workers trained, and provide stipend during the training period. Codissia members submitted a memorandum listing their requirements, which included signing of MoUs between rural development department, district industries centre and industrial associations for setting up skill development centres through which rural labour can be trained. Codissia representatives also urged the government to simplify labour laws. Working hours should be increased from nine hours per day to 12 hours and 54 hours per week to 72 hours without overtime payment, the memorandum said. Section 9A, which prohibits an employer from unilaterally altering the service conditions in respect of issues mentioned in the fourth schedule and Section 33 that restricts the employer to change the service conditions during the pendency of the conciliation proceedings before the conciliation office should be suspended for three years, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/focus-on-building-local-workforce/articleshow/84454971.cms||---

On Thursday, there were 256 fresh Covid cases in the district. The active cases now stand at 3,453. The district also recorded six Covid deaths on the day. Rural areas continued to report higher transmission than the urban areas of the district. As per the health department’s bulletin, the city corporation areas accounted for 43% of the fresh cases in the past week, while the rural areas logged the remaining 57% cases. Among the rural areas, Karamadai was on top with 11% of the caseload followed by Thudyiyalur. Despite being a congested locality, Pollachi municipality reported a low number of cases, accounting for only 1.24 % of the total cases. However, the number of containment zones in rural areas were lesser than that in the urban area. According to health officials, out of the 84 containment zones in the district, only 35 were in rural areas. They said this could be an indication that the cases were spreading only within a containment zone in villages and the transmission was not wide. “Hence, the number of cases is high but containment zones are less,” said an officer. Officials said they were not letting their guard down in the wake of drop in the number of cases, as the movement of people had increased manifold after the relaxation of lockdown, which might spike the transmission. While temperature surveillance of train passengers to the city is being done at railway stations, the social distancing is being flouted at many places, including buses, in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/heightened-vigil-despite-drop-in-new-covid-cases/articleshow/84454979.cms||---

This will eliminate the need for human intervention and ensure that there is no instance of overcharging fares. “It will be a cashless system of generating tickets,” KTC general manager Sanjay Ghate said. In this system, a QR code will be displayed at various locations on KTC bus stands across the state and on the buses – regular as well as electric ones – run by the corporation, which the commuters can scan prior to their journey. Following which, the user will be led to the KTC app from where they can select the destination and time of travel. An e-ticket will be generated for which payment can be done online. KTC has tied up with PayTM for the digital ticketing and payment system. A live clock will be activated for 60 minutes based on which commuters will have to board the bus within an hour of payment through the platform, else risk losing the amount paid for the ticket. Users can board the bus and simply show the conductor the e-ticket and verify that they have boarded the vehicle within the 60-minute time limit. “Once the digitisation process begins, we will need to inculcate the culture of e-ticketing among our commuters to ensure that this system continues. It may take some time for people to adapt to this system, but we are positive that it will work,” Ghate said. However, presently only those with a smartphone will be able to use this platform. The KTC will soon roll out a national common mobility card (NCMC) aimed at helping non-users of smartphones. While the system will be rolled out only for the intra-state buses, KTC which has temporarily suspended its inter-state buses due to the pandemic, will soon incorporate the system on its inter-state buses as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ktc-to-start-qr-based-mobile-ticketing-from-today/articleshow/84459493.cms||Nida Sayed

In the first phase, NMC has decided to confiscate properties of big defaulters starting next month. NMC is in the process of issuing warrants to the defaulters for confiscation of their properties. In the last financial year, NMC had set the property tax collection target of Rs 150 crore, but only Rs 120 crore was collected due to the first wave. The cases had dropped by November last year and the NMC had decided to start the recovery of the property tax dues from February this year. But with the second wave from February, the NMC could not conduct the drive against the defaulters as it usually conducts in March every year. The second wave also affected the property tax collection during the first quarter of the current financial year. Pradeep Chaudhary, NMC deputy commissioner (tax), said, “We have set a target of Rs 190 crore property tax collection during the current financial year. But the second wave affected the property tax collection. Now, the Covid scenario has improved.” “We have decided to increase the recovery of property tax dues. As part of this, we are targeting big defaulters with tax dues over Rs 50,000. We have decided to confiscate the properties of defaulters, who are not paying their dues despite notices issued several times,” said Chaudhary. Of the Rs 190 crore target, only Rs 37 crore has been recovered so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/tax-defaulters-properties-to-be-seized-in-nashik-city/articleshow/84450178.cms||Tushar Pawar

Forest range officers Palaniraja (Mettupalayam range), Senthilkumar (Sirumugai range), Manoharan (Karamadai range) and police officials led the rally. The rally was conducted from Black Thunder to Odanthurai, Dasampalayam to Mettupalayam old town and Kurumbanur village areas. During the rally, police and forest department officials urged the public and farmers not to chase elephants by using crackers when they come out of the forests and enter farmlands. Around 40 personnel from the forest department and police took part in the rally. Mettupalayam forest ranger Palaniraja said whenever elephants come out of the forest and enter agricultural lands, farmers burst crackers to chase away the animals leading to man-animal conflicts. Instead, farmers should inform the forest department. The frontline staff of the department would reach the spot and send back the elephant into the reserve forest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/rally-held-to-create-awareness-on-man-animal-conflict/articleshow/84455017.cms||---

The video went viral on social media and many have shared the video, asking the authorities to provide justice to the farmer. It may recalled that Parvathagiri village is the native place of Panchayat Raj minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao. According to the villagers, Kumara Swamy had 2 acres 5 guntas of land and had been cultivating it for two decades. The land is an assigned land as per the revenue records. The tahsildar and his team visited the spot for a survey of land acquisition. According to Parvathagiri tahsildar Mahboob Ali Shaik, the seven acres of assigned land was allocated and handed over to Panchayat Raj department for the construction of mini stadium, training centre and convention hall in the village. Swamy and his mother touched the feet of the tahsildar and begged him to restore their land. The land is the only source of income for the Kumara Swamy family, said villagers. Swamy had approached and appealed in court, however the court also dismissed his appeal.

After removing seven small temples that were built encroaching the eastern bund of Muthannnakulam earlier this week, the civic body demolished about 76 houses close to Krishnampathy lake on Thursday. The houses at Gokulam Colony at Pappanaickenputhur were there for years and the demolition exercise was launched after allotting alternative housing to the residents in tenements built by the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board. However, the residents resisted the move and demanded they be allowed to stay there. Officials held multiple rounds of talks, but in vain. Eventually, the officials disconnected the power supply and went ahead with the demolition, despite the people’s objection. Corporation officials said the houses were built more than five decades ago, blocking a tributary channel to the lake. Ever since the beautification of lakes was included in the Smart City project, the civic body has been clearing encroachments in all the eight lakes in the city. Some of the residents had approached courts, seeking a bar on the demolition, but the courts had issued verdicts in favour of removing encroachments. The rejuvenation and beautification of Krishnampathy lake is being implemented at a cost of Rs 19. 36 crore. As part of the beautification process, cycle tracks, walkers’ plaza, viewing area and sitting space would be created around the lake. The civic body has plans to set up waste water treatment plants at all the lakes to treat sewerage before letting that into the lakes. The lakes would be desilted, and bunds would be strengthened as part of the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/corpn-fast-tracks-encroachment-eviction-drive-to-beautify-lakes/articleshow/84455022.cms||---

Police said Saravanan from Pollachi befriended Sarah Backy from the United Kingdom through Facebook and they exchanged their mobile numbers and chatted with each other on WhatsApp. During a chat last month, Sarah Backy told Saravanan that she wanted to gift him 20,000 pounds worth gold ornaments. But she allegedly demanded that Saravanan should pay Rs 9.5 lakh in Indian currency as excise duty to get the gold ornaments. Later, Saravanan received a phone call from an unknown person who introduced himself as an excise department officer and asked Saravanan to deposit Rs 9.5 lakh in a bank account as excise duty for the gold ornaments. Believing the unidentified person’s words, Saravanan deposited the amount. After paying the amount, he neither received any gift and nor was able to contact Sarah Backy. Later, Saravanan learned that it was a fake Facebook account used by an unidentified person in the name of Sarah Backy. Saravanan lodged a complaint with the cybercrime police station at the district police officer (DPO) on SBI road on Thursday. Police registered an FIR against the unidentified person under Section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the Indian Penal code and Section 66 D (whoever by means or any communication device or computer resource cheats by personating) of the Information Technology Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/man-loses-rs-9-lakh-to-unknown-fb-friend-probe-on/articleshow/84455009.cms||---
---||Delhi||Less than 100 complaints about overcharging for Covid by pvt hosps: Delhi govt||NEW DELHI : Delhi government has said it received less than 100 complaints of overcharging by private hospitals during the Covid-19 pandemic, denying allegations that patients were fleeced. “It is submitted that thousands of patients were treated in Delhi’s private hospitals during the pandemic and this directorate has received less than 100 complaints with respect to overcharging or excess billing. Hence, it is denied that all private hospitals providing Covid-related treatment were overcharging patients,” the government submitted before the Delhi high court. The government said a committee has re-examined package rates for Covid treatment that can be charged by hospitals and fixed the rates last month. It added that all Covid beds will be at the rate fixed by the committee, “subject to upper limit of 60% of the beds of total hospital bed capacity shall remain unchanged in larger public interest.” In its reply, the government also claimed that senior nursing staff from Delhi government hospitals are posted in private hospitals to monitor and facilitate the admissions of Covid patients. “DANICS officers were posted in 15 large private hospitals to ensure that a robust, efficient and effective public grievances system is established. They were also required to ensure compliance of directions and instructions issued by the government,” the government has claimed. It also assured the court that a grievance redressal mechanism regarding excess billing of covid patients by private hospitals has also been set up. On Thursday a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said it will examine the issue after two weeks. Earlier it had said Delhi government cannot “turn a blind eye” to overcharging of Covid-19 patients by private hospitals in the city and directed it to hold a meeting of all stakeholders to arrive at a “realistic” amount so that people are not fleeced. “Merely because there were no complaints, the situation on the ground cannot be ignored,” it had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/less-than-100-complaints-about-overcharging-for-covid-by-pvt-hosps-govt/articleshow/84455032.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Delhi||Delhi: Use of drones, hot-air balloons prohibited with I-Day in mind||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police commissioner Balaji Srivastava on Thursday issued orders prohibiting flying of drones or any unmanned aerial vehicles apart from microlight aircrafts and hot air balloons in the capital. The order will be in force for the next 32 days, i.e., from July 16 to August 16. While the cops said the order was routine and issued every year, sources said Delhi Police and intelligence agencies were being extra cautious this year, given the way drones are being used by Pak-based terror outfits in Kashmir. Cops have been asked to track any drone sellers and monitor their sales in the coming weeks. Any unauthorised drone flying at any function will be liable for prosecution. “It has been reported that criminals, anti-social elements and terrorists inimical to India may pose a threat to the safety of general public, dignitaries and vital installations by the use of sub-conventional aerial platforms like paragliders, paramotors, hang gliders, UAVs, quadcopters or even by parajumping from aircrafts,” reads the order, further stating that these are banned on the occasion of the upcoming Independence Day celebrations.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/use-of-drones-hot-air-balloons-prohibited-with-i-day-in-mind/articleshow/84455085.cms||---

The cadres, holding empty syringes, gathered in front of the head post office on Variety Hall Road and raised slogans against the government. TPDK general secretary Ku Ramakrishnan said that while health officials warned about the third Covid wave, the Union government provided only 302 vaccines for 1,000 people in Tamil Nadu. “But the government provided 533 vaccines for 1,000 people in Gujarat and 493 vaccines for 1,000 people in Karnataka. Such unfair treatment should be stopped immediately. Due to poor allocation of vaccines to Tamil Nadu, people are forced to wait in front of vaccination centres even at night. As awareness and vaccination rate is high in Tamil Nadu, the Union government should allot adequate vaccines to the state,” he said. The protestors sent the empty syringes to the office of the Prime Minister through post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tpdk-cadres-send-empty-syringes-to-pms-office/articleshow/84455046.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Three months on, no unusual spike in Delta+ pockets in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: The AY.1 and AY.2 sub-lineages of the Delta variant are unlikely to be more transmissible than their highly communicable parent, the Indian SARS-CoV2 Genomics Consortium (Insacog) said in its latest bulletin. The detection of 21 cases of the AY.1 sub-lineage, called ‘Delta plus’, in June had stoked fears of increased transmission or even an early onset of the third wave in Maharashtra. A month later, districts where Delta plus cases were found have not seen any unusual surge in cases or deaths in those pockets. In fact, of all the samples sequenced from the state in June, up to 88% were found positive for the Delta variant and not many for Delta plus. What has also bolstered the belief that Delta plus is not as transmissible as Delta is the fact that some of the cases were detected as early as April; only their genome sequencing reports came in June. The Insacog update said the Delta sub-lineages AY.1 and AY.2 were declining globally with near zero cases in the last week of June in both the UK and US. “There are no indications of rising trend in the four clusters (in Ratnagiri and Jalgaon in Maharashtra, Bhopal in MP and Chennai in TN),” the update added. The Delta Plus and AY.2 sub-lineages continue to account for less than 1% of genomic sequences carried out from June, said Insacog. Delta (B 1617.2), which was first isolated in Vidarbha and has driven the second wave, continues to be the dominant lineage in the country and one that is also rapidly rising globally. Districts corroborated that they have not been flooded with cases or cluster infections as they had feared. Of the 21 cases of Delta Plus in the state, Ratnagiri reported the highest (9), followed by Jalgaon (7), Mumbai (2), and one each in Palghar, Sindhudurg and Thane. An 80-year-old woman from Ratnagiri, who was infected with the Delta Plus strain, succumbed. Of the 1,400-odd June Covid samples processed in the state, as many as 88% (1,195) were positive for the Delta variant. A state official said they are awaiting reports for another 2,200 samples. The Delta variant, believed to have originated in Vidarbha, was found in 87% of samples sequenced in May as well. Maharashtra has tied up with the CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), New Delhi, to carry out sequencing of 3,600 samples in a month. The Covid-19 Genome Surveillance portal maintained by the CSIR-IGIB shows that around 7,900 samples have been sequenced from Maharashtra in 2021. In Ratnagiri, where all Delta Plus cases were found from six villages in one taluka, Sangameshwar, officials said they have not been alerted of any new cases. While the district continues to report 300-400 cases every day at present, they are from other areas such as Chiplun, Ratnagiri city and some villages. Jalgaon officials said Vichkheda village that reported all the seven Delta Plus cases is not seeing even cases of fever or influenza-like illnesses now. After the Delta Plus cases were found, the authorities had carried out a fresh round of tests in the villages, where two positive cases were found. Dr D S Potode, assistant district health officer, said those samples were sent for genome sequencing, but they haven’t got an update. The entire district of Jalgaon is reporting less than a dozen Covid cases daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/3-mths-on-no-unusual-spike-in-delta-pockets/articleshow/84459638.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Four persons who got washed away in a stream in Korutla in Jagtial district were rescued. Jagtial district has received heavy rainfall. Chegunta mandal in Medak district received 21 cm rainfall, the highest in any mandal in the state. Over 10 mandals, including Hayathnagar, Abdullapurmet, Saroornagar, Tharigoppula, Uppal, Medicpally, Kathiapur, Saidabad, Bhongir, Shivampet, Veernapalle, Narmetta, Rajendranagar, Ghatkesar, Toopran, Kammarpalle, Amberpet, Yadagirigutta and Pochampalle, received over 10 cm rainfall Huge inflows continued into the Musi on account of rains in Hyderabad. Officials lifted eight gates to release flood water while alerting villages in the vicinity to take precautions about not going near the water flow. At the Music project at Kethepally in Nalgonda district, officials were keeping a vigil to constantly monitor the inflows. Telangana State Development Planning Society said on Wednesday as many as 17 districts received excess rainfall, while 13 received excess rainfall and three normal rainfall. Meanwhile, police constructed a temporary bridge in Gundala on the Kinnerasani river to facilitate movement of villagers as a permanent bridge has not yet been completed. As the tribals in Bhadradri-Kothagudem district were facing difficulty whenever it rained, police put up a temporary bridge for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/people-moved-to-relief-camps-in-bhadradri/articleshow/84456958.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad rains: Repeat of nightmare 2020 as drains overflow into colonies||HYDERABAD: Several families experienced a repeat of last year’s monsoon nightmare as areas around Saroornagar lake — among the worst-affected by rain-induced floods last year — were inundated once again as a result of heavy rainfall on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday. Locals slammed elected representatives and authorities for their lack of action to prevent the situation which has exacerbated this year as, along with flood waters, froth too has flown into the homes of many. Kodandaram Nagar and Seesala Basthi were among the worst-affected as surplus water from the lake exceeded the capacity of the drains meant to carry it to Musi. As a result, many localities were submerged after the area recorded close to 200 mm rainfall in one night. “A wall next to my house collapsed and the water started gushing out into the streets from inside my house. I saw my neighbour holding his ailing mother to save her from drowning,” said G Tara, a resident of Kondaram Nagar. Residents said the flooding was due to surplus water from surrounding areas such as Meerpet, Kapula cheruvu, BN Reddy Nagar and Balapur being diverted to their locality. TimesViewRecent research by top scientists has shown that climate change is likely to make the monsoon wetter and more dangerous with every passing year. This means that cities like Hyderabad will not only have to take some tough decisions, but also put in place systems that can handle increased levels of rain water. Encroachments will have to be removed from lakes and nalas. Roads and buildings will have to be designed in such a manner that these don’t impede the natural flow of water. If we don’t stop the haphazard growth of our city now, the monsoon will become an annual disaster.GHMC officials said the storm water drain carried water from Meerpet, Bandlaguda and surrounding areas up to a spot in Karmanghat and left it there. “Plans are afoot to construct a drain pipeline under SNDP. It will take some time because it is a big project but once done, water coming from Bandlaguda, Meerpet and other areas will follow its natural course to Musi without flooding,” said GHMC LB Nagar zone deputy commissioner, H Krishnaiah. GHMC mayor Gadwal Vijayalakshmi who inspected flood-prone areas of Saroornagar and Thirumala Nagar said, “Residents who were affected explained their concerns. I have assured that entire work on SNDP phases one and two will be expedited. I have asked officials to monitor the situation closely.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/repeat-of-nightmare-2020-as-drains-overflow-into-colonies/articleshow/84456813.cms||Moulika.KV

Dr K Madheswaran, chairman, Royal Care Hospital, Coimbatore, lodged a complaint with city crime branch police inspector A Ravi on June 23. In his complaint, Dr K Madheswaran said he was introduced to N Panneerselvam, 58, a panchayat president of Pachikottai village in Pudukkottai district, by his friend Balasubramaniam, who owns a school, on October 3, 2020. “I requested Panneerselvam to arrange a loan of Rs 50 crore to expand my hospital. But Panneerselvam promised me that he would arrange to get Rs 100 crore and demanded Rs 2 crore as commission and Rs 85 lakh for document,” Dr Madheswaran said. Believing his words, Dr Madheswaran gave Panneerselvam Rs 2 crore as commission and Rs 85 lakh for document work. On November 11, 2020, Madheswaran visited Chennai where Panneerselvam showed four demand drafts (each for Rs 25 crore) to Dr Madheswaran and again demanded one more crore as commission. Dr Madheswaran doubted Panneerselvam and dropped the idea of taking a loan. He then demanded Panneerselvam to return Rs 2.85 crore. As Panneerselvam threatened and refused to return the amount, Dr Madheswaran lodged a complaint with the CCB police who registered an FIR against Panneerselvam, Balasubramaniam, Selvakumar and Kennedy under sections 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 506 (i) (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code. A team of police led by CCB police inspector A Ravi arrested Pannerselvam and Selvakumar from Chennai on Wednesday and brought them to Coimbatore on Thursday. Police seized two cars, two fake demand drafts worth Rs 99.80 crore from them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/panchayat-chief-held-for-cheating-hospital-chairman-of-rs-2-85-crore/articleshow/84455044.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Lessons yet to be learnt on encroachment of lakes, nalas||HYDERABAD: Waterlogging in several areas across the city following heavy rains has once again highlighted that lessons are yet to be learnt from the gruelling experiences of last year’s floods. Following last year’s floods, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation had carried out a study with the Strategic Nala Development Plan (SNDP) and identified encroachments along lake full-tank-level (FTL) areas, nalas, feeders and trunk mains across the city and outskirts. However, experts say encroachments continue to proliferate despite promises by successive governments. “The encroachments are so rampant that most lakes in the city have been reduced to less than half their original size. The lakes have been drastically compromised in their capacity and that is why the water will spill over,” said lake protection activist, Lubna Sarwath. Citing one such case, Sarwath said that during an inspection with the GHMC commissioner in Bandlaguda last month, a high rise was found to have come up right inside the lake’s area. “The commissioner said this was an unauthorised construction and also mentioned the sale in the report submitted at a court hearing but where is the eviction order?” Sarwath questioned and said the rate of encroachments had increased drastically since 2014. Following floods in 2000, a report by Kirloskar Committee identified 13,500 encroachments along nalas, while another report by Voyants Consultancy identified 28,000 encroachments which needed to be cleared to ensure natural flow of water from upstream areas. However, none of those reports were taken into consideration, according to experts. While GHMC’s Enforcement Vigilance and Disaster Management (EVDM) wing officials did not respond to TOI’s queries on encroachments, SNDP chief engineer C Vasantha said, “We have prepared the DPR and are currently in the process of procurement of material for implementation of the project. The entire SNDP work will be completed in a year.”  Govt had sanctioned Rs 858 cr for 55 works covering 25 packages as measures to improve drainage system. However, projects to remove most encroachments to construct or improve these systems remain on paper||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lessons-yet-to-be-learnt-on-encroachment-of-lakes-nalas/articleshow/84456923.cms||Moulika.KV

But her father, a marginal farmer, didn’t lose confidence in her daughter who always wanted to be a sports person. He encouraged her to take up archery. When she turned 13, Devendra Singh Balyan, the father, purchased an archery kit for her that cost him whopping Rs 3lakh. He took a loan for it. Jyoti hasn't looked back since then. She participated in several state and national events and bagged scores of medals. But, in between, her father died in an accident while working in his field five years ago. This week, when Jyoti bagged a spot to play for the country in the Paralympics in Tokyo, she missed her father the most. She is among five archers from the country to take part in the Paralympics. “I wish my father was here to see all this,” Jyoti said. But she is determined to bring laurels for the country. “I will bring a gold medal for the country come what may,” says Jyoti who was recently provided with a new archery kit by the local administration as she did not have the means to buy one for the tour. According to additional district magistrate enforcement, Amit Singh, “Early in June, we received a call from her coach who requested us to arrange an archery kit for her. Her family’s financial condition is not good. District magistrate Selva Kumari J arranged a good quality archery kit worth Rs 3.90 Lakh for Jyoti.” Kuldeep Balyan, the brother of Jyoti, said, “It was so difficult to qualify for the Paralympics without the help of her coach, my father and administration of Muzaffarnagar. I am so happy and hoping that she brings gold for the country.” She lives with her mother Meera Devi and brother Kuldeep in Goyal village of Muzaffarnagar. Jyoti has completed her graduation from Chaudhary Charan Singh University Meerut. She is scheduled to fly to Japan next month with four archers who have been selected for the Paralympic.

---||Navi-mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Karate kid’ breaks car windscreen to save his family from drowning||NAVI MUMBAI: Seven years of practising karate proved worthwhile on Sunday for 10-year-old Shree Bhayade as he saved himself and his family from drowning by breaking the windscreen of their SUV. The Panvel family was returning from Murud on Sunday evening when the narrow Kashid bridge on Murud-Alibaug Road in Raigad partially caved in during the heavy rains. While two bikes fell into the rivulet water, the front wheels of the Bhayades’ SUV got stuck in the caved-in portion of the bridge. Raigad SP Ashok Dudhe said the boy’s father, Sagar Bhayade (40), who was driving the SUV, was unable to open the door due to severe flooding. Meanwhile, flood waters had entered the vehicle. “Shree, who was in the rear seat, used his presence of mind and kicked the rear windscreen repeatedly till it shattered. He managed to get out through the gap. Shree then opened the door on the driver’s side, helping his father come out. Sagar then rescued the boy’s mother and minor sibling from the vehicle,” Dudhe said. Sagar said, “We were returning home around 7.45 pm after visiting my native in Murud. The caved-in portion was not visible as it was pitch dark. The car plunged about 15 feet into the caved-in portion, but got stuck in a tree. Within minutes, our SUV was filled with water. We started panicking, as the door got locked. I tried to break the window pane on my side, while my son kept kicking the rear windscreen and managed to break it. He got out and opened the door.” Sagar said he carried Shree on his shoulders and pushed him atop the tree branches, which helped him reach the top of the bridge. He sought the help of local villagers even as the rest of the family clung to the tree branches. Locals located the family and guided them to the top of the bridge. “We were stuck in the SUV for about five minutes, but we remained under the bridge in the water holding the tree branches for about 15 minutes. It was a scary experience. But my son’s efforts in helping us come out of the SUV saved us all.” Sagar said his son has been practising karate since he was a three-year-old and the practise came to good use on Sunday. Raigad SP Ashok Dudhe felicitated the boy for his brave act on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/karate-kid-breaks-car-windscreen-to-save-his-family-from-drowning/articleshow/84459550.cms||George Mendonca

Without naming individuals, he said those who went to the US in the name of raising funds had treated themselves to travel comforts but the building for the association had not become a reality. Balakrishna made these comments in an interview to a Telugu television channel aired on Thursday. “If Manchu Vishnu has come forward to construct a building for MAA on his own, I welcome it. In fact, I will also join in contributing for it,” he said about Vishnu who announced his decision to contest the polls for the president’s post. Balakrishna, however, said he himself was not keen about the elections. “I have my own constituency (Hindupur in Andhra Pradesh), my work for the society, my films and also the cancer hospital through which we serve,” Balakrishna said. The actor-MLA also wondered if the Telangana government would not give one acre of land for construction of the building if the matter was pursued with the government. “There are people in the industry who are exhibiting their proximity to the chief minister. Can’t these people get a piece of land from the government?” he asked. Though elections to the 900-member MAA are to be held in September, the atmosphere is hotting up in Tollywood with Prakash Raj announcing his panel much in advance. This was followed by other actors who also came up with their own panels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/what-happened-to-funds-raised-in-us-asks-balakrishna/articleshow/84457680.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Thirsty after day’s work in the field with her mother, a manual labourer, the girl had knocked the door of Harender Singh and asked for water to drink. She was dragged inside and her body was recovered five days later during a search operation by police in February. The accused was arrested from Shimla a day later. Sunil Kumar Sharma, special public prosecutor in the case, told TOI that the judge in the POSCO Court Bulandshahr, Pallavi Agarwal, announced the judgement in a “record time of 140 days”, during which court remained shut for 60 days due to pandemic. “The incident took place in Bulandshahr’s Siror village which falls under Anoopshahr police station on February 25, 2021. Girl’s parents lodged a complaint of kidnapping on February 28. Police arrested the man and the charge-sheet was filed in 10 days. The accused has been given death punishment under section 302 (murder) and 376 (rape) of IPC along with Rs 1 lakh file. He was also awarded a seven year jail term and Rs 20,000 fine under section 201 of IPC,” Sharma said. According to the police’s investigation, Mitali (name changed) felt thirsty and entered a dwelling surrounded by farmlands. She had been working in the field all day with her mother and elder sister. She never returned. Two hours later, her mother and elder sister came to the dwelling looking for Mitali but all they could find was the youth, Harender, on a cot. For the next three days, the family kept searching for Mitali. Later, they again came back to the house where the girl had gone to get some water but the door was locked. It was then that her father approached the police station and a missing person complaint was filed on February 28. Two days later, a police team accompanied by the girl’s father, reached the house and scaled the wall to enter the house. One of the police constables landed on loose soil. Subsequent digging unearthed the body of the child. A day later, SSP Bulandshahr Santosh Singh had revealed, “Harendra has been arrested from Shimla in Himachal Pradesh and has confessed his crime.” Police took just 10 days to file the charge-sheet, setting the stage for court proceedings. When contacted, SSP Singh termed the court’s decision as “historic”. It is not for the first time when a specially-constituted POSCO court has pronounced judgement in heinous crime against minors in such a short period. The POSCO court in Firozabad in April had sentenced a man to death for raping a 10-year-old girl in December 2020, disposing of the case in a record three-and-a-half month. Death sentence awarded by any lower court is subject to approval of the high court.

The dividing line has stirred environmentalists to again complain to the HC-appointed mangrove panel and other departments to save the coastal biodiversity. Navi Mumbai resident S Sachin has sent the satellite imagery and actual photos from within mangroves towards Kamotheto urge the authorities to take action and save the divided mangroves area, as they are not getting tidal water supply. Environmentalist of Vanashakti NGO and member of the HC-appointed mangroves panel, D Stalin, said: “It is a rather serious issue the way gunny sacks and other trash have been systematically dumped at the mangroves site, which can also be noticed from satellite photographs. The forest department must quickly move to save these mangroves from further harm by removing the trash.’’ Stalin added: “Some land mafia is doing this work to divide and kill mangroves. Hence, a formal complaint must also be lodged.” The locals have attached is google map satellite screenshot with location and arrows showing the blocking of tidal water in Kamothe sector 36. “There is heavy fragmentation of mangroves at the site, next to Sion-Panvel highway which connects to the Expressway. Mangroves are the first line of defence against floods. They are nurseries for marine animals and also filter sewage waste which would otherwise enter the sea directly,’’ said a local activist. The mangroves protection panel member said they are hopeful that state authorities will soon carry out a panchanama at this site to remove the segregation. Meanwhile, the tragic hill collapse in the Japanese city of Atamiis a warning signal to Navi Mumbai where hills are being blasted in the name of quarrying, said B N Kumar, director of NatConnect Foundation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaitrash-concrete-sacks-amid-mangroves-dumped-to-kill/articleshow/84457730.cms||Vijay Singh

My son died on the spot,” Sumit's father Satveer Kashyap said, adding that within seconds, the event of joy turned into mourning. According to Satveer, the neighbour came out of his house when the function of ‘ghudchadi’ was taking place and first fired several rounds in the air to instill fear and then took a shot at his son and another youngster. "There were several boys dancing at the event. Surendra didn't like the noise. He came out of his house and shot at in a fit of rage. The other boy is battling for life in hospital,” Satveer added. The accused has been arrested and charged with murder. The killing forced the family to cut down on the wedding activities. The groom left for the bride’s village with only two of his relatives. On Thursday, Saroorpur station house officer, Dinesh Pratap Singh, claimed the accused man shot once and the bullet first struck Sumit and then went on to hit another boy named Ankur. Senior superintendent of police in Meerut, Prabhakar Chaudhary, said, "The police were informed on Wednesday night. There was some dispute at a pre-wedding event. Surendra Singh, son of Kedar Singh, shot at Sumit Kashyap leading to his death.

---||Nagpur||Over 300 schools in rural Chandrapur, Amravati reopen||CHANDRAPUR/AMRAVATI: More than 300 schools reopened in rural areas of Chandrapur and Amravati districts on Thursday as students flocked to their secondary and higher secondary classes with renewed enthusiasm. Over 150 schools in the gram panchayat areas free of Covid-19 infection resumed in Chandrapur district. More than 5,600 students from Std VIII to XII attended classes on the first day of their school reopening, said education officer Ullhas Narad. “Students have responded positively to the reopening of schools. They were welcomed by the teachers and classes were held with Covid precautions. More schools are likely to reopen in the coming days as the formalities related to reopening at gram panchayat level have been completed,” Narad told TOI. In all, 617 schools have secondary and higher secondary education under zilla parishad (ZP) in the district, with a collective strength of 1,54,683 students. Out of these, 5,614 students attended their classes on the first day, Narad said. He added that 296 schools are currently eligible for reopening, based on the criterion of not having any Covid patients in gram panchayat area for a month or more. “Preparations for reopening of other schools are underway and many of them would be holding physical classes in the coming days. With Covid figures remaining low, more gram panchayat-level schools are likely to attain the eligibility criterion,” Narad said. A least four major English medium schools, located in the outskirts of Chandrapur in gram panchayat areas and having nearly entire strength of students from Chandrapur city, are also mulling reopening. Narad said that if their respective gram panchayats allow them, they can reopen the school, but they will have to strictly follow the government guidelines regarding Covid safety. Meanwhile, schools in rural Amravati were abuzz with students as classes for Std VIII to Std. XII students started at 182 of them on Thursday. ZP education officer EZ Khan said, “We have 748 schools in the district and 337 of them proposed to start classes. Out of these 337 schools, 182 started classes from today.” The decision to reopen schools was taken at the gram panchayat level after the villages concerned became Covid free. Khan said that nine schools in Amravati taluka, seven in Bhatkuli, 19 in Daryapur, 14 in Anjangaon Surji, 13 in Achalpur, four in Chandur Bazar, 17 in Chikhaldara, 23 in Walrus, 24 in Dharni, seven each in Nandgaon Khandeshwar, Chandur Railway and Teosa, 10 in Dhamangaon Railway and 21 in Morshi tehsil started from today.

---||Delhi||Shoe factory owner held for fire that killed six workers in Peeragarhi||NEW DELHI: Almost a month after a massive fire at a shoe factory-cum-gowdown in Peeragarhi killed six workers, its owner has been arrested. Pankaj Garg, a resident of Rajdhani Enclave in Pitampura, was initially hiding in Haryana and Punjab after the June 21 fire, but had taken shelter amid protesting farmers at the Singhu border once his money got over, police said. He turned himself in after his wife’s arrest. Police said the factory, Apeksha International, had illegal construction and flouted fire safety norms. Its godown was overloaded and while six workers had escaped, the local police managed to establish after a 50-hour rescue operation by Delhi Fire Service, National Disaster Response Force, Delhi Disaster Management Authority and civil defence staff that six others could not be saved. They were identified as Shamshed (19), Sonu (22), Vikram (21), Abhishek (22), Ajay Shukla (22) and Neeraj (21). Police said 12 workers had reported to work till 8am. “The six workers who had escaped told the cops that the others had got trapped on the top floor because the godown was overloaded. They said it had only one entry/exit point and no emergency fire exit,” said Parvinder Singh, DCP, outer. “There was also no fire safety equipment. It was revealed that many iron slabs were made illegally in the godown to create extra storage space, which had also blocked the staircase,” he added. The owner had not got any no-objection certificate from the fire department. “The factory was jointly owned by Pankaj Garg and his wife Surbhi. Statements of accountants Aashish and Rohit were recorded and it was found that four firms were being run from the same building,” Singh said. After Surbhi was arrested on July 8 from an apartment complex in Dwarka Mor, Pankaj surrendered at Paschim Vihar West police station on Wednesday. Pankaj told police that he had overloaded the godown as he wanted to become the leading dealer in the shoe business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/shoe-factory-owner-held-for-fire-that-killed-six-workers-in-peeragarhi/articleshow/84455187.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Not just third wave, plan for third dose too: Experts||HYDERABAD: India needs to plan for a third dose of Covid-19 vaccine for its population in 2022 to counter the various mutations of the virus, top scientists said. The suggestion comes even as the country is struggling on the vaccination front, with just over 22% of its population having received at least one dose, and about 5.4% getting both by July second week. It is viewed that two of the widely available vaccines — Covaxin and Covishield — in India prevent disease severity. However, the scientific community believes two vaccine doses may not be enough, as the raging delta plus variant has an additional mutation (K417N) and two lineages (AY.1 and AY.2), with immune evasion properties. “How long would the vaccine protection last? Claims vary. But, reasonable predictions indicate that protective antibodies may last for six months after the vaccination schedule is complete,” professor G Padmanaban, senior science innovation adviser (BIRAC), department of biotechnology told TOI. “There could be longer lasting protective ‘memory’ cells as well. All these can vary between individuals. This is where it is worth planning for a third dose vaccination in the middle of 2022.” Padmanaban, the former director of Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, said that while most mutations tend to inactivate the virus, one cannot rule out a more infectious new mutation. “So, one hopes that a third dose offers adequate protection till the virus loses its infectivity — and is tamed to become more of an annual flu visitor — if not give us complete respite,” he said. While India contained the first wave, the second, which began around March 2021 hit the country hard. After showing some signs of decline, the number of positive cases is again heading north, raising fears of a third wave. A senior health expert with the epidemiology and communicable diseases division of ICMR said it is important to discuss new strategies to contain the virus, bolster health infrastructure and prevent more deaths. Former Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology director and advisor Dr Rakesh Mishra said the country is at a crucial stage, and in the next five-six months, the two-dose initial vaccination must be completed. “Once its done, third dose is fine. We plan a third dose for the population as one of those strategies to be discussed,” Mishra said. Padmanaban said one strategy to protect against new variants could be to make new vaccines against the delta/delta plus variants, employing the inactivated virus (similar to Covaxin) or a sub-unit vaccine (similar to Covishield). “Trials would be needed to establish whether such ‘mutant’ vaccines are as effective,” he said. “For now, Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, wearing face masks in particular, and vaccination are the only proven strategies to curb the pandemic,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/not-just-3rd-wave-plan-for-3rd-dose-too-experts/articleshow/84455182.cms||Bappa Majumdar
---||Hyderabad||IIT-Hyderabad develops country’s first rapid electronic Covid RNA test kit||HYDERABAD: The Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H) researchers have developed India’s first rapid electronic Covid-19 RNA test kit that can be used at an affordable cost at home following commercialization and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) approval. Developed by professor Shiv Govind Singh of the electrical department at IIT-H and his team, the test kit named ‘Covihome’ is an artificial intelligence-powered Covid-19 test. Researchers claim that the test kit can produce results within 30 minutes for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. It does not require RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), an expert human resource and a BSL 2 lab facility for the extraction of RNA, so it has potential for one to take the test at home without expert supervision. The Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology performed the validation of the rapid RNA electronic diagnostic device for detection of SARS-Cov-2 virus in the swab samples independently with the in-house samples and hospital samples as advised by ICMR. These samples were confirmed for their positivity or negativity by the RT-PCR method. Researchers said that the validation report confirmed the kit’s efficiency was 94.2 per cent, sensitivity 91.3 per cent, and specificity 98.2 per cent. Each test costs around Rs 400 now. However, mass production of the testing kit will help to reduce the cost to around Rs 300 per test. Initial clinical trial and testing of the device was performed at ESIC Medical College and Hospital in Hyderabad. “A major objective of the research team for the development of the Covihome test kit was to break the transmission chain through affordable testing. We have already filed a patent for the device and are now looking for industry partners for transfer of technology for mass production,” said profesor Shiv Govind Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iith-develops-countrys-1st-rapid-electronic-covid-rna-test-kit/articleshow/84455219.cms||---

Health Canada will make a decision upon review of the evidence submitted that supports its safety, efficacy and quality,” Ocugen added. “We thank Health Canada for their upcoming review of Covaxin and look forward to working with them so that we can offer the possibility of another safe and effective option to be used in their fight against Covid-19 and its Delta variant,” said Dr Shankar Musunuri, chairman of the board, CEO & co-founder, Ocugen Inc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ocugen-begins-covaxin-rolling-submission-in-canada/articleshow/84455203.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

These hoardings were put up by supporters who do not belong to Congress, sources said. Jasssraj Grewal, a Sidhu supporter who has put up a majority of these hoardings, said, “Across all parties, it’s only Navjot Singh Sidhu who deserves to be the next chief minister of Punjab. It would be in best interest of the Congress if it declares Sidhu as its CM face for the next elections as masses have accepted him as their leader from the core of their hearts due to his clean image. It is also certain that once Sidhu becomes CM, all the mafias — sand mafia, transport mafia, drug mafia — will be completely wiped out from the state.” Rinkle Sharma, another supporter of Sidhu, said, “Today there has been a positive development in the Congress to resolve differences between Sidhu and CM Amarinder Singh. We are hoping that Sidhu will be appointed Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president and will be given a freehand to decide the candidates for next elections.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/posters-project-sidhu-as-cm-face/articleshow/84457804.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Mumbai||Court verdict in a jiffy? AI could be answer, says IIT Kanpur research||MUMBAI: Can a judgment be delivered in seconds? An IIT Kanpur’s research paper says artificial intelligence could be the answer. A team of researchers led by Ashutosh Modi and Arnab Bhattacharya at IIT-K’s computer science department developed a system that not only predicts what should be the final decision of a court case, but also how one arrives at that decision. An AI-enabled automated system that can assist judges by suggesting outcome of an ongoing court case may help in expediting the judicial process. For this, they have created a new corpus of 35,000 legal documents from the Supreme Court (SC): the Indian Legal Documents Corpus (ILDC). The research paper titled ‘Indian Legal Documents Corpus based Court Judgment Prediction and Explanation (CJPE)’ states that the advent of AI-enabled technology brings “hope to the legal system”. “This is one of the first Indian Legal Corpus of SC cases created for case prediction and explanation. Moreover, this is an ongoing process and the corpus is being actively built. The ILDC is created and annotated with court decisions. A portion of the corpus (a separate test set) is annotated with gold standard explanations by legal experts,” said Arnab Bhattacharya, professor of computer science at IITK. “The next step is Court Judgement Prediction, for this specialized deep learning-based models are developed. Prediction is followed by an explanation for the decision, using unsupervised algorithms. Explanations given by the algorithm are compared with the explanations annotated by legal experts.” This research was done by including professor Kripa Ghosh from Indian Institute of Science Education and Research-Kolkata and Shouvik Guha, a law professor from West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences as part of the team and it highlights how symbiosis between legal experts and AI researchers could develop practical solutions for the legal system of India. For the record, the National Judicial Data Grid states, there are 5.75 million cases pending in the high courts and 38.15 million in the district courts across India. Of these, more than 4.5 million cases have been pending for more than 10 years. “The goal of this model is to assist the legal community and not replace judges. The AI model can augment the process and bring about faster decision making, allowing for clearing up cases,” added Bhattacharya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/court-verdict-in-a-jiffy-ai-could-be-answer-says-iit-k-research/articleshow/84459562.cms||Hemali Chhapia
---||Meerut||Jamiat to give legal aid to 2 ‘al-Qaeda suspects’ held in Uttar Pradesh||MEERUT: Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind (JUH) -- a prominent organization of Islamic scholars-- will provide legal assistance to two men arrested in Lucknow for their alleged connection with an "al-Qaeda module". The outfit also demanded that all such terror-related cases should be tried in fast-track courts so that the guilty get quick punishment and the innocent don’t suffer in jail. The two men, Minhaz Ahmad and Maseeruddin, were arrested on Sunday by Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) which claimed that they were "members of al-Qaeda’s Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind". Jamiat said that the accused have the right of legal counsel and that it will provide them with that. JUH president Arshad Madani said, “We have taken this decision because in the past there have been so many cases in which courts have let off suspects because they could not find any evidence against those innocent people. For years they languish in jails and the media conducts its own trial and leaves no stone unturned in labeling them terrorists. But when they are freed of all the charges, not a single line is published in their favour.” Madani cited several examples, including the 2002 Akshardham temple attack case. In May 2014, the Supreme Court acquitted six convicts, including three facing death sentence, due to lack of evidence against them. “Due to decades of Jamiat’s efforts, many terror accused have been released. All charges were quashed against them. But this raises a question on the role of investigative agencies that make arrests without proper evidence,” Madani said, demanding that all such cases should be handed over to fast track courts. “Who will return those precious years of so many youths' lives that get lost due to this attitude of the agencies? Jamiat has been demanding fast track courts in these matters for long. If charges against an accused are proved, he should be held accountable. But if there is no evidence, he should be released immediately,” he said. According to the president of the Legal Aid Committee of JUH, Gulzar Azmi, “The decision to provide legal assistance has been taken after a request from the families of the accused. Advocate Furqan Khan will be present in the trial court in Lucknow.” Khan said, “I have represented a couple of cases on behalf of the Jamiat. They take up only those cases in which they believe people are being framed. They have now given me the case of two men who have been accused of being part of an al-Qaeda module. As of now the case is in a preliminary stage. Right now we are in the process of collecting documents in the case.” Shahid Nadeem, legal advisor of JUH, said, “As of now we have directed Furqan Khan to procure case-related documents including FIR, remand report, etc. More lawyers will be hired once the charge-sheet is filed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/jamiat-to-give-legal-aid-to-2-al-qaeda-suspects-held-in-up/articleshow/84452859.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Hyderabad||Open all public roads in Secunderabad Cantonment : Telangana minister KT Rama Rao to Rajnath Singh||HYDERABAD: Municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao urged defence minister Rajnath Singh to instruct the local military authority (LMA) to immediately open all the roads in Secunderabad Cantonment and stop it from taking unilateral and arbitrary decisions on closure of public roads without following the due procedure. KTR said closure of public roads by the LMA was affecting millions of citizens daily, especially those residing in north and northeastern parts of Hyderabad. “In an arbitrary and unauthorised manner, the local authorities are frequently resorting to the closure of these roads, resulting in untold misery to large sections of people as they have to take detours to commute daily,” he said in a letter sent to Rajnath on Thursday. The minister had written letters on the issue earlier also seeking intervention of the Union minister in resolving the issue. In his July 2020 letter, he said the LMA had shut down four important roads - Allahabad Gate Road, Gough Road, Wellington Road and Ordnance Road — citing a surge in Covid-19 cases. “The roads are closed often for reasons bordering on frivolity. The state had taken up all required necessary measures to contain Covid-19, including lockdown imposed in May and June 2021, and seeing improvement, the lockdown was eased. Surprisingly, roads are now closed for the same Covid-19 reasons,” KTR said. The minister said no public roads can be closed by the LMA or any authority other than SCB that too without following the procedure under section 258 of the Cantonment Act, 2006. Blatantly defying all standard operating procedures, guidelines and instructions of the ministry of defence, the LMA continued closure of roads. “In fact, the LMA has added more roads to such closures. The LMA is almost disobeying and neglecting its own SOP and guidelines,” KTR said. He recalled that the MoD in September 2018 had reviewed the matter of closure of roads and insisted on the absolute necessity to follow the procedure prescribed under section 258 of the Cantonment Act and directed that no public road in the Cantonment should be closed by the LMA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/open-all-public-roads-in-cantt-ktr-to-rajnath/articleshow/84455251.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: 57% snakes rescued are spectacled cobras||HYDERABAD: Around 57% of snakes rescued in the city are spectacled cobras, raising fears of their widespread habitat destruction caused primarily by increasing construction activity. Friends of Snakes Society members said they have rescued and relocated 4,793 snakes until June 30, 2021 from Hyderabad and surrounding districts, despite the pandemic and lockdown. Blaming construction activity around Outer Ring Road, rescuers say more calls came from Gachibowli, Patancheru, Kukatpally and other locations on the western corridor. Data reveals that around 24% of snakes rescued are rat snakes, followed by 5% being Russell’s Viper and 4% Checkered Keelback. The rest 10% are non-venomous snakes belonging to 17 species. On the eve of World Snakes Day, experts said that during the monsoons, burrows and crevices on the ground get flooded, forcing the snakes to search for higher and drier hideouts. “This is one of the reasons for the increased frequency of snake encounters during the rainy months,” an official said. Avinash Visvanathan, general secretary of Friends of Snakes Society, said that snakes act as intermediate predators and their role in the food chain is irreplaceable. “Most snake species hunt rodents and keep their population under control, they save several crores of rupees worth of foodgrains and standing crops. Various factors like habitat loss, climate change, diseases and killings by humans are impacting them,” he said. To conserve snakes and mitigate snakebites, Friends of Snakes Society has been working on rescue and relocation of snakes since 1995. The society receives over 100 calls on its helpline every day seeking assistance to remove snakes that enter residences or office spaces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/57-snakes-rescued-are-spectacled-cobras/articleshow/84455259.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Chandigarh||High court judge recuses himself from hearing PIL on Punjab minister Rana Gumeet Singh Sodhi||CHANDIGARH: A Punjab and Haryana high court judge on Thursday recused himself from hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) alleging that Punjab cabinet minister Rana Gumeet Singh Sodhi had perpetrated a fraud on the state exchequer by taking compensation twice — in 1962 and 2012— for acquisition of the same piece of land. The petition has sought directions for a CBI probe into the case. The PIL was listed for hearing before a division bench comprising Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha and Justice Arun Palli on Thursday, however, Justice Palli recused himself from the case. Now the matter has been referred to another bench for hearing. The matter had reached before the HC in the wake of a petition filed by Dinesh Chadha, advocate and two other residents of Roopnagar district in Punjab. According to the petitioners, the land of Rana Gurmeet Singh, four-time MLA and the minister of sports and youth affairs department and NRI affairs Punjab, and his family was acquired and compensation was paid in 1962. However, the same land was again mischievously acquired in 2012 by the state for the same purpose by sheer manipulations and widespread bungling, leading to double payment of compensation for the same very land twice to the minister and his family. The PIL has alleged that the minister and his family have defrauded the state exchequer and public at large. The petition has sought directions to declare both the acquisition proceedings null and void and to order a CBI investigation into the entire case. It has also been submitted in the PIL that as per the state's inquiry committee report, the whole fraud and modus operandi of Rana Gurmeet Singh has been unearthed, and now keeping in view of his influence, the state is diluting the scam to shield the corrupt persons who have looted the state by abusing their official positions. Prayer has also been made in the PIL for restraining the minister from leaving the country without the court’s permission. According to the petition, the minister's land was acquired for construction of the section of Ferozpur-Fazilka road to Guruharsahai, Ferozepur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-judge-recuses-himself-from-hearing-pil-on-pb-min-taking-land-compensation-twice/articleshow/84457844.cms||---

The petitioner Surendra Gajanan Samant told the high court during the hearing that the government has started the procedure for declaring wild boar as vermin. He said there is a duty to protect the animal. The government has an idea to kill animals and with the declaration of wild boar as vermin they can be directly harmed, he said, pointing out that this is against the Constitution of India.  Chief minister Pramod Sawant earlier this month said the state government has initiated the process of declaring wild boars has vermin. He said that he directed the forest department to expedite the process as people are facing problems due to wild boars. Currently the wild boar is protected under the Wildlife Act making its killing illegal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-notices-to-govt-over-declaring-wild-boar-as-vermin/articleshow/84459576.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Cop shoots self dead at Paldi police station||AHMEDABAD: A head constable posted at Paldi police station on Thursday morning allegedly committed suicide by shooting himself in the temple with a revolver at the police station. The reasons for his suicide are still unknown as police did not find a physical suicide note or a digital note on his mobile phone. Umesh Bhatia, 35, a resident of Gayatrinagar in Sarkhej, had been working as the account writer head with Paldi police for 11 months. He was assigned the work of police point distribution, disbursement of salary and other bills along with weapon distribution. He also used to keep the accounts of the police station. “On Wednesday around 7.30am, he arrived at Paldi police station, parked his car and went to his office. He distributed work and informed the cops about a webinar. He then went to his office and closed the door,” said a source in Paldi police. At the time, most staff members were not present as they had gone to investigate a case of burglary near Vasna. Around 9.30am, the few personnel present in the police station heard a gunshot from Bhatia’s office and rushed in. They saw him with his head in a pool of blood on his table, holding a pistol in his right hand. “He shot himself in his temple and was lying unconscious when we saw him. We called an ambulance and they took him to VS Hospital where he was declared brought dead,” said another cop. His family was informed about his death. His wife, Parul, along with their two children,10 and seven years old, rushed to VS Hospital where they went into shock on seeing his body. Senior police officers, including DCP Zone 7 Premsukh Delu, rushed to Paldi police station and began an inquiry. A team of forensic science experts were also called to the crime scene. They recovered his cellphone and took other samples from the spot. Paldi police registered a case of accidental death and sent his body for a panel postmortem at Asarwa Civil Hospital. Something fishy, say kin:The family of Umesh Bhatia refuses to believe that a person like him could take his own life. “He was a strong and content person. He had no history of illness or financial problems that would have driven him to kill himself,” relatives said. They alleged that he may have been murdered. “He owned a house in Sarkhej and three shops that he had rented out. He had good income. Besides, he did not have any issue with anyone in the police station nor did he have family problems,” said a cop. ‘He was honest and caring’:Cops at Paldi police station remember Umesh Bhatia as an introvert but a caring person who always enquired about their well-being. “While speaking of honesty and management, police officers gave his example as he did splendid work as an account writer. Usually, various disputes arise when account writer heads, who look after accounts, salary and point distribution for cops, fail to manage their work properly. In Bhatia’s case, he never gave anyone a chance to blame him for negligence or inefficient work,” said one of his colleagues. Another colleague said, “He was quite introvert and had an extremely limited number of close friends. As he never opened to anyone else about his thoughts and feelings, it has become exceedingly difficult to know what happened and what forced him to kill himself.” Gym freak, book lover:U mesh Bhatia was a fitness freak, literature lover and enthusiastic about clicking nature pictures, said his friends. He woke up at 4.30am to go for a run. He would never miss gym even if he had night duty, said a colleague. He was fond of reading Gujarati literature and attended sessions of writers and poets, he said. On holidays, he visited Nal Sarovar in Sanand and Thol lake in Kadi to click pictures of the lake and migratory birds. He would post these on social media .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cop-shoots-self-dead-at-paldi-police-station/articleshow/84455287.cms||---

Cops feel the gang behind the latest theft had earlier come under their radar for similar offences. It’s learnt that the prime suspects in the latest sandalwood tree theft were among the ones nabbed last year by Sadar police for a spate of such cases in the city, including one at the official quarter of the DIG, Naxal range, near Seminary Hills. Sources from Sadar police station said cops have come to know about the involvement of a few suspects who had sneaked into the city on the night during which the theft had taken place. Despite laying traps for the suspects, the cops have so far not been able to nab any of them. The cops are trying to nab the gang and prevent it from striking again in the ongoing monsoon season, when such thefts of sandalwood become common.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-in-dark-about-sandalwood-thieves/articleshow/84455228.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Delhi||Home alone, seniors vulnerable to attacks in Delhi||NEW DELHI: A spate of crimes against senior citizens in the last two months seems to have raised a question mark on their safety and security in the city. Whether it be the murder of the 70-year-old wife of a former Union minister in Vasant Vihar or the murder of a septuagenarian in Mohan Garden, several incidents involving elderly people have been reported in a short span of time. Delhi Police claims to have made quick arrests in most of these cases and that the killers were known to most of the victims. The cops said they are taking various measures to enhance the security of senior citizens, and the beat officers as well as the area SHOs have been sensitised to the special security needs of the elderly. Police data shows that there are 39,223 senior citizens in Delhi, with 1,272 having been added to the group this year, who don’t live with their sons or daughters or families. A majority of the victims in recent crimes were alone at home at the time of the crime. This was the case in Kitty Kumaramangalam’s murder in Vasant Vihar. The cops said she was not enrolled as a senior citizen because her daughter lived with her. “Moreover, her son also stays with her during the time he is in Delhi,” an officer said. “All her identity documents, like the Aadhaar card, are made out to this address. That is why she was not enrolled as a senior citizen." In the Mohan Garden case, the victim, Kavita Grover, lived with her son and daughter but was alone because they had gone out of town. Similarly, in Burari, a 65-year-old woman was killed when she was alone at home after her son and his wife had stepped out to visit a relative. The police have arrested her son's restaurant employee for the crime. While a criminal out on bail had murdered a senior citizen at his home when robbing the man, a 75-year-old woman was killed during a robbery bid at her home in west Delhi's Janakpuri in June. Many elderly people admitted that police conducted checks and visited those living alone, but they hoped for boosted security arrangements. A west Delhi resident said police needed to beef up the area patrolling and keep a keen watch on people visiting a locality. In Vasant Kunj, a senior citizen said, “We would feel more secure if the beat officer visited our house frequently and regularly verified the workers in the colony. Many times, friends and acquaintances of such workers enter the locality without let or hindrance and this makes one vulnerable.” Regarding their initiatives, a police officer said that there was a helpline and security cell in place for the safety of senior citizens. “Officers from the Senior Citizen Security Cell, Police HQ, pay visits to some of the elderly people every day by turn. During such visits, the physical security of the house is also looked into. The status of domestic helps, whether verified or not, and whether the old citizens are residing alone or with spouses are also ascertained. We get their feedback on policing and implementation of safety measures.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/home-alone-seniors-vulnerable-to-attacks/articleshow/84455324.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||V S Hospital in Ahmedabad told to pay Rs 1 lakh for operating on patient sans consent||AHMEDABAD: A consumer court has ordered the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation-run V S Hospital to pay Rs 1 lakh compensation to a widow, whose husband was operated upon without informed consent from relatives and for not providing medical case papers to the family. The Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission held that not obtaining consent for surgery and providing case papers only after the widow took legal recourse amounted to negligence and deficiency in service on part of the hospital. The case involved Veljibhai Chirodiya from Jaskagam near Dhandhuka town. He was brought to V S Hospital in February 2006 and operated upon for removal of a tumour from his abdomen. The tumour could not be removed and the patient was discharged few days later for further treatment of cancer. Chirodiya died in April that year. After his demise, his widow Kankuben sued the hospital and the treating doctor with the Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, Ahmedabad (rural) for medical negligence and deficiency in service for carrying out the surgery without conducting Prothrombin Time test; for not removing the tumour from abdomen even after incision; for not obtaining consent for the surgery from the patient or his relatives; and for not providing medical case papers, which according to the rules are required to be supplied to the patient within 72 hours. Kankuben sought compensation of Rs 10 lakh from the hospital. After the district forum rejected her complaint, Kankuben approached the district commission. Fifteen years later, the commission held that there was no medical negligence because the doctor performed his duty and exercised an ordinary degree of professional skill and competence. According to Kankuben’s advocate V M Gamara, while the commission did not accept the claim of medical negligence, it concluded that the consent form was completely blank and it shows that informed consent of the patient or his kin was not taken. This is negligence. The commission also held that the hospital provided medical case papers to Chirodiya’s family in 2008, only after the hospital was sued. This is deficiency in service. Besides ordering compensation of Rs 1 lakh, the hospital has also been asked to pay Rs 10,000 to the widow for incurring legal expenditure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vs-told-to-pay-rs-1-lakh-for-operating-on-patient-sans-consent/articleshow/84455326.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BJP launches civic war over Tipu’s name for a garden||Mumbai: The BJP opposed a proposal that was tabled at a municipal committee meeting to name a garden in Govandi after Tipu Sultan on Thursday. BJP members said that Tipu Sultan was responsible for the forced conversion of Hindus, among other atrocities, and demanded that the garden be named after either Maulana Azad or 1965 Indo-Pak war hero Havildar Abdul Hamid. In a letter sent to the civic garden and market committee chairman, nominated corporator Bhalchandra Shirsat of the BJP said the party was not opposed to a Muslim name but Tipu Sultan had opposed the British only for his personal gains. “How can a civic garden be named after such a ruler who hangs hundreds of Hindus, destroys thousands of temples, converts Hindus and oppresses women? The Shiv Sena, by not allowing our party members to speak, indirectly showcased its support to the proposal, it appears,” said Shirsat. Local corporator Rukhsana Siddique from the Samajwadi Party had proposed Tipu Sultan’s name for the garden. Siddique said Tipu Sultan was referred to as the Tiger of Mysore. BJP members even barged into mayor Kishori Pednekar’s cabin in the afternoon. They were informed that no decision had been taken yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-launches-civic-war-over-tipus-name-for-a-garden/articleshow/84458117.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Hyderabad||Rain wreaks havoc in Old City, Osman Nagar badly hit again||HYDERABAD: Rain wreaked havoc in parts of Old City on Wednesday night forcing people to move to safer places overnight. Waterlogging, power outage and inundation added to the residents’ woes at several places. The residents complained that despite multiple calls, officials concerned reportedly failed to respond and help them out. Osman Nagar, which has been submerged for weeks, once again was inundated, forcing people to leave their houses and move to their respective relatives’ house for shelter. The residents alleged that apathy of the authorities and improper mechanisms caused immense problems for the people. The most-affected areas include Al Jubail Colony, Talabkatta, Hafizbabanagar, Gulshan Iqban Colony, Barkas, Bahadurpura and Kishanbagh. “Many localities in Old City that witnessed heavy rains include Talabkatta, Yakutpura, Chotapul, Azampura, Hafizbabanagar, Gulshan Iqbal Colony, Al Jubail Colony, Barkas, Bahadurpura, Kishanbagh, Shahalibanda and Qazipura. The residents kept in touch with officials concerned but there is no proper action yet,’’ said Mohammed Ahmed, TDP, GHMC minority cell vice-president. “Generally, an action plan is drawn ahead of the monsoon by GHMC and electricity department officials. However, this time around, no such process was seen, thus, their carelessness and ignorance towards the Old City have once again been exposed by the rain last night. It does seem that they have failed to take note of the previous rain fury in Hyderabad and people are left to suffer such situations. Also, overflowing sewage added to the residents’ worries as desilting had to be carried out before the rainy season but nothing has been done,’’ he said. Moreover, the residents complained that overflowing sewage entered into their houses. “The water entered the houses due to the overflowing drain at certain places. The accumulation of rainwater in potholes has also inconvenienced the people in Old City,” said Khasim, a local resident. Women in the area demanded the state government take immediate note and come out with effective measures to tackle the inundation problem. “There is no drainage line here for water to drain out, and many a times we drew the attention of authorities and local leaders, but no one took the matter seriously. If the trend continues there is a possible outbreak of seasonal diseases,’’ a resident of Shaheen Nagar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rain-wreaks-havoc-in-old-city-osman-nagar-badly-hit-again/articleshow/84455338.cms||---

After chairing a party core committee meeting, Sukhbir said, “We understand that there are external forces which want to disturb the peace of Punjab by pitching communities against each other. We want to guarantee Punjabis that the SAD will continue to follow the policies of Parkash Singh Badal under which all religions were respected and honoured.” He had earlier announced on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Bhim Rao Ambedkar that his party would offer one deputy chief minister position to a dalit once voted to power. Punjab had the highest proportion of dalits of any state, and it was felt that more efforts should be made to protect their interests, the SAD president said, adding the decision to have two deputy CMs was in consonance with the “liberal secular ethos of ‘Sarbat Da Bhala’ handed down to us through the rich heritage of the great Guru Sahiban.” In the forthcoming parliament session, the SAD would move an adjournment motion demanding the three agricultural laws be repealed, he announced. “We have already spoken to Shiv Sena, NCP, DMK, BSP and TMC and they have would be supporting the adjournment motion in Lok Sabha. We are in the process of contacting other parties and would try to gather maximum support for the motion,” SAD Rajya Sabha member Naresh Gujral said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-bsp-alliance-to-have-hindu-dalit-as-deputy-cms-sukhbir/articleshow/84457898.cms||---
---||India||Hints of Navjot Singh Sidhu as next PCC chief spark row||NEW DELHI/CHANDIGARH: Amid continuing signals that Navjot Sidhu may be handed the charge of the Punjab Congress, an official suggestion to this effect on Thursday triggered a controversy, forcing a notional backpedalling by the party and laying bare the pressures and counter pressures at play. AICC incharge of Punjab Harish Rawat was quoted in the media as saying that Sidhu could be made the party president and a peace formula to ensure that the cricketer-turned-politician and CM Amarinder Singh were on the same page had been worked out. The remark turned up the political heat among Punjab leaders opposed to Sidhu who view him as a newcomer to the party. While some started contacting the Delhi leadership over what was coming, those close to the CM as well as the GenNext leaders antagonistic to Sidhu were agitated. A war of wits played out in public, with separate meetings of the CM with loyalists, while Sidhu called on dissident ministers in Amarinder’s cabinet. Amid the heightened tension, Rawat, following a meeting with Congress president Sonia Gandhi in the evening, mildly retraced his steps. “I didn’t say that Sidhu was becoming president. I was asked if he was, and I had said that a decision was being taken around what you are saying,” he told reporters. CM Singh has opposed Sidhu’s elevation as the party chief with dire warnings to the party brass of chaos, terming him as unpredictable and unreliable, it is learnt. Given the developments, there were rumours that CM Singh was resigning from his post, but his media adviser Raveen Thukral dismissed them as “humbug”. As the party has been saying for a while that a decision was on the anvil, it is to be seen when a formal announcement is made and whether it is able to douse the raging fires in Punjab Congress. What has complicated the issue in recent days are tweets by Sidhu alluding to AAP, even if as part of social media warfare, with many viewing them as subtle warnings from Sidhu that he could bolt if his wishes were not fulfilled. Sidhu all along has been adamant about being made the state chief and has found a strong backer in AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. Sources in the Congress management have, however, stated that any formula elevating Sidhu will have to have CM Singh on board. In view of Sidhu’s strong attacks on Singh, it is felt that a sort of reassurance to CM Singh about future leadership and respect at the hands of the maverick politician would be required to bring about a meeting of minds. Without this ground work, sources said that state government and party leadership in Punjab will work at cross purposes which will only hurt the Congress and demoralise the cadre in the run up to the polls. The duelling show of strength laid bare the faultlines in the state Congress. Sidhu held a meeting of anti Amarinder ministers and MLAs at the residence of cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa. Those present included ministers Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria and Charanjit Singh Channi, and six MLAs. On the other hand, about two dozen Amarinder loyalists including ministers, MLAs and MPs reached the CM’s farmhouse at Siswan in Mohali to take stock. As part of the revamp formula being worked out, Congress may appoint two or three working presidents belonging to Hindu communities for social balance, with Sidhu as party president. At the same time, Amarinder could be named the chairman of the campaign committee and Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa is likely to head the manifesto panel of the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hints-of-navjot-singh-sidhu-as-next-pcc-chief-spark-row/articleshow/84460516.cms||---

Jaspal Singh Manjhpur is lawyer in the blasphemy case of 2007 against Gurmeet Ram Rahim. He wrote to the jathedar that while the Badal government had let off the dera chief, the later Amarinder government had failed to investigate this relief. Manjhpur is defence lawyer in several UAPA (Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act) cases that were registered when the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) or the Congress was in power. The lawyer wrote to the jathedar: “Sirsa dera head’s imitation of Guru Gobind Singh in 2007 at Salabatpura was a prelude to the sequence of sacrilege. The Badals were in power in Punjab when the dera head was booked in this case. After a while, it became clear that Punjab Police wanted to shut the case, so Hardeep Singh Mehraj and I impleaded ourselves as complainants. Despite glaring evidence against the dera chief, police filed a cancellation report in January 2012, just before the assembly elections.” He wrote that the cancellation report had “political motives” but he had moved the high court, yet neither Badal nor Amarinder had tried to prosecute and punish the dera chief. The letter reads: “The case is pending but no Sikh representative in nine years has shown interest in taking it up. Even Badal and BJP have acted against the Guru, though you point finger at only the present chief minister. As jathedar, you said the Khalsa Panth was capable of doing justice on its own... but let’s not confine the context to the current time or vote politics. The case is only a step latter to power in Punjab. Those in power strike deals with those behind sacrilege.” Even as Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar and MLA Pargat Singh have asked for reopening the case, their own government hasn’t respondent. However, after the jathedar spoke on Wednesday, the SAD also accused the government of letting off the dera head.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/badal-let-off-dera-chief-but-in-2007-lawyer-to-jathedar/articleshow/84457945.cms||IP Singh
---||Delhi||Armyman arrested for role in spy ring busted by cops, military intel||NEW DELHI: An Army naik has been arrested by Crime Branch for his alleged involvement in the espionage ring busted by Delhi Police and Military Intelligence. On Thursday, TOI had reported that the accused, now identified as Paramjit, was posted at Agra cantonment in a sensitive unit. Earlier, he was posted at Pokhran. He was inducted by Habib-ur-Rahman alias Habib Khan, a vegetable vendor near the Pokhran base, who was arrested in the case earlier. The probe led the investigators to an entity code-named “Kamal”, who is suspected to be a Pakistan High Commission official, a senior officer confirmed. The agencies have stumbled on communication between Khan and this entity. Khan claimed that he was being blackmailed into working for ISI by “Kamal”, even though he wanted to pull out after the first exchange of information. Police found that Khan had travelled to Sindh province in Pakistan a few years ago to visit his relatives, where he was inducted by ISI. Khan convinced the armyman to share classified documents and coordinates for Rs 5-7 lakh. The payments were made through hawala channels, the senior officer said. Both Paramjit and Khan have been booked under Section 3/9 of Official Secrets Act. Special commissioner (Crime) Praveer Ranjan said the documents seized from Khan show locations and coordinates of military bases in the country. A mobile phone containing incriminating data has also been seized from him. “Army headquarters has confirmed to us that the documents seized from Khan are classified. Our probe has established that Khan has family members living in Sindh. About two years ago, he came in touch with his ISI handlers there. A probe is on to find out with whom the classified documents were shared,” added Ranjan. During interrogation, Khan told police that the information provided to him by Paramjit was passed on to his Pakistani handlers. “He was paid in cash by his handlers for his services. Money was then transferred to the bank accounts of the armyman by hawala traders through wire transfers. Even in the past, he had sent several documents, CDs containing information related to the military and other vital information to his handlers for which he was paid handsomely,” said the senior officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/armyman-arrested-for-role-in-spy-ring-busted-by-cops-military-intel/articleshow/84455378.cms||---

Lauding the policy, the Federation of Telangana Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FTCCI) said it expects that with better logistics infrastructure the competitiveness of pharmaceuticals, engineering, biotechnology, electronics manufacturing and e-commerce can be enhanced. “With the creation of Pharma City, Hyderabad will emerge as a logistics hub for life-sciences as well as other related industries. Telangana government is also actively pursuing a large number of theme-based industrial hubs like biotechnology, electronics, aviation, seeds, food processing, textiles, furniture and leather. All these parks and hubs require integration with logistics infrastructure,” said Saurabh Kumar, chair, FTCCI Logistics Committee. As per the state logistics policy, Telangana will focus on development of a robust logistics infrastructure by encouraging investors to park funds in the development of multi-modal logistics parks (MMLPs), integrated logistics parks and large-scale storage infrastructure facilities across the state. FICCI Telangana state council chairman T Muralidharan pointed out that Telangana has been focussing on creating irrigation infrastructure and this is expected to result in higher agricultural output. “Farmers will be able to derive higher value from the improved agricultural output only if there is a robust logistical infrastructure in the state. This policy is expected to give a boost to the creation of logistics infrastructure,” he added. As per the policy, the government will be offering incentives for setting up of warehouses of capacity greater than 1 lakh sft and cold storage capacity greater than 20,000 sft. Further, to improve storage capacities near tribal zones (within 20 km from outskirts of tribal zones), the government will provide incentives for the development of warehouses with capacity greater than 10,000 sft and cold storages of capacities greater than 5,000 sft. These projects will be eligible for capital and interest subsidy. However, Muralidharan of FICCI said the real test of the policy will be its effectiveness in bringing down the overall logistics costs in the state while helping entrepreneurs in this sector thrive. CII Telangana chairman Sameer Goel said the policy is expected to draw more investments in the logistics sector in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-inc-hails-logistics-policy-expects-it-to-boost-industrial-growth/articleshow/84455373.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Killer couple chopped body through night||NEW DELHI: The investigation into the murder of a 72-year-old woman in Mohan Garden near Dwarka has revealed some gruesome details. It appears the killers, an event manager and his wife, sat through the night and chopped the victim’s body into over a dozen parts. The couple also stole jewellery, documents, a cellphone and other valuables. According to police, the accused couple took a loan from a firm against the jewellery. They claimed they only got Rs 70,000 for it. However, this helped them release their own mortgaged jewellery. Cops are trying to recover the robbed items during the remand period of the accused. While the head and some parts of the victim’s body have been found, the torso is still missing. “It appears the body was chopped into 15-18 parts. The autopsy of the recovered parts, which are highly decomposed, will confirm the details,” said an officer. The statement of the auto driver who dropped them to Najafgarh with the body parts in the bags has been recorded. He told police that he had asked the man about the contents of the bags and got the reply that it was chicken being taken for a party. On the night of June 30, the accused man, Anil Arya, and his wife, went to the house of the victim, Kavita Grover. Arya punched her in the face when she asked about the money she had lent him. He then strangled her with a nylon rope. They chopped the body and filled the parts into two bags. However, as the bags became heavy, they chopped the limbs further and filled them into a third bag to make it easy to carry, the officer said. The suspects then thoroughly cleaned the house multiple times to wipe away any signs of the crime. However, they failed to notice a few drops of blood splashed onto the fridge. This eventually led police to them. The couple stayed put in their house till July 3 to thwart any suspicion on them. When Grover’s son and daughter-in-law returned from their hometown, they lodged a missing complaint on not finding her at home. This was when the accused couple left Delhi. They first went to Ranikhet and then proceeded towards Bareilly where they took a room on rent. When police stumbled upon CCTV footage showing the couple exiting the house, they tracked down the taxi driver who said he had dropped them at a bus stand in Rampur. The couple were finally nabbed from Bareilly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/killer-couple-chopped-body-through-night/articleshow/84455433.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Shivranjani hit and run accused Parv Shah denied bail||AHMEDABAD: A sessions court at the Mirzapur rural court campus on Thursday denied bail to Parv Shah, accused in the Shivranjani hit-and-run incident, in which a 38-year-old woman, Satu Bhabhor, was killed on on the footpath last month. The court noticed that due to such accidents, people in India do not feel safe while walking or even on footpaths. Refusing bail to Shah, additional sessions judge J A Thakkar noted that the poor family of daily wagers was sleeping on the pavement and they were seriously injured in the accident. While Satu was killed, four others were seriously injured and are presently being treated at a hospital in Dahod. Their difficult time has not ended yet. “The poor family has been scattered and this incident occurred due to the act of the present applicant-accused…such incidents of road accidents are increasing day by day and citizens of India are living with fear because of these kind of incidents and cannot walk fearlessly, and they are not safe even on the pavement. Therefore, the interest of the society is also required to be considered at this stage,” the court observed. After citing a TOI report on the cost involved in road accidents in India, the court said in the context of the present case, “This is very significant for us and we should not forget that each life is precious whether that it is from a poor or rich family, urban or rural area, male or female and at any level of society.” The court rejected arguments by Shah’s lawyer for bail, and accepted the submissions made by the district government pleader P M Trivedi that there is a strong prima facie case made out against Shah and the probe is at a delicate stage. The court said considering the larger interest of the society, this is not a fit case to exercise its discretionary power and grant bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hit-and-run-parv-shah-denied-bail/articleshow/84455395.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune police: Dry panchanama reports to nail 4 in 2 MCOCA cases||PUNE: The city police have prepared dry panchanama reports as digital forensic evidence in two cases of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) by recreating the crime scenes using CCTV footage recovered from different spots. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta ordered the dry digital panchanama. It was conducted two weeks ago. “This has been done for the first time in Pune city. It helped in proving the identity and involvement of the arrested men in the crimes,” said assistant commissioner of police Sunil Pawar, who is investigating both the cases. In May, crime branch officials had nabbed Deepak Mali (25) and Mukesh Salunkhe (25) of Hadapsar for snatching a gold chain of an elderly person in Pashan, following which a chain-snatching case was registered with the Chatushrungi police. “Both the suspects are involved in 25 chain-snatching cases. We had invoked MCOCA against them in June,” Pawar said. The police had seized their motorcycle, shirts, boots, jackets, handkerchiefs and even masks. In another case of a robbery that took place on the night of June 11 in Manjari, the crime branch arrested Sonya alias Harish Bhosale (24) and Purushottam Rajendra Veer (25) of Hadapsar. “Both are involved in 24 cases of robbery and other body offenses,” Pawar said, adding, “The duo, who were armed with sharp weapons, had robbed cellphone, cash and wristwatch, collectively worth Rs 12,000, of a man walking to his residence in Manjari.” “We wanted to create strong evidence in both the cases after invoking provisions of MCOCA. Thus, we decided to create a dry digital panchanama report to reconfirm their identities in the crime,” Pawar said. The police has also sent the recreated crime scene to the state forensic laboratory. “The CCTVs at 12 different spots in the city had recorded the movement of the two arrested chain snatchers,” he said. The crime scene was recreated asking the suspects to wear the same clothes they were wearing during the crime time. “The suspects looked the same in the original footage and in the footage in the recreated scene,” Pawar said. Similarly, the suspects involved in the Manjari robbery were taken to the crime scene where they had robbed a pedestrian. “We recreated the entire scene around midnight,” he said. When contacted, advocate and cybercrime expert Gaurav Jachak said, “Police can recreate the entire crime scene for further investigations. However, there is no provision in law to conduct such an exercise. The original footage of the CCTV cameras, which has recorded the crime, has been recovered by the police with the Hash (#) value, so there is no need to conduct such dry runs of the crime scene.” “Apart from this, if the vehicle and clothes of the suspects are recovered, which are seen in the CCTV footage (of the original crime scene), it is sufficient as an evidence in the court,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dry-panchanama-reports-to-nail-4-in-two-mcoca-cases/articleshow/84455394.cms||---

Pandya, who is the deputy superintendent of police of SC/ST cell Kutch (West), stated he wanted to be relieved from service as he had completed 20 years in the police department. He wrote the letter on Thursday and addressed it to the additional chief secretary (home). “I had joined police service on May 2001 and completed 20 years on May 1, 2021. Due to personal reasons, I do not want to continue with the present job. I willingly present this letter to seek voluntary retirement from service. I request you to relieve me from October 31, 2021,” Pandya wrote. Pandya told TOI, “I have done enough service for the country. Now, I want to give other young officers a chance to do the same.” He added, “I have done many things including journalism so I may pursue a different career. But I will think about it after taking a break following my VRS.” Ashish Pandya was a sub-inspector in SOG (special operations group) in Banaskantha when a team of Gujarat police shot Tulsi Prajapati in December 2006 near Chhapri check post in the district. It was alleged that Pandya had shot at Prajapati and was arrested in 2010 by CID (crime). The CBI alleged that Pandya had shot himself in the arm to show that Prajapati had opened fire, provoking police action. In May, 2015, he resumed service after getting bail and was acquitted in December 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/acquitted-in-sohrab-tulsi-case-dysp-ashish-pandya-seeks-vrs/articleshow/84455429.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Link between Delta variant and mucor just a hypothesis: Nagpur experts||NAGPUR: Even as a debate has been initiated regarding a probable link between the Delta variant of coronavirus and mucormcyosis, experts from the district task force feel it can only be a hypothesis at best, and would require a detailed scientific study to establish the claim. So far, lack of microbiological surveillance, use of contaminated water to supply oxygen and injudicious use of steroids were thought to be the major causes of Covid-recovered patients contracting black fungus. The prevalence of the flesh-eating fungus was largely seen in Nagpur, Pune and Mumbai, just as the second wave started to subdue. Following high court orders, the district administration had set up different expert groups to look for probable sources of the fungus. Of late, scientific debates are revolving around a possible direct link between the Delta variant and black fungus in the wake of the double mutant being found in different countries. As per these specialists, the strain B.1617.2 directly affects the beta cells of pancreas, causing diabetes and disruption in blood glucose levels. In Nagpur, which has seen one of the highest number of black fungus cases, a generalized retrospective analysis is going on. Study group members say lack of sufficient data may hinder a scientific retrospective study. Dr Uday Narlawar, head of preventive and social medicine department at GMCH, said both the beliefs — impact of Delta variant and immunosuppressants — regarding black fungus attack are only observations. “It has been observed that the probability of mucormycosis is high among patients who were on steroids during the second wave. But patients were given the same drugs in first wave too,” said Dr Narlawar, who is part of the expert group. He added, “Similarly, the Delta variant is now prevalent in many countries now but they are not reporting so many mucor cases. Nothing has so far been scientifically established.” Head and neck surgeon Dr Shailesh Kothalkar, who treated many mucormycosis patients, said, “Certain retrospective studies have found that the Delta variant was causing more immunosuppression. It got worse when patients were given steroids — an immunosuppressant-category drug. It was the cumulative effect of the Delta variant causing immunosuppression and immunosuppression by steroid.” Dr Kothalkar added, “Besides, known cases of diabetes are prone to infection. As compared to previous variants, immunosuppressant status was very high during prevalence of this variant.” The Delta variant also triggered diabetes in 40% new patients. “The variant damages beta cells of the pancreas. It causes diabetogenic condition in the patients. In some recovered patients it was transient, meaning only for a few months,” he said. The debate *ICUs and treatment protocol were same during both waves * Just an observation that mucor was hospital-acquired infection *Second wave triggered by double mutant, which is now classified as variant of concern by WHO * Mucor a parasite and grows amid weak immunity * Delta attacks beta cells of pancreas which leads to uncontrolled blood glucose level * Patients with compromised immunity and having been given immunosuppressant vulnerable to black fungus * Retrospective studies directly link mucor with Delta attack on multiple fronts * Heart attack, brain infarcts, kidney failure, intestine are affected in recovered patients||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/link-between-delta-variant-and-mucor-just-a-hypothesis-experts/articleshow/84453112.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Now, it was extended it to July 30,” said officials, adding: “In 2020, the advance rebate scheme was extended till August-end.” The officials said that AMC has seen 70% rise in collection from the eastern parts of the city. Viratnagar, Nikol, Gomtipur, Odhav, Vastral, and Amraiwadi registered the highest increase of 90%. “This was probably because Odhav, Vastral, and Gomtipur are industrial areas. With industries getting back to normal, property owners are taking benefit of advance tax payments,” said officials. AMC saw only 50% hike in collection from the central zone as well as western parts of the city. The increase was noticed in advance tax payment on commercial properties more than residential ones. Civic officials said, “The tax on residential property is a smaller amount. Hence, a significant increase was not registered.” Further, officials said that the increase in vehicle tax was also an indication that more vehicles had been sold this year as compared to last year. As against a collection of Rs 7.32 crore in 2020 between April 1 and July 15, the collection this year was Rs 28.69 crore — an increase of 292% or Rs 21.37 crore. The overall tax collection of AMC which included property tax, vehicle tax and professional tax, was Rs 347.93 in 2020 during the same period which increased by 54% and was Rs 536.45 this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/you-can-avail-of-property-tax-rebate-till-july-30/articleshow/84455537.cms||---

There are unconfirmed records of 82 bungas in the vicinity of the Golden Temple from the Sikh misl period. Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) chief secretary Harjinder Singh Dhami confirmed to have found “an old tunnel” during the digging for the foundation of the ‘jora ghar’. He said the SGPC had informed the deputy commissioner and asked for verification of the authenticity of the old structure.

Locals, who found the leopard caught in the fence on a farmland at Jothi Nagar, had informed the forest department. The animal, about three years old, might have got caught in a snare planted in the fence, assistant conservator of forests Saravanakumar said. “It would have struggled to release itself from the snare the whole night and thus it had hurt its hind legs badly. It took nearly eight hours for our team to release it from the snare. However, the animal died within half-an-hour after it was released,” he said. “We guess that stress was the main reason for the cause of death,” the official said. The carcass was brought to a forest rest house at Deer Park near the Ooty Lake for postmortem. Samples were collected for lab tests. Later, the carcass was burnt inside a reserve forest. “The snare was placed for poaching wild boar. An inquiry is underway,” Saravanakumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/leopard-caught-in-barbed-wire-dies-near-ooty/articleshow/84455476.cms||---

The key accused was nabbed from Central Delhi where he had come to meet one of his associates. This illegal telecom exchange caused loss of crores of rupees to the government. “The accused, Nawab, was a key operator of the syndicate. The illegal international GSM termination exchanges were set up using SIP trunk, Internet and server-based technologies. The busted setups were illegally terminating foreign calls in India, bypassing the legal international and national gateways of Indian telecom service providers. Caller Line Identification used to display Indian numbers for the internationally landed calls. In this manner, a huge number of calls went unregulated, causing massive loss of revenues and posing threat to national security,” said Pramod Kushwah, deputy commissioner of police, Special Cell. Inputs were being received over the last two months through sources that some illegal telephone exchanges are running in Delhi-NCR and other parts of the country causing huge financial loss to the telecom sector. Accordingly, coordinated efforts were made with intelligence agencies to locate such setups. Recently, an input was received that a huge volume of incoming international calls were switching using routers located somewhere in Daryaganj. A raid was conducted on the location and two server boxes, three high speed FTTH routers, one SIP Trunk and one laptop were recovered. The illegal telecom exchange was being operated remotely. Another illegal telecom exchange has been busted in Shahdara. Routers and a line machine have been recovered from the location.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/telecom-exchange-racket-busted-1-held/articleshow/84455521.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Pune||Pune Municipal Corporation gets general body nod to prepare development plan for 23 merged villages||PUNE: The general body of the BJP-led PMC on Thursday approved the civic administration’s proposal to prepare the draft development plan (DP) for the 23 villages recently merged with the municipal limits despite the state entrusting PMRDA with the task. The state government had on Wednesday issued a notification stating that the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) would draft the development plan for the 23 villages recently merged with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits. The BJP, which has a majority in the PMC, supported the civic administration’s proposal, saying that PMC was the planning authority and must get the right of drafting the DP for the merged villages. The proposal was approved after 95 corporators voted in favour of the proposal as against 59 opposing it. Opposition parties, including the NCP, Congress, Shiv Sena and the MNS, had opposed the move and termed the general body meeting convened by the civic body “unofficial”. As the elected members could not arrive at the conclusion of the proposal following a debate, the issue was put for voting. Ganesh Bidkar, leader of the house in PMC, said, “Taking away the DP from PMC and giving it to PMRDA is unconstitutional. It is an infringement of the civic body’s powers conferred on it by the Constitution. We held the general body meeting and expressed interest in drafting the DP to uphold the civic body’s rights.” NCP corporator Prashant Jagtap said, “It was pointless to convene the general body (GB) meeting after the state appointed PMRDA the planning authority.” Ulhas (Aba) Bagul, leader of Congress in PMC, said, “If the civic body again starts drafting the DP, it will be a time consuming process. Public money will be spent unnecessarily on work done by the PMRDA. It (PMRDA) should be allowed to prepare the DP.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-gets-gb-nod-to-prepare-dp-for-23-merged-villages/articleshow/84455553.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

The guest worker, who was working on a 14-storey under-construction building at Panampilly Nagar in Ernakulam, died after he got crushed between a concrete structure and the scaffolding around the building on Thursday. The deceased has been identified as Sanjeev Singh, 22, from West Bengal. Fire force personnel brought down the man’s body dangling on the scaffolding with great difficulty. The accident occured when plastering works of the apartment complex were going on. Two others who were near Singh had a narrow escape. Fire force sources said that the workers were working on the exterior of the building by hanging onto the scaffolding with harnesses. They were at a height of about 40m when the concrete structure fell on them at around 11:30am. Fire personnel said that the concrete structure was a beam of about 5.5m length and 2.4m width. A decorative brick wall attached with it also collapsed. The entire structure weighing around 1,500kg was set up on the terrace above the 14th floor of the building. It got detached from the main structure, slid outside and crushed the man onto the scaffolding, sources said. T B Ramakrishnan, station officer of fire and rescue station, Gandhi Nagar, who led the rescue team said that it took 10 personnel nearly two-and-half hours to get the victim down from the precarious position. Singh was rushed to a nearby hospital but he was declared dead on arrival. Fire force personnel prima facie suspect that the imbalance of the structure was the likely reason for it falling apart. Meanwhile, in a rain-related mishap, Kanakamma, 72, wife of late Kochuparambil Sadanandan, died after the mud retaining wall near her house caved in on her at Adivaram near Thamarassery on Thursday at around 10:30 am. She was cooking food in a thatched shed behind her house when the mishap occurred. Though local residents managed to take her out from the piled-up soil, she could not be saved. Though she was taken to a private hospital nearby, she was declared brought dead. The body was shifted to Kozhikode government medical college for postmortem. She is survived by sons Sabu Lal, Saji Lal and daughter Sindhu. As many as 45 houses in Kozhikode were partially-damaged in the rains and strong winds on Thursday. While 16 houses were partially damaged in Thamarassery taluk, 29 of them were in Koyilandy taluk. Meanwhile, the body of Jishnu, 22, son of Naveen Kumar hailing from Ponnempadam near Vazhayur, who went missing in the Chaliyar river while bathing with friends on Wednesday was recovered on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/guest-worker-woman-killed-in-separate-freak-accidents/articleshow/84455649.cms||---

Several schools have completed vaccination of their staff. Schools said that they are all ready to see the students attending classes again. Missionary schools will decide on Saturday about reopening in the present circumstances. School administration said that they have made it mandatory for the staff to get completely vaccinated. “Double dose vaccination is a long process. There is a gape of 84 days between two doses. Due to this reason, we have made it mandatory for the employees to be completely vaccinated. You can see that most of the schools have either completely vaccinated their staff or will be completing it by July 26,” said vice-president, Vice president, Madhya Pradesh Association of Unaided Private Schools.

---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Spate of cyber crimes keeps cops on toes||BHOPAL: There has been a steep increase in cyber crime cases during the ongoing pandemic. Cops have been regularly issuing various advisories to warn people against these online cheats who are ready to pounce on the vulnerable lot, but still a large number of people are being duped by the online fraudsters every day. City cops maintain that cyber crimes were happening in pre-Covid-19 era too, but now police have been focusing on solving them so it has led to an increase in awareness. Speaking on the modus operandi used by online fraudsters, a senior police officer of cyber crime branch Bhopal said, a large number of ‘nude video call’ extortion cases are being reported in which the online thugs befriend the victims on social media platforms posing as women. These cyber criminals lure the victims to make nude video calls on WhatsApp and record the obscene video of the victims using screen recording software and then send threat messages to them to pay extortion money. In some cases, the accused sent the obscene videos of the victims to their friends and relatives on social media platforms. Sources said, a number of financial frauds are also being reported in which the online thugs dupe people on pretext of vaccination registration, selling essential items needed for corona treatment like oxygen concentrators. The online thugs even share the photographs of Covid-19 patients posing as members of an NGO involved in helping patients and collect money from people online on pretext of donation for treatment. These thugs also send links for vaccination registration through which they steal the details of victims and siphon money from their bank accounts. From‘lottery fraud’, to KYC fraud, loan fraud, job fraud , many such cases are being reported on a regular basis. ASP (Cyber-crime branch) Ankit Jaiswal said, victims should report the cyber crime cases immediately to police, especially in case of financial frauds. The money siphoned by the accused from the victims’ accounts remains in their bank accounts for some time before they withdraw it. If the cases are reported to police immediately, police would contact the banks concerned to freeze the bank accounts of the fraudsters, which were used to siphon money. Jaiswal said, for this purpose the cyber crime branch has started a helpline for such frauds and people can now immediately inform police on Helpline Number - 0755-2920664, WhatsApp number - 9479990636 or email their complaints on dspcrimebho@mp.gov.in .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cyber-cell-shares-how-to-stay-safe-from-e-crime/articleshow/84453255.cms||Sudeept Mishra
---||Pune||PMRDA to give building permissions in new areas||Pune: The PMRDA will grant building permissions in 23 villages recently merged into the PMC limits. Building permission is the second biggest source of income after property tax for the local self-government bodies, and the Pune Municipal Corporation may not get any revenue from this sector as far as the 23 villages are concerned. “The state has declared Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) as the planning authority for the 23 merged villages. So all work pertaining to planning, including building permissions, will be vested with the PMRDA,” Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar said on Thursday. PMC officials are unhappy with the arrangement on the ground that though the civic body would not be providing the building permission in the 23 villages, the municipality would have to bear all expenses in these areas. An official said the civic administration would lose around Rs200 crore from building permissions in the merged villages. Illegal constructions in these villages are also a major concern for the civic body, which would have to spend money to deal with the unauthorized properties, an official said. Data available with the PMC revealed that the civic administration on an average earned Rs 800 crore from building permissions every year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmrda-to-give-building-permissions-in-new-areas/articleshow/84455644.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

---||Patna||16 feared dead in West Champaran ‘hooch tragedy’||BETTIAH: At least 16 persons are feared dead in a suspected hooch tragedy in West Champaran on Wednesday. Even as villagers in grief carried out cremations and burials quietly since Wednesday across several villages, the rising death toll since then sparked fearful messages apprehending a larger head count by Thursday evening.Even as local reporters went on a wild goose hunt in response to the mounting word of mouth reports, TOI was able to gather the names of sixteen suspected casualties by the time of filing this report late on Thursday night. Champaran Range DIG Lallan Mohan Prasad told TOI that he too had received information that many people had succumbed after consuming hooch at Deorwa Deoraj village under Lauriya police station. "We are verifying the report," he guardedly said.Mohammad Javed, PACS chief and former mukhiya of Telpur, soon tapped his deep social network across different villages in the area to gather a list of 16 dead. Sharing the names of the deceased, he told TOI over phone, "There is palpable fear that the toll may rise or be more than 20-25."The rising death toll across villages since Wednesday set the cluster of over dozen villages in the Deoraj region spread from Lauriya PS to Ramnagar PS (the latter in Bagaha police district) agog with stories alleging mockery of Bihar’s prohibition law that is in force since 2016. "Now people are talking of several hooch outlets in the area," Javed said, adding that villagers are mentioning three outlets in Deorwa itself. "One of these is/was run by one Thug Sah. In fact, these Deorwa ‘bhattis’ (hooch bars) even outsourced liquor to one Kisun Ram of Baswaria," he summed by the grapevine running viral in the area on Thursday after reports of casualties spread. Binod Kushwaha of Hardia, a newspaper vendor who peddles through Deoraj villages each morning, said: "People have quietly buried or cremated the dead." Echoing Kushwaha, Javed told TOI: "People in fear of police reprisal hurried with the last rites."A list of the sixteen suspect hooch victims, collated by Javed with inputs from different villages reads: Bikau Ansari (45), Ram Briksh Pasi (35), Lateef Mian (60) -- all from Deorwa; Suresh Turha (50), Naim Mian (70), Basisth Soni (40), Hira Lal Dom (45) from Jogia; Bhuttu Mian (30), Tej Mohammad (65) and Jawahir Mian (50) from Sabeya; Amirul Sah (25) from Baswaria, Ratul Mian (55) from Bagahi, Julphan Mian (38) from Dumra, Ijahrul Ansari (45) and Jhunna Mian (35) from Gabnaha and Arun Pandey alias Bhagwan Panda from Panda Patti.What is feared to be common amongst the deceased is they allegedly frequented the hooch joints at Deorwa. "As one after the other spread in different villages fell ill, they were rushed for private treatment and avoided government hospitals," Javed said, adding that one Izhar Mian from his own Telpur village was availing treatment at a private hospital in Bettiah. "Two victims -- Bhartari Sah (65) and Firoz Mian (45) -- have fortunately returned home in Sabeya after treatment," he said. "Those who have recovered shall tell the full story," he added.CPI(ML) leader Sunil Rao expressed shock at the reported casualties. "We will send a team to get the report from the ground tomorrow," he said. Congress leader Shashwat Kedar said the state’s prohibition policy stands exposed. "The CM should adopt the policy of raising education and awareness levels to curb alcohol abuse just as he advocates for population control," Kedar told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/16-feared-dead-in-west-champaran-hooch-tragedy/articleshow/84453326.cms||Abhay Mohan Jha

It also said that there was no law prohibiting setting up of a new airport within 150 km of an existing civilian airport. In a counter-affidavit filed before the National Green Tribunal, GVIAL said the project pertained to developing the Bhogapuram airport and that only 2,004 acres for phase I development along with 119 acres for approach road was contemplated. “There is no project for 15,000 acres as alleged by an appellant in respect of the Bhogapuram airport,” said GVIAL. The NGT was hearing a petition of an agriculture land owner Sridevi Datla of Visakhapatnam whose land was acquired for the airport project. GVIAL said: “The appellant’s contention that Bhogapuram airport is in violation of ministry of civil aviation’s greenfield airport policy is wrong and liable to be rejected. The ministry has given the EC after considering all factors. Conditions mentioned in the EC more than adequately address concerns of the precautionary principle and sustainable development measures.” GVIAL in its affidavit said: “There is no prohibition for setting up a new airport within 150 km of an existing civilian airport. However, in Vizag, the existing airport is not a civilian airport but a naval airport.” The EC was given for development of phase I of the greenfield international airport at Bhogapuram in Vizianagaram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bhogapuram-airport-ec-obtained-after-due-process/articleshow/84458215.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Mumbai||Remove banner at government plot in Madh in Mumbai: HC to tehsildar||Mumbai: Bombay high court on Thursday directed a man to immediately remove a banner he had placed on a corrugated tin sheet at the entrance of a government plot that said, ‘Patel House- name is enough’. The high court bench of S J Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav directed the local tehsildar to remove it if the man fails to do so. The man, along with five others, has allegedly erected half a dozen “illegal structures” on government land in Madh Island, Erangal village, Shanti Nagar, an individual who said he owns land behind the state’s plot has claimed. His advocates, Niranjan Mogre and Siddhesh Borkar, said the construction blocked their client’s right of way through the government land. They also pointed to the gate and banner placed by one of the six. The HC on Thursday summoned the tehsildar via video conferencing and questioned why despite holding the post for over two years he had not taken action against the encroachers when they carried out construction during the lockdown. The HC directed that no construction shall be carried out on the government plot by any one named in the petition. The bench also asked the man’s counsel the reason for such a banner. The counsel said his client ran a milk business. With no further explanation forthcoming, the HC said he should convey to his client this was not Shantinagar, Madh Island, but the high court of the state.

---||Amritsar||Gurdwara sealed, Pakistani Sikhs to observe martyrdom anniversary elsewhere||AMRITSAR: The inadequacy of Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) was exposed after the Sikh body gave in to the dictates of a local Muslim group and announced to observe the death anniversary of Shaheed Bhai Taru Singh in Gurdwara Shahid Ganj Singh Singhania, Lahore, and not at Gurdwara Shaheed Bhai Taru Singh that has reportedly been sealed by the Lahore administration under the pressure of a Muslim religious group that claims ownership of the site. Highly placed intelligence sources here informed that the PSGPC would hold a prayer meet at Gurdwara Shaheed Ganj Singh Singhania on Friday that is situated close to Gurdwara Shaheed Bhai Taru Singh. Both gurdwaras are in Naulakha Bazaar, Lahore. Sources added that clerics of Dawat-e-Islami, which is known as a Barelvi proselytizing group, had in recent past publicly announced to not let Sikhs observe the death anniversary of Shaheed Bhai Taru Singh, claiming that the gurdwara was situated at the burial site of a Muslim saint. After the issue reached to ETPB authorities, it was decided that the Muslim group would hold prayers every Thursday while the Sikhs would also observe the death anniversary of Bhai Taru Singh, but it didn’t resolve the issue as the Muslim group wanted complete control of the site following which the Lahore administration sealed the premises. Strangely, the PSGPC, a body of the ETPB, never took up the issue with the Pakistan government or the international Sikh bodies and instead buckled under the pressure of the Muslim group as well as the ETPB. “The PSGPC should have at least made an appeal to the international Sikh community on the issue but they, never did since their interests are aligned with ETPB,” said sources. When contacted, PSGPC president Satwant Singh denied that anyone had wrested control of the gurdwara, but admitted that the premises were sealed last year. He added that there were people who were making false propaganda. ”The government has sealed that plot. We have control of Gurdwara Bhai Taru Singh and we will observe the martyrdom day of Shaheed Bhai Taru Singh on Friday,” said Satwant. However, ETPB chairman Dr. Aamar Ahamd didn’t reply when asked about the present status of Gurdwara Shahid Bhai Taru Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/gurdwara-sealed-pak-sikhs-to-observe-martyrdom-anniv-elsewhere/articleshow/84458197.cms||Yudhvir Rana

A six-foot-long crocodile ventured into the crowded area and made his way through the neighbourhood in Navagadh Mohalla. The locals immediately contacted Wildlife Rescue Trust (WRT) volunteers who rushed to the spot. Meanwhile, hundreds gathered to catch a glimpse of the reptile that was resting calmly by the roadside. WRT volunteers said that the reptile must have ventured out of a drain connected to Vishwamitri River. The reptile was rescued from the spot and taken to the forest department in an auto-rickshaw.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/croc-walks-into-housing-society/articleshow/84453355.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Mumbai hospital denies giving medical certificate to educationist||NAGPUR: In a startling revelation, the Maharashtra government has informed the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court that the Breach Candy Hospital had never provided any medical certificate to controversial educationist Deepak Bajaj. In its affidavit submitted in HC, public prosecutor Nitin Rode informed that the Mumbai hospital had written a letter to the government denying that its doctors ever had signed on the medical certificate produced by Bajaj for seeking bail on the health grounds. A copy of the letter was attached with the affidavit. On request of Bajaj’s lawyer, Justice Rohit Deo adjourned the online hearing till July 27. The educationist is accused of having disproportionate assets and misusing his position as principal of Mahatma Gandhi Centennial School in Jaripatka. Although Bajaj wasn’t granted bail on the basis of that certificate that time, the investigating agencies had sent it to the hospital for verification. It then denied handing over any such certificate. Bajaj finally secured bail in July 2019 from the HC on medical grounds after spending three years behind bars. While allowing his bail application (No 415/19), justice Manish Pitale granted him permission to undergo treatment for his various ailments at any of the three hospitals in Mumbai, which he had demanded. It included Breach Candy, Saifi and Bombay Hospital. Bajaj, secretary of Sindhi Education Society, was told to inform the police station concerned under whose jurisdiction the hospital falls, where he planned to take treatment. The ACB has booked Bajaj and his wife Veena under sections 13(1) E and 13 (20) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, while Jaripatka police booked them under Sections 406, 420, 438, 471, 34, 168, 120B, 201, 409, 467, 193 of IPC. Bajaj moved HC after his bail application was rejected by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) court. He was, however, granted him permission to undergo treatment in a specialized hospital, which would be conducted under judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mumbai-hosp-denies-giving-medical-cert-to-educationist/articleshow/84453347.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Pune||Pune: Man attacked after dispute over potholed road, 2 held||PUNE: A 39-year-old civil engineer sustained injuries to his head, face and hands after eight men threatened him with swords and brutally attacked him with sticks after a dispute over repairing potholes on Tarde Road in Karkunde vasti in Loni Kalbhor near Pune broke out on Tuesday. The Loni Kalbhor police on Thursday arrested two of the eight men on the charge of rioting and voluntarily causing grievous injuries to the victim. The engineer, Anil Jagtap who works in a construction firm, told TOI, “Passing of heavy vehicles like dumpers and truck via Karkunde vasti has caused massive damage to Tarde Road. It has deep potholes. I have held meetings with contractors transporting gravel to the construction sites in the village and convinced them to repair the potholes because the road is mostly used by them.” Jagtap said the contractors were initially reluctant, but they considered his request and instructed their staff to fill the potholes on their own expenses. “On Tuesday around 1.15pm five dumpers reached the spot and the work began. After the news spread, two of the eight men placed a sword on my neck and six others abused and attacked me with sticks. They said I had no authority to fill potholes. I fell unconscious and found injuries to my head, face and hands after I regained consciousness,” Tarde said. The road belongs to state public works department and is meant for light vehicles, but is used by dumpers, trucks,cranes, multi axel lorries and containers. Local residents have time and again complained to government authorities to resurface the road, he added. Senior inspector Rajendra Mokashi said, “We have arrested Ravindra Jagtap and Kishore Jagtap, both farmers, after the engineer registered an FIR against them and others under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Arms Act. A police team has been sent to arrest the other six who are on the run.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-attacked-after-dispute-over-potholed-road-2-held/articleshow/84455711.cms||---

---||Delhi||Israel embassy blast: Nothing to suggest 4 students from Ladakh have terror links, says Delhi court||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court granted bail to four students from Ladakh on Thursday. They had been arrested in connection with a blast near the Israel embassy in January. The court said there was nothing against the students that suggested they were linked with any terrorist organisation or were a threat to society. The students had been arrested from Kargil and brought to Delhi on transit remand in connection with the improvised explosive device blast outside the Israeli embassy on January 29. Chief metropolitan magistrate Dr Pankaj Sharma granted relief to Nazir Hussain, 26, Zulfikar Ali Wazir, 25, Aiaz Hussain, 28 and Muzammil Hussain, 25, on a bail bond of Rs 50,000 with one surety of the same amount each. The court said nothing in the report submitted by police contained any incriminating material against the accused. Police had alleged that this was a case of conspiracy hatched by Islamic outfits and the four were to carry out terrorist attacks in Delhi and other parts of India, targeting western as well as Israeli establishment in India. The students' counsel argued that Wazir, Ajaz and Muzammil were graduates and were in Delhi to prepare for competitive exams while Nazir was at home in Kargil for the last one and half years. The lawyer added that no incriminating content had been found in the posts allegedly uploaded by the men on social media. The court noted that the report filed by the investigating officer indicated that one of the accused used to post highly objectionable material on his Twitter account against Israel, US and other western countries and his Twitter account was followed by Wazir. "Nothing in the police report suggests any of the accused persons was posting any objectionable material against India,” the court said. “The IO has recovered all the electronic gadgets, including mobiles, laptops and pen drive holding voluminous data that is being analysed. The antecedents of all the accused persons are blemish free and they are students.” In its order, the court also said, “Nothing incriminating has been put forth by the IO which suggests that these accused persons have links with any terrorist organisation and they are a threat to society." It further noted that as per the IO’s report, Nazir was a supporter of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran and this was not a terrorist organisation. The court said the accused had been cooperative during the investigation and surrendered all their electronic gadgets. “The IO is in possession of all the electronic devices and its analysis will take a long time. Accordingly, considering their age, antecedents and the fact that all the accused persons are students having roots in society and a fixed place of abode, in the backdrop of the fact that the IO has the custody of the relevant evidence, all the accused persons are ordered to be released on bail.” It directed all the four students to drop a pin on Google Map to share their location with the IO and not to tamper with evidence. It also ordered them to surrender their passports to the cops and not to leave the country without the court’s permission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nothing-to-suggest-4-students-from-ladakh-have-terror-links-says-court/articleshow/84455698.cms||Usha Das

The new development comes as customs is probing the suspected role of TP murder case accused Mohammed Shafi and Kodi Suni in the Karipur gold smuggling case and their links with the gang headed by arrested accused Arjun Ayanki. Police have recovered an audio clip purportedly from Kodi Suni, who is now lodged in Viyyur jail, from the mobile phone of Ashraf raising suspicion that he had intervened on behalf of the gang that took the 2kg of smuggled gold brought by Ashraf on his return from Saudi Arabia on May 29. The rival gang from Koduvally had kidnapped Ashraf, accusing him of giving the smuggled gold to the gang after receiving money. The person who identifies himself as Kodi Suni is heard telling in the audio clip, “The stuff (gold) which was with Ashraf was taken by my friends. You should not go behind it. The guy who brought it (Ashraf) doesn’t know about that matter. They are my company. You pass the information to persons you know”. There have been allegations that Suni and Shafi are involved in the operation of Kannur gangs that steal smuggled gold. It is suspected that the alleged involvement of the duo in the operation was aimed at ensuring protection from being pursued by the owner of the gold, who engages the carrier to bring the contraband through the airport. Vadakara deputy SP KK Abdul Shareef said that the audio clip has to be subjected to a forensic examination to ascertain if the voice belongs to Suni. He added that the primary focus of the investigation was to nab the kidnappers of Ashraf. Meanwhile, customs Preventive wing has collected details of the incident and is likely to pursue the case. Meanwhile, opposition had stepped up its attack against CPM last month after an audio clip of a purported conversation between an unidentified member of a racket stealing smuggled gold with a carrier had surfaced last month which mentions the involvement of Kodi Suni and Mohammed Shafi in gold stealing operations. The audio clip had said that one-third of the proceeds were to be given to the persons mentioned as ‘party’ in the clip to ensure protection to the carrier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/police-recover-purported-audio-clip-of-kodi-suni/articleshow/84455744.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Telangana's Kokapet land auction a hit, HMDA nets Rs 2,000 crore||HYDERABAD: In what could cement Hyderabad’s position as a major real estate hotspot in the country, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) generated Rs 2,000 crore on Thursday from auctions conducted for eight land parcels in Kokapet. Buoyed by the record price fetched at the auctions, senior government officials said Thursday’s auction was an affirmation of Hyderabad emerging as the most favoured destination for investment as well as for real estate development. They said the auctions received an overwhelming response from bidders. The e-auction was held for Neopolis Layout at Kokapet. While the upset price fixed by the government was Rs 25 crore per acre, one of the bidders secured an acre land parcel quoting Rs 60 crore. The lowest bid amount quoted was Rs 31 crore an acre. Overall, a total of Rs 2,000.37 crore was generated from the auctions. Officials said even as the upset bid amount was Rs 25 crore per acre, the bids ranged from Rs 31.2 crore per acre to Rs 60.2 crore per acre with an average bid amount of Rs 40.05 crore per acre. Among the successful bidders for the eight land parcels, seven parcels were secured by real estate firms and developers such as Rajapushpa Properties Private Ltd, Rajapushpa Realty LLP, Aqua Space Developers Pvt Ltd, Prestige Estates Projects Ltd, Hyma Developers Private Ltd and Varsity Education Management Private Ltd. The other one was bid by Satyanarayana Reddy Manne, who participated in his individual capacity and secured a plot for Rs 335 crore. Reddy reportedly owns a pharma company. Rajapushpa Realty emerged as a successful bidder for a small plot in an extent of 1.65 acres which was sold for Rs 60.2 crore per acre. The biggest plot of 8.9 acres was secured by Aqua Space Developers at Rs 39.2 crore per acre. The same group also secured another plot in an extent of 7.73 acres at Rs 36 crore per acre. The auctions for 49 acres were conducted online on MSTC platform in two sessions. In each session, four plots were put up for auction. There was a minimum bid increment of Rs 20 lakh or its multiples per acre. Municipal administration department principal secretary Arvind Kumar said the auction had reaffirmed Hyderabad as a number one hub for development in the country. “The tremendous response from the market is an indication of Hyderabad’s growing stature as a favoured destination for investment and for creating employment opportunities,” he said. P Sreenivas Reddy, executive director of Rajapushpa Properties, said: “We already have a four-acre land parcel next to the 1.67 acres that we bought in Golden Mile project. We had to buy that piece of land so that we could get a wide road around it for our new project.” The firm bought another plot in Necropolis Layout. Prestige Group Hyderabad senior vice-president (business operations) R Suresh Kumar said: “We are confident of this location as the HMDA has promised to develop infrastructure. It also abuts the Gandipet lake which adds value to it. Our project here will be one of the best.” In 2006, the HMDA had raked in Rs 1,680 crore from land auctions at Kokapet Golden Mile project.

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh govt plans to move Supreme Court over 27% OBC quota||BHOPAL: The state government is mulling to approach the Supreme Court against the decision of the Madhya Pradesh High Court for 27% OBC reservation. It is also planning to increase the annual income limit of OBCs creamy-layer to Rs12 lakh from the present Rs8 lakh. A meeting of senior OBC leaders, including ministers, MLAs and MPs convened at the chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s official residence on Wednesday decided to reach out to the public and give a befitting reply to Congress’s allegations that the BJP government failed to pursue the 27% OBC reservation in the high court. CM Chouhan is learnt to have instructed the legal experts to approach the Supreme Court in the matter, sources said. “The chief minister has clearly said that the state government will move the Supreme Court for 27% OBC reservation as MP has 51% OBC population and it is necessary to give reservation to the community members in that proportion,” said a BJP’s OBC front state functionary. The ruling party’s OBC front has also decided to launch campaigns to counter opposition Congress and make people aware of the steps taken by the state government in the matter. “Congress is trying to divert public attention through its fake propaganda against BJP on its failure to pursue the OBC reservation case in the court. Congress had never made sincere efforts for the reservation and misguided the OBC voters. BJP will expose Congress on this front and inform the public about the steps taken by the Chouhan government,” BJP state president V D Sharma told TOI. BJP’s OBC front president Bhagat Singh Kushwaha said that all MLAs, MPs and members of the front have agreed to take a proactive step and discussed keeping the reservation limit for OBC category at 14% in government recruitments. He said that the government would follow legal procedures to pursue the case. Kushwaha also alleged that the previous Congress government had increased the OBC reservation from 14% to 27% in view of the Lok Sabha elections and when the decision was challenged in the high court, the government failed to provide proper support. The high court in a significant decision on Tuesday ordered the continuation of its interim stay to release the list of candidates selected through various exams with 14% OBC reservation and keep 13% seats vacant till the final order is issued in the case. According to the 2011 Census, OBCs constitute 50.09% of the total 7.26 crore (now 8.25 crore) population of MP. As many as 36 districts have over 50% OBC population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/state-govt-plans-to-move-sc-over-27-obc-quota/articleshow/84453373.cms||Rajendra Sharma

It was found in 87% of samples sequenced in May as well. Delta (B 1617.2), which was first isolated in Vidarbha and has driven the second wave, continues to be the dominant lineage in the country and one that is also rapidly rising globally.A state official said they are awaiting reports for another 2,200 samples. Maharashtra has tied up with the CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), New Delhi, to carry out sequencing of 3,600 samples in a month. The Covid-19 Genome Surveillance portal maintained by the CSIR-IGIB shows that around 7,900 samples have been sequenced from Maharashtra in 2021.Districts where the first Delta Plus cases were reported corroborated that they have not been flooded with cases or cluster infections as they had feared. Of the 21 cases of Delta Plus in the state, Ratnagiri reported the highest (9), followed by Jalgaon (7), Mumbai (2), and one each in Palghar, Sindhudurg and Thane. An 80-year-old woman from Ratnagiri, who was infected with the Delta Plus strain, succumbed.In Ratnagiri, where all Delta Plus cases were found from six villages in one taluka, Sangameshwar, officials said they have not been alerted of any new cases. While the district continues to report 300-400 cases every day at present, they are from other areas such as Chiplun, Ratnagiri city and some villages.Jalgaon officials said Vichkheda village that reported all the seven Delta Plus cases is not seeing even cases of fever or influenza-like illnesses now. After the Delta Plus cases were found, the authorities had carried out a fresh round of tests in the villages, where two positive cases were found. Dr D S Potode, assistant district health officer, said those samples were sent for genome sequencing, but they haven’t got an update. The entire district of Jalgaon is reporting less than a dozen Covid cases daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-88-of-states-june-samples-tested-ve-for-delta-variant/articleshow/84455856.cms||Sumitra Debroy

He also asked for court hearings on a daily basis similar to the Nirbhaya case so that the guilty can be sentenced within three months. “I feel that like the Nirbhaya rape and murder case, there should be daily hearing in this case too, so that a judgment can come within the time limit of three months,” Digvijaya wrote. “I appeal to you that this highly condemnable incident connected to the state’s 3 crore Dalit, tribal and weaker sections be handed over to the CBI or SIT for a thorough investigation,” Digvijaya wrote.

The portal will be closed on July 22 and the schools have been asked to follow the schedule strictly as the board has to declare the results by July 31. The schools have also been instructed to ensure there is no bunching of total marks in the range of 95 and above. “To aid the schools, CBSE has provided marks, including distribution of the marks, based on the best performance of the previous three years, which will be taken as reference for the purpose of moderation. Schools are directed to follow the reference distribution while moderating mass. Also, to ensure comparability and fairness at the higher range of marks, schools should exercise due diligence and ensure that there is no bunching of total marks in the range of 95 and above,” said the circular sent to the school heads. “They will, therefore, have to restrict the number of students at each level of overall marks from 95 and above, to ensure that this number is not more than the number of students scoring those overall marks, as per the best historic performance of the last three years,” it stated. The board has also developed a software that will aid schools in following the moderation policy. “It is informed that the changes made by the schools in data will be recorded by CBSE. If it is observed that the policy has not been followed in letter and spirit by schools, CBSE may initiate action against such schools as stipulated in the policy,” the board further stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cbse-tells-schools-to-avoid-bunching-of-xii-marks-in-range-of-95-or-above/articleshow/84455739.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Given enough vaccine, NMC can complete dose-1 of 18+ in 30 days, 45+ in 20 days||NAGPUR: As per the city's current vaccination capabilities, it would need 30 days to complete at least the first dose of the remaining beneficiaries of the 18-44 years age group, and 20 days for the 45-59 years age group. However, the ongoing trend of repeated breaks — sometimes for three days at a stretch — may stretch the duration of first dose drive to longer than two or three months. The mandatory gap of 84 days for Covishield — which is given at most centres — will further prolong the second dose. Resultantly, it may take at least six more months for the entire 18+ population of the city to get vaccinated. According to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), the 18-44 group beneficiaries are estimated to be around 11.50 lakh and 45-59 group around 8.62 lakh, as per the previous census. The numbers are lower for Nagpur rural, which may require nearly the same duration for its target groups. These are the two important age groups that have the potential to spread Covid-19 rapidly. During the second wave, the two groups’ population was also at the receiving end of the virus. Hence, an urgency can be seen from the daily record vaccination figures in the city, as well as rural parts of the district. Around 2.20 lakh beneficiaries from the 18+ and 1.8 lakh from the 45+ group, respectively have completed their first doses. The first dose of senior citizens, healthcare workers and frontline workers is nearly complete with close to 3 lakh inoculations. The city has been vaccinating around 30,000-45,000 beneficiaries on days when it has sufficient doses. Around 9 lakh beneficiaries from the 18+ and six lakh from the 45+ group, respectively are yet to get their first doses. In the last one month, most of the daily stock has been utilized among the 18-44 and 45+ groups, which were the last to join the drive. NMC has also started using as many doses as possible in a day, without holding back any stock. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said 17 lakh citizens are eligible beneficiaries under all age groups as of now. “The target is to vaccinate 60 percent of the city’s population above 18 years of age. This comes to around 17 lakh. More than 10.81 lakh inoculations have been done so far, through which the first dose of 7.5 lakh citizens has been completed, while over 3 lakh beneficiaries have taken the second dose. The achievement is around 45%,” Joshi said. He added that nearly 90% of healthcare and frontline workers and elderly citizens have been covered. “If 30,000 doses are given every day, we will be able to give first doses to the targeted population in a month’s time. However, since the supply is not regular, we are forced to run the drive for around 10-15 days only,” he said. The civic body has also not received any assurance of restoring adequate and regular supply of doses from the government. The Nagpur divisoin received 1.92lakh doses of Covishield for its six districts. Nagpur district received highest allocation of 1.07lakh doses of which the civic body got 64000 doses. The NMC will utilize these doses over the next two days. In a press note, the cvic body informed that all the over 140 centre will resume vaccination of first and second doses of all eligible beneficiareis on Friday. Covaxin too would be given at five centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/given-enough-vax-nmc-can-complete-dose-1-of-18-in-30-days-45-in-20-days/articleshow/84453385.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Ahmedabad||Whale sharks off Gujarat not a separate sub-population, finds study||AHMEDABAD: Confirming the view held by many researchers and marine experts that the whale sharks found off the coast of Gujarat are part of a larger population found in the Arabian Sea, a latest research paper on movement patterns of the world’s largest fish says they are unlikely to form a separate sub-population. The study titled ‘First Insights Into the Horizontal Movements of Whale Sharks (Rhincodon typus) in the Northern Arabian Sea’ shows that unlike earlier assumptions that whale sharks were coming to the Gujarat coast from Australia and other regions, these whale sharks have largely been found to be moving within the Arabian Sea. Earlier studies including a 2016 IUCN report and a genetic report titled ‘Phylogeography and population genetic structure of whale shark’ carried out by Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) pointed out that the whale sharks found along the Indian coast, including the coast of Gujarat, have no connection to those found in the Atlantic. The latest paper, published on July 6 in a leading international journal ‘Frontiers In Marine Science’, studies data from eight whale sharks that were tagged between 2011 and 2017 and monitored using satellite telemetry. The satellite tagging project is one of the longest conservation projects in the country carried out jointly by Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), the Gujarat forest department and Tata Chemicals Ltd.“Gujarat has set a fine example on how government, corporates and communities can work together to save these gentle giants. This conservation model should be replicated in other coastal states so whale sharks can enjoy the same freedom all along the Indian coast,” said B C Choudhury, executive trustee and chief advisor for Aquatic Projects of the WTI. He led the Indian team of researchers on the study. Veraval in Gujarat is one of the largest aggregation sites in India where tagging was carried out. The tracking study has been conducted in collaboration with the Australian Institute for Marine Science (AIMS) and included nine researchers from Indian and Australian institutes. The findings of the research paper state that whale sharks travel long distances following sea surface temperatures (SST) and boundaries between water masses and cold-water currents. Of the eight tagged whale sharks, one provided the longest track, travelling 2,229km over 137 days.  The nomadic nature justifies these consistent long-distance migrations with the notion that whale sharks prefer to occupy water masses with a 24-29 degree celsius temperature range following frontal zones (frontal zones are boundaries between two water masses with different SSTs). One of the tracks of the sharks tagged (WS-7) showed the animal crossing two-thirds of the northern Arabian Sea and heading toward Oman before the tag got detached. Tagging of whale sharks in the Red Sea has shown some animals exiting the Gulf of Aden into the Arabian Sea, whereas tagging of sharks in the Persian Gulf has recorded sharks exiting the Gulf of Oman and travelling southward toward the Gulf of Aden. Furthermore, whale sharks have also been found along neighbouring coasts of the Persian Gulf, suggesting a wide distribution of these animals in this area. “Given these long-distance movements of sharks in the northern Arabian Sea and the lack of major oceanographic boundaries in this region, there is little evidence (for the moment) to suggest that the populations of whale sharks off the coast of India are likely to form a separate sub-population from those in other parts of the Arabian Sea. More tagging combined with high resolution genetic studies will be required to resolve this issue,” the study states. The migratory behaviour of whale sharks, in combination with their slow growth rates, make populations highly vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures, such as ship strikes, bycatch, targeted fishing and pollution. The tagging resulted in tracks of different durations, with most lasting more than 40 days, however, one tag remained successfully attached to a whale shark for 137 days allowing a more detailed examination of the oceanographic context of their movement patterns in this region. The path of this longer track was consistent with suggestions that whale sharks tend to occupy water masses with temperatures in the range of 24–29°C and are associated with frontal zones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/whale-sharks-off-gujarat-not-a-separate-sub-population-finds-study/articleshow/84455820.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The civic body will spend Rs1.28 crore for the purpose, which will be used from the State Disaster Response Fund. Executive engineer (project), public works department of the NMC, has submitted a proposal to this effect before the general body meeting convened by mayor Dayashankar Tiwari on July 22. Due to coronavirus-induced restrictions, this general body meeting too will be held online. The NMC has already taken over the university’s new administrative building for the purpose. It will set up a 30-bed ICU, 20-bed NICU and 150 oxygen points. Looking at the exigency in view of the projected third wave, the project department has stated that municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B has already given administrative approval and urged the general body to give nod to the proposal. Discussions on many other proposals will be held during the general body meeting. Estate department has submitted a proposal seeking empowering the municipal commissioner to set terms and conditions while allotting 33 places to kiosks for Mother Dairy products. The NMC will provide land for the kiosks on a 30-year lease at Re1 per annum. As per the proposal, only Mother Dairy products will be allowed to be sold at the designated places across the city. The allottees cannot transfer, sale or mortgage the kiosk to anybody. First preference for running the kiosks will be given to freedom fighters, physically challenged and women. The NMC’s agreement with Mother Dairy will be enforced until it is affiliated with the National Dairy Development Board. The day the company gets disassociated, the agreement will be deemed cancelled, the proposal stated. Estate department’s proposal on acquiring NIT land for constructing elevated storage reservoir in Wathoda area, property tax department’s decision on giving 10% rebate on property tax for the current financial year too will be discussed during the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-to-spend-rs1-28cr-on-covid-med-infra/articleshow/84453421.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Hyderabad clocked the highest rise of 150% in home sales in first half of 2021 among the top eight cities in the country with 11,974 units sold as compared to 4,782 units in H1 of 2020, said Knight Frank’s `India Real Estate January-June 2021’ report that was released on Thursday. Hyderabad was followed by Ahmedabad with a 67% rise in housing unit sales, Mumbai with 53% growth, Pune with 74% jump and Bengaluru with 22% increase in sales in the first half. Nationally, residential property sales grew only 67% in H1 2021. In Q2 of 2021, sales of homes soared 420% in Hyderabad as compared to the same period of last year with the highest number of housing units at 5,065 being sold in the city in the midst of the second wave. With this, Hyderabad stole a march over Mumbai, Bengaluru and Delhi NCR. According to Knight Frank, demand grew across all ticket sizes in the city in the first half with the Rs 25-50 lakh category recording a 240% increase and the Rs 1-2 crore bracket showing a 158% rise as compared to H1 of 2020. West Hyderabad localities such as Kukatpally, Madhapur, Kondapur, Gachibowli, Raidurgam and Kokapet continued to account for the largest share in residential property sales and launches with a 63% and 64% share, respectively in H1 2021. Average residential prices in Hyderabad also increased marginally by 1% year-onyear in H1 2021 to Rs 50,803/sq m (Rs 4,720/sq ft) driven by the strong demand momentum. According to Knight Frank India’s Hyderabad branch director Samson Arthur, the Hyderabad housing market responded strongly on all parametres across micro markets with demand and supply increasing significantly despite the second wave. “While IT firms, a key anchor, continued to grow in their core business, Hyderabad continued to be a promising residential destination for end users and investors alike,” he said. “A unique proposition for the city’s attractive index continued to be the government's thrust on improving the city's infrastructure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-pips-all-metros-clocks-highest-growth-in-hsg-sales/articleshow/84458367.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

The case positivity rate dropped to 3% on Thursday as against 4% on Wednesday. The toll rose to 3,103 with one death. A 90-year-old man from Ponda died at South Goa district hospital after two days of treatment. While Goa’s weekly case positivity rate has been below 5%, state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar said people need to be more careful as curfew conditions are relaxed. The weekly case positivity is 3.64% as against 4.17% a week before. While there has been a plus and minus in daily infections, Betodakar said they haven’t noticed any big rise in any area, and if there is, the government will be immediately notified. “Our fervent request to people who are yet to get vaccinated is please do at the earliest. People should continue to take measures as restrictions are slowly being lifted,” Betodakar said. South Goa has more active cases with Margao, Ponda and Cortalim having high caseloads. The estimated third wave is likely to hit in August-September. Experts say the state will have a buffer if a large section of the population is vaccinated, provided no new variant deadlier than Delta makes its way. The state government has set a target to vaccinate the 11.5 lakh adult population with the first dose by the end of this month. As of Wednesday, 7.48 lakh people were partially vaccinated and 1.89 lakh with both doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/positivity-rate-drops-to-3-but-doctors-call-for-caution/articleshow/84458430.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: 82 more dengue cases found, over 1,500 homes bred larvae||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) malaria and filaria department has confirmed 82 more dengue cases in the city from July 1 to 13. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B on Thursday instructed all zones to survey at least 500 homes in the vicinity of each dengue patient during a special meeting. The civic chief also asked all additional municipal commissioners and assistant municipal commissioners to review preventive measures on a daily basis. The worried civic body has already surveyed 1.43 lakh places and found mosquito breeding at 85,428 spots in June. All the 10 zones had also surveyed 66,903 homes in the same month. Of these, 1,571 were found to be breeding dengue larvae in coolers, water containers, flower pots, plastic and discarded items. In June, the department had confirmed 98 cases from 149 suspected serum samples from across the city. Spurt in dengue cases has started since May when 20 cases were detected. Two children and a middle-aged woman died in June which remain the only two suspected dengue fatalities of the year so far. Just over 100 positive dengue cases were reported in entire 2020. Relieved by the drastic fall in Covid cases, the NMC brass is now worried over the spike in dengue cases. During the meeting, Radhakrishnan said the dengue larvae breeds in fresh water and therefore, civic teams must educate people about this. It must be ensured that no water contamination takes place in flower pots, cooler tanks, tyres, and all such potential spots. He urged citizens to observe dry day once a week and take care of kids. He also said that a list of high-risk places must be prepared so that fever clinics can be started in those areas. The NMC will collect serum samples from such places. Additional commissioner Ram Joshi said the zones must start more Gappi fish centres to prevent the spread of dengue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/82-more-dengue-cases-found-over-1500-homes-bred-larvae/articleshow/84453492.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Kolkata||Realty sales may soar after stamp duty cut||Kolkata: The 2% concession on stamp duty on homes for a three-month period up to October 30 announced in the state Budget last week and vaccination coverage to a sizeable section of the population will help Kolkata record a high growth in sales of residential real estate even if the third wave arrives, realtors and developers said on Thursday. Pointing to 80% sales surge in Mumbai and 54% sales growth in Pune after Maharashtra slashed the stamp duty to just 2%, against 32% sales hike recorded in Bengaluru after the Karnataka government announced stamp duty cut for only homes priced below Rs 45 lakh, consultants and developers have projected a growth of around 40% following the 2% stamp duty cut in Bengal that is applicable to all homes, irrespective of price. According to a report on residential real estate released by Knight Frank India (KFI), in January-June 20201, sales of 5,115 units were recorded, a 74% increase against the corresponding period last year when the country had gone into lockdown between April and June. Also, share of home under Rs 50 lakh in the sales pie has dipped from 69% to 63%, indicating a preference for larger size homes following the pandemic in which many continue to work from home. While the pie of homes in the Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore bracket remain unchanged at 24%, the share of homes priced over Rs 1 crore has increased from 7% to 13%. Projects in south Kolkata, north Kolkata and Rajarhat have performed exceptionally well. While the growth in the Narendrapur, Behala and Garia is 66% with sales of 1,876 units; that in Jessore Road, VIP Road and Ultadanga in north Kolkata is 71% with sales of 1,299 units. In Rajarhat, 957 units were sold, a rise of 136% while in Kankurgachhi, EM Bypass and Beliaghata, 322 units were sold, an increase of 118%. Only central Kolkata saw sales decline 8% at just 54 units. The high sales has reduced inventory by 18% from 30,858 units at the end of June 2020 to 25,240 units at the end of June 2021. Project launches also jumped 156% from 858 units in the first half of last year to 2,195 units in the first half this year. While doctors have warned of a third wave that could be even more deadly than the second, the industry is confident of tiding over the challenge. “In the first wave, there was the fear of the unknown. Though there have been more deaths in the second wave, the fear has been replaced by a quiet confidence that we can fight back. Now, armed with vaccines and improved health infrastructure, the economy should continue to do well,” said Credai Bengal president Nandu Belani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/realty-sales-may-soar-after-stamp-duty-cut/articleshow/84453526.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Nagpur||Vaccines may come to your home soon, but ensure it’s not fake||NAGPUR: Fake vaccination camps in Kolkata and Mumbai have proven that people could go to any level when it comes to minting money. Vaccines are likely to be available soon in fully private setups and in the form of camps in housing societies as well as localities in Nagpur too. In such conditions, it becomes important to take precautions and protect ourselves from a vaccination scam. As officials are more alert now, and the administration is implementing all measures to avoid any such scam in Nagpur, experts have shared some simple and valuable tips to ensure that you get only genuine vaccine. “As a healthcare professional, it is our utmost responsibility to notify people about the precautions they must take to protect themselves from getting into a vaccination scam,” said Dr Niranjan Patil, head & biosafety officer, Metropolis Healthcare Ltd. “As we all know that vaccines are providing people with the much-needed mental health boost after seeing a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases all over India, now the world is witnessing the dark side of it in the form of vaccination fraud or fake Vaccination,” he added. While Nagpur or other places in Vidarbha are still away from any such fraud, it’s very much possible for the fraudsters to target tier-II and III cities as and when vaccination forays more into public domain. By August, housing societies and workplaces in smaller towns will start holding vaccination camps after a significant population will be covered under government vaccination drives. A senior microbiologist in Nagpur told TOI that people must ensure that the vial of vaccine is kept safely before getting jabbed. “Maximum shelf life of Covishield and Covaxin is 6 months if stored in a refrigerator between 2 to 8°C. Once removed from the fridge, it must be stored between 2 to 25°C for up 6 hours. Once punctured, the vial must be used within 4 hours. Most importantly, during storage, the vials must be kept in outer carton to protect from light,” said the doctor, adding that people should not accept the jab if vial is stored outside in the light for more period. Such complications may increase after vaccines will be made available in an out-of-hospital setup. So, it becomes the responsibility of people to double-check, said doctors. Ensure authentic jab Register through an authorized vaccination portal Verify whether hospital or centre is authorized to offer such a vaccination camp Verify identity of a person approaching your housing society or workplace for vaccination Avoid temptation to bypass the registration process Avoid anyone who says no documentation, or no queue required as frauds could take advantage of that In case of a paid vaccination, insist on payment receipt with proper details Receipt must include date, time, and venue of vaccination Identification of the authenticity of vaccine certificate is another must||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vaccines-may-come-to-your-home-soon-but-ensure-its-not-fake/articleshow/84453538.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The decision was taken in the cabinet on Thursday to offer scholarships to all the minority communities on the basis of their population in the 2011 census, in adherence to the high court order. As per this, the population of Christian and Muslim communities are 18.38% and 26.56%, respectively, while Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs are 0.01%, each. The scholarships will be divided without any community losing their fair share, the cabinet decided. The cabinet also decided to earmark Rs 6.2 crore extra in addition to the amount set aside in the budget for the scholarship, as Rs 23.51 crore is required for the minority scholarships this year. The government had on June 4, held an all-party meeting to take different views, in the wake of the high court order quashing the earlier ratio. The high court had cancelled a government order issued in 2015, under which 80% of the scholarships for the minority went to the Muslim community, while the rest 20% went to the Christian community including Latin Catholic Christians and converted Christians. The high court, while quashing the government order, had directed the state government to provide merit-cum-means scholarships to the members of the notified minority communities equally. New posts: The cabinet has decided to create 49 new posts in the ministerial section in the police for the smooth functioning of the Kannur city and Kannur rural police offices and the women’s battalion. Additionally, five posts of junior superintendent in the crime branch will be upgraded to that of senior superintendents. Assembly session: The cabinet decided to recommend the governor to convene the assembly session from July 22. The earlier decision was to convene the session from July 21. The date was revised due to Eid ul-Adha. Approval for guidelines: The cabinet approved the guidelines for locating and including the poorest of the poor who have been excluded from the “destitute-free Kerala” project under the local self-government bodies. The survey will be completed in four-and-half months. The government’s aim is to find such excluded poor, and formulate programmes to ensure income for them. Amendment in order: The cabinet decided to amend the order for releasing the share of salary that was held back due to Covid-19 from the salaries of the government officials and teachers. As per the new decision, the notification will be re-issued by excluding the clause that while releasing the salary share of those who are part of the national pension scheme, their share towards the national pension scheme need not be deducted from the released amount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cabinet-rejigs-minority-scholarship-ratio/articleshow/84455861.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Senior inspector Dagdu Hake told TOI on Thursday,“ We have recovered 23 smart phones, four laptops, a hard disc, five dongles,three pen drives, eight SIM cards, three debit cards, an identity card and other documents from their flat in Delhi.” They were identified as Jango Nicolas (29), Monday Okeke (26) and Paulinus Mbamgo (29) from Lagos in Nigeria. They will be brought to Pune on Friday. The cyber police on Thursday said the woman had transferred Rs 3.98 crore to 67 different accounts in 25 banks. The woman in her FIR had said that in April 202, she had received a friend request on a social media platform from the UK. After five months, the man told her that he had sent her an iPhone as a birthday gift. The user had made her pay large sums on the pretext of customs clearance for the gifts stuck at Delhi airport. The fraudsters posed as courier agency representatives, custom officials saying that they were holding jewellery and foreign currency in the consignments. After she realised that she had been duped, she lodged an FIR under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Information Technology Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/3-nigerians-dupe-woman-of-rs-3-98-crore-under-arrest/articleshow/84455824.cms||---

The university is yet to receive consent forms from students. MSU officials said that they had received the new directives and the new consent form format on Wednesday. These were sent to students on email and messaging applications. Most students are yet to submit these forms to the university. Officials said that once the students submit the forms, the university can decide on the schedule of classes. Depending on the number of students that want to come for offline classes, shifts or days have to be fixed to ensure that they study maintaining social distance. The offline classes also cannot clash with the timing of online classes. Registrar K M Chudasama said that clarity will emerge on this in the coming days. Based on this, the deans of various faculties will take a call on holding classes. He added that some classes were held on Thursday, but these were mostly of masters programmes. In Rajkot, despite the nod from the state government, colleges did not begin education on Thursday due to ongoing exam for undergraduate and postgraduate courses at Saurashtra University. The offline classes will now start next month. Also, several private colleges have decided to start college from Monday.

The action was initiated after the video of the event went viral. Zonal DCP Maheshwar Reddy and other senior officers saw the 15-second video of the cop, Mahendra Nerlekar, feeding a piece of the cake to the history-sheeter, Danish Sheikh. TimesViewWhen a cop openly rubs shoulders with a criminal, it must be treated as a case of serious misdemeanour. It is improbable that the senior inspector did not know this history-sheeter who already has criminal cases filed against him by the same police station. It is good that the police department has moved swiftly to transfer him and initiate an inquiry.Former BJP MP Kirit Somaiya, too, tweeted the video on Thursday. Following his transfer, Mumbai police spokesperson DCP S Chaitanya said a departmental inquiry has been initiated against Nerlekar. Sakinaka division assistant commissioner of police, Mukund Pawar, will conduct the probe. Shaikh had thrown a birthday party at his housing society in Jogeshwari (East) two weeks ago. TOI repeatedly tried to contact Nerlekar but in vain. Earlier, he had told mediapersons that it was old video. “I had gone to that housing society to see some demolition work when some senior citizens there insisted that I visit the society office. I was not aware that Danish was also present there with a cake,” he had said. Shaikh has been booked in multiple criminal offences in the past, including an attempt-to-murder charge, and was arrested in 2018 by Jogeshwari police. “Nerlekar attended the birthday cake-cutting event in uniform and both he and Shaikh were captured feeding the cake to each other in the housing society’s office,” said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cop-shunted-after-viral-video-of-feeding-cake-to-criminal/articleshow/84455907.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

However, unlike the past years, this result may not hold “too much importance” as admissions to junior colleges will be based on common entrance test (CET) to be held at July-end or first week of August. The state had cancelled the Std X examination due to Covid-19 pandemic and formulated a method using Std IX final exam marks and Std X internal exam marks, along with practical scores, to calculate the final marks for Std X. “All the 16.58 lakh students who have enrolled for the SSC exams can access their results at http://result.mh-ssc.ac.in/ or at https://mahahsscboard.in/ . I thank all schools and teachers for going beyond the call of their duty to ensure that the results are finalised in a short span of time,” school education minister Varsha Gaikwad stated in a tweet. “All the secondary schools were given the names and seating numbers of all the students through their login ID and user password. Accordingly, all the students concerned have been informed about their seating numbers. However, if some students are not yet aware of this information, it has been made available on the state board’s website www.mahahsscboard.in,” said a notification issued by Ashok Bhosale, secretary, state board. Another notification by the state board said, “As per the Government Resolution dated May 28, 2021, the result of the students registered under the grade improvement scheme for the year 2021 has not been prepared. This exam will not be counted among the two opportunities available for these students. Therefore, the next one or two opportunities will be available to these students, as applicable.” Medha Sinnarkar, principal of the Laxmanrao Apte Prashala, said, “While there is a surety that everyone who has registered will pass Class X, there is no way to predict how the results will be. We can expect huge fluctuations. The parents are anxious about the CET. They keep asking how important it is, what it will be like, among others. There is obviously much talk about it among students who want admission in top colleges. The inhouse quota students are also anxious about whether they will be able to make the cut without appearing for the entrance examination.” Veena Meshram, principal of another city school, said the cancellation of the examination, the evaluation pattern and confusion surrounding it had been hard for students. “Most of them work hard and score well in Std X, which could not be done this time. Then there is confusion about the FYJC CET. These students have not attempted such an exam till now. Hence, I think the board should come out with model papers so that the students know and are well prepared for the CET as and when it happens,” said Meshram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ssc-result-to-be-out-at-1pm-today-all-eyes-on-fyjc-cet/articleshow/84455872.cms||---

While prices of five radiological and 15 pathological tests were capped by the state government on July 7, it was later announced that only those paying their bills by cash would be eligible for the concession and not those who have an insurance cover. But the latter would be allowed a proportionate discount on the tests on the amount that their insurance company refuses to pay and they are forced to pay from their pockets, it was said. The Association of Hospitals of Eastern India (AHEI) has written a letter to the health department seeking a clarification on the discount to insurance patients and has so far refused to allow it though it is supposed to have come into immediate effect. AHEI or private hospitals are yet to receive a circular on the announcement either. “As a result, even cash patients are not getting the benefit. So far as insurance patients are concerned, the issue of discount has been kept ambiguous. The government has just mentioned that a discount on tests is to be allowed on the amount which doesn’t qualify within the permissible limits of the insurance policy, forcing the patient party to pay from the pockets. But unless we have clarity on the percentage of discount and its basis, we can’t go ahead,” said AMRI Hospitals CEO Rupak Barua. Hospitals pointed out that investigations and medicines were their major profit centres since it was difficult to have margins on other counts. “We must run our investigation units round-the-clock. So, we often end up doing a single test at a cost we could have done 10 such tests. That apart, we have to appoint technicians and employees for three shifts. Unless the charge takes these into account, investigations can’t happen,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. He added that 80% of private hospital patients were covered either by a corporate scheme or insurance. “With each corporate and insurer, we already have a discounted rate for investigations which can’t be altered during our contract period. So, insurance patients already enjoy a discount. It’s the cash patients who need the benefit,” said Mitra. Another hospital chief said they were under financial pressure due to Covid-induced expenses and Swasthya Sathi patients. “We have dedicated a ward to Swasthya Sathi and it has eaten into our profits. A further discount will not be feasible,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pvt-hosps-against-discount-for-insured-patients/articleshow/84453550.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

However, sales and launches of residential properties in the city grew significantly in the first half (January-June) of the calendar year, states the latest report by real estate consultant Knight Frank India.  Around 1,163 residential units were sold in Ahmedabad in the second quarter, a sequential drop of 62% from 3,045 units in the first quarter of 2021. Similarly, launches fell by 43% to 2,249 units in Q2 against 3,977 in Q1, according to the report released on Thursday. Home sales and launches saw a resurgence in the third and fourth quarters of last year and momentum was carried into the first quarter of the current year. “The momentum was curtailed in the second quarter due to the second wave of the pandemic,” the report added. Despite the slump in April-June, housing sales in the first six months of the current year climbed by 67% to 4,208 units from 2,520 units in same period last year. With respect to home launches, the city saw a 137% rise to 6,226 units compared to 2,627 units in H1 2020. The growth was largely on account of the low base in the corresponding period last year, especially the second quarter of 2020 when sales and launches were washed out due to the lockdown. “The dampening of sales by the second wave of Covid-19 has not affected the upward momentum in sales activity in H1 2021. The mass exodus of labour seen during the first wave did not repeat this year as developers committed to arranging on-site accommodation, ensuring continuation of development activities, albeit in a limited capacity,” said Balbir Singh Khalsa, branch director for Ahmedabad of Knight Frank India. Compared to the second quarter of the last year, sales and launches in Q2 2021 showed increases of 362% and 328%, respectively, as only 252 units were sold and 525 units were launched in Q2 of 2020. According to Knight Frank, the decline in home prices was arrested in H1 2021 as homebuyer interest remained strong. The increase in the cost of steel, cement and labour raised construction costs by an estimated 8% to 12% over the past year. Developers who tried to pass on this inflation to homebuyers had more success in the premium segment and to some extent in apartments costing under Rs 25 lakh, where margins are already very thin. The unsold inventory of residential units, the report said, increased by 28% to 12,151 units in Jan-June 2021 from 9,744 units in the same period last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/second-covid-wave-erodes-q2-home-sales-launches-in-city/articleshow/84455865.cms||---

Sambhajiraje warned the government that silent sit-in protests would be resumed across the state. On June 16, Sambhajiraje had led a protest in Kolhapur and was called by Thackeray for talks the next day. Demands were made to provide relief to the community as it had lost the reservation granted by the state government following a Supreme Court order. The demands were related to scholarships for students, benefits at par with those received by OBC students, making funds available for the Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Research Training and Human Development Institute (SARTHI) and increasing the limit of non-collateral loans for Maratha youths to start a business. Later, a meeting was held with Dy CM Ajit Pawar, who approved the demand to set up a sub-centre of SARTHI in Kolhapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sambhajiraje-reminds-cm-maratha-stir-can-resume/articleshow/84458405.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Vaccination likely to be among criteria for providing relaxations, says Rajesh Tope||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government is likely to consider vaccination as one of the criteria for providing relaxations from Covid-19 curbs, apart from other parameters like positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy. State health minister Rajesh Tope said that fully vaccinated people who are following Covid-appropriate behaviour are less likely to be infected and transmit the infection. “There is a demand from fully vaccinated shopkeepers, traders and even individuals to relax restrictions for them, but rather than giving relaxations to individuals, a district-wise decision could be considered,” Tope said. He also said that the task force will make recommendations based on vaccinated population at the district levels, along with other Covid-19 indicators, and the state will “positively consider” the recommendations. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi will have a video conferencing meet with the state on Friday, in which there will be experts from ICMR and virologists, and we will seek suggestions from them as well,” Tope said. Senior officials said that there is pressure on the state to lift restrictions, and it is likely that the state government may consider bringing districts to Level 2, which allows for fewer restrictions. Currently, the state is at a minimal Level 3 and above. The state is also considering extending shop timings and timings of restaurants for dine-in. A decision is likely in the next few days. Officials said it will be a while before local trains are opened for the general public again. However, if the level of restrictions is lowered, some more categories of people may be allowed on local trains. “Mumbai local trains are the lifeline of the city, and we are also hoping normalcy is achieved soon. But to start local trains for all, BMC’s suggestions, along with those of the task force, will also be considered,” Tope said. He said that though daily detections in the state have plateaued at 7,000-9,000 cases for a month, the state is not happy with the plateau and wants numbers to dip further. “Despite the drop in cases, we are not reducing the number of tests. When considering positive cases per million of population, Maharashtra stands at the 10th spot. Kerala and many north-eastern states are above,” Tope said. In the meeting with the PM, the state will also be raising the issue of inadequate vaccines. It has sent a proposal to the Centre to hike vaccine stocks allocation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vax-likely-to-be-among-criteria-for-providing-relaxations-says-tope/articleshow/84455905.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Kolkata||Kolkata police: Fourth JMB arrest leads cops to hundi racket||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Police STF on Thursday arrested yet another conduit — the fourth one so far — of the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) for allegedly facilitating the movement of the main JMB extremists across the India-Bangladesh border. The arrest also laid bare the hundi network that financed JMB in India and Bangladesh. The accused has been identified as Lalu Sen alias Rahul Sen alias Rahul Kumar (38). STF picked him from Barasat, taking the total number of arrested people in this module to four. At least four others — including local organizer Selim Munshi — continued to be on police radar. Lalu SenAccording to police, the arrest of Lalu shows how terror organizations still believe in the century-old hundi system in an attempt not to leave behind any digital footprint. “Lalu is an important member of the JMB module and was close to its head, Naziur Rehman Pavel alias Jayram Byapari. Lalu facilitated the movement of JMB activists in Bengal and provided logistical and financial support to them, especially Pavel. He also provided monetary support to the organisation through the hundi channel,” said joint CP (STF) V Solomon Nesakumar. Two Laptops, one i-Pad, two mobile phones and some incriminating documents have been found from Lalu’s possession. “His involvement in the preparation of fake Indian documents like EPIC, PAN card, Aadhaar card and providing them to JMB members cannot be ruled out,” said Nesakumar. Police sources said JMB’s jailed leader Al-Amin, now in Kashimpur jail, controlled the Hundi network.  JMB usually follows the Sahyog hundi that is drawn by one merchant on another, asking the latter to pay the amount to a third merchant. In this case, the merchant on whom the hundi is drawn is of some ‘credit worthiness’ in the market and is known in the bazaar. A Sahyog hundi passes from one hand to another till it reaches the final recipient, who, after reasonable enquiries, presents it to the drawee for acceptance of the payment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fourth-jmb-arrest-leads-cops-to-hundi-racket/articleshow/84453566.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The incessant rains reminded Hyderabadis of the floods of October last year in which at least 18 people had died. Although no deaths have been reported so far, many areas in LB Nagar division such as Uppal, Saroornagar, Hayathnagar, Hasthinapuram, Ramanthapur, Meerpet among others saw streets turning into rivers and storm water gushing into homes. As holding capacity of the water bodies and its channels has reduced, neither the lakes nor the storm water drains were able to hold the water discharged into them. The flooding was triggered by Hyderabad witnessing its third rainiest day in July with 69 mm rain in the last 24 hours. ‘Intensity of rains to subside over weekend’According to the Telangana State Development Planning Society figures up to 8.30 am on Thursday, 25 areas in the city recorded 100 to 200 mm of rainfall with Bandlaguda witnessing the highest rainfall of 212.5 mm. While the downpour was caused by an upper air cyclonic circulation over Bay of Bengal, meteorologists predict that the intensity of rains is likely to subside during the weekend. Among the worst affected were residents living in the surrounding areas of Saroornagar lake. Just like last year, rainwater entered Kodandaram Nagar, P&T Colony and Vivekananda Nagar and neighbouring colonies. “Our lanes are flooded as the lake breached its full tank limit. In the last one year, nothing has changed on the ground. July is just the beginning of the monsoon. If this is the situation now imagine what will happen when peak monsoon sets in,” said Sai Charan Mamidishetty, a resident of Kodandaram Nagar. In Uppal, the situation was much the same. Residents were seen struggling in knee-deep water after the area was pounded with more than 170 mm of rainfall. Six disaster response teams were deployed on Wednesday night to clear the inundation. The Rachakonda police rescued 30 people, including women and children, from water-logged Mallikarjuna Nagar and shifted them to Nagole community hall. For residents of Osman Nagar and Al Jubail Colony in Old City, who are yet to overcome the 2020 flood impact, the Wednesday’s rainfall only added to their misery. “People are wading through knee-deep water with little help from anyone. Snakes are creeping out of the inundated houses, making it dangerous for people to stay in their houses,” said Habib Abdul Khader, resident of Chandrayangutta who came out to help those stuck in Babanagari, Al-Jubail, Ghazi Millat and surrounding areas.

This is the first time anywhere in eastern India that a student has got the “perfect score”. A multi-talented 18-year-old, Majumdar will be leaving the country soon to pursue an undergraduate programme in international relations in the Netherlands. Majumdar had initially taken up science in the ISC stream for Plus-II, but, after attending classes for three months, realised that pure science was not for her. “I wanted to study social sciences and languages alongside science and maths, and that was possible only in the IB Board. So I switched over. I was lucky that my school runs two boards simultaneously,” she said. Majumdar has been learning German for five years and has won scholarships from Goethe Institut to visit Gernany. “It was then that I realised that I needed to be in a stream of studies that would lead me to Europe,” she said. The student has got admission to the Leiden University in Netherlands for a three-year UG programme in international relations and organisations, and her campus is next to the International Court of Justice at the Hague. “It is so exciting to think that I will be able to witness events unfold live in front of me rather than just read about them. I will be at the heart of global politics,” she said. Majumdar had six subjects in her IB Plus-II programme that were divided into three majors and three standard subjects. “I am happy that I could study maths and chemistry along with languages and social science subjects. This has broadened my vista,” she said. Proud of her achievements, principal of the school Seema Sapru said, “We had expected Majumdar to do well, but she has surpassed our expectations. She is multi-talented; a trained vocalist, an adept public speaker, and a brilliant student. She is among the top 1% IB students this year to get the perfect score.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-girl-in-global-1-with-perfect-intl-board-score/articleshow/84453583.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Mumbai||On Day 1, only 10 pregnant women in Mumbai take vaccine||MUMBAI: The first day of vaccination for pregnant women in Mumbai saw a tepid response. Merely 10 expecting mothers came out to take the vaccine on Thursday, underlining the need for greater awareness about the risks and benefits of vaccination. State authorities, meanwhile, said they have received 9 lakh vaccine doses which should sustain the drive for 2-3 days. Public health minister Rajesh Tope again demanded 3 crore doses for the state every month.  Free vaccination for pregnant women is being offered at 36 designated centres in the city, including medical colleges, peripheral hospitals and maternity homes, that routinely offer antenatal services. Many of these centres got a lot of queries from pregnant women and their families, although few agreed to actually take the shot. An estimated 1.5 lakh pregnant women in the city are eligible for vaccination. Of the 10 who got vaccinated on Thursday, eight got vaccinated in public and two inprivate centres. In all, 18 pregnant women have got vaccinated in the last two days. Eight women took the vaccine at private centres on Wednesday.  Dr Vidya Thakur, medical superintendent of Rajawadi Hospital, Ghatkopar, said that only one woman took the vaccine at the centre. “Our antenatal staff will start counselling pregnant women when they come for regular follow-ups. With counselling and awareness, we believe the numbers will rise eventually,” she said. The hospital has created a separate queue for pregnant women and will also facilitate walk-ins, said Dr Thakur.  Many women dropped in to enquire about the vaccine but left without taking the shot at Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital in Kandivli, said its medical superintendent Dr Pratibha Patil. “We will start counselling those registered in our hospital for delivery,” she said. In 2015, when free influenza vaccination was introduced for pregnant women in Maharashtra, a similar hesitancy was seen initially but things improved as word spread, said Dr Lalit Sankhe, nodal officer of vaccination at JJ Hospital. “Mothers are naturally anxious for their unborn child, but those in second and third trimesters may be more willing,” he added. Civic officials said doctors and nurses from gynaecology departments have been trained to counsel pregnant women.  Over 66,421 people took the vaccine in the city on Thursday. Vaccination at the free centres would be carried out at regular hours on Friday starting from 9 am to 5 pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-on-day-1-only-10-pregnant-women-in-city-take-vaccine/articleshow/84456041.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The decision was taken at a meeting on Thursday by the MVA’s smaller parties, including Peasants and Workers Party (PWP), Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS), Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Vikas Aghadi (BVA). “Instead of the proposed amendments to the central government’s farm legislations, the state should have introduced separate Bills for the welfare of farmers to prove that the Acts are ‘ineffective’,” Raju Shetti of SSS said. He added that he recently met NCP chief Sharad Pawar, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and urged them to introduce separate farm bills in the state legislature. Hitendra Thakur, president of BVA, told TOI that besides the agriculture Bills, they also discussed issues like waiver of residential electricity bill and fees charged by private schools. “People have been badly hit by the pandemic; many have also lost their jobs. To help them, the state should waive off residential power bills and provide aid to unaided schools,” he said. On June 5, the MVA had introduced amendments to counter the Centre’s enacted farm laws—the Essential Commodities Act 1955, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020, and Farmers’ Produce, Trade, and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act 2020. three amendment draft Bills in the state legislature to counter the Centre’s enacted farm laws.

He was arrested by a police team led by Kondotty deputy SP K Ashraf from a hideout at Thamarassery on Thursday. Police said Shihab confessed that he had almost reached Karipur airport with the instructions of a quotation team in Thamarassery. The plan was derailed as Ayanki, the second accused in Karipur gold smuggling case, sped away by turning off the headlights of his car on his way back from Karipur airport to Kannur. Five persons, belonging to a 15-member gang from Cherpulassery, who also pursued Ayanki, had died after their car met with an accident. Meanwhile in Kochi, customs’ headquarters preventive unit, probing Karipur gold smuggling case, on Thursday questioned Amala, the wife of Ayanki, for the second time. Sources said the agency had received information which suggested that she was aware of Ayanki’s activities. Amala had earlier appeared before Customs on July 5. “She had said that she didn’t know Ayanki was involved in smuggling but we have found evidence, including journal entries, which suggest that she was aware of his activities,” said an official. Meanwhile, customs will question his friends, Reneesh and Pranav, who hail from Azhikode in Kannur, next week. Customs had issued a summons to Shuhaib murder case accused Akash Thillankery for questioning after it searched his house on Wednesday. The houses of Reneesh and Pranav were also searched. Meanwhile, sources said that the agency will file a report opposing the bail plea of Ayanki. Customs had submitted in court that the carrier, Shafeeque (A1), had deposed that Ayanki guided him in the smuggling operation and provided voice chats in support of the same. There are voice chats to prove that Ayanki is the main operator in this particular smuggling, customs had said.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/man-who-came-to-attack-ayanki-held/articleshow/84456115.cms||---

In the fresh round of contracts dished out by the city’s AMTS, around 150 ‘midi’ CNG buses will be incorporated where the bus will be owned by the contractor and the driver and conductor will be his or her employees. Contracts for six years are being signed by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC). Of the 600-odd buses operational on various routes, 220 buses are such where the conductors are AMTS employees. “There is emphasis on including contracted employees for these bus services as well. The present system is based on a penalty scheme. The 200-odd AMTS employees will be replaced in four years,” says a senior AMTS official. The official also added that following last year’s Gujarat Mazdoor Sabha protest and legal notice asking AMTS to immediately pay dues to 1,000-odd contract workers employed with the AMTS, there have been changes made to the contracts. “The AMTS now prefers paying a fixed operational cost every month for a minimum fixed number of passengers.

New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) officials attributed the problem to some issues in electricity panels due to heavy rain on Tuesday. They alleged that the situation got compounded by the damage to two major cable lines during road digging near the Janpath crossing. “There was a power cut for around 2.5 hours on Wednesday in areas under the north zone as the moisture occurred in the high-voltage power supplying panels making them non-operational. We immediately arranged for repair, but it took time, leading to the unusual outage in NDMC areas,” said the official Unlike other civic areas where the discoms supply power, in Lutyens’ Delhi, NDMC directly buys electricity from Transco and supplies it. “In NDMC areas, demand is more in day time when all offices and institutions are operating. Since there is no major grid station in the NDMC area, the excess power is diverted to Northern Railway,” said the official. Two major cable lines of 11kv and 33kv were damaged, claimed the official. “We have two sources of power, one regular and another a backup supply line. On Wednesday, both got affected due to two incidents occurring simultaneously,” the official claimed. The civic body claimed to have written to the private concessionaire to be more careful. “Though we have given a no-objection certificate to arrange for immediate repair, we have asked them to find out the route of underground lines before starting any digging work,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-rain-ndmc-areas-face-3-hour-power-cuts/articleshow/84456101.cms||Vibha Sharma

Members of the BDU employee welfare association have taken up the matter with higher education minister and the secretary seeking speedy steps for the conversion of such colleges, which have become a liability for universities across the state. The state government announced conversion of these colleges in the last two years, but universities continue to bear the expenditure over the delay from the state government in taking over these colleges. “A total Rs 1.20 crore is spent every month by BDU towards the salaries of 657 temporary staff, including 567 teaching staff. This has been hurting the finances of the university big time especially when the revenue of the university through its centre for distance education have come down significantly in recent years,” said K Govindaraj, president of the association said. “We were relieved after the state government announced conversion of the constituent colleges. Universities were asked to meet the expenditure for the academic year 2020-21 which ends in June 2021, but the government is silent over relieving the university from the financial burden,” he said. With mounting pressure from the guest faculty members to disburse the salaries, the university is being compelled to disburse them, said Govindaraj. Speaking to TOI, BDU vice-chancellor M Selvam said that they have taken up the matter with the state government. “We are expecting a positive response in a few days. The state government has assured to reimburse the expenditure for the last one year,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/bdu-urged-not-to-pay-salary-to-guest-lecturers-of-10-converted-colleges/articleshow/84456118.cms||---

---||World||Desis in the line of fire in South African riots||Thousands of businesses owned by members of the Indian community have been looted and destroyed and an unknown number of Indian-origin people are said to have been killed in the rioting that has hit Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal provinces of South Africa. The rioting began last Friday in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), two days after ex-president Jacob Zuma was jailed for contempt of court. Durban, where one million Indian-heritage South Africans live, has been witnessing widespread rioting with shops, businesses and warehouses looted and set alight. More than 50,000 businesses have been destroyed or impacted in Durban, where many retail and technology businesses, motor dealerships, medical centres, pharmacies and supermarkets are run by the Indian community. Zanele Khomo, chief growth officer at Durban Chamber of Commerce, said: “In Durban, we’ve had 16 billion rand (South African currency) worth of stolen stock and damage to malls and retailers. More than third of this would be Indian businesses. About 50,000 informal traders are out of business and 129,000 jobs are at risk...”. It was on Saturday when Indian-origin businessman Rohit (name changed), who runs a chain of retail technology businesses across KwaZulu-Natal, got phone calls about one of his stores having been targeted by looters. Later on Sunday and Monday, four other shops owned by him had been looted. He has suffered a loss of $2 million so far. “They invaded and looted in the thousands. The security could not stop them. People stole fridges and stoves, high-end TV sets and groceries. You could see blood all over the floor from where people were shot dead... It all happened in broad daylight and the police did nothing,” Rohit said. Phoenix, where more than 100,000 people of Indian descent live and where Mahatma Gandhi founded his ashram, has seen looting transcend into racial violence between Indians and blacks. Dozens of deaths have taken place in street fights as vigilantes of Indian descent have armed themselves to defend their homes and shops from looters. “Lots of Indians died in the line of fire protecting their homes and businesses” Rohit said. “Blacks were also killed. It’s terrible for community relations. The army is in KZN now and we hope things will stabilise quickly,” he said. "Rather than food shortages I am worried about the soul of this country. People are stunned," said an Indian-origin South African woman living in Durban. But she is hopeful. "We are all in this mess and navigating it as best we can. Communities across race groups are working together. There's a great deal of heart and community here despite how we have been separated by apartheid."

The order was issued by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Thursday and said fully vaccinated passengers seeking an exemption must have their final vaccination certificate issued through the Co-Win portal. Directives so far said any passenger arriving in the state by any mode of transport was required to carry a negative RT-PCR test conducted 48 hours prior to commencement of journey. Through the latest order, the state government extended the validity of an RT-PCR test for all other persons to 72 hours before commencement of journey. The order mentions that all passengers must follow Covid-appropriate behaviour like wearing a mask. Officials said that with the states opening up for business and tourism, it was not practical to stick to the requirement for an RT-PCR report for fully vaccinated people. “This will also indirectly act as a sop to encourage more people to get fully vaccinated,” said an official. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had written to the state two days ago seeking an exemption from an RT-PCR report for fully vaccinated domestic passengers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-rt-pcr-to-enter-state-if-person-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/84456203.cms||---

Two-wheeler riders are more susceptible to a fatal fall due to the uneven pattern of the speed breakers flouting the Indian Roads Congress (IRC) standards. As per the information retrieved by the road users’ welfare organisation through RTI, Trichy city has 495 speed breakers on corporation maintained roads. The corporation has control over 800 km-long roads within the city of which most of them lack speed breakers at proper spots to prevent accidents. The existing speed breakers have not been constructed as per the norms specified by IRC. The speed breakers are supposed to have rounded bump structures with 0.10 m in height and 3.7 m in width as per IRC to reduce the crossing speed of vehicles to 25 km per hour. But, the speed breakers in the city deviate from the specifications. “There was a fatal accident due to the faulty design of speed breaker on Wireless Road near Trichy airport,” P Aiyarappan, president, road users’ welfare organisation said. The activist also alleged that the civic body, particularly, Ponmalai zone misreports the speed breaker data. Residential-cum-commercial roads such as Convent Road, Babu Road and Heber Road have unscientific speed breakers. Road safety activists said that the corporation has not restored or repaired these speed breakers. Meanwhile, road markings over the bumps are also missing that leads to people noticing the speed breakers only when it is too late. “Fund crunch was the reason for not making road markings. We will standardize the speed breakers across the city,” a senior official with the corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/speed-breakers-violate-irc-norms-pose-risk-for-riders/articleshow/84456198.cms||Deepak Karthik

However, the situation seems to be under control in Rajasthan as the state reporting daily new infections below 50 for the past four days. Thirty-three persons were tested positive for Covid-19 in the state on Thursday bringing its overall tally to 9,53,257. No death has been reported due to Covid-19. State’s overall toll stands at 8,947. Health minister Raghu Sharma, though, has cautioned people that if they do not follow the Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, the third wave will become inevitable as new Covid variants are cropping up. Sharma said since new Covid-19 variants are cropping up, the possibility of spread of the infection has increased. After unlock 4.0, a lot of crowd in the markets can be seen, which could become the cause of the third wave of Covid-19. He said vaccine and Covid appropriate behaviour can ward off the risk of getting infected from the virus. Therefore, people should get vaccinated and follow Covid appropriate behaviour, he said. The state has received more than 3,73,820 doses of Covishield and 80,580 doses of Covaxin on Thursday. The health department had written to the Centre about the shortage of the vaccines. In Jaipur too, vaccination drive remained affected due to shortage of doses. Now, as the state has received the vaccine doses, the health department will scale up the inoculation drive on Friday. Nine districts in the state reported new Covid infections. Districts which reported new cases are Jaipur (12), Udaipur (7), Jodhpur (4), Ajmer (3), Bikaner (2), Sriganganagar (2), Alwar (1), Kota (1) and Bharatpur (1).

The corporation in February 2019 had commenced work on the three-floor complex in Thillai Nagar 7th cross under the smart cities mission at a cost of Rs 15 crore. While traders, corporates and franchisees were invited to rent the facility, the civic body had made a deal with a city-based private hospital to hand over the entire complex to the hospital management. The move earned backlash as activists questioned the logic behind handing it over to the private sector. The civic body recently modified its policy in renting the complex and invited government offices operating from private properties to rent the floors. Sources said that the passport office functioning in Marakkadai is likely to move to the second and third floors of the complex. “Allowing government offices to use the corporation’s property will also benefit locals. The same model can be adopted in renting other properties of the civic body but handing over an entire complex to a private player is unacceptable,” K Suresh, district secretary, AITUC said. The government offices will also benefit as corporation will charge a nominal rent. “Government offices looking for space can approach us, priority will be given to them. Required facilities will be provided,” a senior corporation official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichys-thillai-nagar-smart-city-complex-to-house-govt-offices/articleshow/84456210.cms||Deepak Karthik

Those removed are Paliganj SDPO Tanveer Ahmed, Bhojpur Sadar SDPO Pankaj Kumar Rawat, Aurangabad Sadar SDPO Anup Kumar and Dehri SDPO Sanjay Kumar. Earlier on Wednesday, the state government had removed Aurangabad SP Sudheer Kumar Porika and Bhojpur SP Rakesh Kumar Dubey and several other officers, including the DTOs, block circle officers and motor vehicle inspectors.

Overall 24 officers, including the two IPS officers, one SDO and four SDPOs, have been removed in the last 24 hours on the basis of the EOU report. When contacted, mines and geology department minister Janak Ram hinted at more action to be taken against officers and mafia involved in sand smuggling. He said CM Nitish Kumar is keeping a close watch on the entire development. “FIRs would also be registered along with confiscation of property of the accused officers," he said while refusing to disclose any further details. Ram’s department has removed its officers Sanjay Kumar, Surendra Prasad Sinha, Rajesh Kumar Kushwaha, Pramod Kumar, Mukesh Kumar from field postings and attached them to the department headquarters with immediate effect. It also returned the services of Bhojpur mines inspector Ranjeet Kumar and Saran mines inspector Madhusudan Charutvedi to their parent cooperative department with a request to take action against them on the basis of the EOU report on their alleged involved in facilitating illegal sand mining.

The decades-old main distribution pipelines, of which some were established during the British rule, will be replaced with cast iron pipes. Corporation officials said the existing network from the headworks situated on Cauvery and Kollidam riverbeds to the city was in desperate need of an overhaul. Frequent pipe bursts and faulty control valves were blamed for the irregularities in water supply. The civic body in 2020 had proposed to redevelop the potable water supply network in the core city. As per the proposal, pipelines between Kambarasampettai collector well to overhead water tanks in Thillai Nagar, Puthur, Rockfort, Anna Nagar, Woraiyur, Marakkadai and Chinthamani will be replaced. “The project may go on for two years once launched. The usage of cast iron pipe will prevent pipe burst and the network will have a long life span since the pipes will offer resistance against corrosion,” a source with the corporation said. The 17.5km-long project, to be executed in six phases, involves overhauling of overhead water tanks and house service connections as well. Around three lakh people spread in about 8.11sqkm area in 17 wards will be benefited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-floats-tender-to-revamp-citys-water-pipelines/articleshow/84456247.cms||---

Although the locals have submitted a written complaint with Trichy Corporation to inspect it, it has not been done even after five months. The petitioner, M Sakthi Prasad, a resident of Annasalai first street in Kailash Nagar in ward 63, said that a drainage canal in his locality was encroached upon and a shed was built over it by a local resident. The canal serves the Kailash Nagar locality to drain surplus rainwater and carry it to cultivation fields in adjoining villages. However, as the shed was built over the drainage canal, the residents said that their street will face inundation as the water will become stagnant. The canal is also misused for letting out drainage from the houses in the locality. Trichy Corporation sources said the lockdown had prevented them from acting on the complaint. “The person against whom the complaint was made claims that he has patta for the land. We will survey the canal and investigate,” an official with Trichy corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-ignoring-encroachment/articleshow/84456225.cms||---

The health department has referred these cases to the medical education department. Around 10 children’s parents had appealed to the high court for helping them in getting treatment. Nine out of these 10 patients — all in the age group of 1.5 to 10 years — have been diagnosed with Gaucher disease, which is a serious, inherited, chronic, debilitating condition, caused due to a build-up of certain fatty substances in certain organs, particularly the spleen and liver. The health department has referred these to the medical education department. “Since the facility of treatment of the rare diseases is available at hospitals which come under medical education department, the treatment of the children with rare diseases has been referred to the medical education department,” said Siddharth Mahajan, secretary health. At least two out of the 10 children, who had sought the state’s help, passed away last year while awaiting support from the government. The parents of both these children explored all possible options seeking treatment, but to no avail. “We have been waiting for the day when the treatment of my son will start. I have already lost my daughter,” said a vegetable vendor from Kota, 37-year-old Rafiq Mohammad, who is among the parents who had written a letter to chief minister Ashok Gehlot, urging him to arrange treatment of rare diseases for their children, which is quite expensive. The children required enzyme replacement therapy, which cost more than Rs50 lakh every year and could go higher depending on the weight of the child. The parents of the children said that two children have died and any further delay in initiating treatment is likely to have serious consequences on the lives of the remaining patients, who are located in various parts of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/health-dept-refers-cases-of-kids-with-rare-genetic-disorders-to-medical-edu-dept/articleshow/84456252.cms||---

The WRB — a floating device that sends real time information about wave action of the ocean — was installed by the Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (CIFT) in 2019. The cops recovered the device, which was found in a damaged condition, from a man from Veraval. According to officials, the WRB was installed near Somnath temple in association with the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS). Few days back the instrument drifted away due to heavy rain and rough sea. The officials of the CIF, with the help of police, recovered the WRB from a person near Talal Naka of Veraval. But the device was found in damaged and dismantled condition. The 45 batteries of the WRB were intact but its antenna was damaged. This instrument sent information to satellites and from there CIFT and INCOIS received the wave characteristics data of the coastal region. These institutes broadcast these real time data to the mobile phones of fishermen and it’s helpful in safeguarding the life and properties of fishermen. Ashish Kumar Jha, scientist in-charge of CIFT, Veraval, termed the theft unfortunate. “The person who stole had no clue about the instrument. We had labelled the instrument as being government property. It had other details to like whom to contact if someone finds the instrument. We request people to support us because this instrument is for the benefit of the local community,” Jha said. The institute’s work of gathering data is set to be hampered due to the damage to the instrument. A team from Hyderabad has been assigned the work of repairing it. Sources informed that in the past this instrument had drifted to Okha near the Pakistan border and was located and brought back with the help of the coast guards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/stolen-wave-rider-buoy-recovered-from-veraval/articleshow/84451381.cms||---

The court was hearing the bail petition filed by K Selvakumar of Goripalayam in Madurai district. The case of the prosecution is that S Mohammed Ali, 37, a resident of Mahaboopalayam had died by suicide by hanging himself at his house on June 14 as he was facing harassment from the moneylenders. He had recorded a video stating that the petitioner and three others were harassing him and his family by demanding exorbitant interest. Based on the complaint of Ali’s wife Fathima, the S S Colony police had registered a case against four people and arrested the petitioner on June 16. The petitioner stated that he was an advocate and was not a regular moneylender. He had loaned Rs 5 lakh to the deceased through a woman known to him and had no direct contact with the deceased. At no point of time he had demanded money from either the deceased or his family members. However, the government advocate submitted that the it was at the instigation of the petitioner that Ali had committed suicide. Hence, he opposed the grant of bail. Fathima had also filed an intervening petition and opposed the grant of bail. Justice G Chandrasekharan observed that the specific allegation against this petitioner is that he had insulted the deceased by asking him to die, if he was not able to pay the interest. This was the breaking point for the deceased to take a decision of committing suicide. The video recorded by the deceased person also reveals that he was forced to commit suicide because of the accused. Taking into account the facts and circumstances, the judge observed that this court is not inclined to grant bail to the petitioner and hence dismissed the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dismisses-advocates-bail-plea-in-usury-death-case/articleshow/84456267.cms||---

Of the total, about 71km or 28% cannot be used by pedestrians as the pavement is blocked by on-road parking. The study titled ‘Strategic Transportation Plan for Ahmedabad – Non-Motorized Transport’ by Lakshmi R, displayed as part of the ongoing Summer Exhibition, states that of the 775 accidents during the period of the study, 40% involved pedestrians or cyclists. Cyclists are at an ever higher disadvantage with bicycle tracks available only on 2% (18km) of city roads. The study recommended the construction of footpath on 142km of arterial roads, and 110km of sub-arterial roads for pedestrian safety. ‘Upgrade of existing footpaths in core city areas is recommended. Footpath width near institutions should be a minimum of 3 metres, whereas it should be 2-3m in commercial areas and 1.8m in residential areas,’ the study states. The study also highlighted the issue of very less bicycling infrastructure in the city and recommended the construction of 107km of tracks along the route with the planning of major roads. A plan was also created for SG Road. Another study by Minal Shetty titled ‘Strategic Transportation Plan for Ahmedabad 2041’ identified traffic bottlenecks on city roads and argued that the majority of severe and fatal accidents take place around these spots where there are major intersections, changes in road width or sudden curves. The study states that of 452 junctions in the city, only 244 have traffic signals. It recommended increasing the number of signals for road safety. The study also recommended reducing the average block size in new and existing road networks to improve walkability and de-congest roads. Outer roads have an average speed of 40-45kmph whereas inside the city, traffic slows to about 15-20 kmph, the study found. The students also identified several points with frequent jams and recommended traffic re-design to address the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/28-footpaths-encroached-on-by-parking-cept-study/articleshow/84456418.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Intern doctors go on strike over unpaid Covid allowance||AHMEDABAD: More than 400 junior doctors, interns at self-financed Gujarat Medical Education & Research Society (GMERS) medical colleges in Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar and Valsad, went on strike on Thursday over their ‘Covid allowance’ not being paid. The allowance was promised by the state government during the second Covid wave when several representations over pay disparity with other states were made. The internship is mandatory for students who start their own practice after completing their bond period. “The intern doctors were promised Rs 5,000 monthly Covid allowance over their stipend from March to June. While interns of the government-run colleges have received the allowance promised by the government, intern doctors at GMERS-run colleges have not been given the sum,” said a doctor on condition of anonymity. “There was no other way for us but to declare a strike for justice.” Meanwhile, Gujarat deputy CM Nitin Patel, who also handles the health portfolio, promised that the issue would be resolved soon. Patel asked the striking doctors to join work and “show some concern for patients”. “Internship is a must for any medical student. These students must be thankful to the government for arranging their internship at government hospitals and giving them allowances. It’s the government which showed a big heart, not the intern doctors,” Patel said on Thursday. “They have to complete their internship even if we do not give any allowance, because it’s a must to become a doctor. At private medical colleges, students have to pay from their pockets to do an internship. These intern doctors should show some concern for patients,” said the health minister. The hospital administration at Sola and Gandhinagar Civil hospitals claimed that services were not affected. “Talks with the doctors are on. Meanwhile, staff has been ramped up so patients don’t face any issue,” said a senior doctor at Sola Civil Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/intern-doctors-go-on-strike-over-unpaid-covid-allowance/articleshow/84456446.cms||---

The petitioner stated that the ministry has the powers in the process of regulating and prohibiting activities is governed mainly by two notifications namely - Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) notification 2006 and the Coastal Regulation Zone notification, 2011. Both these notifications mandate that permissible activities obtain prior clearance.By way of the memorandum, the ministry is providing an illegal backdoor entry for violators of the EIA notification to obtain clearance and regularize their violations.

Mumbai, in pre-Covid days, needed 1,000 units every day, but there has been a drop in use due to fewer surgeries performed during the lockdown. “However, with the second wave ebbing, the number of surgeries and cancer treatment cycles are increasing and there is bound to be more demand for blood,” said a doctor from a civic hospital. It is one of the lowest stocks Mumbai has had in recent times, said another doctor working for a suburban hospital. Dr Mamta Manglani, former Sion Hospital head of paediatrics who now runs BMC’s BMT Centre in Borivli, said she has 138 thalassaemic children in her care who need up to 500 units of blood for transfusion every month. “The last six months have been very difficult as we have to constantly look for donors,” she said. Corporate houses and colleges, which were the most popular sites for blood donations, are currently closed. Social activists said it is not only the fear of Covid that has kept many donors away, but confusion created due to vaccination. A doctor said many people incorrectly believe they cannot donate before and after the vaccination. “With vaccine stockouts, the waiting period for blood donation has increased,” said the doctor. Dr Manglani said the ICMR has clearly stated people cannot donate blood for 15 days after vaccination. State Blood Transfusion Council head Arun Thorat said it was worse in the beginning of July, but the situation has improved in the last few days. Those willing to hold donation camps can contact the STBC (022-22830216 & sbtc@mahasbtc.com) or Think Foundation (vinay@thinkfoundation.org or 9820146448).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-acute-blood-shortage-in-city-stocks-may-last-4-days/articleshow/84456321.cms||---

She said the agitation over the incident would intensify if their demand was ignored. While addressing a ‘Raj Bhawan March’ organised by the CPI, CPI(ML), CPI(M) and the Marxist Coordination Committee (MCC), Karat said Swamy was sent to jail as a part of a conspiracy to suppress the opposition voices. She added that he died due to lack of treatment for his illnesses. Notably, Karat told media persons that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested Swamy last October without evidence on the pretext of further investigation but did not question him once till June. Describing Swamy’s custodial death as a criminal act, she said the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), under which Swamy was arrested, should be scrapped. Speaking during the Raj Bhawan March, CPI state secretary B P Mehta alleged that ever since the NDA government came to power at the Centre, it was trying to suppress the opposition by instituting false cases. CPI(ML) MLA Binod Singh reiterated the demand for a judicial inquiry into Swamy’s death. He said the pro-people issues raised by Swamy would not be allowed to be subdued. Several leaders from Left parties, including Janardhan Prasad of CPI(ML), Mithlesh Singh of MCC, Prakash Viplav of CPI(M), Mahendra Pathak of CPI and social activist Dayamani Barla, took part in the protest. Swamy, who was 84, died at a Mumbai hospital on July 5. He was arrested by the NIA on charges of his alleged links with Maoists and in connection to an ongoing probe of the 2018 Bhima-Koregaon violence in Pune. Swamy had in the past denied the accusations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/centre-must-order-judicial-inquiry-into-priests-death-brinda/articleshow/84452579.cms||---

Closed since March 2020, the morning walkers, joggers and the yoga enthusiasts in particular were disappointed to miss out on their daily dose of exercise in the open green. “The park is now open for the people to visit but there are certain SOPs that the visitors have to follow,” said state health minister Banna Gupta, who reopened the gates of the park. DC Suraj Kumar said there was a demand from the citizens to open the park for quite some time. “ The state government’s unlock guidelines have been followed while opening the park,” Kumar said.

Although police said he went to the woman’s house upon the invitation of her parents, the villagers claimed that he went there of his own accord and tried to forcibly drag the woman out of her house when she refused to see him after coming to know that the BDO is already married. The commotion at her house led to the villagers gathering there and they dragged the BDO by the collar and thrashed him which was captured on video and later went viral on various social media platforms. Kunda police rushed to the spot once they got to know about the incident and took Ram to his home. Chatra SP Rishav Kumar Jha said they will take appropriate action if the woman files a written complaint. “From what we have learnt so far is that the officer was having affair with the woman and was called by her parents to finalise their marriage. But when he refused to marry her, the villagers started beating him. I have asked the officials concerned to submit a report in this case,” Jha said. He added that although the BDO is married, he is going through a divorce. Sources said that Ram was having an affair with the woman for the past two years. He not only helped the woman in getting a job at his office but also played a role in the construction of her house close to the block office. However, when she came to know about Ram’s marriage, she tried to break up with him. On Wednesday morning, Ram went to her house and asked her to accompany him but she refused. Claiming that she is his wife, he tried to drag her out of the house forcibly, according to the villagers, prompting her parents to interfere and leading to a heated argument among the four. The villagers, who had already gathered there, caught him by the collar and dragged him out of the house and beat him up. The villagers said they will demand action against him as well as demand his immediate removal from the Kunda block.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/villagers-thrash-kunda-bdo-for-misbehaving-with-woman/articleshow/84452646.cms||---

The security forces also seized an AK 47 rifle and bullets from the spot. Oraon was a member of the Bihar-Jharkhand Regional Committee of CPI (Maoist) and carried a cash reward of Rs 15 lakh. He was a resident of Pakartoli village under the sadar police station. Oraon was gunned down two days after the start of the anti-Naxal operations in the area. A sniffer dog and villager died while a CoBRA jawan of the 203 Battalion of the CRPF suffered injuries during consecutive IED blasts in last the two days. Confirming the development to TOI, Gumla SP Hrudeep P Janardhanan said, “The combined forces of CRPF, district police and CoBRA personnel are carrying operation for the last three days in the dense forests near Kochagani village. During the operation, Budheshwar Oraon was killed.” Sources said that Oraon joined the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC), which was later named CPI (Maoist) in 1999, and was active in the district. He was involved in the killing of Narayan Say, an area commander of the then MCC. Oraon and other commanders were also instrumental in weeding out the erstwhile militant group, Jharkhand Sangharsh Jan Multi Morcha (JSJMM). While top Maoist leaders kept surrendering, Oraon continued to be with the organization despite police pressure. He was reported to be roaming around the forests with area commander Ranthu Oraon, his brother-in-law, from Kulhi village and a new cadre identified as Lazim Ansari of Panso village, according to sources. Oraon had made Reragani area his safe zone with around 15 cadres for the last one month after planting a series of IEDs. “The district police had specific information about his presence and a special search operation was planned and being executed," the SP said, adding, “The deceased had many cases against him, including attacks on police vehicles, murder and mass killings, extortion and attacking the security forces among others in different police stations of Gumla district." Oraon was also involved in a major encounter with the security forces at Sivil forest where a jawan of Jharkhand Jaguar was killed and two others were injured in 2013. During the Sivil encounter, CPI (Maoist) central committee member Arbind Ji and other top Maoist leaders (who had arrived here) were also present. Oraon and other local commanders later arranged a safe passage of Arbind Ji's squad to the Saranda forest via Simdega district after the encounter. Oraon was also involved in blowing off an anti-landmine vehicle and killing two CRPF jawans on September 22, 2009. He was also associated killing of five policemen in broad daylight at a market at Chainpur block in April 2013. Janardhanan said he had visited his family members a few months back and asked them to counsel Oraon to surrender but he didn’t do so. “Between 2002 and 2020, Oraon was involved in 64 criminal cases,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/maoist-carrying-rs-15l-reward-killed-in-gumla/articleshow/84452858.cms||K A Gupta
---||Ranchi||Look beyond mines for Jharkhand’s development: CM Hemant Soren||RANCHI: More than big industrial units like power and steel plants, people in Jharkhand require assistance in sectors like agriculture, tourism and the likes for overall development of the state, chief minister Hemant Soren said on Thursday while speaking at the state-level workshop on sustainable development goals India Index and Multidimensional Poverty Index. The workshop was organised jointly by the state government and the Niti Aayog at Project Building in Ranchi. The workshop was part of Niti Aayog’s plan to prepare roadmap for 2030 to evaluate and assess the development goals and index as part of which it is holding consultation meetings in every state. Thursday’s workshop was attended by bureaucrats and state government officials. Speaking on the occasion, Soren stressed that it was time to look beyond mines and minerals. He said, “People of Jharkhand can’t run power or steel plants. But they are laborious and hardworking who can do wonders if we provide them with the right environment in sectors like agriculture, tourism, etc. I expect Niti Aayog and the policy-makers to keep the local aspirations and requirements in mind before making any plans. The one-size-fits-all approach won’t lead to success.” He added that even though mines and mineral activities have been operational in the state for decades, it did not lead to a big positive change in people’s lives except resulting in widespread displacement and resentment. “In the command areas of Coal India Ltd people still don’t have access to clean drinking water and in places where uranium mining is taking place, kids being born are disabled. What do we call it —god’s blessings or curse,” he said, adding, “The state government can’t even rollout any welfare plans in such areas. Even the forest-dwellers and tribals are facing a slew of problems due to the complexities of the forest rights acts.” Stressing on framing need-based plans and policies, the CM said that the need of the hour is to focus on ways to increase the income of farmers, livelihood linkages of traditional forest-dwellers, Adivasis, etc., to ensure their development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/look-beypond-mines-for-states-devpt-cm/articleshow/84452193.cms||ASRP Mukesh

The initiative is backed by a few doctors from New Delhi. Dr Khan, who was working with the BRD Medical College and Hospital at Gorakpur in UP and arrested twice for medical negligence for the death of children at the hospital in August 2017 before his release after the intervention of the Allahabad high court, said he had already visited several states and reached Ranchi on the 94th day of their trip. While hosting a free medical check-up camp at the Haj House here, Dr Khan said he had already hosted two camps in East Singhbhum and Saraikela after he entered Jharkhand from West Bengal. “After today’s camp, we are going to visit Godda and Deoghar,” he said. Talking to TOI about his initiative, he said, “I was sitting and talking to a few friends in New Delhi about the sudden rise of Covid cases in April this year and then a few of my friends working at RML and Ganga Ram Hospital said the patient inflow had increased from 30/40 per day to 300 patients per day. I along with a few friends then saw that people were not dying inside the hospital but they were losing breath outside as there were no beds, oxygen supply and medicines. So, we decided to run this campaign with help of a few friends and here we are.” He further said during his initiative so far, his team has provided consultations to 20,000, kids, including over 450, treated paediatric problems and educated the masses on symptoms of Covid among children. His team has also distributed over 45,000 masks and urged everyone to take the vaccine. “This the 94th day of our initiative and reached Jharkhand after visiting UP, Delhi, Rajasthan, Bihar and West Bengal. The idea is to serve people in areas where medical facilities are scarce. Initially, we funded our work but gradually we started receiving donations from the public,” Dr Khan said. On his experience after travelling to different states, he said, “I can sum up this one line — It is not because of Covid-19 that our healthcare system has collapsed but it is the virus which has exposed the weak system in our country.” Dr Khan was slapped charges under the National Security Act (NSA) and the children death case. The charges were dropped after the high court intervened.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/up-medico-team-in-city-to-create-covid-awareness/articleshow/84452147.cms||Gaurav Pandey

While Patole had said last week that both the CM and Dy CM had asked the law-enforcing agencies to keep track of his movements, on Thursday he described Sharad Pawar as the “remote control” of the MVA government. Further, Patole has declared he will address a rally of OBC workers in Baramati, Pawar’s hometown, on July 29. The question is: Do Patole’s statements have hte backing of the Congress leadership, particularly that of Rahul Gandhi? Reacting sharply to this question, Patole told TOI, “I have the support of the high command. I have been appointed PCC president not for locking the party but to expand across the state. As a part of that strategy, I declared that Congress will contest the 2024 assembly elections on its own. I have not changed my stand. I am sure my recent statements will have no adverse impact on the MVA government’s stability.” Patole, who was formerly with the BJP and joined Congress after attacking PM Modi, has courted controversy ever since he quietly resigned from the assembly speaker’s post without informing either Pawar or the CM. Patole had announced that in view of the bitter experience with NCP in the 2014 assembly elections, Congress would go solo in the 2024 assembly elections.” Patole said there was nothing wrong with his claim that Congress would contest elections on its own. “Even Uddhav Thackeray has asked his party workers to be prepared for polls, NCP too is working in that direction. Then what is wrong if I too am prepared for contesting the elections independently?” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/patole-at-it-again-says-sharad-pawar-is-mva-govts-remote-control/articleshow/84460618.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar

The powerpack is a part of the tank’s engine. However, VDIH is not disclosing the company’s name at present citing business reasons. An announcement would be made soon, said Deshpande. He added that the components were being imported by India until now. With the transfer of technology (TOT) agreement between the Czech and Indian company, the production will take place at home as part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat programme of the government. A new unit would be set up in the city with initial investment of Rs25 crore, to be eventually scaled up to Rs55 crore, said Deshpande. The plant is expected to be operational within the current financial year. VDIH was established by Thodge with the objective of promoting defence industries in the region. This is the first major deal struck with the help of VDIH, Deshpande said. In a separate development, VDIH has facilitated an order to supply three prototype telescopic excavators by a Slovakian company to Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML). Mounted on Tatra vehicles, the excavators can be deployed for digging trenches from a distance and search operations, said Deshpande. “Indo-Slovak Chamber of Commerce is a member of VDIH. A memorandum of understanding was signed between CSM group of Slovakia and BEML to provide technology for making telescopic excavators. Recently, the CSM Group has also bagged the order to supply three prototype excavators to BEML,” said Deshpande. This is on no-cost, no-commitment basis, after which further orders may be placed. The excavators can be used by the army in border areas. VDIH has 35 members including industries from Nagpur. It also had plans to set up a centre of excellence in Mihan. The centre was planned to create skilled manpower for aeronautical and defence industries. However, the project has been put on hold after the state government under Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) regime withheld its contribution towards capital. The project will require Rs92 crore, out of which Rs63 crore were to come from the state government. As a part of cost cutting decisions during Covid, the government has put the plans on hold.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lt-gen-thodges-brainchild-closes-first-deal-to-boost-defence-production-in-city/articleshow/84454154.cms||Shishir Arya
---||India||PM Modi praises Yogi’s ‘outstanding work’ to tame second wave||LUCKNOW: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech in Varanasi on Thursday cleared all doubts, if there were any, about the preeminence of Brand Yogi as the part of BJP’s campaign strategy in the forthcoming UP elections early next year. He landed in his parliamentary constituency after over seven months to launch projects worth Rs 1,583 crore but political analysts see it as Modi’s first tour to UP with strong political messages, nearly eight months before the biggest state in the country goes to polls. His 32-minute speech revolved around Yogi’s “outstanding work” to tame the second wave of Covid and the contribution of his work ethics and hard work towards the overall development of UP in the past four and a half years. During his speech, Modi said that “the list of development work in UP under CM Yogi was so long that one really finds it difficult to choose what to count and what to leave out”. This stamp of approval has come after whispering voices of change in leadership were being heard along with attacks from opposition leaders during the peak of pandemic in April and May. Amid speculations that all was not well between New Delhi and Lucknow, top BJP leaders, including the PM, home minister Amit Shah and defence minister Rajnath Singh took to social media platforms to highlight the party’s win in zila panchayat chairperson and block pramukh polls and credited Yogi for the ‘thumping victories’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-praises-yogis-outstanding-work-to-tame-second-wave/articleshow/84460648.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Goa||Tourism body asks Shripad to aid revival of hospitality ind||Panaji: The Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG), the apex body representing hotels and travel trade in the state, on Thursday urged minister of state for tourism Shripad Naik to aid the revival of the hospitality industry that has been in the doldrums since the Covid-19 pandemic began. TTAG representatives, led by president Nilesh Shah, called on Naik and submitted a memorandum about the industry’s expectations. Its foremost request is to lower the GST rate applicable to the hospitality sector to a flat 12%, and for smaller hotels to 5%. It requested that the moratorium on EMIs on term loans be extended till March 31, 2023. The matter needs to be taken up with RBI to provide some relief against the Covid-induced financial crises, the TTAG said. It suggested that tourism offices in international markets be replaced by appointing a local public relations agency so that no sooner the crisis blows over, than an arrangement is in place to convince tourists to visit India. It also asked for a travel bubble with countries from where Goa receives charters. At least 92% of India’s charter business is on account of Goa, it said. SOPs laid out by the ministry of home affairs (MHA) haven’t considered the requirements of charter trade, which is hugely Goa specific, the association said while calling for the introduction of specific SOPs for this segment. It proposed that charter markets originating from countries such as Russia, the UK and Poland, if willing, be allowed to start their operations from November. Charter flights will be allowed to land directly into Goa under a travel bubble arrangement. The SOPs applicable for domestic travel should also be made applicable for foreign tourists, TTAG said. “Announce in advance the date from which charters will be permitted. A delay in announcement will defer the process of starting charters for the coming season,” it stated in the memorandum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tourism-body-asks-shripad-to-aid-revival-of-hospitality-ind/articleshow/84457247.cms||---

The department of tourism, which is pushing the project in a bid to raise the state’s value as a tourist destination finds itself in a spot. A tourism official said that Goa does not have a designated area or a facility complete with parking arrangements to organise crowd pulling events like the electronic dance music (EDMs) festival Sunburn, which has been a huge success over the past decade. An entertainment village like this will ease matters for event organisers, who will not have to run pillar to post for various permissions, giving the sector a thrust, the official said. “No sooner was the project announced, some people started objecting. It is unfortunate that even before knowing what it is about, people raise objections. We don’t know how to go forward,” a tourism official said. For the last few years, the Sunburn was held at Vagator. “The organisers have to go through a gargantuan of formalities right from hiring the place from a local body to getting permissions from various authorities,” he said. The organisers, he said, also have to pay huge sums for renting a place for parking. To make matters worse, someone will go to court over some issue or the other, the official added. “Lot of problems would be solved if there is a special area to conduct entertainment events,” he said. The project site has a scenic view of the sea below and is suitable to conduct various entertainment events, even bike rallies, the official said. “It is a huge area, which is currently in possession of the revenue department, but lying idle. It is better to have some project there than leaving it open to encroachment,” he said. Since 2017, the government has been saying that it does not want EDMs to be held in the week of December, a time when Goa’s footfalls are at a peak in Candolim-Calangute, as it adds to the burden of the security machinery. Traffic during the Christmas week in Calangute-Calangute is always choke-a-block.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/entertainment-village-project-oppn-unfortunate/articleshow/84457296.cms||---
---||Goa||Will resolve all issues, Shripad assures seamen||Quepem: Union minister of state for shipping, ports and waterways Shripad Naik assured the Goan seafarers community that he will try to withdraw the earlier order which debarred thousands of seamen from applying for Continuous Discharge Certificate (CDC). The minister made this statement on the sidelines of a function to launch the distribution of Covid kits, oxygen cylinders and wheel chairs to seafarers. The Goan Seafarers’ Association of India (GSAI) submitted a memorandum to Naik, requesting him to withdraw or reduce the relaxation period. “Seafarers are the backbone of Indian economy, their immense contribution to our state cannot be ignored. Since I am in charge of the shipping portfolio, I will try to resolve all the issues pertaining to seafarers within a short time,” said Naik. Thousands of seafarers from all over India had been barred from applying for CDC and joining ships due to the submission of fake Standardisation of Training and Certificate of Watch-keeping certificates (STCW). More than 100 Goan seafarers are in the debarred list. Naik also assured seafarers that he will urge the chief minister to make the seafarers pension scheme permanent and to increase the pension amount so that seafarers don’t have to fight repeatedly with the government on the pension issue. The Sailors’ Society UK and Seafarers’ International Relief fund have donated 1,200 Covid care kits to GSAI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-resolve-all-issues-shripad-assures-seamen/articleshow/84457327.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Goa: ‘AAP’s power freebies a sham’||PANAJI: Ridiculing AAP’s power freebies, Congress said that Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal was trying to hoodwink Goan voters by promising 300 units of free power. Congress said that power consumers will have to pay double the amount per unit if they consume even one unit more than 300. Former AAP MLA and present Congress member from Delhi Alka Lamba said that AAP should not look at Goa as an “experimental lab” to test out new political strategies. “In Delhi, 200 units of power are free and if you consume 200 units of power you have to pay Rs 3 per unit. But when you cross 201, then you have to pay Rs 6.5 per unit. In Goa, it will be the same,” said Lamba. Lamba said that AAP will increase the electricity tariffs, which will make electricity expensive for high power consumers. “Arvind Kejriwal said that in Goa 80% of the consumers will not need to pay the bill and this is because the remaining 20% will be paying the bills of the others,” Lamba said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aaps-power-freebies-a-sham/articleshow/84457354.cms||---

There is no place to set up IIT-Goa at Tuem in Pernem taluka, Sawant told reporters. “The state government is identifying the land for setting up IIT-Goa,” he said. TimesViewIt is unfortunate that Goa has over the past few years not been able to finalise a site for IIT campus. It seems the government has failed to learn any lessons from experience—especially from Loliem and Melauli. Environment being a sensitive issue in Goa, the government needs to consult people before going ahead on the subject. No citizen trusts a government which doesn’t follow a transparent process. People are blamed for opposing the projects, but the government fails to take the stakeholders into confidence and explain how the locals would benefit from these projects. This needs to be done at the initial stage itself and not after it is unable to handle the protests.In March, the state government had constituted a committee to identify land to set up an IIT-Campus in the state. The committee held a meeting and discussed the location to be identified for the project. In January, the chief minister acceded to the demand of Melauli locals to shift the IIT project from the village. “The decision to shift the IIT project was taken keeping in mind people’s sentiments and the request of health minister Vishwajit Rane, who is also the local MLA, and local representatives,” Sawant had said. The government’s move to cancel the project at Melauli was the culmination of six-month-long agitation by residents. The government had earlier identified sites at Canacona and Sanguem for the institute. Power minister and Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral had said that his constituents “welcome” the project. IIT-Goa currently functions from the Goa Engineering College campus in Farmagudi, Ponda. The government may now look for sites at Sanguem or Quepem to set up the institute.

Hope the legacy bearers of Parrikar also remember his words at Lohia Maidan, Margao, in 2005 where he had declared that he will quit politics if Kamat wins the by-election that year,” party spokesperson Pallavi Bhagat said in a statement. She termed Parrikar as “master of defections” who “attempted to topple Digambar Kamat’s government twice between 2007 and 2012,” and further accused BJP government of having always “grabbed power in Goa by going against the mandate of the people and backstabbing others.” “The BJP came to power in Goa by doing chicanery. They have remained in power by stealing people’s mandate and encouraging mass defections,” Bhagat said in the statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/parrikar-was-jealous-of-digambar-cong/articleshow/84457516.cms||---

Seniors like me (and other Congress MLAs) aren’t taken into confidence,” Sardinha said while addressing reporters at the Congress South Goa district office. Making a case for Chodankar’s removal, he added, “We have told the high command that this man hasn’t won any election so far, and that he cannot take everybody together. The party gives one the ticket, but it is the voters who elect him, and then he becomes politically popular. So (Girish) needs to be removed as early as possible for the Congress in the state to survive; we can’t just dream of winning.” Sardinha further cautioned chief minister Pramod Sawant against opening up the state’s borders any soon just because Covid cases were on the decline. “Let the situation stabilise. Don’t let in the third wave by taking wrong decisions,” he said, even as he urged the prime minister to ensure that both the Covid vaccines are recognised by WHO so that people don’t face difficulties in travelling to other countries. He further urged the Union government to reduce the fuel prices as, he said, it hurts the poor the most. “Everything depends on fuel prices, that leads to inflation. Don’t step on the stomachs of the poor,” he said. He also appealed to the people not to fall prey to what he called “false assurances” given by AAP. “They have finished selling falsehood elsewhere, and have now come to Goa,” he said. He also accused AAP government in Delhi of letting the 10-year church get demolished.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/south-goa-mp-reiterates-demand-for-girishs-ouster/articleshow/84457666.cms||---
---||India||Ex gratia for 2k staffers who died on UP poll duty||BAREILLY: The UP government will compensate the families of 2,020 of its employees who died of Covid-19 while on panchayat election duty in April and May. Of them, 1,071 were teachers or education staff. In May, the government had said just three teachers had died on poll duty. Prior to the election, the risk teachers were at during poll duty had been taken up in court. The Supreme Court eventually allowed counting to take place following the predetermined schedule after the state government and the State Election Commission (SEC) said precautions would be taken. But just as the election was under way, TOI had on April 24 first reported that several teachers had died after panchayat election duty with Covid-19 symptoms — teachers’ unions put the toll at 1,621 after the polls ended. Initially, the government counted only those who had died within 24 hours of poll duty. The state’s basic education department had then said that election duty “starts when an employee reaches the training centre and ends after he completes the polling or the counting and leaves the booth.” If someone died within those few hours, their families would be eligible for compensation. When that was extended to a 30-day window — Covid symptoms take time to appear — the number of those eligible for the Rs 30-lakh compensation went up. The basic education department said the responsibility of final identification was not theirs. The government, in turn, said the state polling body was accountable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ex-gratia-for-2k-staffers-who-died-on-up-poll-duty/articleshow/84460745.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Subramanian was speaking to reporters after meeting Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya in New Delhi. The state had demanded Rs 1,500 crore for management and prevention of the epidemic, he said. “They immediately granted Rs 800 crore. After we utilize this, the Centre will review our proposal and release more funds,” he said. Pointing to the Tamil Nadu’s demand for more vaccines, the minister said, “We need at least 12 crore doses of vaccine, but we have so far received just 1.7 crore doses.” Chief minister M K Stalin has already written to the PM seeking a special allocation of 1 crore doses to correct the imbalance in vaccine allocation to the state, he said. “More people are queuing up for the shots and there is no wastage of vaccine now,” he said. The state has also asked for additional allotment of drugs for treating mucormycosis (black fungus). “We have nearly 4,000 fungal infection cases across the state. We may need more drugs for early treatment of the infection and to prevent deaths. The drugs allotted to the state are also given to private hospitals when they are in need,” Ma Subramanian said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-gets-rs-800cr-from-centre-to-manage-prevent-covid-waves/articleshow/84454972.cms||---

NDRF and SDRF teams had rescued 20 people by midnight and sent them to hospital, but it was still not known how many others were trapped and if any had died. Five of the survivors are hospitalized. The well is 40-ft deep. At least five persons are said to be missing. Rescue ops will continue through the night. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has ordered a high-level inquiry. The incident happened in Lal Patthar area, about 100km from Bhopal. It began with a crowd rushing to the well to rescue a 16-year-old boy, Sandeep Parihar, who had fallen in while trying to draw water, sarpanch Amar Singh Kushwah told police. As word spread, more and more people flocked to the location. At some point, it is estimated, there were around 50 people around the well. A concrete slab that rings the well couldn’t take their weight and collapsed around 9pm, dragging several of them in, said police. The inside wall of the well caved in too. Panic ensued and locals tried to rescue the victims on their own, but darkness and the depth of the well hampered them. An SOS went out to police.CM Chouhan, who was in the district for ‘kanyadan’ of three adopted girls, asked the IG, SP, commissioner, collector and minister-in-charge Vishwas Sarang to rush to the site and monitor rescue operations. “I am in constant touch with them. SDRF teams have been sent fully equipped,” he tweeted. However, darkness made things hard for the rescuers, who often had to put their lives at risk. An inspector and a home guard also fell into the well during the operations, but were saved. DGP Vivek Johri said the exact number of people who might have fallen into the well isn’t clear yet. Rescuers were trying to drain the well in the hope of finding survivors. CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced an ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh each for kin of the deceased and compensation of Rs 50,000 each to the injured. The injured will also be provided free medical treatment.

The Minjur police had initially registered a case of suspicious death under Section 174 of the CrPC after recovering the man’s body near a fish farm. According to police, the woman, mother of two, was working at the farm when the man sneaked in, gagged and dragged her to a secluded place and attempted to sexually assault her. To escape from him, the woman pushed him to the ground. The man hit a stone and lost consciousness. She later dragged him out of the farm and dumped him along the road. The woman then narrated the incident to her husband Poongavanam, 26, who also worked there. He and other workers rushed to the spot where she had dumped the man and found some local villagers there. On information, a Minjur police team led by inspector Vadivel Murugan rushed to the spot. They alerted the ‘108’ ambulance service. Paramedics examined the man and confirmed that he had died. Police registered a case of suspicious death and sent the body to Ponneri GH for autopsy. Vadivel Murugan said, “We inquired about the deceased in the neighbourhood and people said they had spotted him a couple of times in the area. They said that he was not employed in any company there.” Tiruvallur SP V Varun Kumar said, “After ascertaining the genuineness of the case, the woman was booked under Section 100 of the IPC and allowed to go free.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-woman-kills-man-to-save-herself-from-rape-cops-set-her-free/articleshow/84450259.cms||A Selvaraj

As per norms, the sitting MP of a parliamentary seat in the district is appointed chairperson of DISHA by the Union rural development ministry, which conceptualised the committee in 2016 to keep vigil on implementation of various Central schemes through inter-departmental coordination. Currently, Irani also holds charge of DISHA in Amethi. Rae Bareli district magistrate Vaibhav Srivastava confirmed the development to TOI, saying that since Salon block in Rae Bareli district falls under Amethi, Irani has been made the chairperson of DISHA in Rae Bareli. Rae Bareli chief development officer Abhishek Goel said “the seat has been vacant since 2019.” Though he refused to clarify on whether an MP can hold dual district posts, experts pointed out that the move comes ahead of the scheduled Lucknow visit of Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi and marks BJP’s attempt to make deeper inroads into the Congress pocket borough in the run-up to assembly elections next year. On Tuesday, Irani was inducted in the cabinet committee on political affairs headed by PM Narendra Modi. The rural development ministry website still mentions Sonia Gandhi as chairperson of the DISHA committee for Rae Bareli while Rahul Gandhi is shown as co-chairperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/smriti-irani-named-panel-head-in-sonia-fort-rae-bareli/articleshow/84460774.cms||Pankaj Shah
