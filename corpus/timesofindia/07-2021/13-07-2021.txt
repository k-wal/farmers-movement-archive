There are hundreds of varieties of British apples grown in the UK, including Braeburn, Bramley, Cox and Royal Gala, which can now be exported to India following the enhanced trade partnership (ETP) agreed between Indian PM Narendra Modi and British PM Boris Johnson on May 4 as a precursor to a free trade deal. Trade barriers addressed by the ETP include lifting restrictions to enable fruit producers across the UK to export British apples, pears and quince to India for the first time. Until now only 3% of Britain’s apple crop has been exported overseas. The move will give a big boost to British fruit growers. International trade secretary Liz Truss tweeted: "Our apples are now on the way to India for the first time in 50 years thanks to the ETP." Ross Goatham, managing director at AC Goatham & Son, the UK’s largest apple- and pear-growing, cold storage and packing operation, said: "India is an outlet that we have looked at for a number of years but, unfortunately, we were precluded at the time because of a ban running back to the 1970s. With the announcements made the other week of the trade deal, we were pretty much straight on the front foot, and, I think, we’ve had about 20 Indian firms contact us recently asking can they buy our apples. We look forward to opening discussions with interested parties in India." International trade minister Ranil Jayawardena said: "India is a huge opportunity, it’s a market of 1.4 billion people, and our ETP is already helping to unlock benefits for our British businesses." In June, the first consignment of GI-tagged Bhagalpuri Jardalu mangoes had travelled from Bihar to Lucknow to London.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/finally-indians-can-make-apple-pie-the-british-way-with-bramley-apples/articleshow/84357524.cms||NAOMI CANTON

Six persons had been arrested on Sunday. On Sunday, NIA had conducted raids at multiple locations in Srinagar and Anantnag. The raids on both days were conducted to trace people indulged in propaganda to radicalise Kashmiris through a magazine --Voice of Hind (VoH). NIA spokesman said those arrested on Monday included Umar Nisar of Magray Mohalla Achabal, Tanveer Ahmad Bhat of Gori Mohalla Achabal and Rameez Ahmad Lone of Chak Achabal, all in Anantnag district. According to the spokesman, ISIS terrorists operating from various conflict zones, along with ISIS cadres in India, have assumed pseudo-online identities and have created a network through which ISIS-related propaganda material is disseminated for radicalizing and recruiting members to the ISIS fold. “An India-centric online propaganda magazine, ‘The Voice of Hind’ is published every month with an aim to incite and radicalize impressionable youth,” the spokesman added. NIA had earlier conducted searches at the premises of the arrested accused and claimed to have recovered incriminating documents, multiple digital devices and T-shirts with ISIS logo. Preliminary examination of the seized material and examination of the accused persons revealed that they are active cadres of ISIS and have been using cyberspace to propagate inciting material through VoH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/3-more-held-for-isis-propaganda-in-kashmir/articleshow/84357621.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The report says that China is "challenging it's neighbors' oil and gas activities within their own exclusive economic zones". The US organization has said that stand-offs between China and other countries in the region continue to take place on a regular basis, though only some get reported widely. The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) report says that ships from the China Coast Guard (CCG) harassed Malaysian vessels near the Kasawari gas field last month. AMTI says: "This is at least the third time since last spring that the CCG has harassed Malaysian energy exploration. It demonstrates again Beijing's persistence in challenging its neighbors' oil and gas activities within their own exclusive economic zones". AMTI says that the air patrol that China conducted near the Malaysian air space was 'likely not a coincidence'. It adds that the fly-past with 16 military aircraft happened at a time when Malaysia wanted to install a wellhead platform at Kasawari. Last month, Malaysia scrambled it's fighter jets to chase away the Chinese aircraft that violated it's airspace near the disputed South China Sea (SCS) area. Malaysia said that this violation was a 'serious threat' to it's national sovereignty and flight safety. "CCG vessels regularly operate around nearby Luconia Shoals, staying there for months and often making passes by Malaysian offshore energy operations", says the US think tank. Separately, Russian news agency Sputnik reported that two Chinese ships entered Japanese territorial waters on Saturday, close to the disputed Senkaku Islands in the ECS. Sputnik quoted Japanese broadcaster NHK World that the ships tried to approach Japanese fishing vessels. The Senkaku Islands are claimed by China and Taiwan also while Japan has control over the islands. Earlier this week the Japanese deputy prime minister and also the defence minister had both warned about the likelihood of regional tensions due to China's assertion of military might against Taiwan. Currently, China is in disputes with most of it's neighbors over land and maritime territories. These include India, Bhutan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei, the Philippines and Taiwan. There are reports that China also has intruded into the territory of Nepal, a friendly country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-bullies-malaysia-for-oil-gas-quest-in-south-china-sea-us-think-tank/articleshow/84357390.cms||---

---||World||US pulls visas of 100 Nicaraguan legislators, judges||MANAGUA, NICARAGUA: The US state department announced Monday it is revoking the travel visas of 100 legislators, judges and prosecutors who aided the regime of President Daniel Ortega. The department said the visa cancellations came in response to the arrests by Ortega's Sandinista government of at least 26 members of the opposition and most potential candidates in the November 7 elections. The department accused the officials and their family members of having "advanced the Ortega-Murillo regime's assault on democracy." That was a reference to Rosario Murillo, Ortega's wife and Vice President. The measure targets "those with responsibility for, or complicity in, the suppression of peaceful protests or abuse of human rights, and the immediate family members of such persons." It prevents those named from entering the United States. In June, Mexico and Argentina recalled their ambassadors to Nicaragua for consultations, and the Organization of American States passed a resolution condemning the recent arrests of key opposition figures. Those arrested also include opposition leaders, prominent businessmen and former government officials. Since June, Ortega's government has arrested six probable candidates in the November 7 elections, in which Ortega, 75, is running for a fourth consecutive presidential term. The government has accused most of those arrested with accepting foreign funding and working for the overthrow of the government. Ortega has characterized a popular uprising in April 2018 that led to months of street protests as an attempted coup with foreign backing. Legislators, judge and prosecutors have aided Ortega by applying spurious "treason" and censorship laws to justify the arrest of opponents. The state department said: "The United States will continue to use the diplomatic and economic tools at our disposal to push for the release of political prisoners and to support Nicaraguans' calls for greater freedom, accountability, and free and fair elections."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-pulls-visas-of-100-nicaraguan-legislators-judges/articleshow/84358455.cms||---

Ejaz Pasha of Siddaiah Road allegedly clicked her pictures and demanded Rs 5 lakh for not uploading them on social media. She alleged the driver, known to her, also tried to kidnap her 16-year-old daughter last week. “I was alone at home on July 7 evening when Pasha barged into my house and threatened me with a knife. He harassed me sexually and clicked some pictures of the act. Then he called my husband and told him to give Rs 5 lakh, else he’ll take me with him,” the woman said. She alleged that her daughter was standing near a school when Pasha tried to kidnap her. “My daughter resisted and ran away. If something happens to anyone in my family or if any of us die, Ejaz Pasha should be held responsible for it,” she said. Gang assaults youth  A 21-year-old youth was allegedly assaulted by a gang of three men over a petty issue in Hennur on July 4. Karthik, 21, filed a police complaint last week. Karthik and his friend Harish were sitting outside a welding shop at 6pm when the miscreants came on a scooter. When Karthik asked the rider to be careful, they abused him.

Muttu K alias Vinay K alias Siddarth Urs alias Sandy, a resident of Lakshmipura in Bylakuppe of Mysuru district, was nabbed by cybercrime police from Whitefield division after a woman filed a complaint saying he had conned her of Rs 19 lakh. Police found he had cheated two more women of Rs 21 lakh. “After befriending the woman, Muttu promised to marry her. A few months ago, he took Rs 3 lakh from her saying he had a medical emergency. After some days, Muttu returned Rs 5 lakh, asking her to keep the extra money. He did this to win her confidence. Later, he asked for Rs 20 lakh again and the woman transferred Rs 19 lakh,” police said. Muttu would frequent posh hotels in Mysuru and make calls from his laptop using the WiFi in the lobby. He claimed he was working from home for his US employers. He claimed on different matrimonial sites that he was connected to the erstwhile royal family. His chat message with many women began with ‘I am Siddarth Urs’. He posted many pictures of Mysore Palace and some children in its backdrop, and told his victims he was among the kids. DCP (Whitefield) D Devaraj said three cases have been registered against the accused in Bengaluru so far. “We have taken him into police custody for questioning,” he said, adding, “The accused downloaded innumerable photos of the erstwhile royal family from the internet. He would send some to women he befriended on matrimonial sites, saying he was in the photos.” “The accused is married and has a five-year-old daughter. His wife seems to have no idea about his activities and thinks he earns by helping tourists visiting Mysuru,” the DCP said, adding Muttu was being arrested for the first time. School dropout, tourist guidePolice said they are investigating if Muttu had cheated more women. A school dropout, he worked in different capacities, including as a travel guide. However, in 2019, Muttu came across the news of a woman losing money to a fraudster through a matrimonial site, an investigating officer said. “Via YouTube, Muttu learnt how to register on matrimonial sites. He succeeded in creating a profile in the name of Siddarth Urs. Introducing himself as a member of the erstwhile royal family, he claimed be a techie in the US,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/man-poses-as-mys-royal-family-member-cons-3-of-40l/articleshow/84365839.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Gold importers evaded Rs 338 crore in customs duty; kingpin held in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: In the biggest operation of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence’s Bengaluru unit in recent times, a gang which imported gold bars worth over Rs 1,000 crore and evaded Rs 338 crore in customs duty over nearly a three-year period was busted. The Mumbai-based kingpin was nabbed along with his woman associate after an illegal consignment of gold potassium cyanide worth Rs 32 crore was seized at Mumbai airport. DRI sources identified the kingpin as Rajesh, 64, owner of a Mumbai-based chemical industry. They said he was bringing in gold bars from the Gulf by misusing the import duty exemption option of the advance authorisation scheme under Foreign Trade Policy. The scheme provides for exemption from import duty for materials that are used in manufacture of goods exclusively for the export market. ‘He circumvented scheme’“Rajesh smartly used the government scheme to bring in gold bars from Dubai and instead of melting and using them to make gold potassium cyanide as per the exemption condition, he began selling the bars to illegal dealers. He entered into a secret pact with a relative in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, who would export the gold potassium cyanide to the Gulf, claiming it would be used in manufacture of electronics and heavy machinery,” said an investigating officer. With Bengaluru DRI recently receiving specific intelligence inputs that a Mumbai-based gang with possible links in south India had managed to bring in 2,400kg of gold bars into the country without paying a single rupee in import duty, a team was formed and probe commenced. “We were stunned by the modus operandi of the fraudsters as gold bars worth over Rs 1,000 crore legally imported were being illegally diverted to gold dealers. The so-called end-product, gold potassium cyanide, was separately mixed in Gandhinagar to be exported to Dubai as a legal product, which was sent back to India via Indonesia using the ASEAN India Free Trade Agreement attracting duty exemption,” explained a Bengaluru DRI investigator. Bengaluru DRI sleuths along with their Mumbai counterparts seized an export consignment of 100kg of gold potassium cyanide at the Mumbai air cargo complex on Friday. Rajesh and his aide were arrested on Saturday on charges of running the illegal operations since late 2018 and amassing crores of rupees in profit, sources added. Further probe is under way into Rajesh’s links in south India, mainly with illegal gold dealers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/gold-importers-evaded-338cr-in-customs-duty-kingpin-held/articleshow/84358774.cms||Petlee Peter
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Record organ pledges after actor Sanchari Vijay’s death||BENGALURU: The decision of late actor Sanchari Vijay’s family to give his vital organs to struggling patients last month has boosted cadaveric organ donation in Karnataka that had slowed down because of the pandemic. In 20 days, the State Organ Transplant and Tissues Organization (SOTTO) has received 230 pledges from people who want to make a difference even after their death. This is the highest number of pledges recorded in a month, said Lijamol Joseph, chief transplant coordinator, SOTTO. In the same period, six cadaveric transplants have taken place in the state. SOTTO, earlier known as Jeevasarthakathe, has now created a QR code that would-be donors can scan to access its website and register their pledge. “To reach out to as many people as possible, we have come up with this QR code. There has been a huge response after Vijay’s organs were donated,” Joseph said, adding that the gesture of the national awardwinning actor’s family had helped raise awareness. Vijay, who had met with an accident, was declared brain dead on June 15. His liver, kidneys, heart valves and corneas were transplanted to needy patients in Bengaluru hospitals. This was the year’s 26th cadaveric organ donation. Vijay’s younger brother, Siddesh B, told TOI that the family made the decision amid immense grief. “The doctors explained the option of organ donation to us. His organs were intact, and we went ahead,” he said. “It’s a matter of relief that this has inspired other people to make a pledge.” The SOTTO team has not been able to conduct programmes to create awareness about organ donation because of the Covid-19 crisis. This year, 32 cadaver donations have taken place in the state, and 80 organs and 46 tissues have been transplanted so far. These include nine hearts, 26 livers, 36 kidneys, five lungs, 34 corneas and 12 heart tissues. Two instances involved a kidney and pancreas and one involved liver and kidney being transplanted together. Senior officials of the state health department said that Covid-19 hit the organ transplant process in 2020, when only 35 cadaver donations took place as against 105 in 2019. According to SOTTO’s list, the highest number of registered patients, 3,720, are waiting for kidneys, followed by heart (113), lungs (50) and liver (50). Thirty people require both liver and kidney, 22 heart and lungs, and 19 kidney and pancreas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/surge-in-organ-pledges-after-vijays-death/articleshow/84358130.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Yeshwantpur railway station may get ocean-themed restaurant||BENGALURU: After a tunnel aquarium at KSR Bengaluru City railway station, South Western Railway is planning an ocean-themed restaurant at Yeshwantpur station. Sources said SWR’s Bengaluru division, along with HNi Enterprises, a private firm, is planning to set up a railway aquarium complex at Yeshwantpur. It will have several facilities, including a mini-restaurant. Bengaluru divisional railway manager Ashok Kumar Verma said: “This will be a new concept. But we can’t call it an underwater restaurant. It is more like the one in Singapore where people can eat while enjoying a view of marine animals. Yeshwantpur has enough space but it’s still in the planning stage.” If the plan materialises, Yeshwantpur will be the first railway station in the country to have such a restaurant. Syed Hamid Hassan, managing partner of HNi Enterprises, said: “A proposal has been sent to SWR. The modalities are being worked out, but a final decision is yet to be taken. It will be more interactive and bigger than the existing tunnel aquarium at KSR Bengaluru City railway station.” An SWR official said a 3,735 sqft area at Yeshwantpur has been allotted to the firm. “We have issued Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) to the firm for a tunnel aquarium, fish foot spa and natural paludarium under the New, Innovative Non Fare Revenue Ideas Scheme (NINFRIS). The tenure is for a year and could be extended by another year with DRM approval. The firm also wants a pool pond cafeteria, which is under process,” the official explained. Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation along with the firm opened the tunnel aquarium at KSR Bengaluru City, the first such facility among railway stations in the country, on July 1. “Every day, 250-300 people visit this 12-ft long tunnel aquarium. The entry fee is Rs 25 and we only allow 25 people at a time,” said an IRSDC official. Fish foot spa, drug store at KSR Bengaluru City station IRSDC, which manages KSR Bengaluru City railway station, is planning to come up with a slew of facilities. Officials said they want to replicate the concept of The Quad by BLR, an open-air food & beverage area at Kempegowda International Airport, which also hosts live events. A fish pedicure facility and gaming zone are also being planned. IRSDC will install a Fit India squat kiosk at the station as part of the Centre’s Fit India campaign. “If any passenger manages to complete 30 squats on the machine in 180 seconds, he/she will get a platform ticket for free,” said an official. The station will also get Dawa Dost, a store which will sell generic medicines at discounted rates. “We will set up a food court. The station already has outlets like EatFit and IBrew,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/rly-station-may-get-ocean-themed-restaurant/articleshow/84358808.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Four months on, Byappanahalli railway terminal yet to open||BENGALURU: In March, the country’s first centralised AC railway terminal at Byappanahalli was ready. Four months later, passengers still can’t avail its facilities as South Western Railway hasn’t started services from the terminal. Reason: A formal inauguration is pending. SWR had approached the prime minister’s office through the railway ministry to get PM Narendra Modi to do the honours. However, it is yet to get a confirmation date. Similarly, the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the long-pending suburban rail project is pending, officials said. The recent assembly elections in four states and the second wave of Covid delayed the inauguration, they added. Work on the Sir M Visvesvaraya Terminal, Bengaluru (Byappanahalli third coaching terminal) was supposed to have been completed in December 2018, after it was sanctioned in 2015-16 to help SWR operate more trains from Bengaluru. The Rs 314-crore station building spread over 4,200 sqm will cater to a daily footfall of 50,000. It has seven platforms apart from eight stabling lines and three pit lines. Every day, 50 trains can operate from the terminal. ROB work pendingThe 810m-long rail over bridge proposed in 2010-11 to connect Sir M Visvesvaraya Terminal and Swami Vivekananda Metro station on Old Madras Road is yet to be completed. Work stopped in 2012 after the defence ministry refused to hand over land and resumed seven years later. The project was scheduled for completion by June 2020 but got delayed due to shortage of workers after the pandemic struck. However, SWR officials maintain the ROB is expected to be ready by this month-end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/4-months-on-byappanahalli-railway-terminal-yet-to-open/articleshow/84358835.cms||---

Home, law and parliamentary affairs minister Basavaraj Bommai said the Karnataka government is firm on its decision to implement the Mekedatu project. “There is no question of stalling the project. Since it is a drinking water scheme and excess water is being utilised, Karnataka has every right to take it up,” he added. Stating that Karnataka has already submitted a detailed project report to the Central Water Commission and is awaiting clearance, Bommai urged the Centre to consider the project as per the law. “We are confident that the Centre will do justice to Karnataka by allowing us to take up the project," he said. He also appealed to Tamil Nadu to realise that the project will be beneficial to both states, especially during distress years. “The final award over sharing of Cauvery water has already come and Cauvery Water Management Authority has been set up to monitor the release of water to Tamil Nadu (such being the case, the apprehension that Tamil Nadu will be deprived of its share of water is uncalled for),” he said. KPCC president DK Shivakumar urged the state government to show political will to implement the project, saying his party will extend all cooperation.“We need not have to worry about TN’s opposition. They will continue to pose hurdles to the project even if we wait for 100 years. Your party is in power at the Centre. Make use of it and start the project,” Shivakumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/despite-tn-oppn-state-to-go-ahead-with-mekedatu/articleshow/84358837.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka govt to turn GP libraries into WiFi zones||BENGALURU: In a bid to bridge the digital divide and enhance attendance in online classes, the state government has decided to temporarily convert all 6,000 gram panchayat libraries in the state into educational hubs. The government plans to improve access to gadgets and the internet in rural areas, especially in remote villages, by equipping these libraries with a steady WiFi connection. Children can come to these centres and attend online classes. This comes on the heels of the government saying it will set up ‘mobile banks’ with the help of voluntary organisations, to help students access online classes. On Monday, primary and secondary education minister S Suresh Kumar met with chief secretary P Ravi Kumar and advisors to the state government to discuss possible measures to ensure speedy resolution of the issue as the new academic year is scheduled to begin next month. The discussions revolved around service providers increasing mobile towers in remote locations of the state. Kumar told the chief secretary that deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan and the IT-BT department had already held parleys with private mobile network providers to increase their capacity by installing towers and that an action plan was being prepared. While the state government has been trying to address mobile network issues in remote and hilly regions of the state, it is still falling woefully short of ensuring all children have access to the internet to attend online classes. At the meeting it was decided that the government will look at the possible option of using the libraries at 5,766 locations. Since all libraries, besides the local GP office, are connected under the BharatNet project, the government is looking to install devices to ensure children who have no access to the internet or Doordarshan can come and learn at these libraries. Talks are in the advanced stages and the education department is holding parleys with rural development and gram panchayat officials who have ownership of these libraries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/gp-libraries-to-get-wi-fi-connection/articleshow/84358152.cms||---
---||World||Florida town weighs how to honor lost souls at 'holy site'||SURFSIDE: As crews keep searching for the last missing remains of the souls who perished in their collapsing beachfront condos nearly three weeks ago, the question is swirling across the ruins of the Champlain Towers South: What will become of the ground that bears so much pain? "There's a lot of emotion. People talk about it as a holy site," said Miami-Dade police director Alfredo Ramirez. "People want some sort of connection with their family member." Surfside mayor Charles Burkett suggested Monday that with scores of families still processing their losses, it's too soon to come up with anything specific, but he said the tragedy - now with 94 people confirmed dead and 22 others still missing - compels that something be placed on the site to remember them. "I think the first thing we need to do is get the families situated, so they have a semblance of their life back - get them to the point where they aren't burdened by the grief and emotion that they're going through right now," said Burkett said. "It's obvious that this has become much more than a collapsed building site," Burkett said. "It has become a holy site." An impromptu memorial sprung up along a nearby tennis court, soon after the collapse. The fence is now festooned with drying bouquets and fading photographs of those confirmed dead and those yet to be found. Crosses and candles line the street, and stars of David are interspersed throughout the scene. There are teddy bears, toys, shoes - all in tribute to the scores of victims. Many more personal items have been removed along with twisted steel rebar and shards of concrete, kept in storage for investigators who are gathering clues as to what made 12 stories plunge to the ground on June 24. In time, all of it will be cleared away. What then? Memorials are not unusual after a tragedy, of course. Monuments were erected at the site of the World Trade Center after its twin towers were felled by terrorists, as was a memorial in Oklahoma City. After 1989's Loma Prieta Earthquake in Northern California, memorials popped up across the San Francisco Bay Area. It's a human act to want to remember, said Dovy Ainsworth, whose parents, Tzvi and Itty Ainsworth, died in the Surfside tragedy. "It provides comfort for the families and community while also serving as a reminder ensuring it never happens again," Ainsworth said, suggesting that it might be inappropriate to rebuild because "so many lost their lives." Owners of the demolished complex and its board of directors have yet to formally weigh in on the discussion. Survivors and family members are already suing for civil damages. The beachfront property sits atop valued real estate, which could complicate how things proceed. "It seems indelicate and insensitive to talk about the use of the property other than a memorial," said state senator Jason Pizzo, a Democrat who represents the Surfside area. "It's an incredibly complicated balance to be respectful and honor the memory of those we've lost, while also being diligent to ensure that we help people rebuild their lives (and) to get the greatest value for their homes." Authorities on Monday said they are increasing security along the perimeter to preserve potential evidence and to keep people off the property, however well-intentioned their interests might be. "This is one of those situations where you have the connections of the investigation and a lot of hurt, a lot of pain and a lot of want to make people feel better," said Ramirez, the police commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/florida-town-weighs-how-to-honor-lost-souls-at-holy-site/articleshow/84358728.cms||---

---||World||Pak private schools' association launches anti-Malala documentary||LAHORE: Pakistan's private schools' association on Monday launched a documentary on Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai for her controversial views on Islam, marriage and her pursuit of the Western agenda. Malala, who turned 24 on Monday, was the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize for her struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education. Having received the prize at the age of 17, Malala is the youngest Nobel laureate. She shared the prize with Kailash Satyarthi, a children's rights activist from India. Addressing a press conference at his office in Gulberg here the All-Pakistan Private Schools Federation president Kashif Mirza said: “Through this documentary film - I am not Malala - we will tell 20 million students in 200,000 private schools across the country about her controversial views on Islam, marriage, pursuing of Western agenda." “The idea behind this is we want to expose Malala among the youth as it does not get impressed by her so-called story of struggle for women rights,” Mirza said. He said Malala had advocated "partnership" that is adultery in Islam. “Marriage is a sunnah of the Prophet (pbuh) and partnership is adultery,” he said. 'I am not Malala's Day' is also observed on July 12 in private schools as lectures and seminars are held to expose her western agenda to students. Mirza said Malala has categorically rejected the institution of marriage and suggested that 'partnership' is better than getting married. “Malala has attacked the institution of marriage and family structure by advocating that people should live in sin…No one can justify Muslims living together without marriage as it is strongly condemned in Islam,” he said. Similarly, Mirza said in her book “I am Malala”, the Nobel Peace winner book has highly controversial material in it which is contrary to the teachings of Islam, Quranic injunctions, ideology of Islam and Pakistan's founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah and the Pakistan Army. “This book is written at the behest of western forces that used Malala for their ulterior motives. Malala has declared Islam and Pak army as ‘militant' in her controversial book. She also criticised Quranic verses about two women's testimony to be equal to that of a man and also about the four witnesses in rape case,” he said. Mirza said a group photo with writer Tasleema Nasreen and strong ties with an Indian for Nobel award are enough to explain Malala's designs. Mirza alleged her blog in BBC under the name "Gul Makai" was written by someone else as she could not even read or write by then. “Malala's father Ziauddin had admitted in a TV programme that her blog was written by BBC correspondent Abdul Hai Kakar and the book 'I am Malala' was written by Christina Lamb,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/pak-private-schools-association-launches-anti-malala-documentary/articleshow/84359494.cms||---

---||World||US officials flag "small" reaction risk with J&J vaccine||WASHINGTON: Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine may pose a "small possible risk" of a rare but potentially dangerous neurological reaction, US health officials said Monday.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement it has received reports of 100 people who got the shot developing Guillain-Barre syndrome, an immune system disorder that can cause muscle weakness and occasionally paralysis.  That number represents a tiny fraction of the nearly 13 million Americans who have received the one-dose vaccine. Most cases of the side effect were reported in men - many 50 years old and up - and usually about two weeks after vaccination.  The CDC said it would ask its panel of outside vaccine experts to review the issue at an upcoming meeting. J&J didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  The government said the vaccines most used in the US, made by Pfizer and Moderna, show no risk of the disorder after more than 320 million doses have been administered.  Guillain-Barre syndrome occurs when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks some of its nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis that typically is temporary. An estimated 3,000 to 6,000 people develop the syndrome each year, according to the CDC.  Vaccines historically provide broad protection with little risk but come with occasional side effects just like other drugs and medical therapies. The three Covid-19 vaccines used in the US were each tested in tens of thousands of people, but even such huge studies can't rule out extremely rare side effects.  The CDC and the food and drug administration have been monitoring side effect reports submitted by physicians, drugmakers and patients to a federal vaccine safety database.  Guillain-Barre can be triggered by a number of infections, including flu, cytomegalovirus and Zika virus. But there have been rare cases in which people develop the disorder days or weeks after receiving certain vaccines.  J&J's vaccine was highly anticipated because of its one-and-done formulation and easy-to-ship refrigeration. But early on, it was linked to another rare risk, of blood clots, and the company hasn't been able to produce as much as expected because of problems at a Baltimore factory that helps make the shots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-officials-flag-small-reaction-risk-with-jj-vaccine/articleshow/84359836.cms||---

Kangra district suffered the worst damage: a nine-year-old girl was missing after being swept away by a gushing nullah at Chahdi village in Nagrota sub-division, and another 12 people were missing in Boh valley, Shahpur sub-division. At Bhagsunag, near Dharamshala, several vehicles were washed away by water that roared out of an overflowing local nullah. All tourists are accounted for till now and have been advised to stay put wherever they are as heavy rain is expected on Tuesday too. Landslides caused by heavy rain blocked the Chandigarh-Manali national highway and bypass road. The Manali-Leh highway was also partially blocked due to flash floods at three places. Two houses were partially damaged in Mandi district and one vehicle fell into the Chenab river in Lahaul valley. Electricity supply was also suspended at some places and some link roads were blocked by landslides. Himachal chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said heavy rainfall had caused extensive damage across the state, with Kangra the worst-hit district. He said so far no loss of life had been reported in the state and NDRF teams had been deployed for relief operations. The CM said all DCs and SPs had been directed to remain on alert. In Shahpur sub-division, heavy damage to public and private property was caused by floodwater; around six houses were damaged and about a dozen people were missing after floods hit the area. It is feared that the missing people might be buried in debris but there was no official confirmation. At Bhagsunag, near Dharamshala, people were shocked to see the road turn into a nullah and raging floodwater sweep away many vehicles from the parking lot on Monday morning. At Chaitru, also near Dharamshala, two houses were damaged after a flood in Manjhi khad, and a house was damaged near Shilla chowk. The Kangra administration had to launch a rescue operation that lasted over two hours to save a woman from Jamanabad area after she was trapped on a tree she had climbed for safety as floods covered her paddy fields. The Kangra deputy commissioner, Dr Nipun Jindal, said the damage in Dharamshala and its adjoining areas is being reviewed and teams have been constituted for relief and rehabilitation. He said that till Tuesday all tourists visiting Dharamshala have been instructed by the district administration to postpone their travels for the time being. Tourists already in Dharamshala and its surrounding tourist places have also been advised to stay where they are. Traffic was affected on the Chandigarh-Manali national highway after a massive landslide at 7 Meel, near Mandi. The Mandi-Kullu bypass road via Kataula was also blocked after a landslide near Kannoj village. The national highway (NH-3) had been witnessing landslides and shooting stones since early Monday morning."Landslides and swollen rivers are posing a threat… Machines have been deployed to clear the debris. People are requested to travel only if necessary. Rivers are in spate and the water level can rise anytime due to flash floods in the upper reaches. So people, especially tourists, are requested not to go close to the rivers and nullahs," Kullu SP Gurdev Chand Sharma said. A large number of vehicles had been stuck on the Manali-Leh highway due to flooded nullahs. Floods in Teling nullah, Pagal nullah and Bharatpur nullah have made traffic movement very difficult. Lahaul-Spiti SP Manav Verma said, "The three nullahs were in spate in the morning. Traffic movement was halted for about 4-5 hours at Teling nullah. The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) later cleared the highway. No vehicle is stuck anywhere now. Debris had also blocked the Udaipur-Pangi highway where the BRO had deployed machines. There is a report of a vehicle plunging into the Chenab river. A police team is at the spot." Mandi SDM Rajeev Kumar said five roads were blocked in the district and machines were deployed to restore traffic movement. "Five roads were affected as was the electricity supply in some areas," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/heavy-rains-wreak-havoc-in-himachal-pradesh-highways-blocked/articleshow/84360250.cms||---

(Image credit: Times Now)The Indian army refused to comment on the incident. The intrusion was not regarded as serious but part of the Chinese pin-prick tactics in the region. The Chinese obstruct Indian patrols in parts of Demchok area and this is part of the stalled India-China military talks. The latest incident occurred on July 6 at Doley Tango near Koyul, about 30km southeast of Demchok.

Quoting officials, the reports said the Chinese troops stayed on the Indian territory for about 30 minutes. Chinese irritability over the Dalai Lama has always been pronounced and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to call the Tibetan leader and greet him on his 86th birthday would not have been well-received in Beijing. In a tweet on last Tuesday morning, PM Narendra Modi said, “Spoke on phone to His Holiness the @DalaiLama to convey greetings on his 86th birthday. We wish him a long and healthy life.” The Indian government had also pointedly not wished China on the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party. The Indian and Chinese sides remained engaged in talks that have not progressed after the mutual withdrawal in the Pangong Tso region in Ladakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pla-troops-enter-demchok-fume-at-dalai-lamas-birthday-events/articleshow/84360664.cms||---
---||World||10 dead in South Africa riots over jailing of ex-leader Zuma||JOHANNESBURG: Rioting triggered by the imprisonment of former South African President Jacob Zuma escalated Monday as shopping malls in Johannesburg were looted, major roads were blocked by burning tires and the police and military struggled to contain the violence. President Cyril Ramaphosa, in a somber address broadcast to the nation Monday night, vowed that the police and army would restore order, and he appealed to all South Africans to work together for peace. The unrest started last week in KwaZulu-Natal province after Zuma was imprisoned for contempt of court. What began as fairly small-scale blocking of roads in Zuma's home area intensified and spread to Gauteng, South Africa's most populous province, including Johannesburg, the country's largest city. The South African national defence force has been deployed to help the police. At least 10 people have been killed and more than 490 arrested "in acts of public violence rarely seen in the history of our democracy," Ramaphosa said. Without once mentioning Zuma, Ramaphosa said that the "violence may indeed have its roots in the pronouncements and activities of individuals with a political purpose, and in expressions of frustration and anger ... However, what we are witnessing now are opportunistic acts of criminality, with groups of people instigating chaos merely as a cover for looting and theft." He said the root cause of the rioting is South Africa's high rate of poverty and unemployment. "This moment has thrown into stark relief what we already knew: that the level of unemployment, poverty and inequality in our society is unsustainable," Ramaphosa said. "We cannot expect a lasting and durable peace if we do not create jobs and build a more just and equitable society in which all South Africans can participate freely and equally." He urged all South Africans to refrain from violence. "Together, we will defeat those who seek to destabilize our country," he said. "We will stand as one people, united against violence, unanimous in our commitment to peace and to the rule of law." Earlier Monday, the looting of retail centers broke out in several of the poorer areas of Johannesburg, including Benmore, Jeppestown, Vosloorus, and Soweto, where the Jabulani and Dobsonville malls were hit. Retail stores in Alexandra, east of Johannesburg, were also affected, and journalists covering the riots for the public South African Broadcasting Corporation and news channel Newzroom Afrika were robbed of their equipment. Several malls, car dealerships and retail centers in more affluent areas of Johannesburg, including Rosebank and Kempton Park in eastern Johannesburg, closed early even though they were not directly threatened. In KwaZulu-Natal, people took appliances, including microwave ovens, television sets and clothing from stores in the Mariannhill and Umlazi areas. The violence began last week when Zuma began serving a 15-month sentence for contempt of court. He defied a court order to testify before a state-backed inquiry probing allegations of corruption during his term as president from 2009 to 2018. The Constitutional Court, the country's highest court, began hearing Zuma's appeal on Monday. Police were investigating the deaths - four in Gauteng and two in KwaZulu-Natal, said police colonel Brenda Muridili. The police and national security forces expanded their presence in both provinces to help quell the violence, authorities said. Police have warned that anyone using social media to encourage rioting may be arrested and prosecuted. The way the political protest against Zuma's incarceration turned into wider rioting and looting highlights South Africa's widespread poverty, unemployment and economic disparity, analysts said. Many rioters were just poor, said Susan Booysen, director for research at the Mapungubwe Institute for Strategic Reflection. "It is such a mixed bag because some other people are just taking advantage so they can grab things they could not have before," Booysen said. "There is poverty and inequality. We also know that some are criminals looking to benefit. Often legitimate protests are exploited for that purpose," she said. Ralph Mathekga, a researcher at the University of the Western Cape, agreed that the political demonstration had been overtaken. "South Africa is a very complex nation, and (when) there is protest action, there is no doubt that those will be used opportunistically by criminal elements," Mathekga told the News24 website. "We have to recognize the socio-economic situation of the country. Almost the majority of the country is unemployed," Mathekga said. "Protest action in South Africa, without some form of criminality, is very rare."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/10-dead-in-south-africa-riots-over-jailing-of-ex-leader-zuma/articleshow/84360878.cms||---
---||India||High Covid rates in North East; PM Narendra Modi to meet CMs||NEW DELHI: In the wake of concern over high Covid-19 positivity rate in the northeastern states, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will interact with chief ministers of the eight states of the region on Tuesday to discuss the situation and the measures to control the infection. Even as the overall weekly Covid-19 positivity rate has come down to 2.32%, most states in the northeast have many districts with a positivity rate above 10%. Arunachal Pradesh leads the list with 10 districts above 10% positivity rate while Manipur has nine, Meghalaya six, Assam and Sikkim four each, Tripura three, Mizoram two and Nagaland has one district with over 10% positivity. The continuing high rate of infection in certain states, including those in the NE region as well as rising burden in Kerala and Maharashtra, have also impacted the rate of decline which has slowed down over last three weeks with daily new cases stagnating at an average of around 40,000. The Centre is worried as a similar trend was witnessed before the second wave hit, when cases started rising with states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab and Kerala. The meeting will take place through video conferencing at 11 am. The states that will be part of the meeting are Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tripura, Sikkim, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram. Representatives from health ministry, NITI Aayog, home ministry and other relevant ministries will also be present in the meeting, an official said. While there is a steady decline in overall Covid-19 burden across the country, the northeast region has been a cause of worry, as also Kerala, as the number of cases are either rising or not falling in line with the nationwide trend. Cases are falling in Maharashtra but the infection remains stubborn in some western parts of the state. With total 37,154 new cases reported from across the country on Sunday, the total active caseload in the country stood at around 4.50 lakh cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/high-covid-rates-in-north-east-pm-narendra-modi-to-meet-cms/articleshow/84360942.cms||---
---||India||NDA ally Nitish Kumar opposes population control laws||PATNA: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar said on Monday that merely framing a law would not serve any purpose as far as the issue of population control is concerned. He stressed the need for proper education and awareness among women to achieve the objective. Talking to the media on the sidelines of his ‘Janata ke Darbar Mein Mukhyamantri’ programme, Nitish said he was not concerned about what other states were doing on this front. “My opinion is very clear on this point and it may differ from that of other states,” he said, a reference to the draft bill prepared by the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh. Nitish, whose JD(U) is an ally of the BJP, said what he was saying was based on data collected after various research and surveys in that direction. He said one survey found that the birth rate in Bihar was lower than the national average. He said Bihar’s birth rate was 1.6% compared to the national average of 1.7% in the case of women educated up to the intermediate level. Earlier, the birth rate was 2%, both in the country as well as in Bihar in the case of women who had studied up to the matriculation level. The CM said there was a time when the state’s birth rate was above 4%. “It has been reduced to 3%. This is the result of the government’s initiative in Bihar. I am of the firm belief that the birth rate will start declining in the country by 2040,” he added. The CM, however, added that he didn’t mean that population control laws would not be helpful. “What I mean to say is that education will prove to be a major tool in birth control. At the same time, it will impact all communities,” he said. The CM said there have been instances when even educated people have had many children. “These are exceptions,” he said. Referring to China, Nitish said the people of that country have adopted a policy of having two children only, and that too is being looked into to control the birth rate. A day earlier, senior BJP politician and Union minister Giriraj Singh had stressed the need for population control. Giriraj had said Bihar, too, should make a law in this direction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nda-ally-nitish-kumar-opposes-population-control-laws/articleshow/84361346.cms||Ramashankar

Demonstrators gathered in front of Georgia's parliament in the capital of Tbilisi, then went on to rally in front of the headquarters of the ruling Georgian Dream party. Some threw eggs and paint at the party headquarters building and 12 people were arrested. Cameraman Alexander Lashkarava was found dead in his home Sunday by his mother, according to the TV Pirveli channel he worked for. Lashkarava was one of several dozen journalists attacked last Monday by opponents of an LGBT march that had been scheduled to take place that day in Tbilisi. Organizers of the Tbilisi March For Dignity cancelled the event, saying authorities had not provided adequate security guarantees. Opponents of the march blocked off the capital's main avenue, denounced journalists covering the protest as pro-LGBT propagandists and threw sticks and bottles at them. Lashkarava was brutally beaten, and local TV channels showed him with bruises on his face and blood on the floor around him. Media reports say he sustained multiple injuries and had to undergo surgery but was discharged from a hospital on Thursday. The cause of his death was not immediately clear. Georgia's interior ministry said Monday that Lashkarava could have died of a drug overdose, but his colleagues scoffed at the claim. "I do not trust the Interior Ministry in anything," said Vato Tsereteli, owner of the TV Pirveli channel. Tsereteli tried to meet with lawmakers earlier on Monday but was denied access to the parliament. Animosity against sexual minorities is strong in the conservative Black Sea nation of Georgia. The Tbilisi Pride group said opponents of the planned march were supported by the government and by the Georgian Orthodox Church. One photo reportedly showed a journalist caught in a headlock by an Orthodox priest. Georgia's President Salome Zurabishvili condemned the violence, but Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili alleged the march was organized by "radical opposition" forces that he claimed were led by exiled former President Mikheil Saakashvili.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/georgians-protest-for-2nd-straight-day-over-journalist-death/articleshow/84361388.cms||---

A bench of Justices U U Lalit and Ajay Rastogi deferred the hearing after solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, sought time to file an affidavit. The court also asked attorney general K K Venugopal, who was also issued notice on the petition, to file his response on the issue. Six decades after upholding the constitutional validity of Section 124A of IPC, the apex court had in May agreed to examine whether the verdict needed a re-look and whether the penal provision has lost its relevance in the present condition. The petition has been filed by two journalists who challenged the validity of the penal provision which prescribes punishment of up to life imprisonment. The journalists, who are themselves facing sedition charges for allegedly voicing against political leaders and had to spend months in jail, pleaded that the law had outlived its utility and it was being misused by people in power against those who criticise them. They contended that many countries, including England, which had introduced sedition law in India, have scrapped the penal provision pertaining to the offence of sedition and pleaded the court to re-examine the law in the present context. They alleged that the validity of Section 124A was upheld by the apex court in 1962 as it was the need of the hour to prevent public violence and public disorder that fell short of waging war against the state. "Section 124A, was, at the time a necessary tool in crime control. It is conceivable that if sedition had been held unconstitutional in 1962, there may have been a lacuna in the law, the mischief — public disorder and violence — going unpunished. Contrastingly, in 2021, this is not the case. Alternative, less intrusive legislations are now available. The last nearly sixty years have seen extensive enactment of new legislations dealing directly with safety and security, public disorder and terrorism. Prominent among these are the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, Public Safety Act and the National Security Act. Various sections of these Acts deal directly with the overt conduct that sedition seeks to make penal — inciting violence and public disorder," the petition said. While upholding the validity of Section 124A, a Constitution bench of the apex court in Kedar Nath Singh v. State of Bihar case read down the section and held that acts involving intention or tendency to create disorder, or disturbance of law and order, or incitement to violence would be made penal by Section 124A. Referring to the misuse of Section 124A, the petitioner journalists — Manipur-based 41-year-old Kishorechandra Wangkhemcha and 53-year-old Chhattisgarh-based Kanhaiya Lal Shukla — alleged the number of sedition cases registered across the country doubled from 35 in 2016 to 75 in 2018 but no chargesheets were filed in over 70% of the cases, and only four of the 43 cases where trial has been completed resulted in convictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/clarify-stand-on-plea-against-sedition-supreme-court-to-government/articleshow/84361540.cms||---
---||World||Texas democrats leaving state to stop GOP voting bill||AUSTIN: Democrats in the Texas legislature on Monday began bolting for Washington, DC and said they were ready to remain there for weeks in a second revolt against a GOP overhaul of election laws, forcing a dramatic new showdown over voting rights in America. One large group was set to leave Austin on private planes before the GOP could pass a voting bill in a special legislative session ordered by Republican Governor Greg Abbott that began days ago. It was not immediately clear how many of the 67 democrats in the Texas House of Representatives planned to go, but it was expected to be enough to bring the Legislature to a halt. "This is a now-or-never for our democracy. We are holding the line in Texas,`` said Democratic state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer. "We've left our jobs, we've left our families, we've left our homes. Because there is nothing more important than voting rights in America.'' By leaving, democrats would again deny the GOP majority a quorum to pass bills, barely a month after their walkout thwarted the first push for sweeping new voting restrictions in Texas, including outlawing 24-hour polling places, banning ballot drop boxes and empowering partisan poll watchers. The decision to hole up in Washington is aimed at ratcheting up pressure in the nation's capital on President Joe Biden and Congress to act on voting at the federal level. Biden is due to deliver a major address on the issue Tuesday in Philadelphia, after facing growing criticism for taking what some of the left call too passive a role in the fight. It would mark the first time since 2003 that Texas democrats, shut out of power in the state Capitol for decades, have crossed state lines to break quorum. The drastic move lays bare how democrats are making America's biggest red state their last stand against the GOP's rush to enact new voting restrictions in response to former President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. More than a dozen states this year have already passed tougher election laws but only in Texas have democrats put up this kind of fight. Neither Abbott nor Republican House Speaker Dade Phelan offered public reaction in the hours since word of the trip leaked out Monday, and their offices did not immediately return messages seeking comment. Over the weekend, Texas republicans began advancing measures that also bring back provisions to ban drive-thru voting, add new voter ID requirements to absentee ballots and prohibit local elections officials from proactively sending mail-in ballot applications to voters. Abbott also gave lawmakers a lengthy to-do list this summer heavy on hot-button conservative issues, including restrictions over how race is taught in schools and banning transgender athletes from playing in girls' sports. The agenda is widely opposed by democrats. A first key vote on the new voting measures had been expected this week, hastening their scramble to leave town. The move carries risks and no guarantee of victory in the long run. Abbott, who is up for re-election in 2022, has demanded new election laws in Texas and could keep calling 30-day special sessions until a bill is passed. He also punished democrats after their May walkout by vetoing paychecks for roughly 2,000 Capitol employees, which will begin taking effect in September unless the legislature is in session to restore the funding. Staying away for an extended time could also carry repercussions in next year's midterm elections, although many Texas democrats are already expecting a difficult cycle in 2022, particularly with republicans set to begin drawing new voting maps this fall that could cement their majorities. But for weeks, democrats have signaled they were ready to draw a line. Adding to their anger: A Houston man who gained attention last year after waiting more than six hours to cast a ballot was arrested on illegal voting charges, and put in jail one day before the special session began Thursday. Attorneys for Hervis Rogers say that the 62-year-old did not know that his being on parole for a felony burglary conviction meant he wasn't allowed to vote. How republicans respond next will be a major test of their resolve. Phelan told Austin television station KXAN last week that "all options are on the table'' if democrats revolt a second time but did not elaborate. When democrats last fled the state two decades ago, in a failed attempt to stop new GOP-drawn voting maps, state troopers were deployed to bring them back. State Sen. Bryan Hughes, the author of both GOP attempts to pass election changes in Texas, said over the weekend that the legislation had become "bitterly partisan.'' He defended the new version, which leaves out contentious attempts to ban Sunday morning early voting and make it easier for judges to overturn an election. "Your ballot is sacrosanct,'' Hughes said while introducing a bill Saturday. "Everything else in the election process should be bathed in sunshine.'' Last week, Vice President Kamala Harris announced $25 million in new spending by the Democratic National Committee on actions to protect voting access ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. Biden and his team are stressing ongoing legal efforts to safeguard voting rights. They've also promised a major legislative push after Senate republicans blocked a sweeping election overhaul last month. The president has told reporters he plans on "speaking extensively'' on voting rights and that he would be "going on the road on this issue.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/texas-democrats-leaving-state-to-stop-gop-voting-bill/articleshow/84360508.cms||---

Jnanabharati police on Sunday arrested Indiramma, 40, and her lover Rajashekhar, 37, for allegedly murdering Ranjitha on Saturday. Ranjitha, who is from Bidar, lived in a rental house in Jnanajyothinagar near Jnanabharathinagar with her husband Omkar and brother-in-law Nirankar, both employees of private firms. Nirankar found Ranjitha lying in a pool of blood in the hall at 4.30pm on Saturday when he returned home. The woman was stabbed in the neck and her throat was slit. Both her ears had been cut off and were found in the washroom. The killers had kept a knife in the woman’s right hand before fleeing. Police took up a case of murder and Sanjeev M Patil, deputy commissioner of police (west), formed three teams, each headed by inspectors of Jnanabharati, Annapoorneshwarinagar and Chandra Layout police stations. Ranjitha stayed on the first of the two-floor building. Police enquired with residents of the building and found the behaviour of Indiramma, who lived on the ground floor, unnatural. Police picked her up for questioning on Sunday and she confessed to the crime. Police detained her accomplice Rajashekhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/woman-lover-kill-neighbour-for-gold-chain/articleshow/84357227.cms||---

Backing JD(S) MLAs, Shivakumar insisted that there are no reports of illegal mining since the time he was Mandya district in-charge minister during the previous JD(S)-Congress coalition government. “Mining is happening 15-20km away from the dam; it does not make any difference. It is not good to create panic among the public,’’ he said.  Siddaramaiah, who is touring Badami constituency in north Karnataka, on Monday called for an inquiry after verifying the facts. “She has made allegations that JD(S) leaders are carrying out illegal mining, endangering the safety of KRS dam. The matter should be probed,” he said. Former JD(S) minister CS Puttaraju said he will welcome a complete ban on mining at Baby Betta if it is scientifically proven that such activities are endangering the reservoir. “The safety of the dam must be a priority to all of us (mining unit owners). We are ready to give up mining if the government confirms the damage,” he added. Sumalatha meets NiraniSumalatha met mines and geology minister Murugesh Nirani and requested him to survey stone quarries in Mandya and act against those involved in illegal mining. Nirani later said he would visit the mining areas this week and take action against mine owners and officials if they are found guilty. He said measures have been taken to curb stone quarrying in and around Baby Betta while 38 licences have been cancelled. Minister KC Narayana Gowda said he would discuss with the CM and bring in a blanket ban on mining in Baby Betta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/dks-says-no-illegal-mining-siddaramaiah-calls-for-probe/articleshow/84357232.cms||---

India recorded nearly 2.9 lakh new Covid cases in July 5-11, a drop of 5.5% from the previous week, when over 3 lakh infections were detected.   This was the smallest decline in weekly cases since the second wave peaked in the country. The previous week (June 28-July 4) had seen a fall of 11.4% while the week prior to that had posted a dip of 18.6%. Read AlsoHigh Covid rates in North East; PM Narendra Modi to meet CMsEven as the overall weekly Covid-19 positivity rate has come down to 2.32%, most states in the northeast have many districts with a positivity rate above 10%. Arunachal Pradesh leads the list with 10 districts above 10% positivity rate while Manipur has nine, Meghalaya six, Assam and Sikkim fourThe slowing down of the decline is worrying as India is still averaging more than 40,000 cases per day. Last week’s average was 41,256 while in the previous week it was 43,668.   The main reason for the continuing high numbers, relatively speaking, is the persistence of the infection in pockets of the country. Kerala, which posted the highest count of new cases last week at 91,652, saw an 8.1% increase in infections. This was the second straight week of rising cases in the state.

The girl died at Heber Valley Hospital on Friday night, the Wasatch County sheriff's office said. The child's name was not released. Christopher O'Connell, 34, was arrested Saturday on suspicion of manslaughter and is facing other drugs and weapons charges. Two other men, Colin Howells, 36, and Trever Pinter, 21, were also arrested over alleged crimes not directly related to the girl's death. Police found O'Connell near the apartment in Heber City after the shooting, according to police records. Detectives said his speech was slurred and he had a handgun. Howells and O'Connell were inside Pinter's neighboring apartment Friday night, according to arrest documents. Officers found a bullet hole in the wall of the apartment that continued into the girl's apartment, documents said. Detectives spoke to two women who say Howells and O'Connell sexually assaulted them in Pinter's apartment. The women also said they saw O'Connell pull out a gun and wave it around and asked him to put it away. According to police documents, Howells told officers that he had consumed alcohol and prescription medication that night. O'Connell has been convicted for driving under the influence at least three times, KSL TV reported. Howells was also convicted in a drunken incident in 2016 and was charged with a DUI in January. Pinter and Howells were released on bail. O'Connell was ordered to be held without bail. It was not immediately known if the three suspects had an attorney who could comment on their behalf.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/3-men-arrested-in-fatal-shooting-of-7-year-old-girl-in-utah/articleshow/84361864.cms||---
---||India||Mars, Venus set to align today, will be visible with naked eye||NEW DELHI: Skygazers are in for a treat as Mars and Venus— two of the Earth’s closest neighbours — will come closest to each other in the sky on Tuesday. The people would thus have a chance to watch these planets with the naked eye. This unique phenomenon is part of planetary conjunction as such conjunction takes place when two planets appear to have come closer, while in reality they remain far away. "Mars and Venus are passing close to each other in the sky and will be only 0.5 deg (as wide as the size of the Moon) on July 13. This is a naked eye event, so go out and see them", Bengaluru-based Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) tweeted recently. The "celestial kiss" of Mars and Venus will become visible about 45 minutes after sunset under clear weather conditions in the western horizon. The two planets will initially stand 16° above the western horizon and then sink below it 1 hour and 42 minutes after the Sun. Skygazers can spot Venus a bit earlier. Before Tuesday’s celestial event, the Moon passed closest to the two planets on Monday. After Tuesday’s event, the next Venus-Mars conjunction will occur on February 22, 2024. The last conjunction between the two happened on August 24, 2019 but the planets were only 3° from the Sun and were therefore not visible from the Earth. The most recent visible pairing happened on October 5, 2017. The rare celestial event can be viewed from anywhere in India in clear skies. Soon after the Mars-Venus conjunction, astronomers may be able to watch through powerful telescopes Pluto on July 17 when the dwarf planet will reach opposition (it will lie opposite to the Sun). It means the Earth will be positioned between Pluto and the Sun, and the dwarf planet makes its closest approach to the Earth (called its perigee), making it appear at its brightest. From Delhi, it is likely to be visible between 9.27 pm and 3.38 am under clear weather conditions on Saturday. Last year on the night of December 21, skygazers were delighted to watch the great conjunction of bright planets Jupiter and Saturn.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mars-venus-set-to-align-today-will-be-visible-with-naked-eye/articleshow/84362010.cms||Surendra Singh

Last month, President Joe Biden withdrew a series of executive orders issued by former President Donald Trump in August that sought to ban new downloads of WeChat and TikTok and ordered a new review. The commerce department formally withdrew the orders that sought to bar the apps last month.

Raising concern over governments and people being complacent and engaging in mass gatherings without following Covid-19 protocols, IMA said these events are potential super spreaders for a third wave. “Tourist bonanza, pilgrimage travel, religious fervour, all are needed, but can wait for a few more months,” the association said on Monday. Times ViewThe coronavirus continues to stalk and kill. At this juncture, does it make any sense to allow Kanwar yatra, which can potentially be a super spreader event? It seems the authorities are unwilling to learn from the harsh lessons of the Kumbh Mela. Courts should take suo moto notice of this.“Opening up these rituals and enabling people without vaccination to go scot-free in these mass gatherings are potential superspreaders for the Covid third wave,” the IMA said. The statement comes on a day when the annual Rath Yatra began in Puri and there are discussions about allowing the kanwar yatra in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ima-warns-of-third-covid-wave-says-pilgrimages-and-tourism-can-wait/articleshow/84362176.cms||---

"Health crews carried charred bodies out of the burning hospital while many patients were coughing from the rising smoke," a Reuters reporter at the site of the fire site said. State run Iraq News Agency cited health ministry officials as saying that search operations at the al-Hussain coronavirus hospital were continuing after the fire was brought under control. "Raging fires have trapped many patients inside the coronavirus ward and rescue teams are struggling to reach them," a health worker told Reuters before entering the burning building. Initial police reports suggested that an oxygen tank explosion inside the hospital's Covid-19 ward was the likely cause of the fire, a policeman at the scene of the fire said. Health sources said the death toll could rise as many patients were still missing. Two health workers were among the dead, they said. In April, a fire caused by an oxygen tank explosion at a Covid-19 hospital in Baghdad took at least 82 lives while 110 people were also injured. Already decimated by war and sanctions, Iraq's healthcare system has struggled to cope with the coronavirus crisis, which has killed 17,592 people and infected more than 1.438 million.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/at-least-39-killed-20-injured-in-coronavirus-hospital-fire-in-iraq-police-medics/articleshow/84362107.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka ramps up medical infrastructure for third wave||BENGALURU: Ahead of a possible third wave of Covid-19 infections, which some experts say could hit in the last quarter of the calendar year, the state government has drawn up a plan to ramp up facilities in government hospitals across the state to tackle a possible surge in cases. “Though some experts believe the third wave will not be as deadly as the second, we are not taking any chances,” said KV Trilok Chandra, state health commissioner. “We are preparing for the worst by doubling the number of beds and augmenting oxygen capacity.” The government plans to add an additional 3,249 ICU beds and 8,315 oxygenated beds in district and taluk hospitals. With lessons learnt from the second wave, health authorities plan to increase availability of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) in district and taluk hospitals to avoid incidents like the one that occurred in Chamarajanagar, where 24 people reportedly died due to shortage of oxygen. “We have decided to boost oxygen capacity by 1,123 kilo liters in the state. We are setting up new oxygen generation plants and procuring oxygen cylinders and concentrators to avoid shortages,” Chandra said. The government is also focusing on stocking up on essential drugs and equipment such as BiPAP and x-ray machines. “The department will also hire paediatricians and support staff to run centres,” a senior health officer said. Experts have suggested that the third wave could affect children more and therefore the state is ramping up facilities to treat those below 18 years of age. “About 3,000 extra beds for children will be added and childrenfriendly wards are being created,” officials said. “The number of paediatric ventilators will also be increased to 1,000. The focus will also be on improving the 3Ts – testing, tracking and treatment. Since supply of drugs like remdesivir and tocilizumab were erratic during the second wave, we have decided to procure all essential drugs in advance.” The government has already recruited nearly 1,700 doctors and over 500 nurses to ensure adequate staff. “Since some ventilators were faulty, we are focusing on repairing them,” said a senior doctor from the medical education department. Health experts said that if people do not adhere to safety protocols such as wearing masks and ensuring social distancing, a third wave is bound to hit sooner rather than later. “Given the shortage of vaccines besides people’s complacency after Unlock 3.0, a third wave may arrive in August or September,” said Dr M Kaverappa, a retired government doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-ramps-up-med-infra-for-third-wave/articleshow/84362695.cms||ManuAiyappa Kanathanda
---||World||US senate returns for 'hell of a fight' over Biden infrastructure plan||WASHINGTON: The US Senate returned on Monday to one of it's most ambitious agendas in years as Democratic President Joe Biden seeks trillions of dollars in infrastructure spending and Republicans promise "a hell of a fight" against raising taxes to pay for it. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer opened the senate following a two-week July Fourth recess, saying progress was being made on both a bipartisan $1.2 trillion infrastructure plan and the first step toward another measure that would pass with only Democratic votes. But given the 50-50 split in the senate, it was uncertain whether the Democratic leader can fulfill his goal of passing both measures by sometime in August. "If and when we succeed, the benefits will reverberate across the country for generations to come," Schumer said. Last week, Schumer's Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell, promised a "hell of a fight" over the partisan, Democratic initiative while leaving open the possibility of his support for the emerging bipartisan bill. Negotiators were still discussing ways to finance the latter measure's $1.2 trillion price tag according to lawmakers and congressional aides. Adding to the complexity, Congress could get embroiled in a potentially divisive debate over raising the statutory limit on US borrowing authority, which expires at the end of July. While the treasury department is expected to be able to manage for several weeks beyond the July 31 deadline, global financial markets will become increasingly jittery about a potential US default on its debt the longer the matter is unresolved. Democrats control both chambers of Congress by razor-thin margins and can afford to lose only a few votes in the House of Representatives and none in the Senate if they are to succeed. They view the overall infrastructure package as potentially the most important legislation to push through before next year's elections, which will determine control of Congress for the second half of Biden's four-year term. The bipartisan deal would pay for rebuilding roads, bridges and other traditional infrastructure projects and bring broadband internet service to more rural areas. It got a boost last week from the "Problem Solvers Caucus," a group of Democratic and Republican lawmakers. McConnell said there was "a decent chance" the bipartisan bill could gain traction but warned the spending must somehow be financed without adding to the national debt. Speaking at public events in his home state of Kentucky last week, McConnell saved his grim assessments for tax hikes in the other infrastructure legislation Democrats are expected to produce in addition to the bipartisan bill. "This is going to be a hell of a fight. This is not the right thing to do for the country," McConnell warned as he attacked Biden's plans for possible tax increases on corporations and the wealthy to help finance the cost of some infrastructure investments. One measure, to be hammered out sometime before the start of the August recess, would simply provide the technical framework for ramming through the Senate (without Republican support) a second, bigger infrastructure measure. That Democrats-only plan would require a maneuver that skirts Senate rules requiring 60 votes to pass most legislation. The large package is set to be the final major piece of Biden's first-year legislative dreams: a partisan "human infrastructure" bill in the fall to invest huge sums to confront climate change, while also expanding education opportunities across the United States and home healthcare for the elderly and others. McConnell has attacked these initiatives and is hoping to generate opposition from some moderate Democrats. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, a leading liberal, is looking for up to $6 trillion in new investments, while other, more moderate Democrats on his panel want less. Corporate lobbyists, in concert with Republicans, already were laying plans to thwart the initiative, arguing that tax increases would hurt a US economy emerging from the rubble of the Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, Democrats of all political stripes will try to attach provisions important to their constituents. Progressives demand turning a temporary expansion of a child tax credit into a permanent benefit. And, lawmakers from heavily Democratic states with high taxes insist that a cap on state and local tax deductions, which was included in a 2017 Republican tax law, be eased. Given Democrats' razor-thin majorities in Congress, party leaders in both chambers will have to pay attention to every one of their members' demands or risk losing enough support for passage of any of these bills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-senate-returns-for-hell-of-a-fight-over-biden-infrastructure-plan/articleshow/84362539.cms||---

The mix-up in the new minister’s verified status on Twitter (through the blue tick) happened after he changed his username on the platform from @rajeev_mp to @Rajeev_GoI. The change of username, as per Twitter policy, may lead to loss of verified badge. “As explained in the Twitter verification policy, if an account holder changes their username, Twitter may automatically remove the blue verified badge from an account… We are in touch with the minister’s office and worked swiftly to restore the verified blue badge,” the company said when contacted on the issue. As the matter came to light during the day, online chatter started getting louder on whether Twitter’s action could be linked to the company’s strained relations with the government, which have escalated after the introduction of the new IT Rules. However, through a swift resolution of the issue, Twitter – which is now showing willingness to abide by the new regulations – appeared to make it clear that there was no link between its regulatory issues and the removal of the blue tick. The latest incident, however, comes weeks after Twitter had briefly blocked the account of previous IT and law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad over violation of an American copyright law in one of his tweets. The same law was also blamed for a similar (brief) action on the account of senior Congress leader and chairman of the standing committee on IT Shashi Tharoor whose account was also locked temporarily for a tweet that carried a copyrighted video of BoneyM song “Rasputin”. Such actions are rather not rare with Twitter, which has often been accused of being high-handed and opaque after making sudden and controversial changes to the accounts of the powerful. In November 2020, Union home minister Amit Shah’s account was temporarily locked, and his display picture removed in response to a “report from the copyright holder”. The action was reversed almost immediately, and the company had called it an “inadvertent error”. In June this year, Twitter had also removed the ‘blue tick’ verification of VP Venkaiah Naidu’s personal account, and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and some senior Sangh functionaries. The action was soon reversed after a hue and cry from Sangh and BJP leaders. Twitter said the decision was prompted due to no activity in the accounts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/twitter-nixes-then-restores-verified-status-of-junior-it-ministers-account/articleshow/84362737.cms||Pankaj Doval

Michael Curzio, who has been locked up since January 14, is the first of more than 500 people charged with federal crimes in the Capitol attack to be sentenced to time behind bars. He was sentenced to six months after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge, but gets credit for the time already served and will be released on Wednesday. Curzio was arrested in Summerfield, Florida, for the January 6 riot less than two years after he was released from a Florida prison in 2019 after serving an eight-year sentence for attempted murder. Court records from Florida show that he shot the boyfriend of his former girlfriend in a fight at her home. Prosecutors pointed to his criminal record to keep him behind bars after his January arrest even though he faced only misdemeanor charges in the riot. Authorities wrote in court documents that Curzio was part of a violent white supremacist gang called the Unforgiven when he was behind bars in Florida and has tattoos with Nazi imagery. On January 6, Curzio was part of a crowd near the door to the House atrium that refused orders to leave, authorities say. His attorney said Monday that his sentence was "harsher than it should have been" because of his criminal record. "He didn't attack anybody. He didn't break anything. He was just walking around the building like a lot of other people were," attorney A Eduardo Balarezo said in an interview. Curzio's lawyer wrote in court documents arguing for his release from jail that his client joined the Unforgiven "in order to survive in prison" after being attacked several times by other inmates. His lawyer wrote that Curzio is no longer associated with the gang but doesn't have the funds to remove the tattoos. "It is notable that on January 6, 2021, Mr. Curzio did not go to the Capitol in the company of any gang members; he did not wear any gang colors; he did not give a Nazi salute; he did not have any posters with Nazi insignias. In short, his presence at the Capitol had nothing to do with his prior gang affiliation," Balarezo wrote in April. Curzio is the second defendant to be sentenced for the January 6 riot. The first person to be sentenced is an Indiana woman who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building. She was ordered to serve three years of probation, perform 120 hours of community service and pay $500 in restitution. More than a dozen defendants have pleaded guilty, including two members of the Oath Keepers militia group who admitted conspiring with other extremists to block the certification of Joe Biden's victory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/man-tied-to-violent-prison-gang-pleads-guilty-in-january-6-riot/articleshow/84362734.cms||---

Over 200 Indians, a large majority of them students, were stranded at Belgrade airport on Sunday for hours on end till the Indian embassy came to their rescue. On Sunday night (in India), photographs of the stranded Indians made their way to social media. “Help! There are 300-400 Indian students, citizens stuck with children at Belgrade airport. Everyone has connecting flights to somewhere but the police are asking for seven-day mandatory quarantine. We can’t, all are exhausted and hungry,” tweeted RealNick05. Later, the embassy said 120 of the stranded Indians managed to leave by Lufthansa. “Indians travelling by other airlines will fly today or tomorrow (Monday-Tuesday). Embassy officials are in touch with airport authorities, airlines to ensure departure of all Indians,’’ it tweeted. In the past two months, Belgrade had turned into a popular transit halt for Indians going to countries like Canada, US, Saudi Arabia and UAE that had banned direct entry of passengers from India, said Bhushan Kamble of Akbar travels. People travelling from India to Canada, for instance, would stay for three days in Belgrade, take an RT-PCR report as Canada doesn’t accept reports from Indian labs, and continue their journey. However, the transit-in-Belgrade plan collapsed on Friday after Serbia notified the seven-day mandatory quarantine. While the problem of the over 200 stuck at the airport has been resolved, those who have plans to travel via Belgrade in the immediate future are fretting. Budding chess player Kabir has his first match in Serbia on Saturday (July 17) and accordingly booked tickets to reach Belgrade with his father a day before on Friday (July 16). Now the quarantine means he misses a few matches. “I was invited to participate in four chess events in different Serbian cities between July 17 and August 12. Just a few days before I was scheduled to leave, fresh quarantine conditions have been imposed. Now, I fear missing at least the first event on July 17,” said Kabir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/serbia-curbs-checkmate-desi-travellers/articleshow/84362818.cms||Manju V

The US-made J&J vaccine, which requires only one dose for full protection, is part of the UN-backed COVAX program that is shipping coronavirus vaccines to poor countries to help combat the global pandemic. After the vaccine arrived in Chisinau, President Maia Sandu wrote online: "I urge you to get vaccinated. The danger of getting sick hasn't passed yet, and life and health are priceless." Sandu thanked the US for the donation and said the vaccine will "help save lives" and "reduce the force of the pandemic." Moldova, which is Europe's poorest nation landlocked between Ukraine and Romania, has so far administered more than 800,000 vaccine doses. But only 313,000 people have received the necessary doses to be fully inoculated against the coronavirus - about 11% of the country's 3.5 million people. The first J&J batch arrived a day after a snap parliamentary elections in Moldova that saw the pro-reform Party of Action and Solidarity decisively win with nearly 53% of the votes, against 27% for its rival bloc of Communists and Socialists. The pro-Western president said Moldovans "must mobilize" and "in solidarity, get vaccinated." The US Embassy in Moldova has said that it has so far donated more than $4 million (euro 3.3 million) of pandemic-related assistance to the small nation. Neighboring Romania has also donated Covid-19 aid to the country. Since the pandemic began, Moldova has reported more than 257,000 coronavirus infections and more than 6,200 deaths from Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/first-batch-of-us-coronavirus-vaccine-arrives-in-moldova/articleshow/84362863.cms||---
---||World||First batch of US coronavirus vaccine arrives in Moldova||BUCHAREST: The first 150,000 doses of a planned 500,000-dose batch of Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine arrived in Moldova's capital Monday as part of a donation from the United States that will help the former Soviet republic tackle the pandemic. The US-made J&J vaccine, which requires only one dose for full protection, is part of the UN-backed COVAX program that is shipping coronavirus vaccines to poor countries to help combat the global pandemic. After the vaccine arrived in Chisinau, President Maia Sandu wrote online: "I urge you to get vaccinated. The danger of getting sick hasn't passed yet, and life and health are priceless." Sandu thanked the US for the donation and said the vaccine will "help save lives" and "reduce the force of the pandemic." Moldova, which is Europe's poorest nation landlocked between Ukraine and Romania, has so far administered more than 800,000 vaccine doses. But only 313,000 people have received the necessary doses to be fully inoculated against the coronavirus - about 11% of the country's 3.5 million people. The first J&J batch arrived a day after a snap parliamentary elections in Moldova that saw the pro-reform Party of Action and Solidarity decisively win with nearly 53% of the votes, against 27% for its rival bloc of Communists and Socialists. The pro-Western president said Moldovans "must mobilize" and "in solidarity, get vaccinated." The US Embassy in Moldova has said that it has so far donated more than $4 million (euro 3.3 million) of pandemic-related assistance to the small nation. Neighboring Romania has also donated Covid-19 aid to the country. Since the pandemic began, Moldova has reported more than 257,000 coronavirus infections and more than 6,200 deaths from Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/first-batch-of-us-coronavirus-vaccine-arrives-in-moldova/articleshow/84362850.cms||---

The tribal heartland is reporting an alarming spike in Covid infections, with the Maoist hotbeds of Sukma and Bijapur topping the charts. To make it worse, vaccination isn’t able to keep pace with the speed of the virus. While the Maoist insurgency and remoteness of large parts of Bastar are hurdles in the vaccination drive, shortage of vaccines is a concern, say officials. On Sunday, 70 (or 37%) of Chhattisgarh’s 188 new cases were from South Bastar. The Centre has sent a team from AIIMS-Raipur to probe the surge and find ways to tackle it. Nearly 40% of Chhattisgarh’s active cases are now in the seven districts of Bastar division. Bijapur leads the table with 554 cases, followed by Sukma (506), Bastar (249), Dantewada (245), Kankeer (140), Kondagaon (104) and Narayanpur (60). Since the outbreak, 668 people have died of Covid in Bastar region, say health officials. Majority of the Bastar deaths have come in the past few months. Maoists have been hit hard as well. Central committee member Haribhushan and his wife are among several insurgent leaders who have died of Covid, say police. In vaccination, the tribal heartland has catching up to do. A little over 1.7 lakh – or 18.4% — of the 23.4 lakh eligible population in Bastar division is fully vaccinated. About 7.6 lakh have taken their first doses, which indicates the pace has been picking up of late. The division’s joint health director Dr Anandram Gota said, “Covid cases began rising after thousands of villagers held protests on May 15 against the killing of three tribal men in a clash with security personnel.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/maoist-hit-bastar-has-now-become-a-covid-hotbed/articleshow/84362855.cms||Cherrupreet Kaur

A senior RJD leader said there have been frequent telephonic conversations between Chirag and party president Lalu Prasad’s younger son and leader of opposition in Bihar legislative assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. “Chirag and Tejashwi do talk to each other over the phone and after the recent split in the LJP. Chirag had also talked to Lalu ji. Both have an old family relation and Chirag treats Lalu ji like his guardian, especially after the death of his father and LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan,” he said. He, however, added that Chirag may not join RJD, but there were chances of an alliance between the two parties in future. RJD national general secretary Shyam Rajak’s meeting with Chirag in Delhi on Saturday had triggered speculation that something was cooking. Though Rajak called it a courtesy meeting. “Milte hain to kuch baat to hoti hi hai,” Rajak told TOI over phone from Delhi but did not reveal the content of their conversation. On the other hand, leaders of both RJD and LJP denied that this meeting had anything to do with Chirag’s telephonic conversation with the RJD first family or immediate political development between the two parties. A close aide of Lalu, Bhola Yadav said Chirag was welcome in his party, adding, “Whatever happened to Chirag was wrong. Chirag is LJP’s future and his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras has never been a mass leader. It was because of Chirag’s father that Paras became an MP." LJP state president Raju Tiwari also accepted that Chirag and Tejashwi talk to each other, especially if any of their family members is ill or any untoward incident happens in the family. However, he said, Chirag’s recent meeting with Rajak had nothing to do with their political plans. “There is no election right now. So, there is no need for any political development. Just wait and watch, at least for a year,” said Raju, adding, “We are on our ‘ashirvaad yatra’ to seek people’s blessings. Our leader has been betrayed by his own relatives.” LJP state spokesperson Ashraf Ansari said, “One will be overwhelmed to see the kind of love Chirag ji is getting from people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rajaks-meeting-with-jamui-mp-rjd-ljp-deny-political-meaning/articleshow/84355531.cms||Sheezan Nezami

AIG hospital authorities, who carried out the survey, said that post-Covid-19 symptoms are seen more in those infected with Covid-19 in the second wave than those in the first wave. Of the total patients, 48% of hospitalised patients and 37.6% of non-hospitalised ones are said to be suffering from post-Covid-19 symptoms. A little over 2,000 people responded to the online survey conducted by the hospital on post-Covid-19 symptoms. “We were seeing many such post-Covid-19 patients in our hospital, but this survey gave us the true picture of this post-Covid-19 syndrome. If this is an indication to go by then we are looking at over 1 crore people in India who have recovered from Covid-19 but are still having certain symptoms,” said Dr D Nageshwar Reddy, chairman, AIG Hospitals. He advised patients to not neglect post-Covid-19 symptoms and seek medical help so that the complications can be treated and further progression can be stopped. The hospital also launched a dedicated post-Covid-19 care clinic on Monday. According to the survey, a total of 992 respondents said that they have either persistent or new symptoms after recovering from Covid-19. As many as 1,399 respondents said that they don’t have any post-Covid-19 symptoms. Of the total respondents with post-Covid-19 symptoms, 614 said that they have weakness/fatigue, 295 have body pains, 246 have digestive issues, 207 have headache, 201 patients reported breathlessness, 132 patients have chest pain, among various other issues. A majority of patients with post-Covid-19 symptoms said that they were not satisfied with the treatment provided for these complications. “It is a growing challenge and needs to be addressed immediately from all relevant stakeholders. We are keeping a close eye on this situation as it unfolds. It will be important to see what newer protocols will be required to treat patients with post-Covid-19 symptoms and it is our cumulative responsibility to help in this regard,” said Narsing Rao, principal secretary to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, adding that he will recommend starting post-Covid-19 care in government hospitals as well. AIG clinic, touted to be India’s first dedicated post-Covid care clinic, will comprise a multi-disciplinary team of experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/40-patients-suffering-post-covid-symptoms/articleshow/84357522.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

A letter in this regard was issued to JD(U) MP Alok Kumar Suman by former Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri on July 2. Earlier, the Gopalganj MP had requested Puri to begin flight operations from the Sabeya airstrip under the UDAN scheme. Suman told this newspaper over the phone from New Delhi on Monday that the airstrip in Gopalganj was last used in 1968. “I will talk to the officials concerned for upgradation and renovation of the Sabeya airstrip so that commercial flight operations can begin soon,” he added. According to Puri’s letter, no airline has submitted a proposal to operate commercial flights from Gopalganj yet. Suman said, “As soon as some airlines show interest in launching flights from the Sabeya airstrip under the UDAN scheme, a civil enclave will be developed there. International flights may also operate from there in future.” He added, “Launching flights from Gopalganj will be beneficial for the people of north Bihar and neighbouring districts in Uttar Pradesh.” The Sabeya airstrip is a military airport, which is under the control of the Union ministry of defence. It was built in 1868 during the British rule and is spread over an area of 571 acres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sabeya-airport-is-part-of-udan-scheme-mp/articleshow/84354803.cms||Faryal Rumi

According to sources, the serving teachers are supposed to get their salaries in the revised UGC scale with effect from January, 2016 and the retired ones from April, 2017. Since the actual payment of revised salaries and pensions began from a later period, all teachers are to be paid the arrears. Although the government had sanctioned funds to the universities in March last year, they were subsequently stopped from making the payment before verification of the fixation of revised pay of individual teachers by the education department. Even if the pay fixation of most working and retired teachers has been verified now, they are yet to get their arrears. Expressing concern over the inordinate delay in payment of revised gratuity, the former head of the English department in Patna University (PU), Shiva Jatan Thakur, told this reporter that the education department had failed to guarantee the equal protection of law to the university teachers. In yet another instance of “injustice”, more than 50 PU teachers, who had retired during April 2017 and March 2019, have been denied payment of arrears of their gratuity and leave encashment in the revised scale. However, all the teachers, who had retired after March 2019, received the revised gratuity and earned leave encashment. The general secretary of Patna University Teachers’ Association, Abhay Kumar, pointed out, “None of the teachers, who was appointed by the BPSC during 2017-2019, has received the arrears of their salaries revised in the seventh scale. Similarly, more than 150 teachers, who had joined the university in 1996 and 2003, are yet to get the arrears of their pay revised in the sixth scale.” Kanhaiya Bahadur Sinha, who is the working president of the Federation of University Teachers’ Associations of Bihar, blamed the “mandarins in the state education department for creating roadblocks in payment of arrears”. “When the universities had just started making the payments last year, the government came out with a new circular,” he said. However, education minister, Vijay Kumar Choudhary, claimed, “Due to the fiscal crunch amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the education department did not get its full budgetary allocations. However, steps will soon be taken for releasing necessary funds to the universities for payment of arrears.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/delay-in-payment-of-arrears-worries-thousands-of-university-teachers-in-bihar/articleshow/84355697.cms||B K Mishra
---||Delhi||As traffic crawls, commuters spend longer hours on road||New Delhi: Traffic conditions in the city took a turn for the worse after heavy rains on Tuesday. Lengthy traffic jams were reported at ITO, Minto Road, Pul Prahladpur, Dwarka, Najafgarh, Dhaula Kuan and Vikas Marg, among others. The other spots where waterlogging was reported were AIIMS, Mehrauli-Badarpur Road in south Delhi, Som Vihar and Ring Road. There was heavy traffic at Bhikaji Cama Place and Azadpur as well. “I hadn’t expected such a bad situation on the roads because it wasn’t raining as heavily when I left home,” said Ashwini Kumar, who regularly commutes on the Dhaula Kuan stretch. “I think the traffic has worsened in the months since the pandemic because I never encountered so many cars on the roads in the pre-Covid era. I was an hour late for work.” Many others too were late for office, and many of them posted about their plight on social media platforms. Quite a few even sought the help of traffic police. “Though the waterlogging wasn’t as bad, the problem was compounded by people avoiding any part of the road with even the smallest puddle. They drive on this road every day but are circumspect on rainy days,” said an irked commuter on Vikas Marg. Nikhil reported that some ambulances were stranded on GT Karnal Road because of heavy traffic and police barricades on the stretch from Alipur to Bypass Road. PWD officials said only minor waterlogging complaints were reported during the day. However, they conceded that major traffic jams were reported in the city due to rain-affected roads. They argued that this was usually the case during the rainy season and claimed to have been working closely with the traffic police to prevent any mishap on the city roads. Tanushree, a college student who had her first exam on Tuesday, said she was barely in time for her test. “There was a power cut in Janakpuri, so I was heading to a friend’s house in the Connaught Place area this morning when it suddenly started raining very heavily,” said Tanushree. “I took at least an hour and a half extra than usual to reach the place. Then, I had to start writing my exam as soon as I reached the centre. I was almost exempted from sitting for the test due to the delay caused by the rains.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-traffic-crawls-commuters-spend-longer-hours-on-road/articleshow/84391146.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

Most colleges and postgraduate departments of different universities were humming with activities with the enthusiastic participation of boys and girls in academics. Even though the attendance of students was not very encouraging on the first day, it is likely to pick up in a day or two. Moreover, several local colleges have decided to continue with the online classes in theory papers and conduct only practical classes in offline mode. The syllabi of most undergraduate and postgraduate students in Patna University have already been completed through online classes and most of them are awaiting announcement of their examination schedules. However, a number of boys and girls were found making anxious inquiries about their time table of theory and practical classes on the basis of 50% students’ participation. They were wearing masks even though social distancing was not visible at all the places. Interestingly, colleges witnessed much greater footfalls of girls as compared to the boys. Magadh Mahila College principal Shashi Sharma said each class was divided into two halves and classes were held for them by different teachers. Not even 50% girls attended the classes on the first day. She clarified that only those classes were held offline in which some topics were still to be covered. In science subjects, batch and unit wise practical classes in different subjects have been started to maintain social distancing, she said. Sharma said the college has decided to hold mock tests of three hours in different classes to familiarize the girls with the examination techniques in face-to-face mode. In fact, most of these girls have attended only online classes till date after their admissions, she said. Patna College principal Ashok Kumar admitted that only a few students had turned up on Monday. A few classes in subjects like Urdu and Maithili were held but the attendance was very thin. He asserted that the guidelines issued by the education department as well as the instructions issued by PU are being followed strictly. No gathering of students at any point is allowed and the entire campus has been thoroughly cleaned and sanitized, he added. B N College principal Raj Kishore Prasad said the students preferred to attend classes online. Even though the college has notified commencement of practical classes in offline mode, not a single student turned up on Monday, he said. In J D Women’s College, a large number of girls turned up on the opening day. Some classes were also held with 50%attendance. Smaller classes were held in offline mode. “Not a single student was allowed to enter the campus without masks and they were also encouraged to get themselves inoculated at the vaccination camp inside the college,” college principal Shyama Roy said. Students were seen attending classes in offline mode with great enthusiasm at College of Commerce, Arts and Science. The college appeared to be quite clean and no crowd of students was seen at any one place. Those students who have not been inoculated for Covid as yet were asked by the teachers to get it done at the college vaccination camp itself, said psychology teacher Dinesh Kumar Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/college-resume-offline-classes-with-thin-attendance-on-day-1/articleshow/84354414.cms||B K Mishra

State industries minister Syed Shahnawaz Hussain symbolically handed over the concentrators to health minister Mangal Pandey through a virtual meeting organised by the foundation. Shahnawaz addressed Pandey as a corona warrior and said the work done by the health department under his leadership during the coronavirus pandemic was highly commendable. “When the first and second wave of Covid-19 came, the health system of the country was not ready to deal with the situation, but the work done by the health department under the leadership of CM Nitish Kumar needs to be appreciated. Because of that, we are now able to deal with the likely third wave of coronavirus,” Shahnawaz said. The health minister, while expressing gratitude to all the donors, including the industries department and disaster management department, said the relief materials will be immediately delivered to the Bihar Medical Services & Infrastructure Corporation Limited (BMSICL). Pandey said all additional primary health centres will be provided with two oxygen concentrators each. “Apart from this, 1,600 hospitals are planned to be constructed in the state to strengthen the health infrastructure in Bihar. The work is also being done in the direction to increase the skilled manpower in health sector,” he said, adding that all the donated oxygen concentrators will be handed over to the health facilities and the information will be made available to the donors. RS Srivastava, CEO, Bihar Foundation, said so far 846 oxygen concentrators, 25,000 N-95 masks, 225 pulse oximeters, 175 oxygen cylinders and 217 oxygen flowmeters have been handed over to the state government. “In addition, a cryogenic container with a capacity of 20 MT has also received from various donors,” he said. Brijesh Mehrotra, additional chief secretary of industries department, and the representatives of different NGOs were present during the virtual meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-gets-257-o2-concentrators/articleshow/84355572.cms||---

Kerala will have to conduct tests across districts though people think Zika cases are only in Thiruvananthapuram,” said former UN expert Dr KN Panicker, who has worked extensively on mosquito eradication across the world. He added that one will find areas that are breeding mosquitoes extensively in their own surroundings. “During lockdown, people started growing plants apart from having little gardens on terraces, balconies and gardens. If they look around they will see patches of fresh water lying stagnant which could be breeding mosquitoes. Just like Covid protocol is not just for your safety, but also your fellow-beings, we must develop a mandatory system in this case too,” he said. Normally, people think that such breeding happens in drains, canals and places where they store water. “We think it is done by somebody else, but I have been noticing and warning people whenever I see the spill trays of potted plants with water. While taking a video of some plant in one house, I saw lots of mosquito larvae in the water tray,” said botanist and landscapist Prof Jacob Varghese. He said that this is rampant in many homes as people don’t realize it. “If it is a small plant, people will try to throw away the water otherwise it will spill. But in the case of large potted plants, it is impossible for the person to move it. Hence, it is ignored,” he added. One option could be pouring kerosene or oil over such water as it forms a film on top. “We will need to address this water collection issue. Putting a drop of liquid mosquito repellent in water and checking if it’s effective is a way. A few drops of insecticides could also be used after diluting in water,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/social-protocol-needed-to-address-mosquito-breeding/articleshow/84357570.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

The farmers said they cultivated paddy and sold the stock to the rice mill, but were yet to get their payments. Several other farmers from the area also made similar allegations. If the allegations prove to be true, the overall payment due to the farmers could be over Rs 52 crore, police said. Rice mill owner Thatikonda Vishwanatham admitted he owes them money, but said the rice mill has remained shut due to the pandemic situation. He also assured that he will clear all dues after selling the mill’s assets. Cops said the farmers sold their yield to the rice mill either through middlemen or directly, but in both cases payments were kept pending. Vishwanatham has been taken into custody. A case has been registered under cheating and criminal breach of trust against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/rice-mill-owner-booked-for-duping-farmers/articleshow/84357725.cms||---

Delivering the S N Sinha Memorial Lecture at A N College on the occasion of his 104th birth anniversary, Roy said loss of jobs and rise in physical and mental illnesses accelerated the pace of domestic violence amid the lockdowns. Quoting figures of the National Family Health Survey, she pointed out, “After the age of 15 years, every third woman in the country is subjected to some sort of domestic violence. Besides, 31% of the married women experience physical, emotional or sexual violence by their spouses.” Talking about the “growing insensitivity among men towards the domestic violence laws”, Roy urged voluntary social organisations to create awareness and save women from physical and mental harassment. It was also announced that the stadium at A N College would be named after former chief minister, S N Sinha. Death condoled: The teachers of College of Commerce, Arts and Science condoled the death of the former head of Hindi department, Upendra Mishra, on Monday.

---||Business||Adani blames stock crash on ‘reckless’ reporting||TNN Mumbai: Ports tycoon Gautam Adani blamed “reckless and irresponsible” media reportage for the recent crash of his companies’ stock prices. Adani Group’s market capitalisation plunged last month after reports emerged that three of its foreign investors’ accounts were frozen by the depository NSDL. “Recently, a few media houses indulged in reckless and irresponsible reporting related to administrative actions of regulators. This caused unexpected fluctuations in the market prices of Adani stocks,” Adani, 59, told shareholders of group flagship Adani Enterprises. “Unfortunately, some of our small investors were affected by this twisted narrative in which some commentators and journalists seemed to imply that companies have regulatory powers over their shareholders and that companies can compel disclosure.” The stocks of six Adani companies, however, recovered subsequently after the conglomerate clarified that the said accounts remained active. “In the long term, such diversions will not impact us,” said the chairman at Adani Enterprises’s e-AGM on Monday, adding, “We have always been a confident organisation that has taken on challenges that very few would dare or imagine.” A couple of months before the six companies’ stock prices tanked, the group’s market capitalisation had crossed the $100-billion mark in April. “This valuation milestone is a first for a first-generation Indian company.” Adani, a college dropout, tried his hand in a couple of businesses before setting up Adani Enterprises in 1988. A decade later, he started to operate the Mundra port in Gujarat, and since then he has emerged as India’s largest private sector port player. “No other company in the world runs a port business of such scale and reach (like Adani Ports),” said the business tycoon, who has a net worth of $56 billion, according to Forbes. The group’s play now spreads across airports, renewable power, data centres, defence and consumer products. “All Adani stocks generated returns over 100% — and our businesses ensured that we returned close to Rs 9,500 crore to you, our equity shareholders,” said the chairman. Adani further said that “what we built yesterday has allowed us to secure our today — and what we are building today is the foundation for a better tomorrow”. The group’s consolidated operating profit of its listed portfolio was over Rs 32,000 crore in fiscal 2021, a growth of 22% year-on-year basis. Adani, whose businesses are linked to the country’s growth, said that while there have been several voices that wonder if India’s target to be a $5-trillion economy over the next four years is achievable, I personally see it as an inconsequential question. “India will be a $5 trillion economy and then go on to be a $15-trillion-plus economy over the next two decades. India will emerge as one of the largest global markets, both in terms of consumption size and market cap. There will be bumps along the road, as has been the case in the past, and is expected to be the case in the future. However, there cannot be any doubt that the largest middle class that will ever exist, augmented by an increase in the working age and consuming population share, will have a positive impact on India’s growth very much in line with the demographic dividend India enjoys,” said the billionaire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/adani-blames-stock-crash-on-reckless-reporting/articleshow/84359000.cms||---

Statements of some of those present at the hotel were also recorded. Police also listed the items seized, including wine bottles, empty glasses, a DJ console and a small packet of ganja. “As per the protocol, we have informed them about the incident. It is their prerogative how they wish to act on it,” said a police officer. Thirty-seven men were arrested from the hotel early on Sunday for allegedly partying well past midnight in violation of Covid restrictions. Cops alleged four of them jostled with them and five others misbehaved and kept smoking “something pungent” even after they were asked to throw them away. Those nine were remanded in police custody for five days, while the remaining 28 were granted bail by the chief metropolitan magistrate’s court later in the afternoon. Cops said they had questioned those in police custody. “We have collected evidence that there was no birthday party that night and that the guest list had been prepared well in advance for the weekend,” said a senior detective department officer. Those present at the hotel had insisted that there was a birthday party was being celebrated. Officers said they would ask the hotel to share all details of weekend bookings and the names of persons who had booked rooms. “We will see if there was any agreement or any attempt on the part of the hotel to explain the Covid rules and regulations to guests during check-in time,” said the police. Police have spoken to the legal team to ascertain if additional sections could be added once the nature of the items seized during the raid were identified. “The forensic tests will take some time. This ought to be our strongest evidence in the case,” said a police source. When contacted on Monday, the hotel authorities declined to comment. But they had issued a statement earlier, saying: “We are in the business of hospitality for over five decades and have been part of employment creation and economic progress of the State. Guest and Staff safety being our utmost priority, the bars and restaurants at our hotel are shut following Covid-19 protocols. Many of our patrons and their friends or families book stays in the hotel as a weekend getaway on a regular basis. We are complying with rules and regulations and would continue to do so and there has been no violation. We are fully cooperating with the authorities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-alert-excise-dept-about-park-st-hotel-violations-record-statements/articleshow/84357562.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Patna||Patna: Campus buzz back in schools after 4 months||PATNA: The return of higher secondary students to schools in Bihar has brought the buzz back on the campus after nearly four months. School vans, autorickshaws and buses were seen carrying students to schools and back home after classes. Many schools registered good attendance despite the Covid-19 fear. The state government has allowed the reopening of classes XI and XII with 50% attendance on alternate days. Sharat Kumar Singh, principal of Litera Valley School, said around 60% attendance was recorded on the first day. “We conducted the classes in two shifts. All those students who had taken their parent’s consent attended the classes. We are expecting more students to attend the physical classes in the days to come. The confidence level among parents and students will be built up with time. All the safety protocols were followed,” he said. Farhat Hassan, directress of International School, said only CBSE wing was opened and the attendance of students on the first day was good. “It was a good start as 65-70% attendance was registered. We are conducting both online and offline classes with 50% attendance, because the syllabus is vast and we have to complete it on time. The physical classes were held from 8am to 11.40am. Teachers give five minutes break after each class,” she said. She added: “The students were allowed to bring their lunch box but sharing food was strictly banned. We have also banned sharing of stationeries, books and copies for their safety.” Ashfaque Iqbal, vice-principal of Bishop Scott Boys’ School, said, “We registered good attendance on the first day. The school management has taken all the precautions, from sanitization to social distancing. All staff and students were wearing masks throughout the classes. All the school staff are vaccinated.” For students, it was a dull experience of physical classes without school activity, morning assembly, lunch sharing and other fun they used to have before the Covid period. Priyaranjan Kaushik, a student of DAV Public School, said, “Though the physical classroom life has become dull, we still find it more convenient than online classes. It is time to study hard, so I am concentrating on that only.” Anshuman Singh, a class XII student of Kendriya Vidyalaya said, “Most of my best friends will attend classes on Tuesday. Some of them were in different classesa and I was not able to even interact with my classmates.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/campus-buzz-back-in-schools-after-4-months/articleshow/84354527.cms||Faryal Rumi

According to Banka jail superintendent Sujit Kumar Roy, the objective of the initiative, christened ‘Ummeed’, is to make the inmates take up farming after they are released from prison. “It will transform their lives and make them self-employed by bringing socio-economic changes in their lives,” Roy told this reporter and added that the inmates were also being trained for livestock management and milch cattle rearing. The Banka jail superintendent narrated the story of Michal Tuddu, a former prisoner who had received training from KVK scientists in jail. He said, “After his release, he began goat farming and inspired his co-villagers as well.” A KVK scientist, Dharmendra Kumar, pointed out that mushroom cultivation and goat farming could be done on a very small scale at a low cost. “These, however, have numerous benefits, including high returns,” he added. One of the farmers, Vandana Kumari, who is also training the jail inmates, said several varieties of mushrooms could be grown easily. “Rich in protein and nutritional elements, mushroom can replace non-vegetarian food items. Those involved in its farming can earn well,” she claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/156-jail-inmates-learn-mushroom-cultivation/articleshow/84355610.cms||Kumar Rajesh
---||Kolkata||4 lakh doses arrive but hospitals, Kolkata Municipal Corporation clinics need more stock to sustain drive||KOLKATA: Even though the state government claimed it had received 25 lakh vaccine doses for July — to be used at government and Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC)-run vaccination centres — the civic body said the drive could slow down across its clinics this week owing to inadequate stock. While KMC clinics will resume the drive on Tuesday after a two-day break, each centre won't be able to administer more than 100 doses due to the shortage, said civic officials. On Monday morning, the state had a stock of 9.4 lakh doses even as it received a consignment of 4 lakh more in the evening. KMC health department had set a target of administering 15,000-20,000 shots from its 200 plus centres. Now, with an allocation of 100 shots per vaccination clinic, it is impossible for KMC to reach its goal. Half of the allocation (50 shots) will have to be reserved for recipients of second dose. The civic body now needs around 1 lakh doses to administer to second dose recipients who have been waiting for their turn for over a couple of weeks. KMC had suspended first doses for the past four days due to paucity of supply. "We had expected to ramp up vaccination at our clinics to bring more recipients of second dose who are waiting for their turn. This number is increasing at a rapid pace but we are yet to receive fresh supplies,” said a KMC health department senior official. He added that the civic body may be forced to keep some of big centres shut till the supplies reach. Private hospitals, too, are worried about their fast-depleting vaccines and most will run out of stock within the next three days to a week. None has received any vaccine since the new online procurement system came into effect on July 1. Peerless Hospital has stopped administering the first dose and has restricted the drive to just second doses for the 45-plus age group. “We have been forced to ration since we have not received anything under the new online procurement system. Unless fresh stock arrives, we will exhaust all our reserves in 10 days,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences that has sought 35000 doses is left with just 1,500 doses of Covishield that ‘may not last more than 2-3 days in the current scenario’. “We are awaiting fresh stocks since we are going to run out of Covishield this week. Around 100-200 doses of Sputnik, however, will continue to be administered daily for 10 days,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. AMRI Hospitals hopes to be able to continue vaccination with their existing stocks for another week. It has requisitioned 1.5 lakh doses for July that is yet to arrive. “We should be able to manage for barely another week,” said CEO Rupak Barua. AMRI is administering 1,200-1,500 doses a day at its three units apart from 1,800 doses at off-site camps. Fortis Hospital and ILS Hospitals have run out of stock and stopped the drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/4-lakh-doses-arrive-but-hospitals-kmc-clinics-need-more-stock-to-sustain-drive/articleshow/84356904.cms||---

After receiving such complaints, Nitish said, “Yeh to accha hua ki yah programme phir se shuru kar diye (it's good that the programme has been resumed).” In fact, he was a bit delighted over getting feedback from the people directly on the functioning of different government departments. A youth from East Champaran district sought financial assistance for running his small business of making snacks and chips at his native village. The youth had returned from Chhattisgarh during lockdown and started business with the help of a group of his co-villagers. The CM assured referred his case to the labour resources department for necessary action. A resident of Nawada drew the attention of Nitish towards use of vulgarity in certain languages. The CM directed the chief secretary to take proper action in this regard. Similarly, a resident of Supaul complained about an auxiliary primary health centre running on papers only in Raghopur block for the last several years and the staff being paid their salaries.

He said this marks the beginning of the review process for the vaccine. “All documents required for EUL of Covaxin have been submitted to WHO as of July 9. The review process has now commenced with the expectation that we will receive EUL from WHO at the earliest,” said a statement by Dr Ella tweeted by Bharat Biotech's official Twitter handle. WHO had accepted the company’s expression of interest (EOI) for Covaxin in mid-June following which the company made public, earlier this month, its final Phase-3 trials data which shows that the vaccine has an efficacy of 77.8%. Over the weekend, during a webinar, WHO chief scientist Sowmya Swaminathan had indicated that Bharat Biotech has submitted the complete data and the global health body is expected to take a decision on Covaxin’s EUL over the next four to six weeks. A WHO nod would be a major booster shot for Covaxin as it would grant it global acceptance and ease concerns of international travellers about travel restrictions on those who have taken vaccines that are not yet approved by WHO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/submitted-all-documents-for-covaxin-eul-to-who-ella/articleshow/84357551.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Only 36.41% of patients who did not receive steroids developed post Covid-19 symptoms, according to the survey. In an AIG post-Covid-19 online survey, which received scores of responses, it was revealed that 74% of hospitalized patients received steroids while only 34% were on oxygen support. “We believe there is some correlation between irrational use of steroids and post Covid-19 complications because as per the guidelines, steroids are supposed to be given to only those Covid-19 patients who require oxygen. Further research will be required to ascertain the steroids,” said Dr D Nageshwar Reddy, chairman, AIG Hospitals adding that unfortunately, in India, steroids are available as over-the-counter medicines. The survey also revealed that a total of 698 hospitalised patients were given steroids as part of Covid-19 treatment and 239 patients did not get steroids. When it comes to oxygen, only 322 patients required oxygen support and 615 patients did not require any support. A majority of 511 patients were hospitalised for 5 to 10 days. As many as 274 patients required less than five days of hospitalisation and 102 patients were admitted for 10 to 20 days. Only 50 patients said that they were admitted for more than 20 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/steroids-harming-gi-tract-causing-breathlessness/articleshow/84357528.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

During a meeting with the members of empowered standing committee, Sahu said city hotels, warehouses or houses and commercial establishments which were closed for several months will not have to pay for garbage collection. She said some people were trying to create confusion among the masses regarding the holding tax and garbage charges being collected by the civic body. “This rule will be applicable to all types of institutions located in the Patna municipal area. If the house or establishment was vacant during the lockdown, the owners will be exempted from paying the garbage collection fee. The private agency collecting taxes has been instructed that those who pay the garbage fee will be given a separate receipt for that. It will not be adjusted in the holding tax,” the mayor said. Keeping in view the number of tenants in households and commercial establishments, a separate fee for garbage collection will be charged from the tenants. The PMC has directed the private firm to get the details from the landlords about the tenants of their properties. Himanshu said the residents have been allowed to pay their garbage fee quarterly, half-yearly or yearly. “People, who process the wet waste in their homes and establishments will be given 50% rebate in garbage collection charges,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pmc-not-to-charge-garbage-fee-from-shops-for-lockdown-period/articleshow/84354828.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Business||NPCI issues guidelines for prepaid UPI e-vouchers, don’t need app, bank a/c||Mayur.Shetty@timesgroup.com Mumbai: Paving the way for a prepaid Unified Payments Interface — or UPI — platform, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has come out with guidelines for issue of electronic vouchers that can be used by mobile phone owners without any app or bank account. These vouchers will be for one-time use for payments. The government aims to use these vouchers for promoting Covid vaccinations using the private infrastructure. However, in the long term, the UPI prepaid vouchers are expected to play a much bigger role in one-time benefit transfers and replace other prepaid instruments like gift cards. Currently, issuing a plastic prepaid card with a chip can cost as much as Rs 200 for a bank, considering the logistics cost of purchasing the cards, printing and delivering them. A UPI prepaid voucher does away with all these costs as it can be delivered directly to the phone in the form of a QR code image or an SMS string. An additional layer of security is provided through an OTP authentication. In a communication to all participants in the UPI system, the NPCI has said that banks can issue these prepaid vouchers to wholesale buyers who will be known as the sponsors of these vouchers. The sponsors can be corporates, state governments, central government, or a business customer of the bank. The beneficiary can be anyone who can access the voucher through either a feature phone or a smartphone and need not have a bank account or any UPI app installed in their phone. Like in other prepaid instruments, the maximum limit for a UPI prepaid voucher has been pegged at Rs 10,000 or as prescribed by the regulator. To ensure that the voucher is used only for specified goods or services, it will contain a designated merchant code. This will ensure that a vaccine voucher can be used only for purchase of vaccines, or a foodgrain voucher is used only in the public distribution system. According to payments industry sources, the best part of the new platform is that besides the IT costs for the banks, there is no additional infrastructure required. The acceptance of these vouchers can be done using apps on mobile phones. “Even the SMS string that is sent to feature phones can be scanned using an app and the payment can be completed using optical character recognition,” a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/npci-issues-guidelines-for-prepaid-upi-e-vouchers-dont-need-app-bank-a/c/articleshow/84358627.cms||Mayur Shetty

---||Business||Lenders set up bad bank for loans in default||TNN Mumbai: Public sector lenders led by Canara Bank have officially formed the bad bank — the National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARC). Their next step now is to obtain approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to function as an ARC. In May, banks decided to appoint Padmakumar M Nair, chief general manager in charge of stressed assets in SBI, as the MD of the NARC. According to RBI norms, an ARC should have minimum net-owned funds of not less than 15% of the total financial assets that it plans to acquire on an aggregate basis or Rs 100 crore. According to industry sources, lenders have identified 22 asset loan accounts worth Rs 82,496 crore. Assuming a book value of half the loan amount, the ARC would have to pay out around Rs 6,000 crore to purchase the assets. This is because the RBI norms require that 15% of the value of the asset has to be paid in cash, while the rest can be paid for by issuing security receipts (SRs). These SRs entitle the holder to a share of the recovery effected by the ARC. To make the SRs more attractive to buyers, the government will guarantee recovery of up to Rs 31,000 crore. Lenders said that the objective of the guarantee was to provide comfort to investors and the average recovery is usually higher than the guaranteed amount provided.

The deputy commissioner has verified records and conducted a physical verification for some survey numbers. Allegations into the sale of Mansas lands claim that around 150 acres in Visakhapatnam district were sold in 2016-17 and 2018-19. Mansas has an extent of 14,418 acres in Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam and East Godavari. The Simhachalam temple trust board has another 14,000 acres across districts. With hundreds of acres of lands encroached upon, there are allegations that irregularities had taken place in land records. As much as 748 acres of temple lands were encroached upon in 2016-17. “We have inquired into the irregularities in land records and even conducted a field survey in Vizag. I will submit the report by July 15,” the deputy commissioner said. The government had appointed committees to streamline administration and probe irregularities in the trusts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/mansas-lands-probe-report-to-be-ready-by-july-15/articleshow/84356866.cms||Siva G
---||Business||RBI offers retail a/cs for govt bonds||TNN Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has allowed retail investors to open accounts with the central bank through which they can purchase government bonds in auctions and maintain them in dematerialised (demat) form. This was first announced by RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in February this year. He had pointed out that only a handful of other countries like the US and Brazil had this facility. Under the scheme announced by the RBI on Monday, investors can open a ‘Retail Direct Gilt Account’ through an online portal. This portal will give investors access to the primary auction of government securities. While the guidelines are in place, the RBI has not yet announced the launch date. It will also provide them access to the secondary market — the NDS-OM (negotiated dealing system - order matching) segment. Until now, only entities like banks, primary dealers, insurance companies and mutual funds (MFs) could participate in this segment. Most of the time, government bonds provide lesser returns than fixed deposits. For instance, a 10-year bond returns only 6.1%. The advantage of these bonds is that there is no credit risk. They are also very liquid and a 10-year bond can be sold anytime. There is, however, a price risk. A Rs 10,000-bond could see its market value dip if interest rates in the market are higher than the coupon (interest) payment on the bond. However, if the bond is held to maturity, the investor is assured of getting his money back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-offers-retail-a/cs-for-govt-bonds/articleshow/84358687.cms||---

Shareholders of Paytm’s holding company on Monday approved a Rs 16,600-crore IPO, of which Rs 12,000 crore will be raised through a fresh issue of new shares worth Rs 8,300 crore. Existing investors SoftBank and Ant Group will have the option to sell shares worth another Rs 8,300 crore. The shareholders also approved a resolution repositioning the company from a promoter-led entity to a professionally managed one. While Vijay Shekhar Sharma would cease to be a promoter, the shareholders approved his appointment as chairman, managing director and CEO and vested him with powers required to make decisions for the IPO. As a professionally managed company, no shareholder will have any special right. According to sources, the company has identified nine key management personnel, to be named in the draft red herring prospectus, which will be filed shortly. They are president & CEO Madhur Deora, chief finance officer Vikas Garg, head (offline payments) Renu Satti, head (lending) Bhavesh Gupta, head (online payments) Praveen Sharma, Paytm Labs CEO Harinderpal Singh Takhar, Paytm First Games COO Sudhanshu Gupta, CTO (payments) Manmeet Dhody, and president (compliances & operations) Deepankar Sanwalka. Besides these, key officials of the group are Paytm Money CEO Varun Sridhar, Paytm Payments Bank MD & CEO Satish Gupta, and Paytm General Insurance head Vineet Arora. The extraordinary general meeting also resulted in the ‘Articles of Association’ of the company being amended to be compliant with guidelines for listing. The employee stock option plan (ESOP) has also been revised to ensure compliance with listing requirements. Ahead of the IPO, the company has seen some changes on its board with Chinese nationals stepping down. The board also recently appointed former WhatsApp business head Neeraj Arora as a director. Last week, the company allotted 5.1 lakh equity shares to 80 employees at a nominal price of Re 1 and a premium of Rs 8 per security. The employees had sought to exercise their options under the ESOP. Employees already holding shares were allowed to offer their securities as part of the public offer. The Paytm Group comprises a host of businesses housed in One97 and various subsidiaries. A major chunk of the payments business is in Paytm Payments Bank, which is a joint venture between Vijay Sharma and One97 Communications.

Despite sanitation measures by the civic body, cases have risen everyday, posing a worry for health authorities. The number of Covid-19 cases are decreasing gradually and the positivity rate has come down to 5.3% in the last ten days. Officials are conducting around 7,000 Covid-19 tests every day. However, many patients who are coming in for Covid-19 tests are testing positive for malaria, typhoid, dengue and other seasonal fevers which is worrying health wing authorities. The out-patient ward at Vijayawada Government General Hospital (GGH) has been recording a large number of fever cases over the last week. Many private practitioners are also registering fever cases and clinics are asking patients to get tested for Covid-19 before starting the treatment for seasonal diseases. Meanwhile, health wing authorities have started a door-to-door fever survey. Authorities of the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) have intensified sanitation activity in slum areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/monsoon-leads-to-rise-in-seasonal-fever-cases-in-vij/articleshow/84357612.cms||Venu Lanka

Standard operating procedures such as checking temperature, ensuring marks and providing sanitisers to the passengers are not followed properly. Buses in Madurai city are operating with passengers occupying all the seats, and during the peak hours, passengers can be seen standing on busy routes. Mostly buses connecting various bus terminals in the city and those operated to a few distant routes within the district are crowded. Passengers, who are concerned with safety, urge all the standard operating procedures to be followed in the buses. G Senthilkumari, a resident of K Pudur, said that routes such as Mattuthavani-Arapalayam and Mattuthavani-Periyar are crowded during morning and evening hours. Most of the people travelling in the buses are not wearing masks properly. Not only passengers but also conductors and drivers of the buses often pull their masks to the chin. “Conductors can question the passengers and ensure that passengers wear marks properly. Officials should check for violation and take appropriate action to ensure that the Covid-19 preventive measures are being followed properly,” she said. R Ganesan from Alanganallur said that conductors allow as many passengers as possible. Clearly there is no intention from their end to control the crowd. As preventive measures are hardly followed by many passengers, concerned people avoid travelling in buses and arrange their own transportation. “The situation is not better in bus services operated to other districts. Buses could be the places for Covid-19 spreading if 100% seats are allowed to occupy, since passengers have to share the seat with strangers for hours together in the inter-district buses,” he said. An official from TNSTC said they have been insisting the bus crew to ensure all Covid-19 protocols are followed. However, they find it difficult to control crowds as passengers do not obey when the conductors try to prevent them from boarding the bus, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tnstc-buses-in-madurai-city-flout-govts-50-capacity-rule/articleshow/84359943.cms||V Devanathan

While a video of the purported incident is being circulated on social media on Monday, police registered an FIR against four upper caste people -- Virendra, Obay, Shivam and Satyam -- based on a complaint lodged by the youth’s mother. In her complaint, Mamta Devi alleged, “I was sitting outside our house along with my son and other family members on Friday. Around 6 pm, Harnam Singh, a local resident, came hurtling on a tractor, which he deliberately drove off road, close to the place we were sitting. We had a narrow escape. My son, Abhay, objected to his rash driving. An angry Harnam abused us. We did not argue with him as he was drunk. He left after threatening my son of dire consequences.” The next day, when Abhay was heading to the local market on his bicycle, four men – Harnam's sons and a nephew — stopped him. “They beat up my son mercilessly. Villagers informed me and I rushed to the spot to find my son lying unconscious in the field. The men left after threatening to kill my son and throwing my family out of the village if we dared to speak up against them,” she claimed. Fearing for the safety of his family, Abhay’s father, a daily wager, said, “My son is severely injured. I will have to borrow money for his treatment. I have two unmarried daughters. The upper caste men are threatening us with serious consequences and eviction from the village.” Akhilesh Narayan Singh, additional superintendent of police, said, “The matter is being investigated by deputy superintendent of police, in-charge of Sirsaganj circle. The four accused men will be arrested soon.” An FIR has been registered against the four under the IPC’s sections 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

Her family has now alleged that the local police refused to register a case of rape against the accused even after the girl was found on July 11 and they approached them. The girl, according to the family, was found on Sunday lying in an unconscious state in a field in semi-nude condition with her hands and legs tied with clothes. A video was recorded by some local residents. While the police claimed that an FIR was registered under sections 363 (kidnapping) and 366 (abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage) of IPC on the basis of a complaint filed by the survivor’s family, her brother claimed that the police had forced and “dictated” the content of the complaint to them in a bid to save the accused. Mainpuri circle officer (city) Abhay Narayan said that the girl’s statement has been recorded before the magistrate on Monday and other sections will be added accordingly. He, however, claimed that the medical report did not show any internal injuries and the FIR was registered on the basis of the complaint given by the girl’s family. According to her elder brother, his sister had gone to relieve herself when she was kidnapped by local youths on July 9. “When she did not return after an hour, we started searching for her but failed to locate her. We approached the police station to register an FIR but they refused and paid no heed to our pleas”, he claimed. The girl’s brother claimed that his sister was threatened by the police and was being pressured by them to give a "statement that suits them". In a similar incident reported on July 7, a schoolgirl, 16, was allegedly held hostage over days and raped repeatedly in front of her parents by eight men who wanted “revenge” because her elder brother had eloped with a woman of their family in UP’s Moradabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/gang-raped-for-3-days-16-yr-old-found-in-field-with-hands-legs-tied/articleshow/84355305.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

District administration of East Midnapore has decided that without Covid-negative reports tourists will not be allowed into Contai subdivision. Contai SDO Adityavikram Mohan Hirani, in a notice issued on Monday, directed that all hotels and lodges have to check that tourists have the necessary negative report issued within the last 48 hours of visiting Contai. However, if the tourists have got a double dose of the vaccination, the vaccination certificate will be enough to ensure their stay. Digha, Shankarpur, Tajpur and Mandarmani being popular tourist spots, the administration took this decision to prevent the spread of the virus. In recent weekends, the beach destinations had been found to be crowded and there are around a thousand hotels and lodges in this zone. The missive asked the hotel owners to keep a record of reports of all tourists and also asked all to follow Covid-19 restrictions due to the pandemic situation. Hotel owners have been asked to be proactive in thwarting the third wave of the virus. They were asked to display awareness campaigns in hotel lawns and urged all to follow safety protocol. Bipradas Chatterjee, joint secretary of Digha Hoteliers Association, said it will be difficult to do business following the norms of the government. “However, as the government has issued the norms, we need to follow them. We will have a meeting of our association members to discuss the issue on Saturday.

Instead of administering Covid-19 vaccine, the poor man was sterilized at the district hospital. The Asha worker left the man, certified with 100% disability, midway to home. Soon after returning home, Dhruv Kumar fell unconscious. His kin rushed him to the district hospital, where doctors referred him to SN Medical College in Agra on Sunday. According to sources, the Asha worker, Neelam Kumari, allegedly got the man sterilized to complete the target given to each block by the district health department ahead of the world population day on July 11. And to earn an incentive of Rs 400 for promoting sterilization. Victim’s elder brother Ashok Kumar, who works as a labourer, said, “My wife and I are uneducated and do not know about the proceedings of the Covid-19 vaccination. On Sunday, Asha worker Neelam came to my house and asked for permission to take my disabled brother for the vaccination. She claimed that if my brother would go for vaccination along with her, he will be getting Rs 3,000 (the amount provided by the state government to a male member on sterilization). For availing benefit of the government scheme, she asked for the bank passbook and Aadhaar card of my brother. She took my brother and after an hour left him on the way back home." “I made a big mistake by trusting her and sending my brother with him. Instead of providing Covid-19 vaccine, she got my brother sterilized. My brother was already weak. He fell unconscious after reaching home. We took him to the district hospital. There, doctors asked us to take him to the SN Medical College in Agra,” the victim’s brother said. A doctor on duty at the emergency ward of the district hospital said, “Dhruv Kumar was unconscious when he was brought to the hospital. For better treatment, he was referred to Agra after the consent of the family members. I do not know the details of the entire matter. But the sterilization procedure cannot be done on an unmarried man.” Etah chief medical officer Dr Umesh Tripathi said, “We have taken cognizance of an Asha worker allegedly getting an unmarried man sterilized on pretext of Covid-19 vaccine. The entire matter is being investigated.” Meanwhile, Etah police are yet to register an FIR on the basis of the complaint filed by the victim’s brother. “A complaint has been received regarding the unlawful sterilization of a man.

Virtual courses on digital marketing, data science, coding, software development and business management are quite popular among collegians. Akansha Sonal, an undergraduate student of St Xavier’s College of Management and Technology, took up an online course on digital marketing recently, thinking “it will help me in future”. “The course, which was absolutely free, threw light on the fundamentals of digital marketing with the help of numerous examples and videos. Now, I will enrol myself into a programme on data analysis,” Akansha told this newspaper and added that the highlight of the programme was receiving a certificate in the end. A Patna University student, Arnab Chatterjee, wanted to learn the basics of digital journalism and opted for an online course by Reuters a few days ago. After getting a certificate, he enrolled himself into another programme on human resource management. “Both the courses were short, but quite helpful. I am happy I utilised my free time in a constructive manner,” an elated Arnab said. Sawan Gupta, a student of Patliputra University, has taken up a few creative writing courses. He said, “I looked for organizations that offer free online courses, read the reviews, gained an overview of the programmes and learnt the nitty-gritty of creative writing.” Another student, Richa Singh, selected a course on the basis of its popularity on the internet. She pointed out, “There are numerous free courses to choose from. I took up a virtual programme that dealt with each and every aspect of software development.” Dileep Kumar, a professor who conducts virtual mathematics classes, asked students to prefer quality to quantity. “They should take up online courses that are trending and offer certificates as well,” he advised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/free-online-programmes-in-vogue-among-students/articleshow/84354974.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Colleges decide not to increase fee this year||KOLKATA: Several colleges in Kolkata have decided not to increase admission and tuition fees this year. Fees were reduced considerably last year owing to the pandemic. A couple of colleges have even decided to waive off the entire college fee for those students who have lost either one or both parents to the virus. The government has already announced that colleges and universities cannot charge application fee from students who can apply in as many subjects as they want to. Colleges charge anywhere between Rs 200 and Rs 500 as application fee. So, if a student applies in at least four colleges, he or she might end up spending Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,000. TimesViewAnything that helps students in a year filled with so much uncertainty is welcome. The government has already released a timeline for the admission process. This must be adhered to and, in case of any change, students must be informed in advance.Lady Brabourne College had slashed the admission as well as the tuition fee “significantly” last year to provide relief to students. “We have held internal meetings with the governing body, admission committee and senior teachers and decided not to increase the admission as well as tuition fee this year. The government’s decision to waive off the application fee is very good and we are abiding by that,” said Lady Brabourne principal Siuli Sarkar . The pandemic has dealt economic blow to several families, forcing them to curtail several expenses. Principals do not want students to discontinue their studies due to fund crunch. Colleges had reduced up to 40% to 60% of admission fee last year. Basanti Devi College did not increase the admission or semester fee last year. This year, too, no decision has been taken to increase it. Scottish Church has from this semester decided to waive off all semester fee for students who have lost either one parent or both parents to the pandemic. “The students must apply with relevant documents and the fee will be waived,” said an official of the college. Many colleges had also waived off the hostel fee last year. “Since the students are not using the hostels during the pandemic, we have decided to waive off the fee,” said Sarkar of Lady Brabourne College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/colleges-decide-not-to-increase-fee-this-year/articleshow/84356967.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Vijayawada||High court suspends govt order, citing violation of Andhra Pradesh PR Act||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Monday suspended the order issued by the state government on March 25, which transferred some powers of sarpanches and panchayat secretaries to village revenue officers (VROs). Stating that GO-2 goes against provisions of the Constitution as well as the AP Panchayat Raj Act, the high court said that the decision will defeat the purpose of self-governance through elected representatives in panchayats. The GO transferred the control of functional assistants in village secretariats to the revenue department from the panchayatraj department. VROs were delegated with the powers to sanction leaves and other administrative controls over functional assistants in the village secretariats, who were under the direct control of panchayats headed by elected representatives and panchayat secretaries. The GO was challenged by Turimella Krishna Mohan, sarpanch of Thokalavanipalem under Kolluru mandal in Guntur district, on the grounds that it was in contrary to the provisions of the Constitution. Narra Srinivas, counsel for the petitioner, argued that the spirit of the 73rd constitutional amendment would be defeated if the powers of gram panchayats are curtailed. The argument was countered by advocate general S Sriram, who stated that GO-2 was issued in public interest for better functioning and effective delivery of government schemes. He said it was a policy decision of the government to evolve a better process for service delivery and courts should not interfere at this stage. After hearing both sides, Justice Battu Devanand said the intention of the state government in bringing in the village secretariat system with functional assistants under each line department was to provide services to people at their doorstep. The government, in its earlier GOs, had stated that gram panchayat will be termed as village secretariat, while panchayat secretary would be the drawing and disbursement officer, which meant that gram panchayats and village secretariats were a single entity, Justice Devanand noted, while adding that in this case, however, GO-2 states that they are two different entities. If such action is allowed, gram panchayats would become puppets of the government instead of being an institution of self-governance, thereby defeating the very spirit of the Constitution’s 73rd amendment, the court said. The HC also noted that GO-2 is in violation of articles 40, 243-G of the Constitution and section 4(2) of AP Panchayat Raj Act, and passed orders suspending its operation pending disposal of the writ petition.

Diesel price was cut down to Rs95.46/litre in Patna from Rs95.62 in the last 24 hours, after the price revision effected by oil marketing companies. Petrol was being sold at Rs103.66/litre on Monday, which was priced at Rs103.32 the previous day. The Speed or Premium brand of petrol was, however, up at Rs106/litre in Patna. Ajay Kumar, manager of a petrol pump near Dak Bunglow roundabout, said it was for the first time since May 2020 that the diesel price has come down. “But there is no relief in petrol prices, which continue to rise. The petrol sales have declined by 25-30% and diesel by 60% because very few tour and travel vehicles are plying on the road,” he said. Sales executive of a petrol outlet near Gandhi Maidan, Vijay Kumar, said the average sales of petrol were above 14,000 litres per day earlier compared to 11,000 litres nowadays. The same is the case with diesel sales, which had dropped to 6,500 litres from 9,000-10,000 litres per day. Prabhat Kumar Singh, president of Bihar Petroleum Dealer’s Association (BPDA), said the diesel prices decreased across the country while rates of petrol increased. “The rates vary from state to state depending on the local taxation (VAT). But it was evident that the Centre has collected the record-high revenue from the fuel sales. It was also evident that there is no role of international crude oil rates to determine the fuel prices in India. The government increased the rates as per requirement and needs,” he said. “We are expecting further decline in diesel prices because it influences the prices of other essential commodities. But there will be no reduction in petrol rates,” he added. The cascading effect of the fuel prices on essential commodities was already taking the toll on common people’s household budget. Anisha Singh, a resident of Nala Road, said their monthly expenditure on food items was around Rs1,800 about five months ago. It has increased to Rs3,200 as the prices of edible items, from oil to pulses, have increased by 50-60%. Mustard oil, which was earlier Rs100/litre, is now costlier by Rs80. About Rs5 has been increased on refined and other oils in a couple of days. Similar is the case with pulses, foodgrains and spices,” she said. A resident of Lodipur, Vandana Kumari said she had to cut down the purchase of branded and packaged food items to manage her household budget.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/diesel-down-by-16-paise-but-petrol-prices-continue-to-rise/articleshow/84354778.cms||Faryal Rumi

He charged Congress and BJP with talking in two different tones on Krishna water issue in Telangana and AP to cater to respective parties’ interests. “Every state has chief ministers, but our state has a chief minister who had achieved Telangana state. People have faith in KCR’s leadership and believe the state is progressing in every sector,” KTR said. Speaking at a meeting in which four Congress corporators and councillors belonging to Jawaharnagar municipal corporation and Ghatkesar municipality joined the TRS at Telangana Bhavan on Monday, the minister said the TRS government was implementing welfare schemes to meet the requirements of every person and continued even during the Covid-19 pandemic. “Since 2014, there were many allegations levelled against KCR by the opposition parties, but people reposed faith in TRS and his leadership in every election,” KTR said. He assured the state government’s support for development of Jawaharnagar municipal corporation by releasing funds. The municipal minister said by capping Jawaharnagar dump yard, the government could resolve some of the key issues. He said the government would also set up a waste-to-energy plant soon. He promised to resolve the issue of house sites under GOs. 58 and 59 by bringing it to the notice of KCR.

An all-party meeting in Chennai on Monday unanimously urged the Union government not to clear the project pushed by Karnataka, the first time the DMK government and the BJP were in agreement in Tami Nadu. Hours later in Bengaluru, the BJP government in Karnataka said it would do everything possible to implement the project. The all-party meeting led by chief minister M K Stalin unanimously passed three resolutions. The parties said that no construction should be done at Mekedatu without the approval of the lower riparian state as per the Supreme Court order. “The Karnataka government’s efforts to build the dam against that order is condemnable,” the meeting said, adding the project would affect the farmers in Tamil Nadu. The parties offered full support and cooperation to the state government’s initiatives to stall the project, which they said was a challenge to the Constitution. In his opening remarks at the meeting, Stalin said “Karnataka does not give our due share of water normally. Our question is how will water come when a dam is built. Karnataka supplies only the surplus water during floods as it could not store it. The state does not provide the quantum as per the tribunal award and the Supreme Court order.” Stalin said the proposed dam, with a capacity of 67.16tmcft, would jeopardize the interests of Tamil Nadu farmers. “Karnataka’s claims that the dam is to meet the drinking water needs of Bengaluru city and for hydel power generation is not true. This is to deceive us,” Stalin said. Nainar Nagendran, the BJP’s floor leader in TN assembly, said the party extended full support to the DMK government for the welfare of the farmers and that Karnataka should not build a dam without the consent of the lower riparian state. P H Manoj Pandian, AIADMK MLA and party organising secretary, said the state government should move the Supreme Court under Article 131 of the Constitution and it should seek expedition of the pending contempt cases against the violators of the orders of the Supreme Court. In Bengaluru, Basavaraj Bommai, Karnataka home, law and parliamentary affairs minister, said, “There’s no question of stopping it. Since it’s a drinking water project and excess water is being utilised, Karnataka has every right to take it up.” He appealed to Tamil Nadu to understand that the project will benefit both states, especially during distress years. “The final award on sharing of Cauvery water has been issued and the Cauvery Water Management Authority will monitor release of water to Tamil Nadu. The apprehension that Tamil Nadu will be deprived of its share of water is uncalled for,” he said. D K Shivakumar, Karnataka Congress president, urged the government to implement the project and said the Congress party would extend all cooperation. “We needn’t worry about Tamil Nadu’s opposition. They’ll place hurdles even if we wait for a hundred years. Your party is in power at the Centre — use it and start the project,” he said. In Chennai, the Tamil Nadu Congress took a diametrically opposite stand, backing the state government’s stand against the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-all-party-meet-asks-centre-not-to-okay-mekedatu-project/articleshow/84359956.cms||---

A workshop on the importance of quality and research-based education was also held on the occasion. Earlier known as Bhagalpur University (till 1991), the TMBU was established on July 12, 1960. It is spread over 264 acre land with 34 postgraduate streams and constituent colleges and 25 government-funded affiliated colleges, four research centres, several BEd colleges besides self-financing and vocational courses under its fold. “More than 1,36,200 students under TMBU, which include 6,200 in postgraduate streams and 1,30,000 in colleges, are pursuing their education under the mentorship of nearly 1200 teachers at different levels. Despite limitations of resources, students excel due to their hard work and merit under the able guidance of teachers,” the VC said. She added: “Our aim is not only to make the students knowledgeable, but also employable and good human beings. We have endeavoured to improve the academic standards of the colleges, laboratories, libraries etc as well as the postgraduate departments for the students. The university intends to become research-intensive in collaboration with other premier teaching and research institutions.” Prof Gupta also promised to make efforts to regularize the academic session besides streamlining the examination department, so that results are not delayed and the students do not have to suffer in migrating or pursuing courses at other places of education. JD(U) MP from Bhagalpur Ajay Kumar Mandal, BJP MLC Dr N K Yadav and others, while referring to the glorious past of the university, recalled the association of ‘Rashtrakavi’ Ramdhari Singh Dinkar, former CMs Dr Jagannath Mishra and Bhagwat Jha Azad, former assembly speakers Sadanand Singh and Shiv Chandra Jha and others who had studied at TMBU colleges. They also remembered first President of India late Dr Rajendra Prasad, who was instrumental in getting the university established here. TMBU registrar Dr Niranjan Yadav said efforts were on to live up to the expectations of students and the present challenges. Earlier, the foundation day was marked by singing of university ‘kulgeet’ and planting of saplings on the campus by the TMBU officials as well as the teachers and students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tmbu-celebrates-62nd-foundation-day/articleshow/84355036.cms||Kumar Rajesh

Sirisha, who’s the vice-president of government affairs at Virgin Galactic, accompanied the company’s founder Richard Branson to space in their VSS Unity spacecraft. Sirisha said the view of Earth from space has given her a new perspective to life. “I was trying to think about a better word than incredible, but that is the only word that can come to my mind... Seeing the Earth from there was so life-changing... The whole trip to space and back is just amazing,” she told a US-based TV channel. The 33-year-old said she always wanted to become an astronaut or a pilot, but couldn’t through the conventional route (NASA) nor become a pilot due to her eyesight issues. “I took a very unconventional way to go to space and I believe a lot of people are going to be able to experience this and that’s why we are here,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/view-from-space-was-life-changing-sirisha/articleshow/84357547.cms||---

As per a field survey, the civic body has identified 214 tanks in various zones of the city. As many as 29 tanks have completely vanished due to encroachments, while nine have been partially occupied. The catchment area of various small and big tanks in the city is severely affected due to anthropogenic activities such as construction. This has consequently reduced the storage capacities of the water tanks. Many of the water tanks located in the newly merged villages, which were once irrigation tanks or drinking water sources, have turned into garbage dumps or sewage pools. People shifting away from the community-based tank system to individual water sources, encroachments, silt and other factors have also decreased their number and/or size. The GVMC about three years ago renovated various tanks such as in Yendada, Tunglam, Bakkannapalem, Darapalem and Nagarapalem. Now, the GVMC is planning to rejuvenate the remaining tanks with the help of various organisations under the corporate social responsibility (CSR) scheme. The GVMC has preliminarily decided to develop 14 water bodies in the city. This is expected to cost about Rs 15 crore. Some of these tanks include Krishnamahanthi Tank in Thungalam, Voora Cheruvu in Chingantyada, Bata Cheruvu in Lankelapalem, etc. As part of the restoration plan, the GVMC would geo-fence all these water bodies with the help of technology. After removing the accumulated garbage, the water bodies would be desilted and deepened. The inlet and outlet channels would be cleared of obstruction. The bund of the water body would be strengthened and the water channels would also be cleared. According to GVMC officials, the civic body would seek the financial assistance of various corporate companies under CSR to develop these tanks. It has already written letters to some major organisations on the matter. In recent times, the civic body has shifted its focus to improving water sources of the city in keeping with the state government’s plan of shifting the executive capital to Vizag city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/gvmc-to-rejuvenate-tanks-with-an-eye-on-vizags-water-sources/articleshow/84356983.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Area under chilli expands as farmers bank on high returns||AMARAVATI: After witnessing a decent revenue in the last two years, farmers are betting high on chilli cultivation this year as well. The chilli sowing area has increased by nearly 30 per cent during the current crop season compared to last year. Good rains in upland areas of Kurnool, Guntur, Prakasam and Krishna districts have also encouraged farmers to go for chilli cultivation on a large scale. According to latest information, chilli is expected to be cultivated on about 10 lakh acres during the current season as against 6.5 to seven lakh acres cultivated last year. The farmers in upland areas have begun initial operations for chilli sowing. The farmers had reasonable profits on dry red chilli sales in the last two years as the stocks were picked up at about Rs 12,000 to Rs 14,000 per quintal. Fine variety chilli was even picked up at Rs 20,000 per quintal during the peak of the season. The farmers could sell even the lowest quality of stock anywhere between Rs 6,000 to Rs 7,000 per quintal, which is usually picked up for Rs 2,000 per quintal. Despite lockdown restrictions in many states and the Covid-19 outbreak, demand for chilli has gone up in the export market helping farmers gain reasonable amounts. “Any price above Rs 8,000 per quintal is reasonably good and profitable. Farmers got an average price of Rs 10,000 to Rs 12,000 per quintal during the last season due to various factors including crop loss in chilli producing states such as Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka,” said Lanka Kranti Sekhar, a chilli exporter. A few farmers who produced high-demand chilli varieties such as Byadgi and Gunturu Sannalu through organic means or clean stock pocketed Rs 20,000 per quintal. Chilli cultivation is a risky venture as it requires huge investment ranging anywhere between Rs 1 to Rs 1.2 lakh per acre which the farmer can recover only when yields are satisfactory and prices reasonably good. Taking the mood of farmers into consideration, traders have started selling seeds at high prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/area-under-chilli-expands-as-farmers-bank-on-high-returns/articleshow/84356846.cms||Samdani MN

To ensure all hospitals get a fair share of the vaccines, the new policy had mandated that all purchases be made via CoWIN. Big hospitals, ordering more than 6,000 doses, can approach manufacturers directly via CoWIN. But hospitals buying less than 6,000 doses are facing problems. Some hospital administrators said the payment gateway on CoWIN often doesn’t open. A handful of units that were able to make the payment said they’re still awaiting word on delivery. “I placed an order for 1,000 doses via CoWIN and also made the online payment. But there has been no communication on when I’m likely to get the doses,” said pediatrician Nivedita Oswal, director of Parasmani Hospital in Hadapsar. Scores of neighbourhoods in the PMR have at least one small hospital nearby. They can boost coverage and make ‘neighbourhood vaccine drives' a reality, experts said. “Only four of the 30 small setups have been able to access CoWIN’s payment gateway. Most have not been able to access it, a full 10 days after the new policy, on purchases, became operational,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India (HBI) — an association of small hospitals in Pune. Patil said units that have made payments remain clueless on when they’ll actually be getting the doses. As many as 142 small hospitals and nursing homes in the region have been given the nod to serve as vaccination centres. And since June 23, the PMC has even been training staff at these units to administer the jabs (the units have permission to administer 100 to 200 doses daily).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cowin-niggles-policy-shifts-leave-many-small-hospitals-without-doses/articleshow/84360002.cms||Umesh Isalkar

It proposes to raise the current fee per departing domestic (Rs 281) and international passenger (Rs 393) to Rs 728 and Rs 2,200, respectively, in this period (see box). Incidentally, the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) had slashed GMR Hyderabad International Airport’s (GHIAL) UDF from Rs 430 (domestic) and Rs 1,700 (international) from April 1, 2020, to the current levels. A proposal for part of the overall higher aeronautical tariffs — a mix of UDF and other regulated levies like landing and parking charges — for the third control period (FY 2022-26), has been submitted to AERA for approval. The regulator, in turn, has sought comments from the public and stakeholders on the tariffs sought by GHIAL and will accordingly decide the rates. Bengaluru Airport has also sought phase-wise steep hike in UDF and other aero charges. The GMR Group is currently undertaking expansion work at its existing airports — Delhi and Hyderabad — apart from building a greenfield one on Goa. The Hyderabad airport’s capacity is being hiked from the original 1.2 crore passengers per annum to over 3.4 crore. With the pandemic crippling air travel since last March, revenues of all aviation stakeholders like airlines, airports and flight caterers has been severely hit. “Air travel has been impacted due to the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic and it is very difficult to estimate the likely traffic… request the authority to allow mid-term review of the rate card at the end of FY23 based on actual billable traffic for FY22 and FY23 so as to enable us to achieve and that recover the ARR as proposed in the consultation paper,” GHIAL stated in a July 9, 2021, filing of “annual tariff proposal (ATP) for the third control period” to AERA. “In case there is any variation between the ARR (aggregate revenue requirement) on which the current tariff is worked out and the final tariff approved ARR by the authority, we request AERA to allow us to resubmit the revised ATP as the change in ARR may require us to rework on the recovery strategy,” the regulator adds. Hyderabad airport also plans to introduce “variable tariff plan primarily to support new route development, growth of air travel and faster bounce back of air traffic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-airport-seeks-phase-wise-hike-of-udf-other-charges-from-oct/articleshow/84357580.cms||Saurabh Sinha

The treatment costs Rs 60,000 per patient, but the BMC got the two antibody drugs, Casirivimab and Imdevimab, through donations. The study, carried out in BMC-run Seven Hills Hospital, Andheri, included 74 patients with at least one co-morbidity and whose CT scan score was around eight out of 25.

The monoclonal antibody cocktail has been touted as a "game-changer" in the fight against Covid. Studies have shown that 80% of patientsHospital dean Dr B Adsul said fever in all the patients dropped within 48 hours. “Covid progressed in only one patient (0.5%) whose oxygen need increased, but the mortality rate dropped by 70%,” said Dr Adsul. Senior BMC officials said hospital stay was reduced to five to six days as against the mean time of 13 to 14 days needed for patients admitted here during the first and second waves. Dr Adsul said 5% of patients had to undergo ICU treatment. “Most importantly, no side-effects were reported in any patients,” he added. The BMC press statement claimed the cocktail could be “financially beneficial” as patients could avoid hospitalisation and “other expensive medications”. Stating that the stress on healthcare staffers would be reduced as the treatment can be given in the OPD, the release added that the BMC would consider using the monoclonal antibodies during the expected third wave. A similar study was carried out among patients admitted to the private ICU at Seven Hills and NSCI dome managed by H N Reliance Hospital. CEO Dr Tarang Gianchandani said 70 patients were given the medicines free of cost. “The rate of hospitalisation and deaths dropped drastically in these patients, proving that it can be established as a line of treatment,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-drug-cocktail-used-to-treat-trump-gets-bmc-thumbs-up/articleshow/84360028.cms||---

Kaskar also disclosed the smuggling route of contraband by Dawood, officials claimed. “The whole lot of hashish is smuggled into India via Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab from their lands in Rajasthan where there is huge consumption in Ajmer and Pushkar where foreigners visit. The rest is offloaded at Gujarat and Mumbai,” said an official. NCB officials on Sunday laid a trap and arrested Hussain Bi, a resident of Nagpada who was on her way to deliver the contraband, taking her 5-year-old child as a shield from getting caught.

Many owners also put up notices outside their bars, requesting guests to vacate the premises by 8pm. The government allowed bars and restaurants to stay open till 8pm from July 1, provided they followed all Covid-safety guidelines. There have been allegations that some bars remained open beyond 9pm, in violation of the Covid restrictions. But after the raid on Park Street, most places were found to abide by the rules on Monday. The authorities at Broadway Hotel on Ganesh Chandra Avenue claimed they always stuck to the government deadline and stopped taking orders for drinks after 7.30pm. “We start requesting customers to finish their food and drinks before 8pm because we must shut down by that time. We also stop taking orders by 7.30pm so the guests can finish their food and drinks and leave before 8pm,” said Sandeep Sehgal, owner of Broadway Hotel. The establishment has also put up a notice outside, requesting customers to vacate the premises by 8pm. At Ar Han Thai, too, the staff reportedly take the last order around 7.30pm. “We tell customers we will shut by 8pm, the government deadline. So far, we have not faced any problem convincing any customer,” said manager Sanjay Singh. Many bars, however, allegedly shut the main entrance at 8pm but continue to serve beyond the deadline. Flouting restrictions, owners of many guest houses have allegedly been letting out rooms for small parties. “Customers usually start dropping in around 7pm. As soon as they arrive, we tell them to order their last drink at 7.30pm and leave by 8pm. If these time restrictions continue, they will never return again. The government must review this decision,” said the owner of a bar on Park Street.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bars-reinforce-last-order-rules-for-8pm-shutdown/articleshow/84357624.cms||Zeeshan Javed

There are a total 158 Afghan students in OU of which 136 are men and 22 are women. With troops from the United States of America leaving Afghanistan, students fear that the Taliban would take over and worsen the situation, especially for women. Marriam Samit had come to the OU in 2019 to pursue Master of Arts in English. At the fag end of her course, Samit is now worried over her return to Afghanistan as she fears that the Taliban would make it difficult for women like her to seek employment. “My hometown in Afghanistan is barely an hour from where the Taliban is based. My family has informed me that the situation is not at all conducive for my return. We have no idea on how women’s rights will be perceived and if we’d ever have a safe future under the Taliban rule,” said Samit, who is now exploring other avenues of either studying further or seeking employment in a country where she’d be legally allowed to work. Like Samit, there are many others who are set to complete their course over the next few months. However, many are worried as they do not want to go back to their country and are now exploring options for their survival. “Although my hometown Kabul is relatively safe than the other provinces, all other family members living in other parts of Afghanistan are discouraging me from returning to the country. My brother had sustained injuries in a bomb blast unleased by the Taliban. After that incident, we both had left Afghanistan for higher education,” said Rawnaq, an engineering student at the OU, adding that he is not too hopeful to seek employment in Afghanistan under current circumstances and is looking at alternatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/taliban-march-leaves-afghan-students-worried/articleshow/84357631.cms||Preeti Biswas

The district administration has also got approval for two more oxygen plants. During the second surge, it was challenging for the administration to meet the oxygen demand. Raikot SDM Dr Himanshu Gupta, who is monitoring the setting up of oxygen plants in hospitals, said, “Three oxygen plants—one each at Ludhiana civil hospital, Mother and Child Hospital (MCH), Vardhman, and sub-divisional hospital (SDH), Raikot—are likely to be installed in 10 days. Two more oxygen plants have also been allotted for UCHC (community health centre) in Jawaddi and SDH, Khanna. We are hopeful of getting a plant allotted for government-operated Covid care centre at Rara Sahib through a donor.” “One oxygen plant is being installed at a private hospital with the help of an industrial organization. Two more private hospitals have shown interest in their installation,” he added. The district administration officials said two 1,000 litre per minute (LPM) plants are coming up at civil hospital and ESI Hospital in Ludhiana, which are being sent by the Central government and peripheral expenditure, including making of base of plant, DG set and electricity connection, was being done by the Punjab government from state disaster relief fund. They added four plants were being installed through donations: the 250 LPM plant at Raikot SDH, 100 LPM at Vardhman MCH, 100 LPM at Samrala SDH and 500 LPM at a private hospital here, which is being funded by the CII. “These plants use natural air as per latest technology which is different from oxygen cylinders and liquid medical oxygen being used earlier. UCHC, Jawaddi, plant will have a capacity of making 165 LPM and that at SDH, Khanna, of 300 LPM,” the Raikot SDM said. The officials said the plant at SDH, Raikot, got delayed due to power crisis as Nabha power officials, who have to install it, were busy. As of now, Ludhiana civil hospital has an oxygen plant of 700 LPM. Its authorities said another 1,000 LPM plant coming up on the premises is expected to meet the peak demand. “It is important to make arrangements for adequate infrastructure and trained staff in hospitals, ahead of the probable third wave,” said Ludhiana IMA president Dr Saroj Aggarwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/3-o2-plants-at-govt-hosps-to-be-ready-in-10-days/articleshow/84355398.cms||Shariq Majeed

The first phase of 5MW was commissioned in 2015. With the commissioning of the additional capacity, the Hyderabad international airport will be able to cut its dependency on conventional power by 12 million units per year, resulting in savings of around Rs 90 lakh per month. With this, solar power will now cater to nearly 50% of the total energy requirements of Hyderabad airport, helping reduce the airport’s carbon footprint by about 28 lakh kg of carbon dioxide per annum, which is equivalent to saving 1.4 lakh full grown trees, it said. The solar plant, which has been set up for captive consumption, is spread over an area of 45 acres and comprises over 30,000 solar panels that can generate 10MW power. GHIAL said both the solar plants have advanced ABB central inverters and poly-crystalline PV panels, which are far more efficient than mono-crystalline solar PV panels. Terming the commissioning of the second phase as a major milestone and critical step in the right direction, GHIAL CEO Pradeep Panicker said that as a member airport of the ACI (Airports Council International), the airport operator has committed to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-airport-commissions-5mw-solar-power-plant/articleshow/84357615.cms||---

The farmer alleged that the concerned MRO and office staff had failed in updating the land record in the Dharani portal. According to villagers, the farmer Kasim and his mother Mehboobi repeatedly visited revenue officials and submitted representations to update the record but the revenue officials had failed to do so. Following official inaction over multiple representations, the farmer and his mother attempted suicide but were rescued by police personnel at the office. They were later counselled while the recently-appointed MRO, D Sammaiah, said that the issue will be looked into and resolved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/farmer-mom-attempt-suicide-at-mro-office/articleshow/84361992.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna

The Centre had recently announced that the district is among 66 others in the country where positivity rate is a cause for concern and cautioned the state to take extra measures to prevent the virus spread. Alarmed over the high positivity rate in Khammam district, health officials said that a fever survey will help in reducing the rate. Sattuppallu and Madira assembly segments, which share the border with Andhra Pradesh, are witnessing a high number of cases. In June, the state government had found that the cases were high in the two assembly segments because the traffic movement at the border continued despite lockdown. Though officials say that the positivity rate is high in the district due to higher testing, experts said that laxity in implementing Covid-19 protocols and conduct of social gatherings without safety norms led to the surge. “The cases coming to private hospitals here are less, but more cases are being referred to government hospitals,” Dr VK Rao, a physician in Khammam said. Meanwhile, the state health department officials rushed to Nalgonda district as Nagarjuna Sagar is now reporting more number of Covid-19 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/at-6-73-positivity-rate-stays-high-in-khammam-district/articleshow/84357606.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Thackeray had a virtual meeting with CII (Confederation of Indian Industries) and said plans should be made to ensure the impact of the third wave is minimal and production is not halted. “Maharashtra should set an example to nations that industries can continue to operate even if strict restrictions have to be re-imposed,” he said. Thackeray suggested setting up an industrial task force on Covid-19 management and said this body could be in touch with the state government on various steps to be taken in case a third wave strikes. The state government had already asked the industries to look into staggering office timings and even making work from home home productive with technological interventions. He said small and medium industries can create a bio-bubble. Besides, arrangements for temporary field residence should be created for workers to ensure minimal movement. A discussion was also held on ramping up oxygen production and making available oxygen storage and transport capacity. Additional chief secretary, health, Dr Pradeep Vyas said as per policy, private hospitals are getting 25% of the vaccine stocks and industries should tie up with these hospitals to ensure vaccination of employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ensure-impact-of-3rd-wave-is-minimal-cm-to-industry/articleshow/84360070.cms||Bhavika Jain

The victim Kannan, was on the Madurai to Kanyakumari national highway when he was intercepted by armed people on two bikes. Preliminary inquiries revealed that there were five people on the bikes and that they attacked Kannan with machetes before fleeing the place immediately. Superintendent of police for Tirunelveli district N Manivannan visited the spot and conducted inquiries. The body was sent to the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital for autopsy. It is suspected that the murder was over previous enmity and that the victim and suspects belong to different communities. The police soon formed special teams to nab the accused. Tense moments prevailed as kin, friends of Kannan and several villagers gathered near the highway for a road blockade. There was heavy police deployment to ensure maintenance of law and order.

---||Delhi||Delhi rains: It’s no season of joy for those without a roof over their head||NEW DELHI: Rohit Yadav, who lives in Lajpat Nagar, had been praying for rain for over a week. On Tuesday, he was elated as he sat by the French window in his house and enjoyed the downpour. But unlike Yadav, for whom the rain was a welcome diversion, Savita was rather distressed when the skies opened up.  The ragpicker does not have a house to call her own and she prayed on Tuesday that it would not continue to rain as heavily in the coming days. She can’t bear to be reminded that two years ago, she lost one of her seven kids to pneumonia after the little girl got drenched in a monsoon shower. On Tuesday morning, when it started raining, the street citizens knew it was the onset of the rainy season. Since shelters for the homeless are accommodating fewer than capacity due to Covid-19, these people know that they must cope with the wet weather themselves this year. Thousands of homeless people sleep on the footpaths and struggle when the rainy season hits the city.  While people are filled with a sense of elation to see photographs of street children dancing in the rain, the reality isn’t quite so elevating. The joy of rain is short-lived for the homeless. “We used to stay in a shelter home run by Delhi government, but were asked to vacate it when Covid broke out last year,” said Sushil, who begs for a living on Pankha Road. “We have been on the streets ever since. Some good people give us food and that is how we are surviving. We also sell balloons when we have money to buy them, but people are afraid of contracting the virus we are supposedly carrying, they don’t roll down their windows. If being a homeless person in the capital of India is so difficult, it must be really bad in other parts of the country.” A city-based welfare activist said, “All the homeless who survived the recent wave of Covid infections have done so with God’s grace. The government has to do something for their betterment. These are the set of people who are not capable of doing much for themselves, so it is our and the government’s responsibility to take care of them during tough times like now.” Hygiene and sanitation are also problems. The lack of permanent structures and cemented pathways at the shelters, often Portacabin fabrications, worsen the lacks because of the accumulation of water, which becomes a breeding spot for mosquitoes, further posing a risk of disease and infection among the homeless.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/its-no-season-of-joy-for-those-without-a-roof-over-their-head/articleshow/84391241.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Thiruvananthapuram||73-year-old woman tests positive for Zika in Thiruvananthapuram||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: One more Zika virus case was reported from the state capital taking the total cases to 19 in the state. The latest case has been reported on a 73-year-old woman who is undergoing treatment at a private hospital. However, five more samples which were sent for testing to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Alappuzha have been tested negative of Zika. Three people, including a 22-month-old child, were infected with the virus in Thiruvananthapuram on Sunday. All the 19 cases have been reported from the state capital so far. The central team, which is on a visit to the state to review the situation, has directed the government to strictly ensure mosquito control measures. Among the 19 cases, 14 are healthcare workers of a private hospital. They are residing at Nanthencode from where the water samples have been collected for testing. The central team had a discussion with Thiruvananthapuram district health administration and visited areas from where the Zika virus infection has been reported. “We have given specific instruction to test all the pregnant women who are coming with dengue or chikungunya symptoms. We have also given directive to all scanning centres in the district to report the suspected cases immediately to district health authorities,’’ said district medical officer Dr K S Shinu. When there is reporting of dengue and chikungunya cases, then there are chances of spreading Zika virus also as all these three are spread by the same mosquito. The health department has collected more samples from the people who have come into close contact with those who have been tested positive now and also from the people who are staying in the neighbourhood of these people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/73-year-old-woman-tests-positive-for-zika/articleshow/84357652.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Child labour rescue operations draw flak as parents cry foul||HYDERABAD: At a time when people are bracing for a possible third Covid-19 wave and medical experts have cautioned parents to keep their children safe and secure, residents of Old City say their children are being taken away as part of a drive to rescue child labourers. Parents alleged that many children were taken without any intimation from authorities. “We strongly condemn the police and child labour authorities’ action who blindly rushed to take my son away from us terming him a child labourer. Due to the pandemic, schools are shut and children step out to play with their friends. But terming my child as labourer and shifting him somewhere else is unacceptable and objectionable,” Asma Begum told TOI, whose son was shifted to Vijbai Bal Nivas at Shivrampally. Davinder Chary, in-charge of Vijbai Bal Nivas, told TOI that around 15 children were rescued from Rajendranagar Police Station limits on Friday and added that child rescue operations will go on for an entire month. “We rescued children from Rajendranagar on Friday. As far as the allegations are concerned, we will consider the matter and the children will be released on Monday,” he said. Telangana Telugu Desam Party (TTDP) hit out at the child rescue operations and termed it illegal. The party demanded that the government take immediate note of the issue as the children are unable to attend schools due to the pandemic. “Where the children are being taken is never disclosed to the parents. Police say call the labour and child welfare department, whereas Rajendranagar police have no clue. Such attitude deeply hurts worried parents and adds to their woes,” Mohammed Ahmed, TTDP minority vice-president told TOI. When contacted, a senior police officer said that several children were released on Monday and a few more would be released soon. “It’s often difficult to ascertain a genuine case from a false one. So once the confusion is cleared, the kids are released and actual labourers are rehabilitated,” said the officer. Many parents objected to the drive and sought clarification from authorities. “My son just stepped out to play with his friends and was gone the next minute. Before picking up any child, authorities must verify whether he/she is a child labourer or not,” another parent, Mohammed Haji, said. Many children were released after their parents were produced before the child welfare committee in Alkapuri on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/child-labour-rescue-operations-draw-flak-as-parents-cry-foul/articleshow/84357651.cms||---

RPF, the railways’ security wing, has undertaken the benevolent decision across the nation. The cell, comprising two women constables, has been asked to ensure the children of Covid victims are rescued with due care and counselled before being engaged in other formalities. The cops too have been trained in special counselling sessions, so as to ensure the children are being attended sensitively keeping in mind the trauma of the pandemic, which had left them shattered by claiming lives of their near ones. Senior RPF divisional security commissioner Ashutosh Pandey said the priority of special cell would be to counsel the Covid orphans first, before completing the rest of the due procedures of rescue and shelter. “The Covid orphans have witnessed the death of their parents, apart from the devastating effects of the pandemic which warrants them to be handled with much sensitive care and empathy,” he said during an online press conference last week. Pandey added, “Our RPF team would ensure the orphans are relieved of their trauma before presenting them to the child welfare committee, NGO interventions and so on.” He also said that RPF had been extra cautious about unattended or single children in the railway premises. It’s learnt that RPF’s Narkhed post in-charge had extended his assistance to two sisters who had lost their family members amid the pandemic. “The help was extended by RPF senior officers on humanitarian grounds, though there was no link of this case to railways,” said the RPF’s CR division chief. Pandey said though there were no Covid orphans traced in his division so far, RPF has in the last one year rescued around 32 other children from railways premises. Apart from the Covid orphans, RPF has also broached a special drive against ticketing agents resorting to illegal means for earning hefty commissions during the ongoing rush in the railways. “With the labourers returning to their native places like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, unscrupulous ticketing agents have started getting active, eyeing substantial commissions during this peak season. We have rounded up 10 ticketing agents and recovered e-tickets worth more than Rs1.25 lakh from them,” said Pandey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rpf-forms-special-cell-for-covid-orphans/articleshow/84360086.cms||Soumitra Bose

Venkatesan said a temporary worker of the corporation had lost his arm in an electric shock at his work place a few weeks ago. The commission wrote to the corporation to provide compensation to the worker and to take care of his treatment. However, no compensation was provided, said Venkatesan. When he reached Madurai, Venkatesan was told that conservancy workers were protesting at the corporation main building. He went there to hear their grievances . When he sought the commissioner to make himself available there at the earliest, Karthikeyan, who reached there insisted that a meeting could be held in a room. “The commissioner reached out to the protesters after a lot of hesitancy. However, he left abruptly even as I was talking to him. I am disappointed with his behaviour. I see this as a disrespect to the commission. He has not only disrespected me but also the entire conservancy workers community whom I represent,” he said. Drama prevailed as the chairman too joined the protest condemning the commissioner’s behaviour. Soon, the commissioner went to him and insisted that the discussion could be done in the conference hall. Later, the chairman left along with representatives of the protesters to take part in the meeting. Karthikeyan said he was hesitant to discuss the issue at the protest site and only insisted on a meeting to be conducted in the conference hall, where all the arrangements were in place since there could be security issues to the visitor. “I didn't mean to disrespect the chairman. There is no question of disrespecting the commission. I had to be cautious since I would be held responsible if something goes wrong in the crowd,” he said. The commissioner said he had assured he would do whatever feasible at his level to the demands raised by the conservancy workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-corpn-chief-accused-of-disrespecting-safai-karamcharis/articleshow/84360066.cms||---

The firms plan to combine scientific knowledge along with ancient medical practices like ayurveda to treat neurological and mental health issues. They hope the integrated approach will improve quality of life for patients with neuro-disabilities and mental health problems. The centre has created a range of interventions for pain, mental health, lifestyle and disability, said Dr Ennappadam S Krishnamoorthy of Buddhi Clinic. “Allopathy, along with traditional healing therapies, can restore equilibrium of the brain and mind interface. This integrated approach offers 14 non-pharmacological treatment modalities that are an amalgamation of modern science and ancient wisdom,” he said. The centre will offer patients the choice to curate integrated treatment programmes tailored to their specific needs. “We respect and understand each patient’s preferences and involve them in shared decision-making. We call it the ‘Choice’ model, which is better suited for mild impairment and chronic or progressive health conditions,” said Krishnamoorthy. Some of the services offered by the centre includes transcranial magnetic stimulation that helps to handle symptoms of depressions, transcranial direct current stimulation to treat brain injuries or severe neuropsychiatric disorders and transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation that stimulates the auricular branch of the vagus nerve that is believed to be a supplementary treatment for refractive epilepsy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/brain-mind-care-centre-opens-doors/articleshow/84360067.cms||---

But a few hours later, his family looked on, shocked, at his body covered in the muck in Amber fort. Jishan Khan (13) was the youngest victim of Sunday’s lightning strike that claimed 10 more lives in the area. He had gone out to play with his friend as usual and to gather fodder when the tragedy struck. While his friend escaped after managing to find shelter in one of the watchtowers, Jishan was not so lucky. At his home at Handipura area in Amber, neighbours and relatives poured in on Monday in large numbers to console grieving family members who were still in disbelief. SDRF team conducts a search operation near the watchtower at Amber fort in Jaipur on MondayAmidst hectic activities outside the SMS Hospital mortuary as family members and police waited for bodies to come out, a deafening silence suddenly subdued every sound when a weary-looking ward boy emerged from a small gate and shouted “Jishan, son of Ishak”. It was a call for family members to brace themselves as the kid’s body was now ready to be released. Jishan’s family members and uncle broke down as cops and local leaders held them in a long embrace.“He was very happy when he was recently promoted to Class 6. He kept asking us about when his school would open,” said Jishan’s brother Shahbaz. Jishan last spoke to his brother around 3pm on Sunday. “One of Jishan’s friends had come to our house. They used to go out and play regularly. He told me that he was going near Amber and will come back with 'chara' (fodder),” Shahbaz told TOI, adding that Jishan had promised to return home before dusk. Shahbaz, Jishan’s brother (yellow kurta) and relatives at their residence in HandipuraThe family became increasingly worried as dusk turned to night. There was no sign of him. The heavy downpour had turned the road into muck. “Pucho zara kab tak ayega (Ask him when will he return),” his father Ishak told his elder brother Shahbaz. Around 7pm, the entire neighborhood of Handipura, barely a kilometre away from the Amber hill where the incident took place, was alarmed when news started pouring in about screams and cries heard by people. Taufeeq, a local resident, decided to brave the heavy rains and slippery roads and climbed the steep stairs to help people stranded on the hill. “Jishan’s friend had sneaked into a little room inside the watchtower over the mountains. But my brother got stuck, there was no help," Shahbaz said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/like-every-day-jishan-went-out-to-play-never-to-return/articleshow/84360099.cms||Dishank Purohit

---||Chennai||Blind sexual harassment victim’s deposition is valid: Madras high court||CHENNAI: Merely because a victim of sexual harassment had visual disability, her evidence against the culprit cannot become inadmissible, said the Madras high court, awarding seven-year imprisonment to an autorickshaw driver who assaulted the woman. According to the prosecution, auto driver Anbu Selvan was hired to transport the victim to her music class. However, he kidnapped her to a secluded location and sexually harassed her besides trying to kill her if she did not cooperate. Challenging a trial court order awarding a seven-year jail term to him, Anbu Selvan moved the high court saying the victim’s evidence could not be relied upon since she was blind. Justice R M T Teekka Raman, however, termed Anbu Selvan as a ‘heartless person’ who had capitalised on the helpless situation of the visually challenged person and sexually assaulted her. He is not entitled to reduction of sentence, not even for a single day, the judge asserted. Citing circumstantial and other evidence, the judge said, “Merely because of the disability, evidence of disabled persons cannot be treated as inferior in nature.”  The victim’s version had vision, he said, confirming the sentence. Anbu Selvan said, “The identity of the accused was not proved in the manner known to law and since the witness (victim) is a blind, her evidence cannot be termed as eye witness if at all, can be termed only as a hearsay witness which is inadmissible in evidence.” The trial court convicted him for offences under sections 366 (kidnapping a woman), 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 506 (ii) (Criminal intimidation) of the IPC and Section 4 (harassment of woman) of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Woman Harassment Act primarily based on the evidence of the victim woman. Rejecting the argument, Justice Teekka Raman said, “The victim as a blind lacks vision, but her version had vision and hence, this court holds that the evidence of the victim is admissible in evidence.” The court then recommended the Tamil Nadu State Legal Services Authority to grant Rs 1 lakh as compensation to the victim under the Tamil Nadu Victim Compensation Scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-blind-sexual-harassment-victims-deposition-is-valid/articleshow/84360075.cms||---

We simply wanted to enjoy some time with friends and family. In our excitement we violated the Covid restrictions and we are apologetic. None in our family has ever been arrested, but my husband was put behind bars, had to hide his face like a criminal and was made to appear in court with a group of alleged thieves. The incident has left a deep impact on our mental health. We have learnt a lesson and won’t be partying or violating any other Covid restrictions in future,” said wife of one of the 37 arrested men.

She had alleged, once the bar had closed at 8pm, the hotel authorities had given them an option to buy a bottle and order some food and they would be given a room for free to party till late in the night. A special team of officers from Kolkata Police detective department had raided the hotel around 1.15am acting on a tip off. Among those arrested was a young Behala resident, who was allegedly involved in a scuffle, while trying to secure the seized cellphone of his friend. He has been charged with a stringent non bailable section of IPC 353 and was put in police custody with eight others. They would be produced before the court again on Friday. “Stuck at home for weeks we had planned a get together with friends. We are not criminals. My friend, who is behind bars is a teacher and was trying to get my cellphone which was seized when I was making a video of the raid. We were not even partying on the corridor. We were sitting in a room allotted to us by the hotel and drinking. It was a lesson learnt.

Even road-side vendors to panwalas have switched to the no-touch mode of money transfer. “Most of the customers first inquire whether we have the facility for digital payment before placing the order. Earlier, we preferred cash but as the number of customers asking for payment through digital mode has increased, we had to provide them with the facility. Now, you can see customers paying even Rs 10 digitally,” said Suresh, who has a pan shop in Shahpura.If the smaller shops are doing their job with the QR code, bigger shops have POS machines, in addition to QR codes, to facilitate digital payment. “Payment through digital mode has picked up progressively,”' said owner of a medical shop in Arera Colony. “I had never anticipated that liquor shops too would have POS machines and people would make the payments digitally but it’s happening. Any other shop may or may not have the POS machines but most of the liquor shops in the city have and a lot of people, particularly the high-end customers make payment through their debit cards,” said Vijay Rathore, an entrepreneur.Manager of a public sector bank, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Use of digital platforms like UPI, RTGS and NIFT for transfer of money has been consistently rising. Customers are using these for transfer of money rather than withdrawing cash. Net banking is also in vogue. Yes, there is a section, which is skeptical. They feel that their accounts will be hacked or they could fall prey to fraudsters, if they use net banking or other digital modes of payment but otherwise, digital mode of payment has risen significantly and it continues to rise, particularly among the youngsters.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/no-touch-payments-gain-fizz-as-many-say-no-to-cash/articleshow/84357668.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Mayawati on Monday tweeted, “Vidhaanasabha aam chunaav ke kareeb aane par hi iss prakaar kee kaarravaee logon ke man mein sandeh paida karatee hai. Agar iss kaarravaee ke peechhe sachchaee hai to police itane dinon tak kyon bekhabar rahee? yah vah savaal (This type of action just before UP state assembly elections creates doubts in the minds of the people. If there is truth behind this action, then why was the police oblivious for so long? This is the question people are asking).” Therefore, the government should not take any such action which will increase the unrest among the public, she added. Even former chief minister and Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav had on Sunday commented on the matter. “I can’t trust the actions of the Uttar Pradesh police and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government in the state,” he had said. In the swearing-in ceremony of zila panchayat president, Maurya said that the state government is working on a plan in which zila panchayat president and block pramukh will be elected directly by the public from the next elections. He added, “The use of money and muscle power makes the situation very bad because of which planning is being done in this direction.” Speaking on the proposed new population control policy of the Yogi government, Maurya said, “Population explosion is a serious problem and the opposition’s protest in not correct. The government has started efforts to control the population.” He also brushed aside the opposition’s criticism of the policy and said that the opposition should not link the same to elections. The deputy CM said, “As the people of the state have elected the BJP government, it has full right to take decisions till the last day of its tenure.” Maurya said, “Elections will come and go, but the basic mantra is development which should not stop and there should be an all-round development.” He advised the newly constituted zila panchayat to move forward on the issue of development. Newly elected zila panchayat president VK Singh requested for a bridge between Handia and Manda, on which the deputy CM said that this bridge will be constructed as well as Prayagraj would be getting several gifts of bridges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/maya-akhilesh-doing-politicsof-appeasement-says-maurya/articleshow/84359462.cms||Rajeev Mani

This has caused great inconvenience to all those going to work. They travel daily under difficult circumstances and other modes of transport are more expensive and time consuming,” said party spokesperson Keshav Upadhye. Meanwhile, Opposition leader in the legislative council Praveen Darekar said he had received a call from CM Uddhav Thackeray on Monday to discuss resumption of train services for all. “The chief minister was positive about allowing all Mumbaikars to commute by locals,” he said. Upadhye alleged there was growing fear among citizens that non-resumption of train services was a means to promote private transport. “The government must compensate people on account of the railways being inaccessible for them. The Rs 7,000 crore set aside for vaccines must be given to the public as transport allowance,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-start-locals-for-all-or-pay-rs-5k-allowance-demands-bjp/articleshow/84360143.cms||---

A part of Tata Garden at Breach Candy will be gone as the civic body claims that there is no way to change the alignment of the coastal road. During a meeting held with residents on Friday, BMC officials said that irrespective of where the first interchanger of the coastal road is located, Tata Garden stands to be affected. While 61 trees will be cut, 79 will be transplanted. A large portion of the 1.06 acre garden is slated to make way for the first interchange of the proposed coastal road which will exit towards this garden, carrying traffic headed to Malabar Hill, Peddar Road, and Mahalaxmi. During a protest held by residents on July 4, BMC officials turned up at the venue, promising to hold a dialogue with them over the issue. Assistant municipal commissioner of ‘D’ ward, Prashant Gaikwad who was present at the meeting with residents, said that they explained to the residents that an alternative suggested by them (residents) was not implementable and that one extra lane cutting through the garden was needed for traffic coming from the coastal road. Activist Zoru Bhathena who attended the meeting said, “The BMC said that irrespective of where the exit junction is located, one lane of Tata Garden will still be cut. They also showed us that moving the location of the exit would in future lead to a problem regarding the flow of traffic. They asked us if we would want to save a few trees just to compromise on a good exit flow plan. Frankly, we didn’t have an answer,” Bhathena said. “BMC officials said they wanted to show us that they had tried and done their best,” he said. Bhathena added that of the 79 trees that will be transplanted, residents plan to plant 20 of them back into the garden instead of relocating them elsewhere. Chief engineer for the coastal road project, Vijay Nighot, said that 36% of work on the coastal road has been completed and 500mt of tunnelling work is done. “The suggestion to transplant trees was not feasible as work on reclaimed land is to be completed. We have informed the contractor to ensure the soil on reclaimed land is feasible for plantation,” said Nighot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/tata-garden-to-wilt-away-as-bmc-says-it-cant-tweak-coastal-rd-plan/articleshow/84362077.cms||Richa Pinto

Unidentified assailants fired three bullets at a history-sheeter identified as Aakash Andhewar, but he managed to escape. The incident is suspected to be a revenge attack following murder of a criminal Suraj Bahuriya, who was shot dead in broad daylight in Ballarpur town in August last year. CCTV footage of Monday’s incident, which has gone viral, shows two assailants, one of them wearing veil usually worn by Muslim women, came into Raghuwanshi shopping complex located in the heart of city.

Though injured, Andhewar ran for his life on the road running parallel to Azad Garden and took shelter in a mobile shop. The assailants pursued him for some time, but fled as the crowd of onlookers started to swell. Ramnagar police team rushed to the spot and shifted the injured Andhewar to civil hospital. He was then referred to Nagpur after primary medication. SP Arvind Salve and SDPO Sheelwant Nandedkar too visited the spot and inspected the scene. The murder bid is suspected to be outcome of rivalry among the coal mafia that had led to murder of kingpin Suraj Bahuriya in Ballarpur last year. Andhewar was main accused in the Bahuriya murder case and is leant to be out on bail. He was avoiding going to Ballarpur following threat to his life, but the rival gang tracked him in Chandrapur and tried to kill him.

More importantly, cops with the help of newly elected gram Pradhans would also be taking up a mega awareness campaign for not burying bodies on the banks of Ganga and take up proper cremation of bodies. Inspector-General of police ( Prayagraj range) K P Singh told TOI, "we have drafted a blueprint to keep the banks of Ganga clean and green”. He added, "We have prepared a list of 283 villages located on the banks of Ganga in four districts of the range including Prayagraj ( 200), Kaushambi (23), Pratapgarh (18) and Fatehpur (42) and are engaging newly elected gram Pradhan to create a mass level awareness campaign in 283 villages so that bodies should be created properly. The police have compiled data of newly elected gram pradhans of those villages located on banks of Ganga in four districts of the range and Thana cops concerned are contacting and consulting them for the novel mission. Claiming that none of the bodies of Covid-19 victims was buried in the sand of Ganga during the second wave of Covid and that the bodies were cremated at a separate ghat (Phaphamau), IG said that development agencies including Prayagraj Municipal Corporation (PMC) are currently taking up a campaign to cremate bodies that were exposed due to strong water current of Ganga in the ongoing monsoon season. Over 100 such bodies were cremated in Prayagraj district so for.

---||Allahabad||ABAP backs state’s new population control policy||Prayagraj: Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP), the apex decision-making body of the 13 recognised Hindu religious akharas or monastic orders of the country, has supported the proposed new population policy being brought by the Yogi government. “Population explosion is a matter of deep concern. The government should come out with a strict law to control the population and the same should be binding on every citizen living in the state as well as the entire country,” ABAP president Mahant Narendra Giri said in a statement issued to the media on Monday. Giri said, “The rapid population explosion in the country and the state is also the reason for many major problems. Therefore, it is very important that the ever-increasing population should be stopped immediately.” The ABAP chief appealed to the Muslim religious leaders to “accept the proposed law with sincerity and make people of their religion aware of the need of having fewer children”. “The increase in population is directly affecting the quality of education and medical system in the country and the state. On the other hand, Muslim religious leaders are calling a child ‘gift of Allah’. The law on controlling population should be so strict that if a third child is born to any couple, they should not have the right to vote nor the right to contest elections. Also, Aadhaar cards should not be issued to such people,” ABAP president demanded. Giri asserted, “Three marriages are allowed in Muslim society, so wives may be three, but children should be only two in the entire family.” He further demanded that those having three children should also be deprived of all the schemes of the government. “Only then can this law be strictly followed in the true sense,” he added. “The growing population of the country is the biggest issue, so people of all religions can get rid of this problem together. Caste and religion should not be brought in the middle of population control steps. Rather, considering it as a challenge, everyone should follow the law being brought for population control,” he said. The Uttar Pradesh State Law Commission released the first draft of the proposed population control bill — titled The Uttar Pradesh Population (Control, Stabilization and Welfare) Bill, 2021 — on Friday which has provisions to debar people who have more than two children from the benefits of government schemes and perks to those who follow the two-child policy. Further, anyone violating two-child policy in the state will be debarred from contesting local bodies elections, from applying for or getting promotion in government jobs, and receiving any kind of government subsidy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/abap-backs-states-new-population-control-policy/articleshow/84359412.cms||---

Surgery will be performed for them in one month,” S Sridhar, head of the endocrinology department at GRH said. GRH is the second government hospital in the state after the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital in Chennai to have a dedicated clinic for the third gender, where specialists from various departments will be available to attend to the transgenders. Delay in performing sex reassignment surgery at GRH has been a cause for concern among the third gender. Transgender activist Bharathi Kannamma is among those who have been raising voice against the delay in commencing the surgery as it is turns out expensive in the private sector, pushing those who undergo the surgery into debt and flesh trade to repay the loans. Sridhar, coordinator of the transgender clinic said, “The surgery is a staged process spanning over a period of one year.

During investigation, it came to fore that the man did this just because his wife had been refusing to come back from her maternal home for the past one year. As per the complainant, Kanchan Devi, she was married to Asharam Dohre, a resident of village panchayat Karaundshah Nagar of Umarda development block, of the district in 2011. “In the year 2016, a house was allotted to them under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. In the process, they had received a sum of Rs 1.20 lakh for getting a house constructed from the government. Later, the house was built,” said block development sources going by the woman’s complaint. Kanchan further stated in her complaint that since then, her husband started routinely torturing her and their children after consuming liquor. “He used to beat her and their son often under the influence of alcohol. Peeved over which, she had gone to her maternal home about a year ago with their children,” she added in her complaint.

Shrikala, however, termed the Sunday evening police action as ‘nothing serious’. Dhananjay is wanted for alleged involvement as conspirator in the sensational murder of history-sheeter Ajit Singh in Lucknow on January 6. Lucknow police had also announced a cash reward of Rs 25,000 on him. On July 6, he was declared absconder by the CJM court, Lucknow. In a follow-up action, a team of Vibhuti Khand police station reached Jaunpur on Sunday. A team of Lucknow police reached the house of Dhananjay in s Bansafa village under the limits of Skirara police station of Jaunpur on Sunday evening and pasted the attachment notice issued under 82 CrPC (proclamation for person absconding) and returned. Men in khaki also completed the formality of ‘munadi’ (announcement) that if Dhananjay does not surrender in a given time, his property will be confiscated, SO Sikrara Ashwini Kumar Dubey informed TOI on Monday. A few hours after the action, Dhananjay’s wife Shrikala Reddy was administered the oath of zila panchayat chairman by district magistrate Manish Kumar Verma at Jaunpur district collectorate headquarters on Monday morning.

The state government will extend all support to honest traders and take action against dishonest traders, the minister said. He appealed to traders to help the government find spurious players. “Representatives from Tirupur have sought a separate commercial tax office in the district. Their request will be taken to the knowledge of the chief minister. Opinions and demands related to GST were obtained from the representatives and steps will be taken to convey them to the GST council,” Moorthy said. “Directions were given to officials to regularly monitor works of the commercial tax department. Steps are being taken to involve officials other than flying squad to involve in field work. To ensure transparency in the registration department, officials from the headquarters will monitor works in all sub-registrar offices and a control room has been set up to address public grievances.” As MSMEs are affected due to the pandemic, it would be helpful if relaxations are provided under taxation laws, said a petition from Codissia president M V Ramesh Babu. “Reliefs like time relaxation for furnishing documents for VAT/CST assessments or on pending audits were sought under the Tamil Nadu Value Added Tax Act, 2006, the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 and the current goods tax. Under GST, relaxations like increase in turnover criteria for registration and taxability to Rs 1 crore, input tax credit benefit for constructing industrial and factory buildings should be given.” The exercise of assigning circle or assessment officer to all tax payers should be completed, said a statement from the Federation of Coimbatore Industrial Associations (Focia). “Steps should be taken to withdraw the draconian rule, which allows the GST intelligence wing to question anyone even if they do not fall under their home circle. Every tax payer should be dealt only in their home circle.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/minister-assures-all-possible-help-for-smooth-conduct-of-business/articleshow/84360137.cms||---

In metro cities some hospitals received Covishield lot at their doorstep within 72 hours of placing orders. Not many smaller set-ups, though keen, would still be able to be part of the vaccination drive because of minimum procurement norms. The minimum quantity that can be ordered is 6,000 doses said to be worth Rs37 lakh. The idea of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) facilitating the vaccine procurement for such hospitals was under consideration. But it was dropped as hospitals apprehended this would cause a delay of over a month in getting the delivery. Dr BK Murali, director of Hope and Ayushman hospitals, attempted to find a solution by forming a consortium to place a big order on behalf of all small hospitals. The effort couldn’t come through. “The consortium is not working out as per government norms. Small hospitals may not be able to pay Rs37lakh. We had inquired if say four hospitals could place one order and then divide the doses. But it was not allowed. Every vaccination centre is seeing huge rush. People are worried and want to get vaccinated but not enough doses are available. At least 200 small hospitals are unable to procure vaccines,” said Dr Murali adding that the capping should be removed. Dr Anup Marar, director, Orange City Hospital and Research Institute, welcomed the opening of portal and wished to get quick delivery. “After a prolonged delay, the Covid vaccine payment portal for private hospitals in Co-Win at last opened a few days back. As guided by the portal, we have duly remitted the applicable Rs630 per dose charges for the fixed procurement quantity stated there. However, we are not sure about the supply time or delivery mechanism as to whether it will be routed through state government or directly by Serum Institute of India. We are keeping our fingers crossed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pvt-hosps-unsure-of-vax-delivery-time-min-order-norm-a-hurdle/articleshow/84355522.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The 23-year-old survivor had managed to climb a tree nearby and spent the entire night there even as the big cat made several failed attempts to strike at him. Vikas (who only uses his first name) gathered the courage to come down from the tree only after he saw local residents pass by the next morning. “We informed police and forest department after we saw the man, terrified and barely able to speak. A bike was lying nearby and next to it was a body. There were claw marks on the tree that saved the man’s life,” said Rajendra Prasad, a local resident. The attack occurred on Sunday night when Kandhai Lal (35) was returning along with his nephew Sonu Kumar (22) and his friend Vikas after meeting his in-laws in Jalalpur village in Shahjahanpur. According to the forest department, the men were in an inebriated state and were warned by the forest guard about tiger movement in the area along the 10km long link road. “Movement of three tigers had been recorded by our staff in this particular beat of the forest and the victims were cautioned as well but they ignored the warning,” deputy director of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve Naveen Khandelwal told TOI. The bodies — one of them partially-eaten — have been sent for autopsy while Vikas is recovering in a hospital. “The man had a cellphone on him but since there is no network in the area, he spent the night on the tree. He is in shock and keeps losing consciousness. We will record his statement once he is able to talk,” said Khandelwal. The deputy director said the attack was “unusual” since tigers don’t attack moving vehicles. “Either the victims saw the animal on the road and lost balance after which it pounced on them or they must have stopped their bike for some reason,” he said, adding that the area hasn’t recorded big cat attacks in the past few years. Since the incident has taken place inside the reserve forest area, the victims will not be entitled for compensation, according to the official. “We are now sensitising locals to refrain from taking the road after dark,” he said. Twenty camera traps have been set up to monitor the area. “We have recovered pug marks of two tigers while combing the area. The camera trap monitoring will provide more information as the tiger is expected to return to the spot,” said Khandelwal. Last month, two bikers in Nepanagar town, 320km from Bhopal, had managed to fend off a leopard attack by throwing a two-pound cake on the animal's face.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/tiger-kills-2-bikers-in-up-third-survives-the-night-by-climbing-tree/articleshow/84355556.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The load test of the elevated civil structure has also started on the Priority Corridor. This assessment is carried out with the weight of about one and a quarter times (1.25 times) the weight of the part of the train that falls on the girder considering that the entire train is fully occupied with passengers. In Kanpur, this test will be conducted with a weight of about 248 tons. Congratulating the Metro project engineers on the commencement of load test on the Priority Corridor, UPMRC MD Kumar Keshav said, “Kanpur Metro project is being constructed as per the international standards where top notch technology and raw materials are being used. UPMRC has commenced the load test on the Priority Corridor which has a major significance considering the trial run to be held in November this year.” For load testing the weight-bearing capacity of the Metro structure will be checked all through the process of testing. Sacks filled with sand will be placed on the viaduct of the Metro structure. The prescribed weight will be put on the viaduct in five stages and the effects on the Metro structure will be then noted and analysed. The Priority Corridor of the Kanpur Metro Rail Project is fully elevated and there are mainly three types of girders that have been used to prepare the viaduct — U-Girder, I-Girder, and Steel Box Girder. The ‘Load Test’ will be processed on I-Girders between IIT-K and Kalyanpur, while U-Girders and Steel Box Girders will be tested in Rawatpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/kanpur-metro-project-load-test-on-prioriy-corridor-commences/articleshow/84358955.cms||Abhinav Malhotra
---||Nagpur||66% RTE admissions done in Nagpur; many schools boycott it||NAGPUR: In Nagpur district, around 65% of RTE admissions have been completed, according to data released by the education department. Many schools, however, have decided to boycott the process till their demand for pending reimbursements is fulfilled by the government. RTE quota admissions are for 25% of a class capacity and the selection plus seat allotment process is handled by the state government. After seat allotment is done, the student has to complete the admission process by physically submitting required documents (birth certificate etc) to the school. In district this academic year, 5,611 students were selected through online lottery draw. By Monday, 3,805 students had completed the admission process. In Nagpur, there are still many schools who are boycotting the admission process either directly or indirectly. The latter method is by delaying the admission by citing some or the other irregularity, of which distance is a key reason. In RTE, priority for admission is given to the student who resides closest to the school of his/her choice. It’s common for parents to provide fake address proof through rental agreements and avail of free admission in big brand CBSE schools. Rajendra Dayma, former president and executive member of Independent English Schools Association (IESA), said, “For the last so many years, the government has been delaying payment either in full or part of many of our members. So this year, we have made up our minds that till our past dues are cleared, we shall not complete admission process.” Sachin Kalbande, founder-president of RTE Foundation, said, “The state government is not releasing complete corpus of funds which are being sent by the Centre. I found out through RTI that the central government pays over and above the amount which the state pays to us. We recently met education minister Varsha Gaikwad and apprised her of the situation.” Kalbande claimed that the education minister agreed to release Rs200 crore to schools. However, no such GR has been issued so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/66-rte-admissions-done-in-dist-many-schools-boycott-it/articleshow/84355507.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Bhopal||Private schools to move HC, to start online classes from today in Madhya Pradesh||BHOPAL: After suspending online classes on Monday, private schools in the state have decided to move the high court against the government decision to keep the campuses closed till the fear of the third wave ends. Schools have also decided to resume online classes from Tuesday. Private schools in Madhya Pradesh had threatened to stop online classes from July 12. Vice president, Madhya Pradesh Association of Un- aided Private Schools, Vinny Raj Modi claimed that majority of the schools in the state capital and other parts of the state did not conduct online classes. Asked the reason for moving the court, Modi said, “We are neither against the students nor the parents. By keeping the classes shut students would suffer. We are fighting against the state government and its decisions regarding schools.” He added that online classes will resume. “We will make our point in the court. Online classes will resume from July 13.” Meanwhile, several schools had postponed exams as they did not conduct online classes on Monday. Modi said that for the past 18 months, all business sectors have been affected by the pandemic, but school education has been affected the most. "Except the students of class 9 to 12, who have attended school for 2-3 months, all other students are deprived of education for the last 16 months. Due to this, not only their education but also their mental and physical development is being harmed," claimed Modi. "After the second wave of Covid, while on one hand the government has restored business and services by relaxing every sector, the educational institutions continue to be closed. Children are going alone or with their parents to markets, malls, weddings, picnics, fairs, excursions and others. Only going to school is prohibited," said Modi. Schools have also objected to the state govt decision that private schools will not increase the fees in this session also, and only the tuition fee from the students would be charged. "The announcement made by the chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has shaken the teachers, students, parents and educationists of the entire state. Everyone is aggrieved by the partisan (step-motherly) attitude of the government," alleged Modi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/private-schools-to-move-hc-to-start-online-classes-from-today/articleshow/84357760.cms||Ramendra Singh

This was followed by some of the regional brands too hiking the prices. The prices have been revised after a gap of one and a half year. It’s not due to fall in milk production rather the dairy industry is blaming it on the rising fuel costs. The overall milk production has been stable. But the cost of production at the farmers’ end has gone up. The basic factor is the increase in diesel prices which has led to a sizeable increase in the prices of cattle feed. It has also made transportation costly for the dairy plants. Narrowing margins of the milk producers has led to an increase in procurement price by dairies. Even the input cost at the milk processing units’ end has gone up leading to an increase in MRP of milk packets ultimately, say industry sources. Anoop Kumar, the state’s principal secretary (animal husbandry department ), said the rise is not due to the milk production but due to rising input costs. Milk production from organized sector stands in the range of 1.32 crore to 1.25 crore litres a day in the state. This is very much in lines with the normal average with no drastic drop seen in the output. RS Sodhi, managing director of Gujarat Completive Milk Marketing Federation, also said that the milk output was stable and the flow was increased towards cooperatives as private players had cut down on procurement. Industry sources say apart from normal milk production, there is also a sizeable carry forward stock of the last year. This is in form of white butter and milk powder. These are raw material for making ice-creams. Last two years saw a poor demand for ice-creams. Even this May saw a lukewarm demand for ice-cream, leading to the stock of milk powder and butter piling up. Since the items can be stored, they can be used in the coming years. Anil Upadhyaya from Dinshaw’s Dairy said it’s not only the procurement price that has gone up but even the landed cost to the dairy industry has increased by Rs 3 to Rs 4 a litre. “The cost of cattle feed has increased by Rs 30 a quintal. The production is normal as compared to the season. Not only this, there is a surplus of raw materials for ice-cream like white butter and powder. Dinshaw’s alone is sitting on 500 tonne of additional white butter,” he said. A source in Haldiram’s also confirmed that the milk prices have been hiked by Rs 2. It was mainly because of diesel prices which is affecting the cost of logistics, said the source. The price rise was needed to keep the margins intact, say industry sources. A source in Mother Dairy said procurement price is Rs 25 for cow milk and Rs 40.50 for buffalo milk. The latter has been increased by one rupee. A statement issued from Mother Dairy said the company has been experiencing inflationary pressure on the overall input costs. Even the milk production has been affected due to the pandemic. Farm prices of milk have increased by 8% to 10% coupled by mounting operational cost which includes cost towards processing, logistics and packaging. The increase in cost was however not passed on to the consumer for one year, the company said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rising-diesel-cost-drives-milk-prices-up-by-rs2/ltr/articleshow/84355543.cms||Shishir Arya

The arbitral proceeding had arisen out of a “player representation agreement” of 2003 under which Percept was to act as the sole manager and agent of Ganguly for five years in respect of defined and commercial rights. Percept, through its lawyers Shardul Singh and Parag Khandhar, informed HC it will disclose assets of the two companies by July 20 and maintain status quo of their assets and bank accounts. Ganguly’s counsel Birendra Saraf, Samrat Sen with advocate Ishwar Nankani sought to enforce an award dated December 9, 2018, including the interest on it and sought orders including for disclosure by Percept of its assets. Justice A K Menon, in his ad-interim order, said “Singh who appears for the respondents fairly states that he has instructions to submit to the orders” in terms of two clauses except to spend Rs 15,000 towards payment of auditor’s fees and statutory fees, which the high court permitted. The HC directed Percept to file affidavit-of-disclosure “by a director of each of the companies.” The HC order said that “Inspection shall be granted on July 23, 2021, without fail.” The court will hear the matter again on July 26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sourav-ganguly-gets-interim-reprieve-from-high-court-in-rs-36cr-legal-dispute/articleshow/84360214.cms||Swati Deshpande

He will be meeting party functionaries and some prominent persons to strengthen the party in the state and review the preparation and strategies for the 2022 assembly polls. During his visit, a couple of politicians are likely to join AAP on Wednesday, sources in the party said. “Goa wants change. Enough of parties buying and selling MLAs. Enough of dirty politics. Goa wants development. There is no shortage of funds, only shortage of honest intent. Goa wants honest politics. See you in Goa tomorrow,” Kejriwal tweeted on Monday. The party launched ‘Lets clean Goa politics’ ten days prior to his arrival. “Goa needs freedom from the corrupt policies and practices of traditional parties. Both BJP and Congress have played with the sentiments of Goans, The buyer–seller relation of BJP & Congress needs to end,” said AAP Goa convener Rahul Mhambre. AAP-Goa vice-president Surel Tilve said the two traditional parties are hand in glove and their their agents have looted Goa and said the party would fulfil the dreams of political stalwarts in Goa. “Arvind Kejriwal ji is coming to change the politics of Goa. Goans are fed up of opportunism, family raj and defections, and they need real development. BJP and Congress have not fulfilled the dreams of Goa, the dreams envisaged by stalwarts like Bhausaheb Bandodkar, Jack Sequeira and Manohar Parrikar. Now Aam Aadmi Party will fulfill their dreams,” Tilve said. AAP-Goa vice-president Pratima Coutinho said Kejriwal’s visit to Goa is a good opportunity for young leaders to learn from him and his pro-people policies. “Goa is ready for a change, a change that is much needed, and only AAP can bring it,” she said. “It is time to end the politics of betrayal and defections, it is time to start a new era of politics and governance in Goa,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/delhi-cm-in-goa-today-calls-for-freedom-from-bjp-cong/articleshow/84360175.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Reopening of schools in Maharashtra only after colleges, says Rajesh Tope||AURANGABAD: State health minister Rajesh Tope on Monday said the reopening of schools could be considered only after colleges begin classes. He said minors cannot be inoculated with the Covid vaccines presently available. “Once colleges restart, only then should schools be considered for reopening,” Tope said in Jalna while launching the statewide drive for inoculating infants with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV). Tope said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will take an appropriate decision regarding reopening of schools. “We are currently vaccinating people in the 18-44 age group, and so there seems no harm in starting colleges wherever vaccinations are underway. But we cannot inoculate minors, or say that we are not inoculating them. Minors are more vulnerable to getting infected. Hence, colleges should first be started and later schools can be reopened step by step,” he said. Speaking about PCV, he said that as per an estimate, 15.9% children up to five years of age succumb to pneumonia. “The vaccination is being carried out as per the latest directives of the World Health Organisation for inoculating children aged below one,” he said. Tope said PCV is effective in preventing pneumonia as well as encephalitis, which are among the major concerns in infants and minors. The second PCV dose should be taken three-and-a-half months after the first while the third dose is to be taken after a gap of 9-12 months. A dose of PCV costs around Rs 7,500 in the open market but is given for free to children at all rural and primary health centres and other government facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-reopening-of-schools-in-state-only-after-colleges-says-tope/articleshow/84360182.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Goa||Goa: ‘Resolve confusion over Congress party leadership’, says former power minister Alexio Sequeira.||PANAJI: The Congress high command needs to settle the confusion over the state party president as soon as possible so that there is clarity among partymen who are gearing up for the 2022 assembly elections, said former power minister Alexio Sequeira. “I believe the party should resolve the issue once and for all about Girish Chodankar,” said Sequeira. “He has submitted his resignation. The party should either accept it or reject it and put to rest all the confusion. Today people are confused.” Sequeira expressed confidence that Congress would win a majority and form the government in 2022. “The party will rule the state from 2022 for five years. The Congress has learnt from its mistakes,” he said. He also said that the party has to “pull up its socks” and work hard as the Congress voter cannot be taken for granted. He said it is wrong to conclude that the party is not preparing itself for the 2022 assembly polls, saying that unlike the past, this time, the high command has deputed its observers nearly a year before the polls. He also said that there is confusion in all political parties and that a wrong impression is being created that Congress is not preparing for polls, which he said is completely wrong. Sequeira said that he is willing to contest the coming elections from Nuvem if the party entrusted him with a ticket. In 2017, Congress denied him a ticket and opted for Wilfred D’Sa who later joined BJP along with nine other Congress MLAs. Sequeira said if he is not given the ticket, he would not rebel against the party. “If they don’t give me the ticket, I will still be propagating Congress. In 2017, I was denied the ticket, but I didn’t contest against the party. Henceforth, the party will think ten times before giving anyone the ticket,” he said. He said he had taken sanyas after he was denied ticket in 2017, but later then state Congress president late Shantaram Naik and others pleaded with him to work for the party. On the possiblity of alliance, he said the high command will decide on it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/resolve-confusion-over-congress-party-leadership/articleshow/84360197.cms||---

Instead, the cabinet decided to extend their tenure by a month, till July 31. The advocate general had sought tenure extension of 16 special government pleaders, 43 senior government pleaders and 53 government pleaders in the high court as well as KAT for the smooth conduct of cases until the next set of lawyers are appointed to these posts. The tenure of existing officials would end on June 30. The advocate general wrote to the government that 100 applications have been received from lawyers to consider them for the post. In order to complete the selection of new special, senior and government pleaders, it would take at least three more months and till then the services of the existing team should be allowed to continue, the AG had said in his letter. Government pleaders are appointed on the basis of Kerala government law officers (appointment and conditions of service) and conduct of cases, rules, 1978. They are appointed for a tenure of three years, after which the rules allow the extension of their tenure by another three more years, on which the state cabinet takes a call. When the matter was submitted to the CM by the law minister, he instructed that the matter be placed before the cabinet, but for extending the tenure by one more month and not three. Sources said that till the selection and appointment of new set of lawyers are completed, government cases are likely to get stalled for the want of government pleaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-nixes-ags-plea-for-tenure-extensions/articleshow/84357823.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Can enact law on intra-state terrorism, says Gujarat high court||AHMEDABAD: The state government on Monday defended its legislation on terrorism, the Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organised Crime (GujCTOC) Act, asserting before the Gujarat high court that intra-state terrorism can be a state subject. Advocate general Kamal Trivedi was arguing to defend the constitutional validity of GujCTOC against various petitions and contentions including that the subject of terrorism is dealt with by central laws and the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) takes care of the subject. The state government’s legislative competence to enact such a law has been questioned. In reply, the state government submitted that when the law mentions the word terrorism, it is not international or cross-border terrorism, but it is terrorism that arises within the boundary of the state the state legislature can take care of law and order issues within its territory and forces that intend to overthrow the government. “Waging war against the state, which is treated as the highest pedestal, is within the state subject. Terrorism comes thereafter. Why cannot intra-state terrorism be a state subject?” advocate Trivedi asked. The state law officer submitted that the state government cannot enact a law for security and sovereignty of the nation, but it can do so for security within the state boundaries and to deal with a matter that disrupts public order. He also questioned why terrorism within the state borders cannot be included in the definition of public order. The advocate general also rebutted submissions of the petitioners citing Supreme Court orders. He said picking up one line and putting it out of context is not a proper way to interpret the order. The state government asserted that the legislation on terrorism in GujCTOC is in the pith and substance of the enactment on organised crime, and constitutional provisions support such enactment. He insisted that two legislations on the same issue can operate simultaneously, even when it is assumed for a moment that the state law encroaches upon the central law. In this case, the encroachment is incidental and inconsequential. The HC is likely to hear further on this subject on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/can-enact-law-on-intra-state-terrorism/articleshow/84360297.cms||---

A purported video of his statement is going viral on social media, wherein the senior politician could be heard asking the ministers of the government to “first reveal about their legitimate and illegitimate children”. The veracity of the video is, however, yet to be established. In the purported video, Khurshid says that before the population control law, the government should tell how many children its ministers have. “First they should declare how many of their children are legitimate and how many are illegitimate. I will also declare how many I have and then it should be discussed.” In the video, he also said as far as treatment of coronavirus is concerned, he has heard of black fungus, but the government played black jokes with the public. Taking a jibe at India-Pakistan relations, he said that relations with Pakistan were good only when “Modi Ji went to Pakistan”. “What did he say in his (then PM of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif) ear with a hug and what did he say in Modi Ji’s ear. This should also be revealed by Modi Ji,” the former Union minister added. Sources have informed TOI that the video was shot while he was talking to reporters during his visit to his native place in Farrukhabad a couple of days ago. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday unveiled the new population policy 2021-30, on the occasion of World Population Day. The State Law Commission has also prepared the draft of the Uttar Pradesh Population (Control, Stabilization, and Welfare) Bill-2021, on which the public can give suggestions till July 19. According to the proposal, parents who limit their family to only two children and are in government service and undergoing voluntary sterilization will be given facilities like two additional increments, promotion, exemption in government housing schemes, increasing employer contribution in PF. There are also provisions to provide exemptions in water, electricity, house tax, home loan, and other such facilities to couples with two children who are not in government jobs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/khurshid-attacks-up-govt-on-new-population-control-policy/articleshow/84358994.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Four arrested for murdering DySP’s father in Narmada||VADODARA: The Narmada police have arrested four persons for murdering a 70-year-old man, a resident of Mangu village in Tilakwada taluka. The victim Sanabhai Bariya is father of a cop who recently got promoted to deputy superintendent rank. According to the police, Sanabhai had helped a youngster in getting a loan from a farmer last year. Sanabhai kept asking the youngster to return the money and even had arguments with him. On July 8, four men gathered in the field where Sanabhai was present and assaulted him. The accused hit Sanabhai with a spade causing injuries to his head. To mislead the cops and show that Sanabhai died in road accident, the accused disposed off his body near Pahad village. They even abandoned the Sanabhai’s two-wheeler at the same spot. The Narmada local crime branch (LCB) swung into action after the body was recovered on July 10. On the basis of tip-off, they nabbed four men including Altaf Ghori, Saddam Hussain Ghori, Rameez Khan Hussain and Ashraf Khan Ghori, all residents of Tilakwada. The accused told the cops that Sanabhai had helped Altaf’s friend in getting a loan last year. But Altaf’s friend wasn’t returning the money and hence Sanabhai got into arguments with Altaf who then decided to kill Sanabhai. Sanabhai’s son R S Bariya had served as police inspector in Panigate, Harni and Fatehgunj police station in the city. He recently got promoted as DySP and is posted in Rajkot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/four-arrested-for-murdering-dysps-father-in-narmada/articleshow/84355575.cms||---

The incident occurred in Khurja town of Bulandshahr district where the accused, Pawan, worked at a brick kiln. He has been arrested. The woman who sustained 40% burns told police that she was in a relationship with Pawan’s elder brother who has gone for police training. According to police sources, the woman, who is a neighbour of the accused, was asked to come into the courtyard and the moment she entered, Pawan poured petrol on her, set her on fire and fled. Her screams brought in neighbours who rushed her to the hospital. Bulandshahr SSP Santosh Kumar Singh said, “The woman in her statement has alleged that Pawan did not like her relationship with his elder brother. He called her to his house. As soon as she entered his house, he poured petrol on her and set her on fire. On the basis of her statement, we have arrested the accused. Though the sequence of events seems a little suspicious as others on the brick kiln claimed that Pawan was at the brick kiln at the time of the incident.

---||Chennai||Chennai lab develops anti-ageing ingredient from deep sea bacteria for making cosmetics||CHENNAI: City scientists have developed a key ingredient, which has UV protection and anti-ageing properties, for luxury cosmetic and skin care products from a novel strain of bacteria found on the seabed sediment in the Andaman Sea. They extracted the gene code producing this ingredient and introduced it in a commonly-found bacteria for culturing and large-scale production. It was one of the two technologies the city laboratory National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) transferred to the industry recently. The other technology is a biosurfactant, which is an emulsifying agent, also made from bacteria found in deep sea sediment, used in food like ice creams, agriculture and pharma industry, as an alternative to chemical surfactant.  The team from Marine Biotechnology group at NIOT identified a novel strain of Bacillus clausii found on the deep-sea sediment in Andaman Sea to produce ectoine, a molecule which is capable of protecting the skin from ultraviolet radiation and has anti-ageing properties. They then took the gene coding of ectoine and inserted it in Escherichia coli or E coli for laboratory culturing and optimising it for faster bacteria growth, large scale production of the molecule, good yield and easy extraction of the molecule. “At present, ectoine is being imported. Our technology will reduce the cost of manufacturing and the dependency,” said G Dharani, group head, Marine Biotechnology NIOT. Dharani added, “Of course, only top organic-based cosmetics may be using it. The regular cosmetics that most of us use will have a synthetic alternative.” Earlier in July, NIOT director G A Ramadass signed an agreement for technology transfer with Cosmos Biotech LLP, Bengaluru. The lab also transferred technology of a biosurfactant developed as an alternative to chemical surfactants used in the making of anything from ice creams to fertilizers and pesticides. The biosurfactant was also developed from a deep sea bacteria called brevibacterium and its culture conditions were optimised to enhance the production rate of the biosurfactant.  This microbe derived biosurfactant has advantages over their synthetic counterparts like biodegradable, non-toxic and is highly stable and works efficiently in a wide range of pH, temperature and salinity levels. “Surfactant is an emulsification agent. When used in fatty food like ice cream, it will increase the surface area so that your application can be larger. At present, only chemical surfactants are used in the oil industries. In food too, some permissible chemical surfactant is being used,” the scientists said. The technology was transferred to EcoBuildCorp Private Limited Bengaluru. Tata Sudhakar, head, Ocean Electronic Group, NIOT, said the technologies were transferred through National Research Development Corporation for commercialisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-lab-develops-anti-ageing-ingredient-from-deep-sea-bacteria-for-making-cosmetics/articleshow/84360251.cms||U Tejonmayam
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Narco-terror a cause of concern for India, says Union minister Amit Shah||GANDHINAGAR: Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday said that the ill-effects of narcotics on the youths, security and economy – along with the danger of ‘narco-terrorism’ are a cause of concern for India. Shah was speaking at the inauguration of a Centre of Excellence on Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances at National Forensic Sciences University. “India faces danger in the form of narco-terror. The money earned through this is used in terrorism, and this also needs to be stopped. Our coming generation is being destroyed,” said the MP from Gandhinagar. “I am happy to say that the last one and a half years have been the golden time for India in terms of seizure of narcotics. But as long as they are not scientifically analysed and stopped using a different strategy, such physical campaigns do not deliver us success,” he said. Shah said India has made several changes in the system to deal with narcotics – right from coordination, hierarchy and law, as more changes are on the way. The home minister lauded the role of forensic sciences to curb the menace. “The field of forensic science leaves no scope for casual approach or laziness if we have to meet or even stay two steps ahead of the challenges that our country of 130 crore population face,” he said, citing the issues of border security unlike any other country and changing face of crime because of neighbouring countries. He added that the time to use ‘third degree’ (torture to glean information) is over. “Forensic Science Laboratories play a big role in modernising police and making investigation scientific, and get the criminals punished based on strong evidence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/narco-terror-a-cause-of-concern-for-india/articleshow/84360296.cms||---

Chodankar said that the assessment is not mere party confidence but based on an internal survey conducted by BJP a month ago. He also issued a veiled warning to NCP, saying that though no decision has been taken about an alliance, such a possibility will die out if NCP inducts any former Congress MLAs who joined BJP. “We have banned the defectors, so if NCP inducts even one of those MLAs, we will not be able to start talks of an alliance,” said Chodankar. Chodankar’s remarks come after NCP state president Jose Philip D’Souza said that NCP is ready to induct some of the Congress turned BJP MLAs if no pre-poll alliance is formed. The Congress remains convinced that ground sentiment is with them and that the tide is turning against BJP. “We are confident of getting a clear majority, with 23 to 26 seats and we are working towards this endeavour. The people will stand by us to get a pro-people government,” said Chodankar. Chodankar also said that the party is ready to contest the elections at any time. The party has been holding block meetings, activating booth committees and mobilising the frontal organisations as part of the preparations for the coming polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-confident-of-winning-23-26-seats-in-2022-girish/articleshow/84360220.cms||---

Amit Vaidya was picked up by a team of Bulandshahr Police from the house on late Sunday night, while the MD of his channel who was among the six persons booked for filing the false case, is on the run. While back in Bulandshahr, where the attempt to murder case was filed against Delhi-based businessman Sumit Walia, a sub-inspector (SI) has been placed under suspension for “conspiring with the six accused”. According to UP Police, Vaidya framed Walia in the false case in order to settle scores with him. Police said that Vaidya was allegedly trying to grab a high-value plot adjacent to Walia’s bungalow in Chattarpur area. He wanted to build a multistoried building, which was against the norms. His plan was nipped in the bud when Walia complained to the authorities about it. It upset Vaidya and he decided to frame Walia. The case of attempt to murder was filed in a Bulandshahr police station and the SI was its investigating officer (IO). “The case was meant to settle scores and coerce Walia,” a police officer said. Bulandshahr’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) Santosh Kumar Singh gave details about how the case was actually filed. “Vaidya and his associates, which included a reporter with another TV channel, hatched the plan to trap Walia. They engaged a drug addict called Gaurav Sharma, a resident of Anupshahr in Bulandshahr, who claimed to have worked for Walia once. Gaurav was administered local anesthesia after which he was ‘stabbed’ to make it look like a genuine attack. He was paid Rs 50,000 for it. “Then, Gaurav called local police, who reached the spot and took him to a hospital. On the basis of his statement, an FIR was filed on June 10 in which Walia was booked for attempt to murder.” Walia in his statement has alleged, “A team comprising policemen and some suspicious people barged into my house, ransacked everything and even threatened my family members. It was then we approached senior police officers and told them of the harassment we faced for highlighting illegal operations right adjacent to my home.” A probe was launched“Investigation revealed that Walia never went to Bulandshahr, where the attack on Gaurav took place. And the call detail report of Gaurav revealed that he was in constant contact with Vaidya and his aides,” a senior police officer said. According to ADG Meerut zone, Rajiv Sabharwal, “The investigation officer of the case, Ram Sen, has now been suspended and sent to police lines.” According to police, Vaidya and Gaurav have been arrested. Remaining four are on the run and police teams have been constituted to nab them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/tv-channel-owner-held-for-framing-a-delhi-bizman-in-attempt-to-murder-case-in-up/articleshow/84355600.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Ludhiana||Lucknow-Agra expressway model may come to Ludhiana||LUDHIANA: Soon, the e-challan model of Lucknow-Agra expressway may be replicated in Ludhiana also. Hi-tech equipment would be installed at different points of the national highway to keep a check on speeding vehicles. The vehicles found speeding would be issued an e-challan. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), speeding was the major cause of road accident deaths in Ludhiana in 2019, which were even higher than the national average that year under the category. As per the NCRB data, 365 deaths in 526 road accidents were reported in Ludhiana. Of these, 314 accidents were due to speeding, which resulted in 209 deaths. This means 57.26% of the total deaths in road accidents in the city were due to speeding and the figure is even higher than the national average of 55.2% under this category. The NCRB data reveals that in the past three years, the number of accidents due to speeding increased. In 2017, 193 road accidents happened due to speeding, in 2018 it increased to 197 and in 2019 to 209. Joint commissioner of police (traffic) Deepak Pareek said, “Speeding is the major cause of road accidents, especially on national highways. We have two speed radars, one has gone for repairs. Due to the lockdown, checking of speeding vehicles was stopped, but it will resume soon.” “For a city like Ludhiana, we are planning to replicate the model of Agra-Lucknow expressway. The distance between Lucknow toll plaza and Agra is 302km, which as per the speed limit should take three hours to cover. The hi-tech equipment has been installed to capture the image of the vehicle that covers the distance in less time and these are issued challans. We had taken up the project with the National Highway Authority of India, but they suggested we discuss it with the state government first. We have written to the state government to pass the project, so that we could save precious lives.” The JCP said, “Another major reason for the accidents on the national highway is people crossing the road from the broken medians and railings. We have written to the NHAI to repair the spots so that people cross only through the foot overbridges.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/lucknow-agra-expressway-model-may-come-to-city/articleshow/84355593.cms||Payal Dhawan

---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: Two die, three in hospital after family eats macaroni, samples sent for lab tests||BAREILLY: A father-son duo in UP’s Shahjahanpur died and three others are now in hospital after a family prepared macaroni at home following its purchase from a local shop recently. Samples of the macaroni and the oil used to prepare it have been sent for tests by the food safety department. A probe is on. The family of five, including three children, fell ill on July 7. Shankarlal (35) and his elder son Rajnish (16) passed away on Sunday. Three others are now receiving treatment at Shahjahanpur medical college. They used to work as labourers. No official complaint has been registered by the family yet. Police have launched an investigation with the food safety officer. Rajnish had brought macaroni and his mother Usha Devi prepared it. The same night, all of them had complained of diarrhoea and were taken to a primary health centre. They were then shifted to a private clinic in Narotha village. Shankarlal died during treatment. Usha and her other son Vishal (10) and daughter Kiran (7) were later shifted to a district hospital. Powayan SDM Satish Chandra and Khuthar SHO Jaishankar Singh visited the village and met with the family on Monday. Chandra promised funds for construction of a house under a government scheme along with a widow pension for Usha. Jaishankar Singh told TOI, “We are looking at all the possibilities. The food safety team didn’t find the raw macaroni poisonous during initial tests. Lab reports are awaited. We are also checking if someone added any substance to the macaroni. The autopsy report couldn’t confirm the exact reason of deaths.” Food inspector JP Singh told TOI, “Macaroni is dry and doesn’t have any moisture in it which means lesser probability of food poisoning. We didn’t get the samples of the prepared macaroni consumed by the family. There is also a possibility of reaction of medicines given by the quack treating them. Now, the viscera report will confirm the substance that caused the deaths."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/2-die-3-in-hospital-after-family-eats-macaroni-samples-sent-for-lab-tests/articleshow/84355687.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Ludhiana||MLA Simarjit Singh Bains booked for rape of 44-year-old widow||LUDHIANA: Lok Insaaf Party chief and MLA Simarjit Singh Bains has been booked for allegedly raping a 44-year-old woman. Six others, including his brothers, Karamjit Singh and Paramjit Singh Pamma, have been booked for criminal conspiracy. The FIR was lodged on July 10, but the Ludhiana police kept it under wraps till Monday. It was registered on the orders of a local court issued on July 7, stating that a criminal case should be lodged without any further delay. The accused have been identified as Atam Nagar MLA Simarjit Singh Bains, his brothers, Karamjit Singh and Paramjit Singh Pamma; workers, Baljinder Kaur, Jasbir Kaur Bhabhi and Sukhchain Singh; and PA Gopi Sharma. The FIR was lodged under sections 376 (rape), 354 (sexual harassment), 354-B (sexual assault), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC. The complainant, a widow, alleged that she was raped by Bains several times between April and October last year and she had lodged a complaint against him and his accomplices on November 16 with commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal, following which a probe was marked. The woman had also approached the Punjab and Haryana high court, where the case is still pending. The woman stated that after the death of her husband, bank officials started harassing her as she was unable to pay EMIs of their home loan. In April 2019 during the Lok Sabha elections’ campaign, she met Simarjit Singh Bains, who advised her to sell the house. Bains also contacted a realtor, Sukhchain Singh, who sold the house, she said, adding that the realtor gave her Rs 4.5 lakh and got her a plot in Jassowal village. However, she wanted money so she asked the realtor to sell the plot too. She said as the realtor was giving her a lesser amount, she asked Bains to intervene. Bains asked her to come to his office, where he raped her in his cabin and asked her to continue keeping physical relations with him, she alleged, adding that then Bains called the realtor and asked him to give her the money. The woman alleged that when she met the realtor for money, he also pressured her to have physical relations with Bains to get more money. Thereafter, the MLA kept calling her at his office and the house of a woman worker of LIP, Jasbir Kaur Bhabhi, and raped her several times, she said. The woman stated that MLA’s younger brother Karamjit Bains also sent her lewd messages and threatened her. She said his PA Gopi Sharma threatened her father to withdraw the complaint.

---||Jaipur||Two RU law students lost their lives in Amber||Jaipur: Sumit Sharma (name changed) called up his roommate Aman Meena, who had gone to Amber with his friend Vaibhav Jakhad on Sunday evening to enjoy the first monsoon rains. The phone was picked up by a stranger who told Sumit that a lightning had struck and most people around him slumped to the ground. To confirm, Sumit made a video call, but because of the darkness nothing was clear. He immediately informed Aman’s brother, who had already received information about the lightning. Recalling the incident, Sumit said, “Aman was my roommate in a PG in Jaipur. Aman and Vaibhav were first-year students of Rajasthan University’s five-year law school. They both went to Amber to enjoy the evening rainfall, but when Aman didn’t return, his brother called me up to enquire. I called up Aman and Vaibhav’s number and got to know about the lightning.”Aman had sent a photo of his visit to Sumit on Snapchat barely 15 minutes before lightning struck them. Aman, the youngest among three siblings, is the son of a bank manager and hails from Churu. Vaibhav was the only child of a lawyer and hailed from Sikar. TOI tried to contact the family members of the deceased, but the tragedy was such that they were not able to speak anything. Aman, who used to live in a paying guest in Bapu Nagar, had come to Jaipur on Saturday with his elder brother for some work. Vaibhav was already in the city, so both the friends decided to visit Amber.Sumit, who is still at his native place in Jhunjhunu, said it was difficult to believe that his friend Aman was no more. “Aman’s brother was crying inconsolably and Vaibhav’s mother, who lost her only child, wasn’t in a position to speak. She couldn’t believe that her son was gone. Aman and Vaibhav, both were my friends and a part of me,” said Sumit. The bodies of both the students have handed over to their families, who had taken them back to their hometowns. Rajasthan University administration and students union expressed condolences to both the families who lost their children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/two-ru-law-students-lost-their-lives-in-amber/articleshow/84360298.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: People selling gold, jewellery to tide over pandemic crunch||PUNE/MUMBAI: From meeting hospitalisation costs to school fees and shop rents, a growing number of people are selling their gold jewellery to tide over the economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Sources in the state jewellers’ associations told TOI on Monday there has been an uptick in the number of citizens resorting to encashing their gold assets. “This trend has been fuelled by mounting expenses such as school fees, hospitalisation costs, house rent, among other things in the face of slashed salaries and job losses. The number of people coming to sell off their gold jewellery has doubled in the last few days in comparison to pre-Covid times,” Fatehchand Ranka, president of Maharashtra Rajya Saraf Suvarnakar Federation, told TOI. Ranka said not only those from economically weaker classes, but even those from the upper and middle classes were being forced to sell their gold. “Wedding ornaments like mangalsutras have also been sold by families to overcome the financial crunch,” said Ranka. Kumar Jain, president of the India Bullion and Jewellers Association Ltd, Mumbai, told TOI said 24-carat gold, which people may have bought for around Rs 30,000 is now fetching around Rs 49, 000 per 10 gm. “Several business owners are therefore selling gold to pay shops rents, electricity bills, staff salaries etc. It has been over a year since the pandemic began and the financial crisis has only worsened as restrictions on businesses continue,” he said. Jain said the trend has been more pronounced in the past three to four months. “Gold is the easiest to encash. In comparison to last year, we have seen an almost 60-70% increase in customers walking in to sell their gold jewellery,” he said. Shailesh Ranka, owner at Ranka Jewellers Pvt Ltd, said until last year, people had reserves and many also took loans to meet expenses. “The reserves are now exhausted and people do not want to go into further debts by availing more loans.” Jewellers in Mumbai, however, are not reporting an unusual rise in the number of people coming to pawn or sell their gold ornaments. TOI spoke to large and small firms that offer cash for gold, and only one reported a marginal rise. Arjun Singhvi (Jain) of Mahavir Jewellers in Borivli’s local Zaveri Bazar said a few families have been arriving to sell chains, mangalsutras or bangles to pay medical bills. Representatives of Jugraj Kantilal and Chokshi Arvind, two major gold purchasers in Zaveri Bazar, said the situation in Mumbai was not dire enough to warrant people to sell the precious asset. Ketan Parekh of Chokshi Arvind Jewellers said, “Perhaps that is true of lower income groups or daily wagers who live a hand-to-mouth existence. But one cannot generalise that middle class Mumbaikars are flocking to sell their jewellery. It is true that jobs have been lost and businesses are losing 20-50% of their income due to lockdown. But families have also automatically had to reduce expenditure.” In Bandra, Nilesh Soni of Thanks Gold! said the trend was next to negligible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-people-selling-gold-jewellery-to-tide-over-pandemic-crunch/articleshow/84360329.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana government hospital doctors go on three-day strike||LUDHIANA: Doctors at various government hospitals of the district went on a three-day strike on Monday to protest against the government for reducing their perks in Sixth Pay Commission. On the first day of the strike, doctors boycotted OPDs and all other activities, except emergency cases and Covid duty. They also burnt the copies of the Sixth Pay Commission report while raising slogans against the Punjab government. In a statement, Joint Punjab Government Doctors’ Coordination Committee (JGDCC) members Dr Gagandeep Singh, president, Punjab Civil Medical Services Association (PCMSA), Dr Sarabjit Singh Randhawa, president, Veterinary Officers’ Association, Dr Gagandeep Singh Shergill, senior vice-president, PCMSA, Dr Pawanpreet Kaur, president, Dental Association, Dr Sanjeev Pathak, Ayurvedic Association, Dr Balwinder Singh, Homoeopathic Association, and Dr Deepinder Singh, Rural Medical Officers’ Association, criticized the lax attitude of the government towards doctors. They said if the government did not address the issue of non-practicing allowance (NPA), the medical and veterinary doctors of Punjab would be forced to go on an indefinite strike. The coordinating committee also appealed to the CM to resolve the issue. The JGDCC members said Monday strike was observed following the decision of the joint committee that all the doctors in the state would boycott the government OPDs from July 15 to 17 and parallel OPDs would be run by the JGDCC in the lawns of the hospitals so that the needy were not deprived of health / veterinary services. It was also announced that during the boycott of health services, all the doctors of the state would donate blood and area-wise blood donation camps would be organized, on July 15 in Malwa, on July 16 in Majha and on July 17 in Doaba region. Patients were a harried lot. “I had come to the hospital for treatment of abdominal pain. Now, I am returning without a medical consultation as I did not know about the strike,” said Ashok Kumar of Old City. Pregnant women who went to government hospitals for check-ups also faced problems due to the strike.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/govt-hosps-docs-go-on-three-day-strike/articleshow/84355649.cms||---
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Injured elephant dies slow, painful death as Amangarh forest staff fail to act||BIJNOR: Wounded and separated from its herd, a three-year-old elephant suffered a slow and painful death over a period of one month. Its decomposed carcass was found on Sunday in the Jaspur gate area of Amangarh Tiger Reserve by forest department staff. According to forest department officials, the elephant was suffering from a wound in the rear leg. They suspect that due to its wound, the pachyderm could not keep up with its herd, got separated from it and eventually met its untimely death. A camera trap had sighted the elephant walking with a limp a month ago but forest rangers failed to trace it and administer proper treatment. Slammed by activists for failing to act on time that could have saved the elephant a painful death, M Semmaran, Bijnor divisional forest officer, has ordered a probe into the matter. He said, “We are probing the matter thoroughly. If forest staff showed negligence to trace it, strict action will be taken against the erring personnel.” According to sources, forest department personnel found the elephant carcass on Sunday and informed their superiors. However, villagers claimed that they had spotted the carcass lying in the forest for the past 15 days. A post-mortem has been conducted and its viscera will be sent for tests for ascertaining the cause of death though foresters suspect the wound in the leg could be the primary reason for death. Semmaran said, “The post-mortem of the three-year-old elephant was conducted in the presence of senior officials. It had a wound in its leg that hampered its movement. With time, the wound festered and the animal was unable to move from one place to another. This could be a reason for it getting separated from its herd. Its picture caught on camera a month ago showed it was limping.” According to the census conducted last year, Amangarh Tiger Reserve is home to some 200 elephants and 27 tigers. The wildlife count goes up in summer when high temperature and water scarcity drive the animals, including elephant herds, from Corbett tiger reserve to Pili Dam reservoir in Amangarh reserve. This summer, more than 100 elephants have already crossed over to ATR and have been spotted around the reservoir, said the foresters. Besides, ATR has 12 water holes and is crisscrossed by three monsoon rivers — Pili, Feeka and Dhara — and numerous streams. A large number of Rohini trees laden with juicy fruit, a favourite of elephants, provides ample food for the herds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/injured-elephant-dies-slow-painful-death-as-amangarh-forest-staff-fail-to-act/articleshow/84355701.cms||Harveer Dabas

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: SGST department temporarily attaches property of Bhavnagar firm||AHMEDABAD: As further investigation into the Rs 900 crore fake billing scam revealed an additional tax evasion of Rs 62 crore by Madhav Copper Limited, the state goods and services tax (SGST) department has ‘temporarily’ attached the properties and bank account of Nilesh Patel, the chairman of the Bhavnagar firm. Last week, while investigating the scam, it was found that Madhav Copper Limited utilized fake bills worth Rs 425 crore to wrongfully claim input tax credit (ITC) worth Rs 75 crore. With further evasion through illicitly claimed ITC, the company has now evaded taxes worth Rs 137 crore. Despite summons being issued, Patel continues to be on the run. In light of this, the department has temporarily attached the company land, bank accounts, stocks worth Rs 10 crore and two land plots of the staff colony. Further investigation is underway in the matter. Last week, the SGST department had arrested two persons — Afzal Sadiq Ali Sajwani from Bhavnagar and Meena Rathod from Prantij — who were involved in generating fake bills to the tune of Rs 900 crore. Madhav Copper Limited was one of the beneficiaries of these fake bills generated by the duo, using which the company evaded taxes, according to department sources. Meanwhile, further investigation into the firms to which the fake bills had been supplied by Rathod and Sajwani revealed involvement of some 29 more companies located in Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar and Rajkot. The amount of evaded taxes is yet to be identified and will be done in due course of investigation. While Rathod’s remand ended on Saturday, Sajwani — a repeat offender who is also a key accused in a financial scam post-demonetization — has been further remanded for custodial interrogation till 3pm on July 14. His remand was extended after a lot of incriminating documents were found at his residence. When Sajwani’s residence was raided, a lot of data containing details of transactions worth crores was found saved on electronic devices. Further probe is being done by the department officials. Sources in the SGST department said that the amount of tax evasion is expected to grow bigger in days to come. Meanwhile, raids were conducted across nine more locations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sgst-dept-temporarily-attaches-property-of-bhavnagar-firm/articleshow/84360406.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Covid survivors battling severe hip problems now||RAJKOT: Blood clotting, black fungus and bacterial infections. If you thought, the list of post-Covid complications would just end at that, here is another disturbing trend that doctors are seeing in Gujarat. High dose of steroids in treatment of Covid is leading to avascular necrosis or bone death which in turn is pushing patients to go for hip treatment or hip replacements. Patients in the age group of 40 to 60 years are approaching orthopaedic doctors with complaint of hip pain. “In last month, I got 20 new patients with the complaint of hip pain. All had steroid history. We first treat them with medicines and if the problem persists, we suggest MRI to diagnose the stage of hip bone deformation. Based on that we take a decision on whether hips need to be replaced,” said Dr Bhavesh Sachde, a Rajkot-based joint replacement surgeon. He otherwise gets 4-5 patients with such complaints in a month. Some patients with skin disease or asthma who need steroids for longer period also suffer from hip bone deformation. “If a patient is in the final stages, we need hip replacement otherwise we could save replacement. In 30 % cases, if diagnosed early, patients need replacement after 5-10 years,” said Dr Sachde. “In pre-Covid era, I used to get one patient in two weeks with complaint of hip bone pain in my OPD. But now I see five new patients in a week. All are Covid survivors and these cases are coming because of high usage of steroids,” said orthopaedic surgeon Dr Hiren Kothari. “We fear that more such patients will come in the next four to five months. It is early to say that out of these how many will require hip replacement but many of them who will be treated currently may require hip replacement in longer run,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/covid-survivors-battling-severe-hip-problems-now/articleshow/84355707.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Chandigarh||Residents harassed as political parties take to road for ‘people’s rights’||Ludhiana: Monday was a day of protests in Ludhiana, as Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Aam Admi Party (AAP) all staged protests on different issues and all the action was witnessed around same venue the mini secretariat located on Ferozepur Road. Due to this display of power by parties, specially SAD, which organised its protest on the main road outside the mini secretariat, and BJP, whose leaders marched on the main road towards police commissioner office, common people had to suffer as traffic snarls were witnessed on major chowks and roads connecting with Ferozepur Road through mini secretariat crossing. Lot of traffic jams were witnessed in the internal roads, specially Kocchar Market where from the buses and vehicles plying to destinations like Mullanpur, Jagraon and Ferozepur tried to take alternate routes to avoid passing through choked Bharat Nagar Chowk stretch. Meanwhile, SAD leaders and workers who had given a call to protest in front of the police commissioner office, demanding registering of FIR against Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) MLA Simarjit Singh Bains, switched their demand at the last minute to arrest of Bains when the FIR was registered by the police earlier in the day. They warned that if he was not arrested, the party will gherao residence of cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu on Tuesday. SAD also demanded that Navjot Sidhu, Sukhpal Khaira and AAP should tell Punjabis why they were silent on this issue and explain if they supported the rapist and did not want justice to the done to the victim. Sharanjit Singh Dhillon, Mahesh Inder Singh Grewal, Hira Singh Gabria and other leaders said, “The Bains case has proved that women are not safe in the Congress government. Goons like Simarjit Bains targeted and sexually exploited women, but the Congress government did not take action against him. As far as Ludhiana police is concerned, it too has violated the guidelines of the Supreme Court, which had stipulated that a case should be registered in a complaint of rape within 72 hours and the trial in high profile cases of rape should be completed in three months. So Ludhiana police should explain what investigation it did in the case in the last seven months and why it had not proceeded against the LIP leader for so long.” SAD leaders also appreciated the role of party member and senior advocate Harish Rai Dhanda for his fight for the FIR against Bains. Speaking on the occasion Dhanda said, “We will also take up the issue of destruction of vital evidence by the Ludhiana police. Party would also pursue the case of another woman complainant, who had also accused Bains of exploiting her sexually. Now, more women who have been raped and sexually exploited by Bains are also expected to come forward.” In other protest by BJP, which was organised against attack on their leaders in Rajpur, unruly scenes were witnessed, as the protestors tried to enter police commissioner office to stage protest. They tried to climb over the barricades to make their way inside and tussle ensued between the BJP leaders and the police in which some people, including party’s district president Pushpinder Singhal, were manhandled. Singhal was rushed to a hospital for checkup in a police vehicle and he is reported to be discharged later in the day. In the third political dharna, AAP leaders staged a protest outside the mini secretariat on the issue of power shortage in the state and difficulties being faced by the industry due to this. Speaking on the occasion, AAP Youth Wing president and MLA Meet Hayer said, “People of Punjab are suffering in spite of getting more expensive electricity than the rest of the country. Earlier, the costly power deals made by Badals and the BJP government with the private companies had forced the people of Punjab to pay exorbitant electricity bills, but now the power cuts have made life difficult for the people.” AAP’s MLA from Garhshankar Jai Kishan Singh Rori said, “Due to non-availability of complete power supply, the crop has to be operated by generator by purchasing expensive diesel to irrigate the crop. Punjab government should also impose penalty on power companies to get rid of unannounced power cuts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/residents-harassed-as-political-parties-take-to-road-for-peoples-rights/articleshow/84357969.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: Ruckus at Rahon Road as truck kills 25-year-old man||LUDHIANA: A mob raised a ruckus after a speeding truck killed a 25-year-old man at Rahon Road, near Amarjeet Colony, on Monday. Kimti Lal, a resident of Mangat village, had left his house on a bike for a salon in Indra Nagar for a training in hairdressing. When he reached near Amarjeet Colony, a speeding truck hit his bike around 8am. The truck driver dragged Kimti for a few metres. After people raised the alarm, he jammed on the brakes and escaped, leaving the vehicle behind. Passersby called up the police and informed Kimti’s family. His family sat near the body and staged a protest by blocking the road. They did not allow cops to take the body to civil hospital and demanded that the truck driver and the owner be brought to the spot. Kimti’s father, Harmesh Lal, said, “This is an accident-prone area. Trucks loaded with sand run at high speed and cause accidents every other day. We want justice for my son.” As the family sat by the body, some unidentified people torched the truck. They did not let firemen reach the spot and pelted police with stones and bricks. The agitators alleged that first the police lathicharged them and then they threw stones. However, the police claimed that they resorted to lathicharge after the mob hurled stones at them. A brick injured Meharban police station SHO sub-inspector Simranjit Kaur, who fell on the road. Another cop picked her up and took her to a hospital. Assistant commissioner of police (east) Devinder Chaudhary and additional deputy commissioner of police-IV Rupinder Kaur Sra also reached the spot. Chaudhary said, “The cops were convincing them to take the body to hospital. But they were adamant that the truck driver and the owner be brought to the spot. While the family of Kimti was sitting by the body, some unidentified people set the truck on fire. It was a minor blaze, which the cops managed to douse.” “The mob then started hurling stones and bricks. Sub-inspector Simranjit was injured as a brick hit her face. When I went there, a brick hit me too. A case is being registered under sections 279 (rash driving) and 304-A (causing death by negligence) against truck driver Arvinder Singh of Phillaur,” the ACP added. At 3.30pm, the family ended the protest and the body was taken to civil hospital for autopsy. On action against those who attacked the cops, the ACP said, “We will discuss it with the senior officials and act accordingly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/ruckus-at-rahon-road-as-truck-kills-25-yr-old-man/articleshow/84355738.cms||---

For a fleeting moment, he assumed his phone had overheated and exploded. Before he could gather his wits, another lightning with equal ferocity struck. “I was knocked down. I could hear a cacophony of people crying, and others calling for help. There was mud everywhere. And pathways near ramparts were slippery,” he said. Izhar said that the first lightning struck at about 7.04pm, he remembers the time because he had taken the phone out of his pocket to click a selfie. “I shiver with fear every time I have to recall scenes that unfolded over the mountain. It was pitch dark. People were jostling to find some shelter due to heavy downpour. Others were stumbling over the bodies of people lying lifeless all over,” he said. Izhar said he managed to get up on his feet and looked for survivors. “I tried to help everyone I could. We screamed for help, but no one could hear us from over the mountains,” he said. He told TOI from his bed in SMS Hospital that some of his friends and cousins also got stuck in the chaos that soon ensued after the lightning. “It is nothing short of a miracle that I am alive today,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/was-taking-a-selfie-i-thought-my-phone-exploded/articleshow/84360348.cms||---

The city recorded just three positive cases on Monday, the lowest since the onset of the pandemic in the city. According to Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) officials, one Covid-19 case was recorded from the Central zone and two cases were recorded from the Rander zone on Monday. No positive cases were recorded from Varachha (A), Varachha (B), Katargam, Limbayat, Udhna and Athwa zone on Monday in the city. As per the data released by the civic body, eight Covid-19 patients were discharged from different hospitals in the city on Monday. Currently, 12 Covid-19 patients are undergoing treatment at various city hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surat-city-records-3-new-covid-19-cases/articleshow/84355750.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: No certificate-free entry for vaxxed tourists till August||PANAJI: Until next month, Goa will not permit entry to fully-vaccinated tourists who don’t produce a Covid-negative certificate. The high court of Bombay at Goa on Monday waived the requirement of the Covid-negative certificate for the workforce and other categories entering Goa, provided they are fully-vaccinated and two weeks have passed since their second dose. “The state, however, will have to evolve a suitable mechanism to ensure that the benefit of the exemptions is extended to only the exempted categories and not to others,” the division bench comprising justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar stated in the order.. “This is imminently in the public interest just as any undue lowering of the guard, in the present circumstances, is not. Normalcy will have to be restored depending on the situation, but there can be no scope for any undue complacency or laxity,” the bench added. The state government was seeking an exemption for all fully-vaccinated persons to enter the state without a negative certificate, stating that the state expert committee had approved it, but the court asked the committee to “deliberate specifically on the issue as to whether it will be safe to permit entry of tourists and others” who are fully-vaccinated without any Covid-negative certificate, and submit the minutes of the meeting at the next hearing. Since the committee at its meeting on July 2 based its recommendation to allow all fully-vaccinated persons into Goa on a May 4 advisory of ICMR, the court said it is not sure whether there is any severe load on the laboratories at the moment, which was the situation when the advisory was passed. It also asked the Union government, in light of experience it has gained from the reported incidents of rush at tourist places, to offer its say in the matter before the next hearing. “This is because there were some reports of warnings issued by or on behalf of the Central government about the relaxation of Covid-safety protocols in states where the tourist influx is substantial,” the division bench stated. The categories exempt include the workforce, i.e., persons who enter Goa for purposes of work in industries, labour-force, construction, persons who enter Goa for business and employment, residents of Goa who are now stranded outside Goa for pandemic-related or other such issues, and residents of Goa who, on account of their work or for medical reasons, are required to travel outside Goa and return.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-cert-free-entry-for-vaxxed-tourists-till-aug/articleshow/84360425.cms||---
---||Surat||Not just patients, second wave of Corona left doctors mentally scarred too||SURAT: The second wave of Covid-19 inflicted mental scars not just on patients or the kin of those who succumbed to the virus but also the treating doctors. Having witnessed, from close quarters, the death of younger ones and the sudden demise of patients who seemed to be recovering has left some doctors deeply disturbed. It’s been almost two months since the second wave hit its peak and currently cases are down. Still, a city doctor couple, who looked after the patients in ICU, is unable to overcome the trauma. The two are taking help of a psychiatrist to improve their private life. They are finding it difficult to get intimate with each other and are sleeping in different rooms. It is not an isolated case. Another doctor couple, on similar Covid-19 duties, is taking counselling from a psychiatrist to help them come out of the trauma to revive their relationship. “The doctor couple claimed that they can’t enjoy a cosy moment with each other since they handled some of the most critical cases and saw patients, who seemed to be recovering, die all of sudden. The main reason for shock was the sudden death of a patient who was normal a few hours ago,” said Dr Mukul Choksi, who is helping a few such doctors to come out of the trauma. Dr Parimal Desai is a psychiatrist who has treated multiple cases of anxiety. “Many doctors came for treatment and counselling complaining that they suffered nightmares and weren’t able to sleep properly. In sleep they saw RT-PCR reports, ventilator settings or CT-Scan reports,” said Desai. The two waves of Covid resulted in 1.11 lakh of the city population getting infected with 1,629 patients succumbing to the virus. The second wave, particularly, stretched the health infrastructure to its limit and took a heavy toll on healthcare workers. Explaining the severe impact of the horrific situation during peak of Covid-19 a senior doctor in Surat Municipal Corporation said, “A senior doctor who handled critical cases during the peak has developed a habit of cross verifying multiple times with his hospital staff before signing a document. The doctor is just not able to concentrate. His is a severe case of anxiety.” An intervention specialist stopped going to hospital after developing fear of wearing a PPE kit. Later, his wife approached a psychiatrist for help. “The doctor felt panic soon after putting on the kit and he could not work hence he stopped going to his hospital,” said a psychiatrist. Meanwhile, Dr Trupti Patel, a psychiatrist explains how hospital staff, apart from doctors, are also facing severe mental conditions. “I was treating a female psychologist who handled Covid-19 patients for an NGO. She was suffering from compassion fatigue and got angry with patients. She was depressed and felt guilty about how she could not help people dying due to Covid,” added Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/not-just-patients-second-wave-of-corona-left-docs-mentally-scarred-too/articleshow/84355827.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Three cars sucked in by Manekbaug-Shyamal cave-in||AHMEDABAD: Heavy rains in the city once again exposed the shoddy work of road contractors of the AMC, with two major cave-ins reported on Monday. One cave-in occurred between Manekbaug and Shyamal Crossroads and the other in Balol Nagar in Ranip. At least three vehicles were stuck in the Manekbaug-Shyamal cave-in. Cranes were called in by the car owners. First, Foram Patel found her car sinking into the crater. Then an SUV and a luxury car got sucked in. Patel said she was going to conduct a karate class. As she took a left turn opposite Shreyas Foundation, she realized that her car was tilting to one side. “I immediately tried to get down but could not open the door and hence had to exit from the other side,” she said. “The road was subsiding and there was no way to get the car out by myself. I called for help, but several crane drivers refused to come.” Finally, one crane driver took up the job. “He brought the vehicle out and charged me Rs 1,200,” she said. Patel said she had even called the traffic police, but got no assistance. She said that she and other people who had gathered at the site were telling drivers to be cautious, but an SUV driver got his front tyres stuck in the cavein. However, people managed to help him. “Later, the driver of a luxury car did not heed our warnings either,” Patel said. “He too needed the crane.” The Balol Nagar cave-in forced the AMC to close one side of the road and divert the traffic to the other side. As for the Manekbaug-Shyamal case, AMC officials said the cave-in illustrated contractors’ laxity. Once pipelines are laid, contractors are supposed to water the area and reclaim the earth. But that is seldom done, an official said. So when AMC resurfaces such stretches, they remain susceptible to cave-ins during rains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/three-cars-sucked-in-by-manekbaug-shyamal-cave-in/articleshow/84360487.cms||---
---||Goa||99.7% clear SSC, 67 students in Goa fail school assessment||PANAJI: Barring only 67 students across the state, 99.7% or 23,900 of the students in Class X of the Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education cleared the year. The board declared the results on Monday based on the tabulation of marks carried out by individual school result committees. “Of the 67 students, only two were girls,” Goa Board chairman Bhagirath Shetye said. The result saw nearly every school achieve a cent percent pass percentage. The 67 students have been allowed to keep terms (ATKT) and will get an opportunity to clear their Class X at a supplementary exam to be held by their schools this year for which the board will provide the sample question papers. The 2021 pass percentage is almost six percent higher than last year’s pass percentage of 92.7%, when a public exam was held. The Class X public exam for 2021 was cancelled due to the pandemic. “These 67 students did not clear the year because they had not appeared for some or the other internal assessment so their result could not add up to 33%. There are nearly no cases where students appeared for all assessments conducted, but did not clear,” Shetye said. The board chairman said that almost all could clear Class X this year as internal evaluations carried out by schools were taken into account. He, however, said that it was ensured that the scores were in line with the schools’ past performance. “Schools have evaluated students based on internal assessments, which were focused on certain topics so students have done well. We had given schools their last three years’ historical score and it has been ensured that students have retained their subject average as per the institute’s past performance. All schools have retained their subject average. It was a well-thought model adopted after research,” Shetye said. As per the formula for tabulation of marks provided by the board to schools, students’ score at the formative I, formative II, and other internal tests, besides preliminary exams conducted by schools, were taken into account. Some weightage was also given to the students’ performance in Class IX. This year, Class X saw the highest enrolment at 23,967 and for the first time, more boys (3,011) than girls (10,956) had registered. Board statistics showed that it was not just a case of students clearing the exam in bulk, they also scored well. The maximum number of nearly 10,300 students scored a first class with nearly 4,400 securing a distinction. Across all 12 talukas, the number of students who scored first class was higher. For the first time, mathematics was split for Class X students into maths level 1 and 2. Mathematics level 2 was for students wanting to pursue the science stream. The average marks scored by students at Class X was the lowest in mathematics level 2 (45.5) and science (40.4), among all subjects. Students, who opted for the easier mathematics level 1, scored 63.5 out of 100 on an average, indicating that the option could have helped a higher number of students score better at Class X. The highest number of 5,085 candidates registered for Class X in Salcete taluka and the lowest of 415 in Dharbandora taluka. Most of the 67 students who could not clear Class X were from Tiswadi and Quepem talukas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/99-7-clear-ssc-67-students-in-state-fail-school-assessment/articleshow/84360491.cms||---

And while the city is known for its kitli culture, the desire to indulge in some tea-time during curfew will definitely land you in trouble. Three men from different parts of the city learnt this lesson the hard way when they were caught by the cops while roaming around the city on their quest to find some ‘cha’ at night. A 21-year-old student from Ghatlodia was searching for tea near Shastrinagar when he was caught by a team of cops patrolling the area around 1.50am on Monday . “When we stopped him and asked him about the emergency that forced him to move out when curfew was imposed, the youth said that he was addicted to tea and had been searching for a kitli since midnight,” stated the FIR filed by Ghatlodia police. Police said, “As searching a for tea is not valid grounds to be out at that time, he was booked under charges of violation of curfew notification along with epidemic act and disaster management act.” In the second case, a Satellite resident and a Ranip resident were found searching for a kitli near Shastrinagar crossroads. “Both the men were in their early thirties. When we asked them why they were out at 12.30am on Monday, they said that they were friends and were looking for a place to have tea and indulge in some gossip,” said police. The FIR mentioned that the two men despite knowing that the curfew was imposed in the city had gone out and endangered their lives as well as the lives of others by behaving negligently. They were booked for violation of curfew norms along with disaster management act and epidemic act. All three men were released on bail on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/midnight-urge-for-chai-brews-trouble-for-three/articleshow/84360478.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Post unlock, air pollution surges in Madhya Pradesh||BHOPAL: Corona curfew not only breaks the Covid chain, but also helps in improving the air quality. Around 50 days of lockdown between April and June had brought down the air pollution substantially in major Madhya Pradesh cities. But after unlock, the pollution levels have again started rising in most of the cities across the state. Air quality index of Bhopal on May 30 was 77 that rose to 98 on July 8. In Indore, AQI was 73 on May 30, which went up to 101. In Gwalior, AQI was 53 on May 30 which rose to 84 on July 8 while in Jabalpur AQI was 80 on May 30, which hovered around 76 on July 8. Track the pollution level in your cityAir quality is measured taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox), RSPM10 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. While the rise in sulphur dioxide is due to vehicle emissions, the increase in nitrogen oxide is due to human activity, including vehicles and sewage, among others. PM 10 is due to dust, construction, including building of roads while PM2.5 is due to dust, human activity and climatic conditions. Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is the most harmful to health since it causes severe lung diseases. Air quality index between 0 and 50 is termed as good with minimal possible health impacts while air quality between 51 and 100 is satisfactory but may lead to minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people. Air quality above 100 is moderate and leads to breathing discomfort to the people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases. AQI above 200 leads to breathing discomfort for most of the people on prolonged exposure. Officials said the air quality remained best during the corona restrictions. From April 8, the government announced weekend lockdowns in city limits across the state due to a surge in Covid-19 cases. It was later converted into a lockdown on all days with only the ones pressed in emergency services allowed to move. Unlocking process started in June in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/post-unlock-air-pollution-surges-in-mp/articleshow/84358097.cms||Ankur Sirothia
---||Chandigarh||Industrialists relieved after curbs lifted, seek permanent solution for power supply||Ludhiana: With slight improvement in the power supply situation, due to resumption of one of the damaged Talwandi Sabo thermal power generating units, the state government on Monday decided to ease off all power regulatory restrictions on industrial consumers. Earlier in the day, chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) A Venu Prasad declared that all power regulatory restrictions are being removed except on those industrial consumers, who use continuous power, but later in the day chief minister Amarinder Singh issued a statement saying restrictions on all sections of industrial consumers are being removed. However, according to CMD, the relaxations will be reviewed after three days and fresh decision will be taken. According to a statement issued by the CM’s office, “CM has directed PSPCL to ease off all power regulatory restrictions on industrial consumers across the state with immediate effect. The CM was informed that the plant at Talwandi Sabo had resumed 660MW production, improving the power situation in the state. The decision on the complete withdrawal of the restrictions was taken by the CM soon after PSPCL announced a similar, but partial withdrawal in districts falling in central and border zones. The PSPCL had allowed all industries, except those using continuous power, to operate at full capacity from today. However, after the CM’s intervention, all industries across the state, including those using continuous power round the clock (textile, chemicals, and spinning mills), can now operate to full capacity.” City businessmen, meanwhile, have heaved a sigh of relief but are of the view that these are temporary measures. According to D S Chawla, president of United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association, “PSPCL needs to ensure that it comes out with some solution so that after three days it does not need to impose these curbs on the industry again. Already, we have suffered huge losses and it would not be possible to bear these any further. Therefore, we request PSPCL and the state government to find a solution in the next two to three days for normalising power supply.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/industrialists-relieved-after-curbs-lifted-seek-permanent-solution-for-power-supply/articleshow/84358037.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

At present, any passenger arriving in the state by any mode of transport is required to carry a negative RT-PCR test conducted 48 hours earlier. Chahal said with vaccination drives conducted across the country, many citizens have received both doses of the Covid vaccine. “There are many passengers who are travelling to Delhi or other business places in the morning and returning the same evening or the next morning. In such cases, conducting the RT-PCR test and getting the report becomes impossible. In view of the above, domestic passengers who are fully vaccinated may be exempted from carrying negative RT-PCR test reports while arriving in Mumbai,” he wrote. After the second wave of Covid started, the MVA government on May 12 this year imposed restrictions on domestic passengers arriving in the state. These restrictions were initially imposed on passengers coming from Gujarat, Goa, Delhi, Rajasthan and Kerala. However, as cases increased, it was decided to impose the restriction on all the passengers coming into Mumbai from any part of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/allow-fully-vaccinated-in-without-rt-pcr-report-chahal/articleshow/84393722.cms||Richa Pinto

The police, in its report filed on a plea seeking registration of FIR for the offence of murder against the management of the hospital, stated that the inquiry could not be concluded and sought more time. Metropolitan magistrate Vivek Beniwal said, “The status report has been filed in a casual manner. The IO (investigating officer) has not disclosed what steps he has taken after he was directed to file a status report.” The court further granted one last opportunity to the police to file a detailed status report. “Considering the fact that the present matter is highly sensitive, I am of the opinion that the ATR (action taken report) or status report should be filed by the concerned area DCP. This is the last opportunity granted to the police department to file the status report,” the judge said. The court further said appropriate action would be taken as per the law if the report was not filed by the next date of hearing. The status report submitted by the police stated, “It is most humble submitted that (complainant) gave the complaint against Jaipur Golden Hospital Sector-3 Rohini, Delhi, stating therein that the alleged persons committed cheating, fraud, criminal conspiracy and gross medical negligence and also caused threats as such are liable to prosecuted for the offence punishable under various section of Indian Penal Code.” “In this regard, it is submitted that the inquiry into the matter could not be concluded. It is, therefore, requested to the Hon'ble court that some more time may be given to file the status report,” the report further stated. The plea was filed through advocates Sahil Ahuja and Siddhant Sethi on behalf of six family members of the deceased. On the intervening night of April 23-24, 21 critically ill patients had lost their lives allegedly due to shortage of oxygen supply at the hospital. It alleged that the police, with a mala fide intention, did not arrest or set up an inquiry against the management of the hospital. It stated that the management of the hospital had allegedly committed the offences of murder, cheating, fraud, criminal conspiracy, criminal intimidation and gross medical negligence. It further said that the management should have stopped admitting the patients if they were low on oxygen supply, but instead they kept everyone in the dark.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hospital-deaths-city-court-pulls-up-cops-for-filing-casual-status-report/articleshow/84391670.cms||Usha Das

Police said that the 19-year-old deceased Denil Patel’s father Sanjay gave him a dressing down as he had posted a local ruffian’s video as his WhatsApp status. Sanjay fumed over the status asking Denil to remove it and scolded him over his irregularity at work. The father-son duo worked together at a popular dairy parlour’s godown in Ichhapore area. Cops said that Sanjay was worried that his son would get inspired from such videos and keep a bad company. The video was about a ruffian from Amroli in which he was claiming to be a ‘don’. “Denil felt humiliated because of his father’s bitter words, so he hanged himself from the ceiling fan in the kitchen, using a saree when nobody was at home. When the family members returned home around 9.30pm, they were shocked to find him in such a state,” said a police official. Sanjay called an 108 ambulance but the paramedical staff declared Patel dead. “The deceased was a decent fellow but for some reasons he posted the video as his status which triggered his father’s anger and later he took the extreme step,” the police official added. A case of accidental death was registered at Adajan police station and after the post-mortem, Patel’s body was handed over to his family members. Police said that Patel lived with his parents and a 16-year-old sister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/pulled-up-over-whatsapp-status-teen-hangs-self/articleshow/84355880.cms||---

Led by Jaswinder Singh Thukral, president of Janta Nagar Small Scale Manufacturers Association (JSMA), the protestors also burnt an effigy of the chairman of the PSPCL. Addressing the businessmen, Thukral said, “PSPCL has slapped penalties worth several lakhs on innocent businessmen who inadvertently ran more power load in their factories than the sanctioned load. Even if the businessmen ran overload just for one day they were slapped with penalties worth their bills for an year. This is totally unjustified action and the small-time businessmen, who are already struggling to earn their bread and butter, are being asked to pay such huge amounts of money as penalties. As our repeated representations to the officials of PSPCL bore no result, we are forced to take up the path of protest and as part of our weekly protest at different office of department we staged an agitation at Focal Point division where we burnt the effigy of chairman of PSPCL A Venu Prasad.” According to another businessman, Svinder Singh Hunjan, “Industry is unable to pay such huge penalties levied by PSPCL. Moreover, by registering UUE cases against us, they are treating us like criminals. Therefore, we have started this weekly agitation against the department, which will continue till August 23 in Ludhiana and after this we will stage protest at headquarters of PSPCL at Patiala. We will continue with our campaign for the rights of businessmen until the penalties are waived off and UUE cases are cancelled.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bizmen-protest-against-pspcl-for-uue-cases/articleshow/84358094.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Key sources in the state government confirmed to TOI that the Gujarat government has started studying the pros and cons of a population control legislation that is being proposed by UP. “So far, no formal decision has been taken in the matter, but the government is considering the views of experts and the likely response that common citizens will have on it,” said sources. Sources added, “Government is closely studying UP’s proposed population control bill. If the government decides to adopt such a legislation, it could introduce a bill in the upcoming monsoon session of the state assembly. A bill like the one being proposed by UP will yield political benefits to the BJP.” The draft of the Uttar Pradesh Population (Control, Stabilization and Welfare) Bill, 2021 was unveiled a few days back by the UP state government. The draft says that those having more than two children will be debarred from contesting local body polls, applying for government jobs or availing subsidies. “The state government aims to start wider consultations with different stake holder groups if and when it decides to prepare a draft population control bill. Gujarat could also consider UP-like penal action for failing in adhering to two-child norms and also have state policy for not providing government scheme benefits to couples having more than two children. If the government adopts the bills, it will include clauses of not giving government jobs or disqualifying those with more than two children from government jobs,” said sources. Interestingly, Gujarat has a law since 2005 where those with more than two children are not permitted to contest. The state amended the Gujarat Local Authorities Act in 2005, which prohibits those with more than two children to contest local body (panchayats, municipalities and municipal corporations) elections. “This norm has been tried and tested for contesting elections in Gujarat for a long time. The same can be extended for all government schemes as well. A large section of taxpayers feel that they have to pay more taxes to fund schemes for others. The government will be able to provide better quality health and education services if a population control law in enacted,” felt sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-mulls-up-like-population-control-law/articleshow/84360543.cms||Kapil Dave

---||Goa||Goa: Galgibaga river changes course, locals worried about flooding in low-lying areas||POINGUINIM: In a major natural or Cyclone Tauktae-induced development, the Galgibaga river has changed its course while separating from its smaller twin, the Mashem river, on the sea face. It now flows directly into the Arabian Sea. The Mashem river flows zig-zag, a short distance from Loliem in the south-east. Canacona taluka’s second biggest river, the Galgibaga, originates in the Western Ghats and flows westward, curving south to join the smaller river for the short gush to the sea. Galgibaga’s diversion to the left, near the sea, was necessitated by the formation of a spit - a tongue of sand - since hoary times, blocking its access. This natural barricade was partly broken in May, during the turbulent Cyclone Tauktae. Experts say that the sandbar along the Galgibaga has been subjected to erosion for a long time, mostly due to rough sea conditions and storm surges. “The sandbar was first breached at many places in August 2020 by Cyclone Vayu. The leftover sandbar was completely devastated by Cyclone Tauktae, resulting in the opening of a new channel,” senior geographer F M Nadaf told TOI. On Thursday, villagers were stunned to see strong waves dismantling the remnants of the sandy barrier, flattening more than 100m of it and carving out a new channel of about 15m for direct flowPreviously, the interaction of the Galgibaga with the Arabian Sea was through the Mashem creek, but now, due to the opening of this new channel, it is directly interacting with the sea, Nadaf said. “It was observed that during the last spring tide, the level of water in the Galgibaga was higher than the May 2021 period. This resulted in panic among locals.” On Thursday, villagers were stunned to see strong waves dismantling the remnants of the sandy barrier, flattening more than 100m of it and carving out a new channel of about 15m for direct flow. “The damage to the tongue of the spit was hardly 50m and easier to fill up, but the authorities concerned ignored the matter. Huge sea waves are now directly entering the river creating dangerous currents,” Mashem resident Manoj Prabhugaonkar said. The confluence of the two rivers on the sea face - something quite rare - was exactly what made these two rivers important and created a breathtaking view, especially at sunset. Now, however, the unprecedented opening has triggered panic as locals are apprehensive about flooding of low-lying houses at Mashem jetty and nearby. Just last week, a local fisherman almost drowned after his canoe capsized due to strong currents. The flow in the river has also resulted in the mangroves on the Mashem side gathering more sand and muck. The river changing its course could be disastrous to the ecosystem and local residents on its bank, villagers said. “This needs a high-level study or the mangrove cover will disappear completely, exposing the river bank to tidal currents, sea waves and floods in the rainy season” another local, Matilda Dias, said. Half a century ago, the confluence of the Mashem-Galgibaga rivers - that created an extensive channel between two rivers - was a thriving port, some elders said. Ships coming with goods from as far as China would dock here. “The creek was more than 10m deep,” a senior villager said. But, two decades back, the public works department’s (PWD) decision to reclaim the river along the eastern bank of the channel choked the flow and increased siltation. The villagers stopped the mud dumping for a bridge, but the damage had partly been done. PWD abandoned the work, but did not clear the embankment. “A sand bar which formed later made the river mouth shallow, affecting its ecology,” a villager said. In recent years, PWD took up and completed the highway expansion, reclaiming more area of the river. “All this will have an irreversible impact on the rivers’ ecology,” Prabhugaonkar said. “The threat to life and property will increase when spring tide and heavy rainfall like that of 2009 (Canacona disaster) transpires,” Nadaf said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/galgibaga-river-changes-course-locals-worried-about-flooding-in-low-lying-areas/articleshow/84360530.cms||Albert Fernandes

People convulsed in pain and shuddered with fear. I felt there was some tremor because I spotted some people rolling down the mountains and into the valley,” Hussein added. He said there was a stampede where people were falling into the mud after stumbling over the bodies of the dead. “There was complete chaos. We all were stranded at a faraway hill and no one could reach us easily because 2,000 steps separated us,” he said. Hussein said people were helping each other. “People who managed to get up after the first lightning strike gave CPR to other injured,” he said. The survivors said many injured were crying for help and water. Those present on the spot took water from a pit filled by the rain and splurged over the face of those lying lifeless. But in vain. “I just want to forget that day. I am alive, but I have nothing to feel happy about knowing that many others did not make it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2000-steps-separated-us-from-help-says-survivor-/articleshow/84360524.cms||---

She was hospitalized this past Saturday.  Jaina Sanghavi (31) is currently admitted to a hospital in her locality. Sanghavi was among the 390 recipients of fake vaccines in a drive held on May 30 at Kandivli’s Hiranandani Heritage housing society. Sandhavi told TOI she has been administered countless injections so far and has also been started on remdesivir. “The hospital bills have already run into several lakhs, with remdesivir itself being a costly drug. Apart from financial stress, there is the emotional stress of leaving my six-year-old daughter with my parents at Nalasopara. My daughter has a runny nose, which is also a concern. Besides, she has online school and her exams are also due, and I feel bad I am not around. All this has happened despite the fact that we had registered to get the vaccine well in time and by now would have been halfway into completion of my first dose while being due for the second dose next month,” she said, visibly upset that the authorities have been unable to provide clarity on re-vaccination more than a month after the fake drive. When asked if the recipients tried to get the jabs again after learning they were victims of the scam, Sanghavi said she and her husband were among those who had been issued vaccine certificates and their status on CoWin shows them as “partially vaccinated”. “The certificate given to us said we were administered the first dose by Lifeline Hospital. In such a situation, who would administer the vaccine to us?” said the home tutor who got Covid symptoms of cold and cough last week. When contacted, BMC officials said they are in the process of deciding on vaccination for all the victims of the alleged scam. “We are yet to get a report from the police on what was in the vaccine vials. In the last week of June, a team of health officials had also visited the society and the health status of the residents was checked over the phone,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fake-vaccine-recipient-tests-ve-hospitalized/articleshow/84355899.cms||Richa Pinto

The activity usually subsides after monsoon settles down with and widespread rainfall activity is seen. TOI spoke to scientists at Jaipur Met office and IMD to find out what makes an area prone to lightning. “First, cumulonimbus office clouds are responsible for lightning and thunderstorms in a particular region. And these clouds form when monsoon becomes active after a long break. On Sunday, monsoon arrived in Jaipur after a delay of almost 22 days and these clouds triggered lightning,” said Jaipur Met office director Radhey Shyam Sharma. Asked how these clouds a formed, an officer, said, “These clouds form when warm air rises from the earth and two different air masses meet. These clouds have updraft and downdraft which causes induction of charge realised in the form of thunderstorm,” said an officer. Scientists at IMD and Jaipur Met office said when non-seasonal rainfall activity is seen, it also brings lightning. “Cumulonimbus clouds are also formed during a cyclonic system that can even brings lightning and hailstorm,” said a scientist at IMD-Delhi. Authorities said even for lightning, they have various models that facilitates them in getting timely forecast. “We have our system that enables us to know about the direction, area and time where lightning can strike at a particular region.

Justice Gita Gopi observed so last week while dealing with a petition filed by one Rajatkumar Patel from Mehsana district, who was seeking protection from and action against certain police officials who allegedly threatened him and sought to seize his car because he had not paid Rs 30,000 bribe to the cops for his bail. Patel was arrested in 2019 in connection with crosscomplaints filed over a matrimonial dispute. He alleged that the cops extracted a certain amount from him towards settlement of the dispute, but he was still arrested. He was promised bail at payment of Rs 50,000. The amount was later settled on Rs 30,000, which he did not pay. He claimed that he received threats from the cops and faced seizure of his car so he decided to approach the HC. The judge discussed the issue of corruption at length and observed, “Corruption is the deadliest enemy of every free civilized society. The society has become a victim to the rampant corrupt practices of public servants.” The court further said that the Prevention of Corruption Act was to deal with rampant corruption among public servants. “It is a social legislation defined to curb illegal activities of public servants and is designed to be liberally constructed so as to advance its object.” After discussing the provisions of filing complaints as interpreted by the Supreme Court, the HC said that there is restriction on a private citizen filing a private complaint against a public servant. The court is not barred from taking cognizance of offence by relying on incriminating material collected by private citizen. It further said, “The corruption at any level by any person of any magnitude is condemnable which cannot be ignored by the judicial officer.” The HC asked Patel to either approach the Anti-Corruption Bureau or a court for redressal of his grievance under the anti-corruption laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/corruption-deadliest-enemy-of-society/articleshow/84360553.cms||---

For the final decision, the resolution will be kept on the general house meeting of MC on July 14. The house meeting will take place after a long gap and many issues like garbage lifting and increase in tipping fee to the contractor will be discussed. A long debate and discussion took place and now finally it is decided to shift the dairy complexes to Gorsian Kadar Baksh village. According to resolution, both dairy complexes are developed in 224.88 acres of land. The 818 plots are of 500 square yards while 86 plots are of 1,000 square yards. Certain land is lying vacant as well. The officials claimed that even proposal to install biogas plants should be shifted to the new location where dairy units will be shifted. The dairy owners had also agreed, but they had demanded for change of land use permission. The panchayat of Gorsian Kadar Baksh had also agreed to give their land for the modern dairy complex. The dairy units are linked directly to Buddha Nullah pollution and whenever the issue of Buddha nullah pollution gets highlighted, the government becomes worried about the shifting. This time there was pressure of National green Tribunal to curb the pollution in water bodies especially Buddha Nullah and the Satluj. To tackle this, a committee was formed and mayor Sandhu was made its chairman. After long discussions, this decision was taken and now final approval will be given in the house meeting. One of the officials said the city is growing and since it is a smart city, dairy complexes should be out of city so that there should not be any pollution source within city. He said even in city, the sewerage system remains choked near these dairy complexes so it will be a relief for the sewage system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/moving-dairy-complexes-away-from-buddha-nullah-to-be-finalised-on-july-14/articleshow/84358196.cms||---

He said the additional amount in the compensation amount under the norms of state disaster relief fund will be borne through chief minister’s relief fund. Gehlot was holding a review meeting of officers of diaster management through video conferencing from the CM’s residence to discuss monsoon preparedness. “The financial assistance for the injured in disasters such as lightning as per the norms of state disaster relief fund is inadequate. Thus, in order to provide every injured a financial assistance of Rs 2 lakh, the amount will be paid through the CM’s relief fund,” Gehlot said. Authorities said as per norms, an injured is entitled to get Rs 50,000 compensation and the rest will be given from the CM’s relief fund. Gehlot asked the authorities that in case of any calamity or disaster, the divisional commissioner, district collectors, SP should be sensitive and should visit the spot to monitor relief work. “With the presence of senior officers, relief work gets momentum and affected people get moral support,” Gehlot said. The chief minister also asked authorities to take stern action against those who were found negligent while performing their duties during a natural calamity or disaster. “The chief secretary should issue guidelines to ensure strict compliance of these orders during natural calamity,” the CM told authorities. Gehlot also urged authorities of the Met office to analyse and study excess rainfall, hailstorm, cyclones and lightning and should issue timely warnings. “The forecast on lightning, cyclones, hailstorm and excess rainfall should be sent to the department concerned so that they can have a contigency plan in advance,” he said. Gehlot also directed authorities to start purchase of the important equipment needed for the relief and rescue work by the state disaster relief force and urged on strengthening civil defence. Disaster management principal secretary Anand Kumar came up with with a presentation on the preparedness during flood or flood-like situation during monsoon. He informed that areas porne to excess rainfall, waterlogging and having chances of getting flooded have been identified. “We have set up control rooms in district and state level and authorities of water resources, public health and engineering department (PHED), police and SDRF have been issued directions to act together,” Kumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-announces-r2l-relief-for-injured-additional-gap-will-filled-through-cm-relief-fund/articleshow/84360566.cms||---

GMCH authorities belatedly offered a ventilator from the 154 machines reserved for Covid patients, but it was too late for the woman. The focus on Covid-19 seems to have cost this patient her life due to lack of timely medical care. As per latest government records, the tertiary care facility has 154 ventilators kept exclusively to treat Covid-19 patients. Doctors said apprehensions regarding cross-infection deter them from using the ventilators for other patients. There are another 150 ventilators available on paper for regular patients. However, almost all of these are awaiting repairs or have been discarded, leaving the medicine ward with just 10 functional ventilators, doctors said. GMCH dean Dr Sudhir Gupta refused to comment on both, availability of ventilators and the death. The patient’s relatives told TOI that before they could move her to another hospital she passed away in GMCH casualty ward. “They admitted her but had made it clear that ventilator was not available,” they said. The patient had been brought to the city from Betul for better treatment and investigations after suffering paralysis. “Where can poor patient go but government hospital?” a relative said. The GMCH conducted a postmortem and released the body on Monday evening. The incident came to fore after activist Akshay Samarth circulated a WhatsApp message claiming “patient needs a ventilator, but they (GMCH) are saying that ventilator is not available. Can anyone help” on Sunday evening. On Monday, Samarth said, “Within a few minutes of my request, GMCH agreed to make available a ventilator but she passed away before that. Her condition had worsened as the relatives had delayed bringing her to GMCH.” GMCH doctors admitted that the increased rush of regular patients and surgeries had led to paucity of equipment. “We have started utilizing Covid wards, as they are vacant, to accommodate other patients. There is no point in keeping these wards shut and sending back other patients,” they said. The doctors added, “Maintenance of ventilators, oxygen ports, beds, electrical fittings, air conditioning is underway. These wards will be vacated if Covid cases surge. Right now, only 10 ventilators are functioning in non-Covid wards. Over 100 ventilators are not in use, with some needing repairs, some parts not available, and some discarded. Hence it is difficult to spare a ventilator immediately on arrival of a patient. Using Covid ventilators for non-Covid patient is risky. They may cause infection.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/woman-dies-sans-ventilator-at-gmch-as-154-covid-units-lie-idle/articleshow/84358253.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The LIT had appealed to civic body for taking over this work in five colonies because of repeated complaints of public. Now, the house will decide whether civic body will take over this task or not. The LIT has asked to handle the water supply and sewerage system in schemes like Rishi Nagar, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, Rajguru Nagar and Sant Isher Singh flats. It is not for the first time that such proposal has been put up in front of civic officials, as earlier proposal to take over these schemes was discussed and approved in the MC general house in 2013. But LIT had refused to hand over the scheme areas, as managing them forms major work for LIT at the moment. The civic officials calculated that annual cost for tubewells, water supply and sewerage maintenance and cost of establishment will be around Rs 1.65 crore. Apart from this, six tubewells are old and need replacement that will cost Rs 1.30 crore and cleaning of five-kilometre sewerage line will be done at cost of Rs 38 lakh. The civic officials also claimed if they will maintain all these things then they will recover water supply and sewerage dues from people who live in these colonies that will around Rs 9 lakh per month and annually it will be Rs 1.08 crores. Meanwhile, the residents of these colonies demanded that not only water supply and sewerage maintenancem, but other basic services should also go to MC from LIT. A resident of area Arvind Sharma said the MC will at least maintain things in better manner because they have technical staff to maintain things, but LIT does not have required infrastructure. However, the civic officials claimed that the house will decide about the proposal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-house-to-take-call-on-managing-water-supply-sewerage-of-lit-scheme-areas/articleshow/84358308.cms||---

For the Serbian government has issued new Covid-19 guidelines according to which all foreign citizens arriving in Serbia from countries of special risk like India will receive mandatory quarantine measures for 7 days in home self-isolation. Amin, an engineering graduate, who has enrolled for a masters’ degree in web designing at a university in Toronto, had earlier booked a direct flight for Canada on April 25 but the flight got cancelled on April 23 amid the second wave of Covid-19. She decided to take a longer de-tour even if it meant spending extra bucks to get there. As a result, she got a ticket to Canada by travelling from Ahmedabad via Mumbai, Frankfurt and Serbia before reaching her destination. There are many like Amin from Gujarat who have got transit visas and plan to hop from one country to another and using stopovers at international airports to reach Canada in time for the second term of their college studies. Riddhi Patel, who holds a BE in computer science and has enrolled for a masters’ degree programme in hardware and networking programme at a college in Toronto says the change in quarantine rules in Serbia is going to be an expensive affair as candidates like her will have to cancel and book new tickets as well as bear the expense of getting quarantined at a hotel. There are over 200 students from India who got stuck in Belgrade due to the new quarantine rules, said sources. . “Out of 205 stranded Indians at Belgrade airport, 120 are travelling today by Lufthansa. Indians travelling by other airlines will fly today or tomorrow,” the Indian Embassy in Serbia said on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/serbia-quarantine-rule-poses-fresh-hurdle-for-city-students/articleshow/84360614.cms||Bharat Yagnik

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka students head to Goa & Maharashtra for ‘network’||BELAGAVI: Around 100 SSLC students of Khanapur are forced to commute to Goa and Maharashtra borders ahead of exams due to lack of internet connectivity in their villages, nestled in thick forests along the Western Ghats. As no telecom operators offer service in these 10 villages, the children travel up to 12km every day to reach hilly areas in neighbouring states. They sit atop hillocks, smartphones, textbooks and notebooks in hand, jotting down key points to prepare for the exam. Datta Gayakwad’s niece walks about 8km along with her father, carrying books in one bag and food in the other, to a hill located in Sattari district in Goa. Children from other villages — Maan, Sada, Huland, Parawad, Chugle and Chikale for instance — go to Surla, on foot or bicycle. “It’s an arduous task for the children who are already under pressure due to the uncertainty caused by the pandemic,” says Gayakwad. Kids: Have to travel through forest routesFrom Kanakumbi and Jamboti too, some 60 SSLC students go to Sindhudurg in Maharashtra. They start from home early in the morning, spend the day in studies and return home around 5pm. “We have no option but to travel every day as we have no network. My friends and I have to travel through forest routes to reach a hill station with connectivity and we are afraid of animals attacking us,” said Nagesh Sutar, an SSLC student. “Although there is a BSNL tower in Kanakumbi, where I stay, due to power disruption we face huge inconvenience.” Khanapur MLA Anjali Nimbalkar said she has brought the plight of the children to the notice of the education minister and is expecting a speedy solution. Belagavi DDPI Dr H Pundalik said earlier, teachers were reaching students in these villages but the practice was halted due to lockdown in the second wave. “We will now make some arrangements for all such students to assemble in one place,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/students-head-to-goa-maha-for-network/articleshow/84363551.cms||Basavaraj Meeshi
---||Mysuru||Karnataka: Privacy issues hit Rs 2,000 aid for domestic helps||MYSURU: Domestic workers across the state, who are entitled to Rs 2,000 Covid relief announced by the government, are struggling to furnish proof of employment which is mandatory to get the assistance. On the high court’s nudge, the government had stepped in to simplify the process, and allowed employers to certify helps. Employers, however, are required to give proof of their identity and most are reluctant to part with their Aadhaar number or PAN. An estimated 10 lakh domestic workers are eligible for the Rs 2,000 one-time assistance from the state government. Many lost their jobs during the May-July lockdown and are only now eyeing a return to normalcy. Labour minister Shivaram Hebbar defended the move, citing the HC’s intervention. Initially, the state government had asked domestic workers to get their proof of employment certified by a gazetted officer. Employers should not be wary of sharing identity details: Labour chiefThe process was delayed incessantly, forcing the domestic workers union to file a PIL. Chief justice Abhay Sreeniwas Oka, who presided over the case, summoned the labour secretary and directed the government to simplify the process. Accordingly, the labour department issued an amended government order allowing domestic workers to get a proof of employment from any of their employers. “First we were asked to apply for Rs 2,000 with the door number of the houses where we were working, along with the house owner’s name. Now, we are asked to get the signature of house owners with their Aadhaar number/PAN. A majority of the house owners are declining to sign and share the document,” said Bhagya S Pura, a domestic help from Mysuru. Sandhya PS, Mysuru district committee member of the All India United Trade Union Centre, said house helps are struggling to convince employers. State labour commissioner Akram Pasha said employers should not be wary of sharing identity details. “We use the ID numbers given by house owners only for verification If the house owners decline to share ID details citing privacy concerns, domestic helps can always take the help of gazetted officers or panchayat development officers for certification,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/privacy-issues-hit-2k-aid-for-domestic-helps/articleshow/84363553.cms||---

He had earlier spoken to his friends asking them to take care of his mother and also relayed them about his decision to end life through a conference call. Ambazari police have procured CCTV footage of the incident in which the teenager can be spotted gradually moving on his bike towards the slope leading to the lake. There was a boundary wall guarding the lake, but it has been pulled down due to ongoing renovation work. Sources said a mentally disturbed woman’s car too had slid down the slope into the lake water from the same place. Anandewar, who had an outing with a group at a resort on Saoner Road a day ago, stunned his friends by ending his life within 24 hours. Prior to his taking the drastic step, Anandewar had spoken to friends, but did not reveal the reason behind ending his life. Anandewar, staying at Ambedkar Nagar at Control Wadi, was the younger of the two siblings. His mother is learnt to have gifted him the bike around a year ago. His father worked at a tile factory in MIDC. A friend, who had rushed to dissuade Anandewar after he relayed his decision, said he wanted to save his friend but did not know swimming. “We had managed to reach Futala Lake, but he had already taken the plunge,” said the friend. “We could see him drowning. One of us had even jumped into the lake, but to no avail. Some of us also had thrown bamboos and planks into the water for Atharv to latch-on, but he soon disappeared under the water,” said the friend. Senior inspector Narendra Hiware of Ambazari police station said the bike was fished out of the lake with the help of fire department personnel. “The body could be traced after a couple of hours and it has been sent for postmortem,” he said. Ambazari police have registered the case as accidental death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/19-year-old-drives-bike-into-futala-lake-ends-life/articleshow/84358395.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Delhi||50% of Delhi’s budget schools await 2-year-old EWS payment||NEW DELHI: Close to 50% of the budget private schools in the city claim to have not received EWS reimbursement even for 2019-20. The schools say if the amount is released now, it will help them stay afloat for a few months during this pandemic time. With the general admission not taking place and many parents not paying tuition fees due to Covid-19, a few private schools have already closed operations. Sudesh Thakur of Mata Kaushalya School in Kakroli said she was yet to receive Rs 16 lakh for close to 80 students belonging to the economically weaker section. Earlier when the school, which has till Class VIII, was functioning well, it had around 400 children. “In nursery classes, there has been no new admission in my school; in KG, there are two. The ones who are studying have not been paying fees. It is becoming difficult to even pay salaries. I have borrowed money from here and there to keep the school afloat,” claimed Thakur. Sant Lal of National Public School, Narela said the reimbursement had been pending since 2018-19. “We were told to get the verification done, but there is no movement even after submitting it. If the government clears the dues, we would have some amount to sustain the school,” said Lal. The school is till Class XII and Lal is worried about clearing its electricity bill and rent. The city has close to 2,200 budget private schools with around 5 lakh students. Under Section 12(1)(C) of Right to Education (RTE) Act 2009, 25% of the seats in a private school are reserved for EWS/disadvantaged (EWS/DG). The government reimburses a maximum amount of Rs 2,260 per month for various fees for each student and a separate amount for the uniform. While the Centre contributes 65% of the amount, 35% is borne by the state. The director of the directorate of education (DoE), Udit Prakash Rai, did not respond to the query on the matter. Private Land Public School Trust has also written to DoE requesting for the release of at least 50% of the reimbursement amount for 2020-21. “Most of the budget affordable schools are running in the un-regulated area, where most of the people belong to very humble backgrounds. Due to Covid-19, they are also facing financial problems. Most of them have lost their job and are not in a position to pay the fees regularly,” said Chandrakant Singh, national general secretary of the trust. Due to this, he added, most budget schools’ collection from fees has come down. “Our survival is in danger. We request DoE to release at least 50% of the EWS reimbursement for 2020-21 to save us from closure,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/50-of-citys-budget-schools-await-2-yr-old-ews-payment/articleshow/84391853.cms||Shradha Chettri

---||Delhi||Delhi: Yamuna level lowest since 1965, says Raghav Chadha||NEW DELHI: While visiting Wazirabad barrage on Monday, Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice-chairman Raghav Chadha alleged that as Haryana had withheld the capital’s share of water, the Yamuna levels had reduced to the lowest since 1965. The water level has reportedly gone down by 7.5 feet. He added that the capacity of Delhi’s water treatment plants (WTP) had reduced by 100 million gallons per day (MGD). “Haryana has withheld at least 120 MGD water and this has caused a huge crisis in Delhi. We rely on our neighbouring states for water supply. The biggest share is supposed to be supplied by Haryana,” claimed Chadha. Against the normal level of 674.5 feet, water level at Wazirabad pond has gone down to 667 feet. Currently, Chandrawal WTP is supplying 55 MGD against its capacity of 90 MGD, Wazirabad WTP is producing 80 MGD against 135 MGD and Okhla WTP is supplying 12 MGD against 20 MGD. “So far, all governments have been abiding by the water sharing arrangement ordered by Supreme Court, except Haryana. DJB has moved Supreme Court against Haryana government seeking Delhi’s legitimate share of water as determined in 1995,” said the DJB VC. Claiming that a part of the riverbed had dried up to a point that it could be used as a sports field, Chadha warned that the situation may cause a crisis in central Delhi and NDMC areas like the PM’s residence, Supreme Court, the high court and the diplomatic zone. “The water levels in Haryana are higher than their requirement. They are deliberately not releasing water to Delhi. As there has been sufficient rainfall there, the water levels have remained high,” he added. Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta and party workers demonstrated outside water minister Satyendar Jain’s residence to protest against the ongoing water crisis. “BJP will disconnect the water supply to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s house if the system in Delhi is not corrected in the next 48 hours. While Haryana has to provide 500 MGD water, it is supplying 640 MGD. Chadha and the CM are blaming Haryana government to hide their own shortcomings,” said Gupta. Meanwhile, several colonies across Delhi reported shortage of water supply on Monday. Vasant Vihar Welfare Association took to social media to register its protest. It said Vasant Vihar had been facing a severe water crisis for the past few months and they were without a drop of water for the last two days. “Other neighbouring colonies are getting water, but we as an A-Grade colony have been left high and dry,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/yamuna-level-lowest-since-1965-says-chadha/articleshow/84358408.cms||---

---||Surat||Gujarat: BJP worker hacked to death in Navsari over past rift||SURAT: A BJP worker was murdered outside his house of his relative in Navsari late on Sunday night over a past rift. The deceased Shailesh Parmar, who worked as a driver, was leaving for his home, when six persons identified as Sumit Jadhav, Umesh Vanam, Rakesh Solanki, Piyush Thakore, Ajit Mishra and Rajesh Diwakar, attacked him with pipes, knives and an axe. Police said that Vanam had been seething in anger to take revenge for his brother Nilesh’s murder that took place during Navratri in 2017. Police said that Nilesh had a fight with a few people including Parmar which had led to his death. The conflict was resolved then as Nilesh’s family and those involved in his death had reached a settlement. Vanam, however, wanted to take revenge so he planned the murder along with five others. On Sunday night when Parmar was approaching his scooter, Jadhav hit a pipe on Parmar’s head due to which he collapsed. Vanam then hit an axe on Parmar’s head a few times. On hearing the commotion when Parmar’s relatives rushed to help, the attackers targeted them as well. After a couple of minutes the attackers fled in two auto-rickshaws and Parmar was taken to Navsari Civil Hospital from where he was referred to a private hospital. He succumbed to his injuries on Sunday midnight during treatment. Parmar’s nephew lodged a complaint of rioting, murder and criminal conspiracy at Navsari Town police station.  On Monday, police detained Jadhav, Vanam, Mishra and Thakore. “We have kept them in quarantine and will formally arrest them on Tuesday when their Covid-19 test report arrive,” said a police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/bjp-worker-hacked-to-death-over-past-rift/articleshow/84356143.cms||---
---||Mumbai||MIDC was not under Eknath Khadse but he gave orders on land: ED||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate has alleged that a note indicated Eknath Khadse had, as revenue minister, despite having no charge of MIDC, given directions for acquisition of the disputed Pune land and not informed the concerned department. MIDC comes under the industry ministry. Meanwhile, the ED also recorded the statement of an alleged shell company’s ex-director through which Khadse’s arrested son-in-law Girish Chaudhari (47) raised Rs 2 crore to purchase the land. The ex-director said he used get Rs 25,000 for signing balance sheets and it was just a “paper company.” The ED made the submissions before the special PMLA court, after which Chaudhari was remanded to the agency’s custody till Thursday. He was arrested on July 7. Chaudhari’s advocate Mohan Tekavde opposed the remand plea and said all relevant documents were lying with the government, hence the question of his custody did not arise. The court allowed the defence lawyer to be present for two hours during Chaudhari’s interrogation. Chaudhari on July 9 had claimed he had interacted with the company, Ms Benchmark Buildcon’s chief director Om Prakash, while availing loan for the land. The ED in its remand plea submitted and argued by special public prosecutor Kavita Patil said that neither had the ex-director mentioned any chief director by the name of Om Prakash nor did any documents show him holding such a position with the company. Chaudhari refused to disclose details and whereabouts of Om Prakash during his questioning by ED. The ED alleged the source of funds was not genuine. It said the money was layered and routed through shell companies, which are either dysfunctional or ceased to exist later. The ED said there are documents from the revenue department which signified MIDC has right over the land. The statement of Pune’s deputy collector stated the land was in MIDC’s possession, ED said. The ED had alleged that on April 12, 2016, a meeting was held in Khadse’s chamber for acquisition of the Pune land. It was alleged Khadse had given directions to immediately start the process as there “was injustice to the owner of the land”. The ED further alleged that within 15 days, a transaction took place, where only for Rs 3.75 crore, the land was purchased by Khadse’s wife Mandakini and Chaudhari. The land’s government value at that time was Rs 31 crore. The ED recorded Khadse’s statement last week. While he told ED he could not give directions to MIDC officers as it was not part of his portfolio at that time, however, he was present at the meeting. The ED in its remand plea said it wanted to ascertain under what capacity Khadse was present, so statements of officers present are required to be recorded. The remand plea said Khadse was questioned about the internal note of Chief Executive Officer, whose subject mentioned it was regarding completion of “Land Acquisition process” of the Pune property. The ED said the note said on April 12, 2016, at 4 pm, a meeting was called by revenue minister in his office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/midc-was-not-under-khadse-but-he-gave-orders-on-land-in-mumbai-ed/articleshow/84360725.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Delhi||Delhi Jal Board seeks urgent hearing on water||NEW DELHI: The Delhi government on Monday sought urgent hearing before the Supreme Court on its contempt plea against Haryana for not supplying the portion of water which it is entitled to as per the Supreme Court’s order, saying there is a possibility of severe water crisis in the national capital. It said water supply to the President’s Estate, Parliament House and important buildings has already been curtailed. The petition filed by Delhi Jal Board, seeking contempt proceedings against Haryana chief secretary Vijai Vardhan and other officials, alleged that the Wazirabad reservoir is only 31% full. It said as per the apex court’s order, the water level at Wazirabad reservoir was to be kept full to its capacity by Haryana in order to meet the drinking water needs of the NCT of Delhi. Refuting the allegation of the Delhi government, the Haryana government has said it has fulfilled its commitment even at a time when deficient rainfall had reduced flows in the Yamuna. It has said data at Munak water works will show that Haryana had not cut back on supply of water. “Due to non-supply of adequate water by the state of Haryana, the water level in the Wazirabad reservoir stands at only 667.60 feet as against the mandated level of 674.50 feet, as on July 10. This means that the Wazirabad reservoir is only 31% full,” Delhi government’s counsel Shadan Farasat said in his letter to Supreme Court seeking urgent hearing. “As such, the urgent intervention of this Honourable Court is required as the National Capital Territory of Delhi is staring at an extremely grave and precipitate water crisis. It is therefore prayed that the matter be processed for urgent mentioning through VC before the Court of the Chief Justice of India,” he said. “The captioned petition filed by me seeks initiation of contempt proceedings against Vijai Vardhan and Devender Singh, Additional Chief Secretary, Irrigation and Water Resources Department, Haryana for wilful disobedience of order dated February 29, 1996 of this court....whereby this court had directed that the water level at Wazirabad reservoir was to be kept full to its capacity by the state of Haryana, in order to meet the drinking water needs of the National Capital Territory of Delhi,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/djb-seeks-urgent-hearing-on-water/articleshow/84358378.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Choked! Naraina village pond dries up in 20 years||NEW DELHI: Residents of Naraina village have written to Delhi Jal Board (DJB) and Delhi Cantonment Board highlighting the disappearance of a 12-acre waterbody in the area, which satellite data shows has now dried up completely. Satellite images from the years 2000, 2004, 2009 and 2021 show the waterbody gradually reducing in size, with an effluent treatment plant stretched out in the area. The locals have sought efforts to be made to revive the waterbody and ensure the area is not encroached upon further. Paras Tyagi, an activist with the NGO Cycle-India, said the waterbody had been disregarded over time and its water level had reduced each year. Simultaneously, encroachments occurred in the area, reducing the expanse the waterbody once had. On Monday, he wrote to the DJB CEO asking for attention to be drawn to the waterbody. In his letter, Tyagi showed satellite images stating that an opportunity for local use of water and natural groundwater recharge was missed by not saving the village pond. “The Delhi chief secretary has passed an order that clearly states no ponds should be filled up or reclaimed by any individual or organisation. But today, barring a few waterbodies in the public eye, all others are left ignored and are in a dilapidated condition. Residents have to bear the consequences as they suffer the most due to inappropriate and unsatisfactory supply of water,” said Tyagi. Aditya Tanwar, a Naraina resident who tracked the disappearance, said the waterbody was spread over 12 acres and was flourishing till the year 2000. It was a part of five local johads in the area. “In government records, only two out of these five waterbodies are recognised. A number of waterbodies in other villages have also slowly disappeared. The authorities have systematically encroached upon this village pond too, which was the largest of the five,” he added. Last year, the NGO had released a “health” scorecard of 1,009 waterbodies across Delhi, mapping each through geocoordinates provided by Delhi Parks and Gardens Society. Each waterbody was given a score from 0 to 7, where 7 was the healthiest. The analysis found that only 327 waterbodies had water through the year, while 345 were dry and fully bereft of water. Another 302 had been given negative health ratings because they were found to have been partially or completely encroached upon. Among the prominent ponds, Naini, Sanjay and Bhalswa lakes had scored 4 on the index. The Mehrauli (Kishangarh) lake was given a score of 2.5, while Khirki lake scored 2. The waterbodies at Rajokri and Hauz Khas scored 3.5 on the index.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/choked-naraina-village-pond-dries-up-in-20-yrs/articleshow/84358483.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Delhi||Not even a drop: Monsoon continues to test patience in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Monsoon continues to elude Delhi. On Monday, Delhi saw overcast skies, but no rain. For the past three days, India Meteorological Department (IMD) has been waiting for rain to declare the onset of the monsoon over the capital. The department had recently forecast the monsoon to cover Delhi by July 10. Met officials say the shifting of the monsoon trough southwards, with it currently passing through south Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, is one of the key reasons why rain has been eluding Delhi over the last 72 hours. IMD on Monday said such types of failures by its models and predictions were ‘rare’. “It is needless to mention that IMD has predicted well with high accuracy about the advance of the monsoon over Delhi quite accurately in the recent past years and also the advancement of the monsoon over different parts of the country during the monsoon-2021 accurately, about four to five days ahead,” said the department in a statement. “The situation is being monitored continuously and regular updates are being given on its progress into the remaining parts of northwest India.” IMD said Delhi had largely been unlucky during this spell with easterly winds at lower levels establishing on July 8 and from July 9 onwards, easterly winds had established over plans of northwest India. “These moisture-laden easterly winds led to an increase in cloudiness and relative humidity. It also led to revival of the monsoon over the region and occurrence of fairly widespread rainfall activity over east Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir and scattered rainfall over Punjab and west Rajasthan. However, it did not cause significant rainfall activity over Delhi even though there was rainfall activity over neighbouring places around Delhi,” India Meteorological Department stated. A Met official said conditions remained ‘favourable’ for rainfall to occur, but patchy rains were being seen in parts of Haryana and south of Delhi. “A decent spell of rain will mean the monsoon can be declared. The movement of the monsoon trough towards Madhya Pradesh has made it difficult for sufficient rain to occur in Delhi,” added the official. IMD had on July 9 forecast ‘moderate’ showers to occur in the city between July 11 and 13. The normal date for the southwest monsoon to enter Delhi is June 27, meaning it has been delayed by over two weeks now. Till 8.30 pm on Monday, no station in Delhi had recorded any rainfall, despite the weather department forecasting chances of light rain in parts of east Delhi, north Delhi and northwest Delhi during the day. Delhi’s maximum temperature on Monday stood at 37.7 degrees Celsius — two notches above normal for this time of the season. IMD forecasts light showers and overcast skies for Tuesday, with the maximum expected to dip to 33 degrees Celsius.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/not-even-a-drop-monsoon-continues-to-test-patience/articleshow/84358443.cms||---
---||Delhi||On a wing and in the clear: 5 more butterfly parks in Delhi soon||NEW DELHI: Though Delhi has around 55 butterfly parks, Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) is creating five more gardens for the winged insects ahead of the capital’s annual butterfly month in September. Over 50 host plant species will be planted at each site to attract the lepidoptera. BNHS officials said the butterfly parks are being developed near Singhu border in association with the forest department, at Bal Bharti School in Rajinder Nagar in collaboration with the school authorities and at Narmada Apartments in Alaknanda with the help of the RWA. Two other jlocations are being identified. At Singhu border, the park will have other features like gardens, pathways, amphitheater and a gazebo. “We want to develop these butterfly parks in the monsoon and introduce the host species there so they are ready during the butterfly month in September when the counting of the species is conducted,” said a forest official. Explaining why such parks are important, Sohail Madan of BNHS said, “Habitat destruction is a common problem for wildlife across the world. In most parks, the use of chemicals and fertilisers and degrading of the environment, like removal of grass and wildflowers, have affected the population of butterflies. However, butterflies are territorial. In their adult phase, they look for mates and a plant on which to lay their eggs. So putting up host plants for common butterflies in homes, schools and gardens will help increase the lepidoptera population.” A forest official reiterated, “Butterflies lay eggs on the host plants and the caterpillars feed on the leaves of these plants. The introduction of host plants attracts butterflies, and people can help by planting these species in their garden.” Madan added that by involving residents, BNHS seeks to create a network of local people who will help in creating habitats for butterflies and work for the conservation of the environment. The locals also help in maintaining data related to sightings of species. Among the common butterflies found in Delhi are Red Pierrot, Common Jay, Tawny Coster, Plain Tiger, Lemon Pansy and Common Lime. According to BNHS, which has been organising the butterfly month in September, 69 species were observed in Delhi in 2017, increasing a year later to 75. However, in 2019, the number had declined to 66 species. The report for 2020 is still being compiled because the butterfly census was conducted across the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/on-a-wing-and-in-the-clear-5-more-butterfly-parks-in-city-soon/articleshow/84358507.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The new editor, Poornima Mohan, a Sanskrit professor, was appointed as the Malayalam lexicon editor by KU, allegedly under the influence of the office of the chief minister. Poornima is the spouse of R Mohan, a former IRS officer working as the officer on special duty at the CMO. It is alleged that Poornima, being not proficient enough in Malayalam, is not a scholar fit for the responsibility of the Malayalam lexicon editor, a post renowned Malayalam scholar like Sooranadu Kunjan Pillai had occupied in the past. Poornima, however, refused to react to the allegations that she was considered for the job owing to the influence her husband has in the CMO. “I saw a notification and applied for the post. The university has selected me after completing the due process. I’m victimised for being a woman. I don’t need to prove myself in front of these people. It’s for the university to respond to such allegations,” she told reporters after police forcibly removed the KSU workers from her office. Save University Campaign Committee (SUCC) that raked up the appointment row alleged that the university vice-chancellor had unilaterally changed the qualification criteria prescribed in the university statute. “The VC revised the qualification prescribed for the lexicon editor. While the statute says that a Malayalam linguist of excellence with degree and postgraduate degrees in Malayalam should be considered for the post, the VC in the notification has changed the qualification as ‘eminent scholar having PhD degree in Malayalam/Sanskrit’. This was done clearly to tweak the norms to suit the qualification of Poornima Mohan,” said SUCC chairman R S Sasikumar. The committee has also submitted a petition to governor Arif Mohammed Khan, seeking an inquiry into the nepotism and favouritism charges against the university authorities. Meanwhile, KU has termed the allegations baseless. In a statement, the university said the appointment of Poornima was made on a deputation basis. “Steps are being taken to appoint a full-time director. For the past several years, university faculties were given the additional charge of the lexicon editor...Sanskrit was added in the list of qualifications as the scholarship in Sanskrit would be of great help for the lexicon editor,” the statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/lexicon-editors-posting-in-kerala-varsity-kicks-up-row/articleshow/84356269.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Rs7 lakh bridge, built 6 months ago, washed away||Nagpur: A cement causeway across a tributary of Pili river in north Nagpur, built to connect Chitrashala Nagar with Kalamna, was washed away in last week’s rain. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) public works department had spent Rs7 lakh to construct the bridge just six months ago. The residents of this part of the city, including 24 localities like Chitrashala, Laxmi Nagar, Parvati Nagar, Ganesh Nagar etc are facing severe hardship on losing the crucial link to the city, locals told TOI. These localities had been facing a lot of inconvenience due to the lack of a bridge to reach the city (Kalamna side), as they had to take a long detour. Despite following up with NMC and Nagpur Improvement Trust, nothing had happened for years. With no response from either the local civic body and civic agency, the residents had earlier made temporary arrangements by putting wooden beams over the nullah. But it caused many accidents as the wooden slabs used to tilt often. Following several memorandums, local corporator Sheshrao Gotmare got the sanction for the construction of the cement bridge over the nullah in 2020. The Lakadganj zone PWD got the work done through a private contractor. NMC had also laid big pipes beneath the bridge to ensure free flow of water over the bridge meant only for light vehicles. But the bridge failed to withstand the first heavy rain, with one end of the bridge caving in, said local activist Shahnawaz Sheikh. Another resident, Sitaram Sahu, questioned the quality of the bridge’s construction. He alleged that the bridge was not constructed properly, and sub-standard material was used by the contractor. Lakadganj zone executive engineer Rakshamwar did not respond to TOI’s calls and text message. Gotmare admitted that the pipe beneath the bridge had come out and as a result one end of the bridge caved in. It will be repaired soon, the corporator assured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rs7-lakh-bridge-built-6-months-ago-washed-away/articleshow/84358524.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

A bench of Justice A Rajasheker Reddy and Justice Shameem Akther told this to state home department counsel, T Srikanth Reddy, while hearing a petition that challenged the detention of Akula Swati, a resident of Market Road in Nakrekal town of Nalgonda district. The allegation against her is that she was selling Tupperware utensils and duping people with false promises of securing them a dealership of the company. Several people who lost their money filed complaints against her. The police then detained her under PD Act, and she has been lodged at Chanchalguda women’s prison from May 7. Her mother, Gopisetti Shailaja, filed a petition in the HC challenging her detention. Her counsel said the charges against Swati, who is six months into her pregnancy and also has a 5-year-old son, can be dealt with the help of IPC provisions. The home department counsel said that they are ready with a counter, and would file it and argue the case next week. However, while giving him the time sought, the bench made it clear that it will not hear the case on merits. “The fact that she is pregnant, is enough to set her free on bail, and PD Act cannot be sustained on such people,” the bench said. “You need not argue this on merits. We have already pronounced our judgment in a similar case earlier,” the bench said referring to the case of Majji Rajeswari, resident of Malkajgiri in Ranga Reddy district. She was detained under the provisions of PD Act in Chanchalguda women’s prison. Rachakonda police had arrested Rajeswari for immoral trafficking. Two cases were registered against her in Meerpet and Uppal police stations. According to the police, she was trafficking women from Bangladesh for prostitution here. The bench, in its judgment, said she was eight months pregnant, and hence cannot be jailed for longer periods as PD Act does not allow any bail to such prisoners. “A life that affects a pregnant woman’s physical and mental health, which in turn affects the health of the unborn child in the womb of a mother, is not a proper life at all,” the bench said while setting aside the detention order of the police and the state’s consequent GO authorising her detention under PD Act. “The life and liberty of the mother cannot be extricated from that of an unborn child, as there is no life for a fetus separated from that of its mother. Thus, the protection of the health and well-being of an incarcerated pregnant woman is a matter that certainly requires greater attention by the courts of law and other law-enforcing agencies,” said the HC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wont-tolerate-pd-act-against-pregnant-women-hc-to-cops/articleshow/84362563.cms||---
---||Delhi||Private player to manage civic services at Delhi's Chandni Chowk||NEW DELHI: Cleanliness and maintenance of the redeveloped Chandni Chowk will be managed by a private company that will be selected by the public works department. The Delhi government has initiated the process to appoint the company. North Delhi Municipal Corporation officials are, however, not very happy with the decision. Former mayor and municipal councillor from Sadar Bazar ward Jai Prakash said that waste management was the obligatory function of the civic body under the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act. “The maintenance of the Chandni Chowk stretch is being privatised, while the DMC Act clearly states that such services fall under the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation. If the same amount of funds is provided to the municipal corporation, its sanitation workers can carry out the work,” he added. A senior corporation official said that four toilet complexes were to be developed in the 1.3-km long stretch near Red Fort Junction, Bhagirath Palace, Fountain Chowk and Press Building. “We had prepared a plan to give advertisement rights on these buildings to the operator who would have in turn carried out cleanliness and maintenance of the stretch. The proposal was also put up in the standing committee meeting. It has now been decided that PWD will issue tenders to appoint a company. They may ultimately hand over the municipal solid waste to the corporation,” the official stated. Sanjay Bhargava, who heads Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, however, welcomed the government’s move. “We have been demanding from the beginning that a private agency with manpower deployed round the clock should be managing this key stretch. Municipal workers clean the road once in the morning, which is not sufficient for such a busy commercial market,” he added. According to the redevelopment plans, a big toilet complex will be constructed near Fountain Chowk. Its ground floor will have female toilets and 1st floor male toilets. CCTV control room will be set up on the second floor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pvt-player-to-manage-civic-services-at-chandni-chowk/articleshow/84358489.cms||Paras Singh
---||Delhi||Delhi: Burglar who targeted houses in Lutyens’ held||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police arrested a notorious burglar who targeted residences of government officials in Lutyens’ Delhi and stole jewellery, cash, crockery and other valuable items. The accused was identified as Karan (28), a resident of Bijnore in Uttar Pradesh. Cops said he had carried out back-to-back burglaries at four houses between Saturday and Monday last week, including two on Sunday. Nine cases of burglaries reported from Lutyens’ have been solved with Karan’s arrest. Police have recovered the stolen goods, including foreign currency. Karan, police claimed, worked as a labourer at a government residential complex earlier and realised it wasn’t tough to break the locks and hinges of government accommodations, most of which were in dilapidated condition. Police started tracking the suspect after multiple incidents of burglary were reported in localities like Ravinder Nagar and Pandara Road. “The modus operandi was to target locked houses. CCTV footage from the localities were analysed, which revealed that the burglar struck alone and the same person had committed theft in multiple houses of the same locality,” DCP Deepak Yadav said. The description of burglar was studied and a team of Special Staff, New Delhi District was constituted and deployed in civvies. Through technical surveillance, it was found that accused entered the target house from an adjacent house, which had been locked. Traps were laid and the suspect was apprehended. A search of his bag showed he was carrying break-in equipment, including iron cutters. The accused was interrogated during which he broke down and confessed to his crimes. Karan also led the police staff to Kotla Mubarakpur where he had a room on rent to store the stolen items. The accused was arrested in a similar case last year and sent to jail. He was released eight months back and went to Dehradun to look for a job but couldn’t find any, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Thereafter, he headed back to Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/burglar-who-targeted-houses-in-lutyens-held/articleshow/84358539.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Yellow alert today, brace for a wet week as monsoon picks up pace||MUMBAI: After a dry Sunday, the rains picked up pace on Monday with isolated heavy showers being witnessed across the city. Train services were disrupted after a tree fall incident between Churchgate and Marine Lines railway stations on the Western Railway at 5.15 pm. Both up and down slow lines were disrupted till 5.40 pm. Weather officials have forecast a wet week ahead for the city and adjoining areas such as Thane and Palghar. A yellow alert is in place for Tuesday indicating heavy rains at isolated places in Mumbai and Thane, while an orange alert has been issued for July 14-15 indicating heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places, including Mumbai and Thane. A red alert has been issued for neighbouring Raigad district with likelihood of extremely heavy rain at isolated places. The IMD said monsoon was active to vigorous over most parts of Maharashtra on Sunday. Most parts of Konkan —Goa, Madhya Maharashtra and Marathwada—received widespread rainfall. Experts said despite the heavy rain warning for Sunday-Monday, the city missed out on the intense showers. “The heavy rains were just 30-40 km off Mumbai coast and in the sea. However, the monsoon surge has been activated and heavy rains will be witnessed in the week,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet Weather Services Pvt Ltd. In the 12 hours ending 8.30pm Monday, the IMD Colaba observatory recorded 48.6 mm of rain and Santacruz observatory recorded 43.2 mm of rain. “Southwesterly monsoon is expected to strengthen and rainfall distribution and activity is expected to increase over the region. Maharashtra is likely to experience an active rainfall spell during the week,” said the IMD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-yellow-alert-today-brace-for-a-wet-week-as-monsoon-picks-up-pace/articleshow/84360780.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Prachi cinema set for a new look, retail outlet to replace food court||KOLKATA: The iconic Prachi cinema has gone for a makeover with the food court on the ground floor turning into a retail outlet. Before the Sealdah cinema reopens, the outer façade will get a facelift. A reduction in the number of seats is also on the cards. There have been rumours about Prachi going the Metro or Mitra way for survival. However, Prachi’s owner Vidisha Basu told TOI that she is neither “selling” nor “renting” it out. “Prachi will reopen in a new avatar under the same ownership. I have taken a franchise of M Bazaar. Its retail outlet will be on the ground floor where my food court used to be. Our cinema, which was inaugurated by my grandfather Jitendra Basu in 1948, will get a new look with a modern touch while retaining its heritage value,” she said. However, Prachi will reopen only after the government gives permission and there is a steady flow of content. During its heyday, this cinema has hosted multiple important screenings and premieres of Bengali films with the likes of Bidhan Chandra Roy, Satyajit Ray, Soumitra Chatterjee, Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen in attendance. On Uttam Kumar’s personal request to its owner, the first Hindi film screened there was ‘Chhoti Si Mulaqat’ in 1967. Talks about renovating the cinema had begun in December 2020. A week before that, her husband, Sanjay Mitra, passed away. “Every Puja, we would go to my sister’s place in Gurgaon and then drive to Badrinath. Sanjay had a massive cardiac arrest the morning after our darshan in 2019 and was shifted to a Gurgaon hospital,” Basu said. He gradually recovered after being in a comatose state for two-and-a-half months. “Single screens don’t give revenue. My sister and I have decided to renovate and run a remodelled Prachi as a tribute to our ancestors’ memories. Besides, we have a responsibility towards the staff,” she recollected. The idea was to find a sustainable revenue model without only depending on its nostalgic value. However, destiny had other plans. “One afternoon, everything went still. Sanjay had another cardiac arrest,” she said. That was a week before Prachi’s renovation was supposed to begin. The renovation plans had to be kept on hold. If the bereavement was tough to handle, so were the challenges of bringing up a seven-year-old daughter single-handedly and functioning as a middle-aged woman in the patriarchal world of cinema. “Tagore’s song ‘Bipade more rokkha karo’ and Rani Rashmoni’s life gave me strength to fight it out and save Prachi. I live with Sanjay’s memories and immerse myself in work. The renovation work started in February end this year,” she said. Basu now regularly shuttles between Gurgaon and Kolkata to look after the theatre and her family. “When a theatre is shut for so long, so many things need repair. During Amphan, the building sustained multiple internal and external damages that needed thorough repair. The building is still under renovation. Once we replace all the seats, we will be able to understand the exact occupancy,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/prachi-set-for-a-new-look-retail-outlet-to-replace-food-court/articleshow/84358527.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The AIFF has made it clear that only those states which conduct a league will be allowed to nominate a team. At least two states made direct recommendations, but were turned down. “The League Committee decision is very clear,” said one official. “If the state association has not conducted a league, there’s no way we can accommodate the teams.” The I-League qualifiers will be played from the last week of September at the Bengaluru Football Stadium in Bengaluru. Even though states are allowed to nominate two teams, the AIFF said each state association will be represented by just one team in the I-League qualifiers. “From among the nominated teams, one will be selected based on sporting merit (league champions) and club licensing criteria. If the league champions don’t meet the criteria, we will move to the next eligible one. All participating clubs have to meet the (club licensing) criteria,” said the official. States who have been unable to hold leagues due to Covid-19 pandemic are now rushing to organise short tournaments that will determine who gets the nod for the I-League qualifiers. Kashmir has already kickstarted its league with eight teams playing a total of 28 matches, while Delhi is expected to host a qualifying tournament. Bengal, Delhi, Kashmir, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat and Meghalaya are among the states who are expected to nominate their teams. The AIFF has given state associations time till July 31 to complete the nomination process. According to sources, the 10 participating teams will be divided into two groups with the top two qualifying for the semifinals. The winner will book their place in this season’s I-League to be played in Bengal later this year. BDFA Super Division League winners, FC Bengaluru United, will play at home and hope to book an elusive spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/one-state-one-team-for-i-league-qualifiers/articleshow/84389811.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The FIRs were registered at police station Dayalpur in connection with two cases of gunshot injuries sustained by two men during the widespread riots in February last year. Hussain has been booked for offences under IPC, including attempt to murder and rioting, and Arms Act. His first plea came up before Justice Yogesh Khanna, who issued notice and sought status report from police.  The second plea was listed before Justice Subramonium Prasad, who tagged it along with the bail plea heard by Justice Khanna. In the plea before Justice Khanna, he sought bail on the ground that he had been in jail for long. “I seek a date as short as possible. I've been in custody for 14-15 months,” said senior advocate Mohit Mathur, appearing for Hussain. On May 15, a trial court had dismissed the bail applications moved by Hussain in the two cases. The cases were registered on separate complaints filed by Ajay Kumar Jha and Prince Bansal, who claimed that they sustained injuries after a riotous mob, which was pelting stones, throwing petrol bombs and firing gunshots from the terrace of Hussain's house, fired upon them on February 25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-to-hear-tahirs-bail-plea-on-aug-6/articleshow/84391996.cms||---

While his family members alleged that the man was taken to Ambedkar Nagar police station where he was beaten to death, cops claimed that the man committed suicide after leaving the police station. The man, Yogesh Gupta, ran a shop and was a resident of Madangir. A complaint was received at Ambedkar Nagar police station from one Neeraj Pahadia alleging that Gupta was running a committee in which he had invested Rs 12.2 lakh. Gupta closed the committee without informing the members and did not return his invested amount. During police inquiry, both Gupta and Pahadia agreed to settle the matter amicably. “On Sunday, Pahadia and Gupta were called to the police station. After inquiry, Gupta left the police station around 8pm. Around 10.30pm, Gupta’s son visited the police station saying that his father had not reached home. Subsequently, a missing complaint was registered,” said DCP (South) Atul Thakur. Gupta’s photographs were circulated to trace him. “Later, GRP Faridabad informed us that Gupta had committed suicide by jumping in front of a moving train at Old Faridabad railway station. His family was informed and a probe was started into the matter,” added the DCP. The family members of the deceased, however, alleged that he was picked up from his shop by cops and taken to the police station where he was beaten to death. They claimed that when they tried to meet him, policemen didn’t allow them access. Alleging police brutality, the family members also staged a protest outside the police station on Monday. Gupta is survived by his wife, son and a daughter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/body-found-on-rly-track-kin-allege-police-brutality/articleshow/84358571.cms||---

The Congress government lost the Rs 2,500 crore coal washing charges to the thermal plants, it alleged. SAD spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema said it was a known fact that immediately after the power purchase agreements (PPAs) were signed with the private thermal plants by the erstwhile SAD-led government, the Congress had swung into action claiming they were wrong and even threatened to annul them. “At the same time, the Congress took funds from the same private companies whom its Punjab leaders, including Sunil Jakhar and Capt Amarinder Singh, were accusing of indulging in malpractices,” he alleged. The Akali leader accused Rs 8.25 crore was taken from one foim, Rs 8 crore from second and Rs 10 lakh from third, The SAD leader said Punjab Congress chief Jakhar and chief minister Amarinder should tell Punjabis that if the PPAs were wrong and were slated to be scrapped by the Congress when it assumed power in the state, why did it take an “advance” of Rs 16 crore from the companies? He said CBI should be entrusted with the case and it should probe whether the private companies were blackmailed into coughing up the crores of rupees. Asking the Congress government to come out with a white paper on the entire issue, Cheema said the government also had the responsibility of explaining why it frittered away Rs 2,500 crore to the private companies on account of coal washing charges by deliberately supplying wrong information in the Supreme Court. He said the apex court had pointed out that the Punjab government had submitted that there was no way to measure the calorific value of coal at the site when this was being done earlier. “This lie cost Punjab Rs 2,500 crore and the state is continuing to lose thousands of crores on this account every month,” he claimed. The Akali functionary claimed that erstwhile SAD-led government had rejected the claim of private thermal plant managements demanding compensation for coal washing and had won the case in this regard in the state regulatory authority and even the national electricity tribunal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-took-rs-16cr-from-power-firms/articleshow/84360810.cms||---

In a recent case, tip-off from alert citizens helped expose a hazardous practice, in which harmful acid from a steel and power unit was being discharged in a nearby water body. The case is of Shilpa Steel and Power Limited, against which the regional office of Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has issued closure directives. Known to be a “habitual offender”, the unit has been charged of violating serious pollution control norms by releasing hazardous spent acid, which is a waste product, into a nearby nullah. The industry is located at MIDC Butibori. According to MPCB officials, Butibori police officials received a tip-off against this illegal practice. “The cops were keeping an eye on the area. On the night of June 26, they caught two tankers, having capacity of 30 kilolitres each, while trying to dump the waste in the water body. They were about to release the acid when the police officials nabbed them. A first information report (FIR) was also filed,” said MPCB’s sub-regional officer Hema Deshpande. On receiving information from police, MPCB officials carried out spot inspection. “The pH of the effluent in the tanker was found to be highly acidic. This acid, which is generated from the pickling unit, was found accumulated in the nearby nullah,” said the board’s sub-regional officer Anand Katole. As per the board, it had earlier too warned the unit for violating norms. In December 2016 also, the board had disconnected electricity and water supply to the unit as it was found practising the same illegal technique. This is the second time that the board has taken stern action against the unit. “Also, the quantity of hazardous waste generated from the effluent treatment plant has found to be more than the consented quantity. The tankers used for transportation of the waste did not have the mandatory authorization under Hazardous Waste and Other Waste Rules, 2016,” the MPCB’s closure notice stated. As per officials, the industry cannot re-start its operations till it complies with the regulations. “If they apply for re-opening, a hearing will take place. Only if we are assured that all the compliances are meeting, we will think on the lines of letting the unit re-start,” they added. The board took the action under relevant provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/midc-unit-shut-for-violating-pollution-norms/articleshow/84358648.cms||Manka Behl
---||Delhi||Third accused held in Delhi's Vasant Vihar murder||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has arrested the third alleged accused in connection with the murder of Kitty Mangalam, wife of former cabinet minister P Rangrajan Kumaramangalam. While two men had already been arrested, the third suspect had been absconding. About one kg of jewellery and some cash have been recovered from the man. The third accused in the murder has been identified as Suraj (36) who belongs to Tikamgarh in Madhya Pradesh and lived in Delhi’s Mahipalpur. A mobile phone, cash Rs 9,020 and 920 grams jewellery have been recovered from him, police said. According to the police, on July 6, a call was received reporting that Kitty Kumar Mangalam and her housemaid had been attacked by some burglars at their Vasant Vihar house. A police team that reached the spot, found that Mithila (33) was in a semi-conscious state while Manglam (70) was lying unconscious in another room. The house was ransacked. Both the women were immediately sent to Safdarjung Hospital where Manglam was declared dead while Mithila survived. “The woman told us that around 8.30 pm, one Raju, who was working as a washerman in the locality along with his two friends, forcefully entered the flat and fled with jewellery and other valuables after beating them both.” “During investigation, we had successfully arrested two of the accused persons, Raju and Rakesh, while the third accused remained at large,” said deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Ingit Pratap Singh. “On July 10, we succeeded in identifying the location of Chhotu Adiwasi, a resident of Tikamgarh in Madhya Pradesh. He is the brother-in-law of Suraj. A team then raided the identified location with the help of the local police and Suraj was found hiding there along with his wife and children. On seeing the police team, Suraj tried to flee the spot but was overpowered. Robbed jewellery containing 520 grams of gold with diamonds and about 400 grams of silver with gems, a mobile phone and cash Rs 9,020 were recovered from his possession,” the DCP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/third-accused-held-in-vasant-vihar-murder/articleshow/84358588.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Plasma treatment at ICH saves boy with liver failure||KOLKATA: Doctors at the Institute of Child Health (ICH) Kolkata conducted a rare procedure on a 15-year-old with acute liver failure, saving the boy from undergoing a liver transplant surgery. Termed as high volume plasma exchange with sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED), the rarely used procedure can be a promising alternative treatment for patients with acute liver failure, said doctors at ICH. Abhas Mitra of Chowbagha Road was brought to ICH on June 18 and he was detected with acute liver failure that had in turn caused a kidney injury. Even as doctors started the treatment, the boy went into hepatic coma due to high ammonia in his blood induced by the liver failure. “The patient fulfilled the liver transplant criteria. But liver transplant in a child and that, too, in a case of acute liver failure can’t be easily done in our state. Also, the parents could not afford the costly transplant procedure, so we tried this rarely used method to save the boy,” said ICH associate professor Prabhas Prasun Giri. The boy was put on ventilation and fresh plasma units were given to him in three cycles on three consecutive days to remove the ammonia that had shot up to around 500 and salvage the brain from the toxic side effects. “The patient had acute kidney injury and had dangerously high creatinine level and he was very sick to tolerate normal dialysis. The SLED procedure is meant for children where we use a specialised machine,” said paediatric nephrologist Rajiv Sinha. Giri said that the liver in the children suffering from acute liver failure due to hepatitis A infection has some potentiality for spontaneous regeneration. But in most cases patients die before that recovery due to bleeding and high ammonia, if no transplant could be done. “A few medical papers also support that high volume of plasma exchange has some liver regeneration properties. We tried this and it had been successful,” said Giri, a paediatric intensivist. The patient’s condition started to improve slowly after the procure and he was discharged from the hospital two days ago. “My son had been in coma for 14 days. Doctors initially suggested a liver transplant that we could not have afforded. Now he is doing well at home,” said the boy’s father Apurba, a musician with a band in a city pub, who has not found any work during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/plasma-treatment-at-ich-saves-boy-with-liver-failure/articleshow/84358595.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Aurangabad||Schools can reopen only after colleges, says Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope||AURANGABAD: State health minister Rajesh Tope on Monday said the reopening of schools could be considered only after colleges begin classes. He said minors cannot be inoculated with the Covid vaccines presently available. “Once colleges restart, only then should schools be considered for reopening,” Tope said in Jalna while launching the statewide drive for inoculating infants with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV). Tope said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will take an appropriate decision regarding reopening of schools. “We are currently vaccinating people in the 18-44 age group and so there seems no harm in starting colleges wherever vaccinations are under way. But we cannot inoculate minors, or say that we are not inoculating them. Minors are more vulnerable to getting infected. Hence, colleges should first be started and later schools can be reopened step by step,” he said. Speaking about PCV, he said that as per an estimate, 15.9% children up to five years of age succumb to pneumonia. “The vaccination is being carried out as per the latest directives of the World Health Organisation for inoculating children aged below one,” he said. Tope said PCV is effective in preventing pneumonia as well as encephalitis, which are among the major concerns in infants and minors. The second PCV dose should be taken three-and-a-half months after the first while the third dose is to be taken after a gap of 9-12 months. A dose of PCV costs around Rs 7,500 in the open market but is given for free to children at all rural and primary health centres and other government facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/tope-schools-can-reopen-only-after-colleges/articleshow/84354040.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Delhi||Delhi HC extends government’s welfare scheme to lawyers from NCR||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Monday expanded the scope of Chief Minister’s Advocates Welfare Scheme to all lawyers registered with Bar Council of Delhi (BCD), irrespective of whether they are registered as a voter in the city. Calling the exclusion of lawyers registered with BCD but residing outside the capital as “discriminatory and arbitrary,” Justice Prathiba M Singh said that the scheme was announced to recognise the contribution of advocates in bettering the lives of the citizens of Delhi and not for advocates who constitute the electorate. The high court ordered that a new scheme be brought into effect by the Delhi government after consultation with BCD and insurance companies. It pointed out that on account of various reasons, including economic and financial, a substantial number of lawyers practising in Delhi reside in the neighbouring areas of Noida, Gurgaon, Sonepat, Rohtak, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, etc, but “were intricately and intrinsically linked with the dispensation of justice” in the national capital. “They commute from these areas to Delhi almost on a daily basis. Such advocates are registered with BCD and are also members of the bar associations of the court complexes where they practise. They play an important role in serving the citizenry in Delhi and assisting courts in Delhi for the adjudication of disputes. They also contribute to the revenue stream of the Delhi government by practising in Delhi. They may also have chambers/offices in various court complexes in Delhi,” the court noted. It said a pre-condition that the names of the advocates should appear in the voters’ list of Delhi has no link or connection with the scheme’s objective of welfare. “The scheme centres around the professional contribution of advocates, not their role as citizens of Delhi who participate in the election process,” the high court said. It was dealing with a batch of petitions seeking a direction to extend the benefit of the scheme to all those enrolled with BCD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-extends-govts-welfare-scheme-to-lawyers-from-ncr/articleshow/84358619.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Amid doses shortage, Nagpur Municipal Corporation plans special drive for lactating mothers, pregnant women||NAGPUR: Once again, Covishield shots won’t be available at any government vaccination centre in the city and several rural centres on Tuesday. Nearly all the over 65,000 free Covishield doses were utilized in the district on Sunday and Monday. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) vaccination centres won’t be able to offer Covishield to any age group at least till Thursday. Yet, the civic body has decided to reach out to lactating mothers and pregnant women from Thursday itself. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said, “As the norms allow vaccination of such women, the civic body won’t delay it any further and start reserving certain amount of doses for them. We would be vaccinating them on priority,” he said. Joshi added that survey is being started to estimate the number of such beneficiaries. “Special camps in areas having high number of lactating mothers or pregnant women can be held. Our teams would spread out in each zone to look for such beneficiaries. Priority can also be given to them at existing centres,” he said. On possibility of such drive amid persistent shortage, Joshi said, “The civic body had reserved doses for foreign-bound students as they needed vaccination on priority. This time too, we shall ensure the group is covered fast,” he said. The group would also have the advantage of both online and offline registration. The women can schedule an appointment or walk in to the nearest vaccination centre to register. Meanwhile, Covaxin would be available for 18+ and 45+ age groups at GMCH, Siddarth Nagar centre, Ambedkar hospital at Indora, and Mahal Diagnostic Centre on Tuesday. Both doses would be given, the NMC informed. On Monday, the vaccination numbers in city dropped to over 22,000 after a record of over 37,000 doses a day before. Many centres witnessed huge rush, as per officials. Most of the slots were taken as soon as they were made available on the Co-Win system, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/amid-doses-shortage-nmc-plans-spl-drive-for-lactating-moms-pregnant-women/articleshow/84356299.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Kochi||‘Politicians, bureaucrats are like frog in the well’||Kochi: In the event of escalation of the aggressive stand against Kitex Garments, the firm will consider closing its existing manufacturing facilities in Kerala, said Kitex Group CMD Sabu M Jacob on Monday. “Even if I close down this facility (at Kizhakkambalam, near Kochi) and move it to Telangana or Tamil Nadu, I can generate double the profits. There, the manufacturing costs will be less, which will result in higher profits for me. If I close down today and move [outside Kerala], I will be able to create ten times the profit within a 10-year period. The only reason I had been continuing here was due to the commitment I have to the local community. But, If I’m mistreated and kicked out again, I will not tolerate that and I will surely close down the facility,” he said. Regarding the business-friendly aspect, the politicians and bureaucrats in Kerala are like the ‘frog in the well’ he said. “They don’t know what kind of incentives other state governments and countries are offering to investors. Twelve days have passed since we took the decision to leave Kerala, yet not even a minister, collector or even a peon has not called me to discuss the issue,” Jacob said, adding that politicians forced him to enter politics. In Telangana, Kitex will initially be setting up a similar manufacturing facility that will have factories for spinning, bleaching, dyeing and knitting at two separate industrial parks. Telangana government has allotted 180 acres at Kakatiya Mega Textile Park, Warangal and 200 acres at Chandanvelly Industrial Park, Hyderabad. “The government has offered additional land if need arises,” Jacob said. Apart from its production facilities within industrial parks, Kitex will be setting up small decentralized production units called ‘mother’s unit’, employing jobless mothers in villages. “This is a project which the Telangana government is interested in as it could create a huge number of jobs,” he said adding that, he got offers from nine states and foreign countries like the UAE and Bangladesh for setting up facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/politicians-bureaucrats-are-like-frog-in-the-well/articleshow/84356307.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||No charges filed, 3 Chinese nationals in loan app case get bail||Hyderabad: A countrywide probe into the illegal instant loan app case involving Chinese nationals suffered a blow when three of the four alleged Chinese kingpins secured conditional bail, after two police commissionerates failed to file chargesheets within the stipulated three months. Hyderabad police in May filed two separate chargesheets against Chinese national Zhu Wei alias Lambo. As a result, it helped police in keeping Lambo behind bars ever since his arrest along with his company’s manager Nagaraju in December 2020. Lambo had used Nagaraju’s bank account to upload 30 financing applications on the play store. “We knew that it’s such a high-profile case that we have to file charges on time and thankfully we did,” Anjani Kumar, Hyderabad commissioner of police told TOI. Unlike Hyderabad police, the cybercrime police in Rachakonda and Cyberabad failed to file chargesheet on time against three Chinese nationals as they waited for some crucial forensic evidence. So far, various law-enforcing agencies in Telangana have arrested 50 persons from call centres in various parts of the country, after six victims, including an agriculture officer and a software engineer, committed suicide. Scores of people said they were harassed and their pictures shared on social media by the companies to shame them for defaulting on loans. On Monday, Rachakonda police said they are yet to file a chargesheet against Chinese woman Liang Tian and He Jian alias Mark. Both are out on conditional bail. Similarly, Dennis from Delhi, also obtained bail after Cyberabad officials failed to file the chargesheet on time. However, Dennis has been periodically appearing before police, as directed by the court in their conditional bail given to him. “We are in the process of finalising the chargesheet. Hopefully, it will be filed in the next couple of weeks,” a top cybercrime official in Rachakonda police told TOI. Both Cyberabad and Rachakonda police had been waiting for forensic reports, besides handling cases filed by the accused in the Telangana high court, challenging the police action. As a result, there has been a delay in filing chargesheet, which helped the three Chinese nationals in obtaining bail. Officials of Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda have made several Chinese nationals, residing either in China or other countries, as accused in instant loan app harassment cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-charges-filed-3-chinese-nationals-in-loan-app-case-get-bail/articleshow/84362656.cms||Srinath Vudali
---||Delhi||Delhi: Blood transfusion from one langur saves life of another||NEW DELHI: A grey langur came to the aid of another langur after blood was transfused from one animal to another on Sunday. Blood transfusion among animals is a common practice. Veterinarians said animals have blood groups, but every species has different systems. The blood group for humans is based on three different antigens, but the antigens vary species-wise among animals. According to a forest official, two adult langurs were rescued near Okhla a month back. Of these, the female langur was found injured and vets suggested surgery for a fractured leg. However, when the injured animal underwent a routine blood test, it was learnt that she had a blood count deficiency. “We took blood samples of both the donor and the recipient and sent them to a veterinary laboratory to match the samples. After their blood samples were found compatible, it was decided to conduct blood transfusion. Both animals were given anesthesia during the procedure and 150 ml blood was transfused in the body of the injured langur.” said Dr Mohit Swami, veterinarian, forest department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/blood-transfusion-from-one-langur-saves-life-of-another/articleshow/84358634.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Vadodara policemen under scanner for violent behaviour||VADODARA: Touted as the cultural capital of Gujarat, the city has witnessed some boorish behaviour of the cops over the last few days. Some policemen have come under the scanner for ill-treating and assaulting citizens over minor issues. City police commissioner Shamsher Singh has acted sternly and either transferred or suspended the erring policemen. But the violent streak of the cops doesn’t seem to end. On the night of July 10, a shop owner in Manjalpur area was brutally assaulted by two police constables posted in Manjalpur police station. The shop owner pleaded with folded hands but the cops kept thrashing him till his face got swollen. Both the cops were suspended on Monday morning. Five days ago, a vegetable vendor was also thrashed by a head constable of a police control room (PCR) van in Sama area. Ganesh Sonkar alleged that the cop identified as Suresh Rathwa demanded 20kg of onion for free. When Sonkar asked for money, Suresh allegedly assaulted him. Instead of acting against the cop, the Sama police had acted against Sonkar for not wearing a face mask in a public place. Senior police official, though, transferred the head constable and ordered an inquiry against him. Some days ago a 45-year-old man was reportedly assaulted by a police constable in Chhani. Govind Rathwa had to undergo treatment in a private hospital but he refused to file a complaint against the constable. “Actions have been taken in such cases whenever we get complaints. I keep telling the policemen that they should take legal steps as per the situation but never misbehave or use violence on public. In our large police force, very few cops misbehave with people,” city police commissioner Shamsher Singh told TOI. Last month, D S Patel, a police sub-inspector posted in Navapura police station that time had beaten up an 18-year-old boy who had not worn a face mask. The incident occurred when Ritham Patel was driving his car without wearing a face mask near Polo Ground. The cops intercepted him and D S Patel was accused of beating up the boy along with some other cops. An inquiry was ordered against Patel who was later transferred to the police control room. Patel had also allegedly assaulted ex-Member of Parliament Satyajit Gaekwad over a minor issue near Polo Ground last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vadodara-policemen-under-scanner-for-violent-behaviour/articleshow/84356340.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Trees in polluted areas affected as their starch levels dip, says study||Ahmedabad: Unlike humans, plants do not ‘eat’ food from external sources to meet their energy needs. Instead, they fix energy from sunlight through photosynthesis, and store it, in the form of starch. The production of this fuel for trees is being hampered by Ahmedabad’s air pollution, found a Gujarat University (GU) study. The study, which has been under way since 2011, was recently re-published. Five species of trees — peepal (Ficus religiosa), banyan (Ficus benghalensis), goolar (Ficus glomerata), neem (Azadirachta indica) and ashoka (Polyalthia longifolia) — at eight locations in the city were monitored for starch content. Naroda was the most polluted location and a residential area in Paldi was the research control. The locations where trees of these species were monitored were Lal Darwaza, Naroda, Kalupur railway station, Ahmedabad power station and the Geeta Mandir bus terminus. The researchers, D K Chandawat, P U Verma and H A Solanki of the botany department of Gujarat University, found that the peepal tree in the industrially polluted Naroda area showed 28.11% less starch production compared to a peepal tree in Paldi. Similarly, there was a 17% reduction in starch in banyan trees, 21% in goolar, 29% in neem, and 19% in ashoka. The researchers reasoned that the reduction in starch content in polluted areas was mainly attributed to increased respiration and decreased carbon dioxide fixation because of chlorophyll deterioration. “Pollutants like sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and hydrogen sulphide under hardening conditions can cause more depletion of soluble sugars in leaves of plants in a polluted area,” the study said. It added, “The reaction of sulfites with aldehydes and ketones of carbohydrates can also cause a reduction in carbohydrate content.” “Leaf samples from the selected polluted area were collected during all seasons and analyzed for starch content. The level of pollutants was comparatively less at most of the selected sites,” states the research paper. The research also found that “plants growing in a polluted environment often responded and showed significant changes in their morphology, physiology, and biochemistry”. The researchers also found that a higher amount of starch was found in the summer season mainly because of the temperature. The study added, “Since at higher temperature respiration increases, starch is converted to glucose. Therefore as an adaptation it may be that more starch is synthesized during summers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/trees-in-polluted-areas-affected-as-their-starch-levels-dip-study/articleshow/84360850.cms||---

The Zilla Parishad officials claimed that around 700 villages in Solapur rural have not reported a single Covid case in last one month. The state government had approved the proposal of the ZP to open the schools after the local gram panchayats gave the green signal. Dilip Swami, chief executive officer of Solapur ZP, personally visited some of the schools and even taught at one school for some time. “The online classes were posing a challenge. Offline classes are very important for learning and, therefore, we decided to allow schools to open in the Covid-free villages. The teachers are vaccinated and students follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. In next three to four days, schools from all Covid-free villages will be opened,” he said. The officials said most parents gave their consent to allow the students to attend the classes offline. Several parents want the schools to reopen sue to issues of poor or no connectivity, no regular data recharge. The schools have been asked to take classes in batches. Swami said the teachers have been asked to focus on crucial subjects which require intensive coaching for understanding the concepts. Earlier, Swami had launched ‘Jhadakhalchi Shala’ meaning schools under trees in the villages where there were no active cases. However, the initiative had some limitations during monsoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/solapur-dist-first-in-state-to-open-schools-in-335-villages/articleshow/84354081.cms||---

Warring has accused Manpreet of promoting Shiromani Akali Dal leaders by giving them grant money. Earlier, he had accused Manpreet of giving money to his relative’s family on the demise of maternal uncle for a pipeline to village pond. Warring had alleged that the family had remained in Akali Dal. He had also demanded action, when SAD leader Sarup Chand Singla accused Manpreet and his relative of patronising sand mafia in Bathinda. Warring on Monday took to the social media by putting up posts on Facebook and Twitter with photograph of Manpreet handing over a cheque of Rs 15 lakh to Charanjit Singh, zone president of Akali Dal from Gidderbaha. He also attached photos of that leader with SAD patriarch Parkash Singh Badal, party president Sukhbir Badal and former minister Bikram Singh Majithia. The MLA wrote, “I am saddened that finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, who came to Congress from Shiromani Akali Dal, is promoting Akali leaders. Party has given you everything and you are stabbing in the back of the party. Remember supporting Akali Dal by staying in Congress will destroy your political life and Punjabis will not forget it. Your work as finance minister in last 4 years has forced every section of Punjab to protest against Congress government. Yesterday thousands of employees opposed you in your constituency. Congress leaders and workers are now understanding your 75-25 game.” He said, “I have urged Rahul Gandhi to take disciplinary action for this anti-party activity and ignoring Congressman and directly handing over cheques to sarpanches in my area by not involving me for being the MLA.

Christened as the Authors and Poets Guild, this will be a platform where authors can approach if their copyrights are violated or if publishers are not giving them their royalties at the promised rate. The guild was launched by state transport and housing minister Firhad Hakim and filmmaker Goutam Ghose. “Unless authors feel protected, creativity will not progress. It is sad that talented authors are sometimes so driven by poverty that they have to undersell their manuscripts. This is where the guild needs to step in and offer protection in the form of a patent,” Hakim said. Film director Goutam Ghose said, “We see how authors, filmmakers and other people in the creative field are being dumbed down. The guild needs to ensure that such authors are protected.” Among the authors, who are part of the guild, are Tapan Bandypadhyay, Swapnamoy Chakraborty, Tridib Chatterjee, Binayak Bandyopadhyay, Saikat Mukhopadhyay, Dipanwita Roy and Debarati Mukhopadhyay. The authors demanded that the Publishers and Booksellers Guild, that organises the International Kolkata Book Fair, should work closely with the new association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/authors-and-poets-get-a-guild-for-protection-of-rights/articleshow/84358675.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Aurangabad||ED short of work, hence the Maharashtra focus: Dilip Walse Patil||AURANGABAD: Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse Patil on Monday raised questions took a dig at the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for paying “too much” attention to Maharashtra and said, “It seems, the ED does not have enough work. That is why it is paying too much attention to Maharashtra. The misuse of ED is unprecedented and no other government had done it to this extent ever before.”  He pointed out that the responsibilities of the central and state governments are different and, “We believe and expect both the governments to do their respective jobs responsibly.” The home minister’s statement has come against the backdrop of the ED issuing notices or summons to several leaders and former ministers from the MVA government. This was Walse Patil’s maiden visit to Aurangabad city since taking charge of the home ministry. Along with director general of police Sanjay Pande, the minister held a crime review meeting with Aurangabad police commissioner Nikhil Gupta, Aurangabad range’s special IGP Prasanna Mallikarjun and four SPs heading Aurangabad rural, Jalna, Beed and Osmanabad districts. During the press conference, when asked about his priority as home minister, Walse Patil said: “Policemen across the hierarchy should behave and interact with every commoner with due respect. We have asked even the seniormost police officers to remain available to the public round the clock. We have asked them to ensure that no guilty is spared and no innocent faces the heat.” He added that steps are being taken to carry out transfers and postings without political interventions or favours. He expressed concerns over the misuse of social media to defame people, especially women, and also to commit economic offences. “Social media is being misused by some to spread communal disharmony, to further differences between castes and communities. We are going to get tough on such people,” he said. Walse Patil added that he had found that the cyber police stations were not working effectively. “I have asked the senior officers to prepare a three-month target-oriented programme for the cyber police. After three months, I will personally review the progress.” Speaking about steps being taken to address the issues of vacancies and poor infrastructure plaguing the police department, he said the state will fill 5,200 posts of police constables before December. The remaining 7,000 vacancies will be filled up after that. “Police constables, after serving for over three decades, retire as assistant sub-inspectors. We are now considering giving them an additional promotion so that they retire as sub-inspectors,” he said. Speaking about the pending files on housing loans, the minister said a high-level meeting was held two days ago to address the issue and it will be resolved soon. Instructions have been issued to recruit immediate relatives of the policemen, who lost their lives due to Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/ed-short-of-work-hence-the-maha-focus-walse-patil/articleshow/84362680.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The incident had occurred on July 10 late night when J D Bhaliya was in his shop near Vadsar bridge. Two police constables Harish Chauhan and Thakore bhai approached Bhaliya as he had kept the shop open during curfew hours that start at 10 pm. The duo posted at Manjalpur police station started slapping Bhaliya who was taken aback and started apologizing. But the cops didn’t relent and kept thrashing him. The CCTV camera’s installed at Bhaliya’s shop captured the assault wherein one of the cops is even seen throwing the victim on the floor. Despite apologizing with folded hands, the two policemen, who were in civil dress, kept slapping him. Bhaliya downed the shop’s shutter but they again opened it and assaulted him. The brutal assault left Bhaliya’s face swollen. After the videos of the assault went viral on Sunday, city police commissioner Shamsher Singh ordered an inquiry into the incident. The police said that such behaviour won’t be tolerated. Early on Monday morning, both the cops were suspended and an inquiry was ordered against them. The incident has once again highlighted the high-handedness of some cops who resort to violence for implementing law and order in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/two-cops-suspended-for-thrashing-shop-owner/articleshow/84356393.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Won’t construct EKW flyover till nod from MoEF, wetland authority: Bengal government||KOLKATA: The state on Monday assured the Calcutta High Court that no construction would start on the flyover from EM Bypass to New Town main arterial road till the central government gave its nod. The issue came up during the hearing of a PIL that environmental action group People United for Better Living in Calcutta (PUBLIC) had filed against the proposed flyover through the wetlands. Though the alignment of the flyover was thereafter changed, PUBLIC senior counsel Siddharth Mitra pointed out that the state’s representation that the project had been granted approval by the central government was not accurate, since a realigned route and an environmental impact assessment had been sought by a team that had visited the site in 2019. “These conditions had yet to be met, so there was no question of approval having been granted,” Mitra argued. State government’s senior counsel Amitesh Banerjee agreed and reiterated that the state stood by its earlier assurance that no construction would start until the central government approval had been obtained. On the World Environment Day on June 5, the state had unveiled a plan to “save the wetlands”. The plan, according to additional chief secretary environment, Vivek Kumar, envisaged an expenditure of Rs 120 crore over the next five years on restoring and improving the environmental services provided by the “lungs and kidneys” of Kolkata. PUBLIC’s Bonani Kakkar said that formulating a management plan for the East Kolkata Wetlands is an encouraging step, but it did not make sense to build a flyover to reduce driving time to the airport by 10 minutes at a huge environmental and financial cost. Amit Roy, management consultant on development projects in India and internationally, said the experience worldwide has been that building more flyovers does not solve traffic problems; at best it transfers or postpones the problem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/wont-construct-ekw-flyover-till-nod-from-moef-wetland-authority-govt/articleshow/84358701.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Chandigarh||High court notice to Punjab over rape charges against Lok Insaaf Party MLA||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has issued notice to the Punjab government on a plea filed by Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) MLA Simarjit Singh Bains seeking directions to stay the orders of the lower court that had ordered registration of a rape case against him. The complainant in this case has also been issued notice, seeking her reply as to why the order of the lower court should not be stayed. The case will come up for hearing on July 15. In his plea, Bains, 51, sought directions to quash the order dated July 7 passed by additional chief justice magistrate Ludhiana directing the SHO of police station division number 6 to register a criminal case for rape against him. Bains claimed that he always opposed wrong policies of the ruling party and the present case was a matter where he had been targeted with an object of ruining his political career. It has been said earlier the complainant had filed a complaint against him on November 16, 2020 to the Ludhiana police commissioner, which was entrusted to Kanwardeep Kaur, JCP, Ludhiana (rural) for probe. In her complaint, no exact date and time of alleged offence was given by the complainant, as she alleged that the offence was committed 10-12 times over a period of time. According to Bains, with regard to her complaint to the police, both the parties were called and their statements were recorded. Some documentary and other evidence came up during inquiry which is being verified and call detail records have been requisitioned and inquiry is going on. Bains submitted to the HC that he is president of Lok Insaaf Party and has been targeted and falsely implicated by making false, frivolous and baseless allegations. None of the offences disclosed have been committed and the story propounded by the complainant is totally absurd, he has contended in the petition. It has also been claimed in the plea by the MLA that the complainant in this case had earlier levelled allegations against one Sukhchain Singh and gave a police complaint on October 5, 2020 for forcing her to have physical relationship with him. However, later she compromised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/high-court-notice-to-punjab-over-rape-charges-against-lip-mla/articleshow/84360881.cms||---

The police and local administration too did not take stringent action against the traders. The administration has put the district in the Level 4 category of Covid restrictions and has not considered Kolhapur city as a separate unit. Last week, the city was considered a separate administrative unit and thereby the non-essential shops were allowed to open in the city. Sanjay Shete, the president of Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries, said, “Efforts are on to convince the government to allow the shops to open. We have been told by the state authorities that the unlocking phase will be carried out from next week. However, we want the non-essential shops to open, even if for a restricted period during the day. If needed, we will visit Mumbai and meet chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and state officials.” The traders in Ichalkaranji, meanwhile, have stopped their agitation. The traders have decided to keep their shops shut hoping the government will consider their proposal too. Ichalkaranji MLA Prakash Awade has spoken to the CM and has requested the traders to wait for two more days. Tighten Covid restrictions in Sangli, says Jayant Patil Sangli district guardian minister Jayant Patil, showing his displeasure over the rising number of Covid cases, on Monday asked the district authorities to tighten the Covid restrictions. He suggested that home delivery of vegetables be started so that the citizens do not step out of their homes. The Sangli district has again been put in Level 4 after two weeks in Level 3. The district has a current positivity rate of 10%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-shops-keep-shutters-half-up-as-traders-wait-for-state-nod-to-reopen/articleshow/84354126.cms||---
---||Delhi||16-year-old battles for life after stalker attacks her with axe in southwest Delhi||NEW DELHI: A 16-year-old girl is battling for life after being attacked with an axe by a youth from her locality just a day before her birthday. The incident was reported from a slum cluster in South Moti Bagh in southwest Delhi on Monday afternoon. The attacker, Praveen alias Pradeep, is also a resident of the JJ cluster and is reportedly in his early 20s. A manhunt has been launched for his arrest, said a senior officer. Police received a call regarding the “murder of a girl” around 3.20pm and rushed a team to the spot. The girl was found bleeding from a deep gash near the eyebrow. She was rushed to Safdarjung Hospital and admitted in the ICU. After initial inquiry, police suspect the attacker may have been stalking her after she turned down his advances, but haven’t confirmed the theory. “The motive will be clear after investigation. A case under relevant sections of law has been registered and a hunt is on for the accused, who was known to the victim,” said the area DCP. Footage of CCTV cameras near the scene of crime are being checked. The call records of the accused and the victim are being analysed to ascertain if the youth had been harassing her. The family members of the accused and the victim have been interviewed. The girl’s family told police that she was a Class XI student and mostly kept to herself. They claimed that the accused had been troubling and threatening her of late. Eyewitnesses told cops that the youth attacked the girl with an axe after a brief argument. This crime is a grim reminder of the Radhika Tanwar incident, who was attacked by her stalker at Dhaula Kuan a few years ago. In another similar incident, a JNU student had attacked a girl with an axe inside a classroom in 2013.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/16-yr-old-battles-for-life-after-stalker-attacks-her-with-axe-in-sw-delhi/articleshow/84358789.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Pharma biggies likely prime bidders for Kokapet land||Hyderabad: Ahead of the much-publicised Kokapet land auction on July 15, market sources indicate that majority of big-ticket bidders are likely to be pharmaceutical and hospital giants — most of them headquartered in Hyderabad. While multiple real estate majors from Bengaluru, Chennai and Mumbai too are expected to be in the fray, they maintain that the pharma sector will emerge as key player. “That’s that most cash-rich industry at the moment,” said a senior property consultant from the city. “The rumblings within real estate sector suggest these firms are planning to buy the land and enter into joint ventures with developers, both for commercial and residential projects. It is learnt that the government too is encouraging them to participate in the bidding, and has been holding one-on-one meetings with some pharma heads.” According to the plan, Thursday’s e-auction will see 65 acres of unutilised land — at Neopolis and Golden Mile in Kokapet and Khanamet — go under the hammer. Government officials say that 80 to 90 individuals/groups are likely to participate in it. They also admit to a keen interest among pharma companies, to acquire land. “At least four leading names from the pharma industry had participated in the pre-bid meeting that was held in June. So, it seems likely that they will invest in Kokapet,” said a senior government official privy to the developments. The bidding price, he indicated, could range between Rs 30 crore and Rs 35 crore per acre. “With the pharma sector’s participation, we can even expect it to hit Rs 40 crore per acre, for some plots. In fact, the government is hoping to make at least Rs 2,000 crore from this auction,” said another senior realtor, in discussion with some prospective bidders. He reiterated: “Though we might see many mainstream developers joining in, it might not be viable for them to buy land at this price. They would, much rather, partner with pharma owners to develop the area.” In 2006, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority auctioned 166 acres under Golden Mile for Rs 14.5 crore per acre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pharma-biggies-likely-prime-bidders-for-kokapet-land/articleshow/84362707.cms||Sudipta Sengupta
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra ATS to look into online sale of weapons, drones: DGP||AURANGABAD: The Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS) has started working on bringing a check on the illegal sale and supply of sharp-edged weapons and drones through e-commerce websites in the state. Expressing concern over the articles being sold under the garb of toys or artefacts, Maharashtra director-general of police Sanjay Pande said things challenging the law of the land or posing a security threat need to be screened. During his maiden visit to Aurangabad on Monday, Pande told TOI: “The loopholes in the Information and Technology Act do not give the exact idea on the imposition of particular sections on the e-commerce websites selling articles not permissible by law. The ATS is working on this and soon, things will have a legal check.” The officer said a letter is being sent to all e-commerce websites to ensure that there is no violation of law, knowingly or unknowingly. The decision to task the matter to ATS was taken after multiple cases of Maharashtra police seizing swords that had been purchased on e-commerce websites. Orders placed online and delivered through courier companies, often owned by the e-commerce websites, keep the entire transaction off the police’s radar. Further probes have revealed that the manufacturers of these sharp-edged weapons are located in different parts of the country, making the investigation an uphill task for the local police. Aurangabad commissioner of police Nikhil Gupta too shared the concerns and said, “The anti social elements are misusing social media to spread hatred amongst communities. This is also related to the large-scale purchase of sharp-edged weapons like swords, daggers, Kukris and Chinese assault knives, and it something we are currently focusing to bring a check on.” The officer said that the recent seizure of over 50 sharp edged weapons from a 20-year old youth as well as the seizures that were made three years back, are equally serious and will face stringent legal action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/maha-ats-to-look-into-online-sale-of-weapons-drones-dgp/articleshow/84362700.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Nashik||Chikungunya cases in rural Nashik double than last year||NASHIK: The rural parts of Nashik district have seen chikungunya cases already double, when compared to the number of cases reported in the whole of last year. The district malaria department has reported 83 chikungunya cases so far. In comparison, there were 43 cases of chikungunya in the rural parts of the district last year. The recent cases have been reported from Kulwandi village of Peth and Nigdol areas of Dindori taluka. Around 20 cases were found in these two villages after which the health workers have started a survey of villagers suffering from joint pain and fever. The health department has appealed to the people in these villages to observe a ‘dry day’ by cleaning containers where water can accumulate. This prevents mosquito-borne diseases and other communicable diseases. District malaria officer Madhukar Ahire said that people have started storing water in vessels due to the break in rains. “If proper care is not taken, water containers could turn into breeding places for aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the vector that causes dengue and chikungunya,” he said. People should also ensure that they empty the flower vases and clean them at least once in a week to curb the mosquito spread inside houses. Apart from this, people should also ensure that there is no water accumulation in tyres or water stagnation in their surrounding. Nonetheless, the health workers attached to the primary health centres of the respective villages have started making house to house visits to check for patients with symptoms. Patients are referred to the primary health centres where their blood samples are taken for further investigation to determine if they are suffering from chikungunya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/chikungunya-cases-in-rural-nashik-double-than-last-yr/articleshow/84354179.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Born while mom on ventilator, 21-day-old girl set to go home||KOLKATA: She lost her mother to Covid just a day after she opened her eyes to this world. Born prematurely after an emergency C-section while her mother was on ventilation, the newborn’s life, too, was under a cloud. Twenty-one days later, however, the baby is fit to go home and reunite with her father, 10-year-old brother and grandparents. It’s thanks to the whole team of doctors at the state-run Medical College and Hospital (MCH), who rallied around the infant, that the 21-day-old fighter has got a fresh lease of life. On June 21, doctors at the hospital had conducted a life-saving C-section on 31-year-old Rakhi Mandal Biswas. Admitted with severe Covid pneumonitis on June 12, the Bongoan resident’s condition kept sinking. Her oxygen requirement kept rising even on support. When the saturation plunged to 60%, her doctors knew that Covid had become a threat to the 32-week-old fetus. Immediately putting Rakhi on ventilation, the doctors conducted an emergency surgery to save the unborn child, as well as attempt to put the 31-year-old on ECMO support. But she could not be saved and passed away hours after the delivery. “If it was not for the emergency C-section, we could have lost the baby as well,” said Partha Mukherjee, the gynaecology head at MCH. Immediately after the premature birth, a paediatric team stood by the bedside at the operating theatre to take care of the baby. “She did not cry after birth, being in severe breathing distress, for which she had to be resuscitated shortly after birth,” said Dinesh Munian, who’s in charge of the special newborn care unit (SNCU). The baby was immediately put on mechanical ventilation and shifted to the SNCU. Even as her Covid-negative result came as a relief to the docs, the team had to constantly monitor her as she struggled to breathe despite being on invasive ventilation. But, with medication and care, her condition gradually started improving and she was shifted to non-invasive ventilation first and then to CPAP. Later still, she was moved to normal oxygen support until she started breathing on her own. “The baby’s 22-day-old journey has come with a lot of twists and turns,” said Dibyendu Raychaudhuri, assistant professor of paediatrics at MCH. “She is now on full oral feeding, has gained weight and is in good health, and can be sent home. It was great teamwork by the neonatal unit and the gynaecology & and obstetrics department,” he added. The baby’s family, too, acknowledged the huge support of the entire team of doctors and nurses. “They took such great care of the baby, almost as if she was their own. It was only this that helped her win the battle against death,” said Mita Mandal, her grand-aunt, who’s also a sister-in-charghe at the hospital’s emergency unit. “We have been reading and hearing about Covid snatching away parents, rendering their children orphans. She is lucky in a sense that she has her father, grandparents and 10-year-old brother who can’t wait to meet her. Our only concern is that the 10-year-old boy is going to ask why his mother has not come back with his sister.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/born-while-mom-on-ventilator-21-day-old-girl-set-to-go-home/articleshow/84361005.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Chandigarh||Power curbs on industries lifted in Punjab: Chief minister Amarinder Singh||CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Monday evening ordered immediate withdrawal of all power regulatory restrictions that were imposed on industries across the state to meet the power crisis. An official said the crisis was triggered by a delayed monsoon and an unprecedented surge in demand from both agricultural and domestic sectors. Reviewing the power situation in the state after the resumption of generation at one of the three non-functional units at Talwandi Sabo Thermal plant, the chief minister directed the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to ease off all power regulatory restrictions on industrial consumers across the state with immediate effect. The chief minister was informed that the plant at Talwandi Sabo had resumed 660 MW production, improving the power situation in the state. Two other units of 660MW each at the plant are yet to be made operational. The decision on the complete withdrawal of the restrictions was taken by the chief minister soon after PSPCL announced a similar but partial withdrawal in districts falling in central and border zones. The PSPCL had allowed all industries, except those using continuous power, to operate at full capacity from today. However, after Amarinder’s intervention, all industries across the state, including those using continuous power round the clock (textile, chemicals, and spinning mills etc), can now operate to full capacity. Owing to unprecedented rise in demand of power, the PSPCL had, as a temporary measure, ordered restrictions on Industrial consumers of the State in order to provide power supply to domestic consumers and 8 hours power supply to the agriculture sector for paddy operations. Continuous process industries were allowed to operate at 50% of their load, added the spokesperson. Punjab has 99,834 small power industrial consumers besides 30,176 medium power consumers upon whom no usage restriction has been levied at all despite rising demand for power across the domestic sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/power-curbs-on-industries-lifted-in-punjab-cm/articleshow/84360948.cms||---

Kasba Walve, a village in Radhanagari taluka, has around 190 active cases. Before the lockdown was imposed in Radhanagari taluka, the gram panchayat of Kasba Walve had already imposed a lockdown due to the number of active cases. Prasenjeet Pradhan, the sub-divisional officer of Radhanagari-Kagal, said, “Rush in the weekly markets, no use of masks and improper home quarantine are few of the reasons for the increase in the number of Covid cases in Kasba Walve. People were seen less aware of the Covid safety measures. We have shifted all the home quarantined patients to institutional quarantine facilities on Sunday and no home quarantine will be allowed further”. All the borders of the Radhanagari village and taluka have been barricaded. Only emergency services and banking will be allowed along with routine farming activities. The number of people coming to Radhanagari town for work from different villages in the taluka is significant “When I visited Rautwadi waterfall in Radhanagari, around hundred people were seen enjoying themselves without wearing masks or following social distancing. On Sunday, 20 more cases were found in Radhanagari village. I have ordered a 14-day strict lockdown in the entire taluka considering the cases in Kasba Walve and Radhanagari. We have asked for the police force to be deployed at tourist spots and also in major hotspot villages in the taluka,” he said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/14-day-lockdown-in-radhanagari-taluka-amid-rise-in-covid-cases/articleshow/84354171.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

---||Mumbai||Covid incentives unequal: Former civic medical interns in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Medical interns from BMC-run colleges who completed their internships this February have alleged unequal distribution of Covid-19 incentives to them. At the peak of the pandemic last year, the BMC announced an incentive of Rs 39,000 a month for Covid duty for all interns, in addition to their stipend of Rs 11,000. While interns from one civic-run medical college and hospital were given the incentive from March 23 last year to January 2021, the ones in three other hospitals did not get it for a month or two or longer. Some of them said they did not even get the daily allowance of Rs 300 for two to three months. On Monday, these doctors, who are now serving their bonds, wrote to all the concerned authorities to seek arrears of their payments. In their letter, the junior doctors have alleged their colleagues from KEM Hospital have received Rs 39,000 per month from the start of the Covid-19 pandemic till January 31 whereas the ones from Nair Hospital did not get it for over two months. The interns from Sion and Cooper hospitals did not get their incentive for January. Some from Nair Hospital, too, did not get their daily allowance of Rs 300 from October to December. “In fact, some of us were not even given the arrears of our basic stipend of Rs 11,000 for two months last year,” said a member of the Association of State Medical Interns (2020-21 batch). One of the doctors said despite working throughout the pandemic, there is an unreasonable and unacceptable delay in paying them. There is also confusion on when the incentives were to be discontinued. While a BMC authority said the incentive was discontinued after December 2020, when Covid cases had dropped significantly, the interns from KEM hospital received it for January too, said an intern from last year’s batch. “Why is there a differential treatment for interns, when all these colleges come under the BMC?” asked a doctor. A senior BMC official said they are looking into the complaints from students and will resolve these at the earliest. Meanwhile, interns from the current year, who started their internship in May, have also asked for Covid incentive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-incentives-unequal-former-civic-med-interns-in-mumbai/articleshow/84355359.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Nashik||Nashik civil hospital to handle dialysis of Covid patients||NASHIK: The district health department has decided to shift the dialysis process of Covid patients with kidney-related ailments to the Nashik civil hospital instead of the government-managed Nashik Regional Referral Hospital in the city. This was done to avoid the spread of Covid infection at the referral hospital, which is not a Covid hospital. This is a speciality hospital for treating kidney, heart ailments and cancer. V B Nampalli, the medical superintendent of the Nashik Regional Referral Hospital, said the decision was taken last month and one dialysis machine has also been given to the civil hospital for Covid patients with kidney-related ailments. He said earlier the dialysis was being conducted at the referral hospital. However, it created fear among the non-Covid patients undergoing treatment there. Since the Covid outbreak last year, around 5,000 dialysis were performed on patients, of them, 44 were Covid patients. A separate arrangement and separate entry for such patients had to be made in the hospital. However, since the fear among other patients persisted, it was decided that the dialysis of the Covid patients will be done at the Nashik civil hospital, where Covid patients are also being treated. Since the number of cases are dropping, there are very few dialysis patients, who are Covid positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civil-hosp-to-handle-dialysis-of-covid-patients/articleshow/84354202.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Talking to mediapersons on Monday, state president Bhagwant Mann claimed that three private power companies had set up their plants in Punjab and the Congress had taken Rs 15.35 crore from them. Congress leader Navjot Sidhu should tweet about the funds taken by his party, he added. Mann said the Congress had earlier taken Rs 1 crore, then Rs 2.50 crore and third time Rs 5 crore as funds. Similarly, amounts of Rs 5 and 2 crore respectively, were received from the company “for setting up the power plant at Rajpura”, while Rs 10 lakh has been received from another firm as campaign funds. He alleged this was the reason why the Congress government was not cancelling the agreements with private companies as they had given money to the party. Mann alleged, “The hands of the Congress government are stained with bribes.” SAD president Sukhbir Badal was aware of the bribe taken by the Congress and that was why he was challenging Captain Amarinder Singh to cancel the power deals, he claimed and asked Congress’s Sidhu to post a tweet about the money companies gave to the Congress. AAP MLA Gurmit Singh Meet Hayer also tweeted that Navjot Singh Sidhu should ask Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to return the funds taken from private power companies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sidhu-must-speak-on-funds-aap/articleshow/84361017.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Camps to help workers update data for Rs 5,000 aid||NEW DELHI: Delhi Building and Construction Workers Welfare Board will organise special camps from July 12 to 17 to help workers update their correct bank details in the government records to receive Rs 5,000 assistance provided by Delhi government. After the Covid-19 outbreak last year, Delhi government had given Rs 5,000 assistance to registered construction workers, but the amount of some workers was returned to the bank as sufficient bank details were not uploaded during the registration process. To help workers update the necessary details, special camps are being held at three labour welfare centres at Nimri Colony in Ashok Vihar, Jhilmil Colony and Pushp Vihar. “The goal of organising these camps is to update the data so that the assistance reaches all the workers in time,” said deputy CM Manish Sisodia. In a statement, Delhi government said it had made major reforms in the construction board in the past two months, including online verification system for workers, who would no longer be required to visit labour office for registration. Online verification will also be done through live photo capture and online payment, the statement said. The government said, with these reforms, workers could now make all their claims online on the e-district portal. “This include education, pension, maternity benefits, marriage and death, which can be filed online, and within two weeks, will also be available through doorstep delivery,” it added. With such crucial reforms, the government said, the number of registered construction workers had increased from 1 lakh in December last year to over 3 lakh currently. Delhi government said it had set a target to register all the 10 lakh construction workers in Delhi by next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/camps-to-help-workers-update-data-for-rs-5k-aid/articleshow/84358863.cms||---

This year the traditional pulling of the three chariots was suspended but the 40-feet long and eight-feet wide chariot carried the Trinity as part of a convoy that saw Kolkata Police pilot cars in front of the procession of 15 cars. The route was not announced to prevent crowding. CM Mamata Banerjee had sent bhog for the Lord that was carried to the temple by MP Subrata Bakshi. After the bhog was offered, the idols were placed on the chariot and the procession started from Albert Road to Park Street and then to Jawaharlal Nehru Road, S P Mukherjee Road, AJC Bose and finally the Iskcon temple on Gurusaday Road. A shamiana has been set up and an altar has been created to act as the temporary mashir bari for the next seven days. Devotees were allowed to enter from 4pm in small numbers with the monks and other sevaks ensuring that safe distance was maintained and everyone was wearing mask. Aarti was done and kirtans filled the air. These were livestreamed from the social media pages of Iskcon. At the Balaram Mandir at Bagbazar of the Ramakrishna Mission, near Mayer Bari, the monks celebrated Ratha Yatra, though it was a restricted affair. For many in the city, the day offered some relief from the prevailing pandemic fatigue. Paromita Banerjee, a social entrepreneur, performed puja both and home and office. “What a relief it was to cook bhog and offer to the Lord, breaking the usual monotony of virtual meetings and working on the laptop,” she said. At the 625-year-old puja of Mahesh, the idols were kept inside the temple where the aarti and other offerings were made while the ‘Narayan Shila’ was carried to Mashir Bari. MP Kalyan Banerjee was present. The ASI did not allow crowding at Brindaban Jew temple at Guptipara. The 250-year-old Ratha Yatra of Midnapore town did not move and the puja was completed inside the temple.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/spl-convoy-live-streaming-mark-ratha-yatra-in-cov-times/articleshow/84358823.cms||---

Apart from this, NMC has already retained 1,068 temporary staffers, who were recruited during the second wave of Covid. These existing temporary staffers include 150 medical officers, 100 staff nurses, 54 pharmacists, 140 ward boys, 172 auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM), 70 lab technicians among others. Bapusaheb Nagargoje, NMC’s medical superintendent, said, “We have already retained the existing temporary health staffers. But as most of the beds in all the Covid facilities of the civic body are vacant due to the drop in cases, we have deployed them at the vaccination centres.” “But we will need more health staffers considering more people might get affected during the third wave of Covid. We are planning to hire around 500 more health staffers temporarily to provide better treatment to patients,” he said. NMC officials said they are enhancing the medical infrastructure and they will need more staff. NMC is adding 1,700 oxygen beds in civic and private hospitals. Of the 1,700 beds, 1,200 will be provided by the civic body while 500 oxygen beds will be added by an NGO and private hospital. The civic administration is expected to start walk-in interviews to recruit the new staff next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-hire-500-temporary-health-workers-soon/articleshow/84354254.cms||Tushar Pawar

The women and child department has given an initial go-ahead for 500 such children. "The district magistrates have confirmed after verifying documents and other information that 500 children would be given this benefit. The benefit-related funds and other documents have been readied at the respective district administration level," said Rekha Arya, state women and child development minister. The other applications are being scrutinised and the remaining eligible children are likely to receive the benefit in the second phase. According to Arya, the state's new CM, Pushkar Singh Dhami, is likely to flag off the programme this week. Meanwhile, in a department meeting, Arya directed the officials to increase the pace of work in Nanda Gaura Yojana. Under the scheme, an amount of Rs 51,000 is given to those girl students of state-run schools who clear the Class XII examination. Earlier, the officials had sought Rs 200 crore from the state government for the scheme. The Chief Minister Mahalaxmi programme, under which nearly 50,000 new mothers will receive health kits, is also likely to take off this week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/500-covid-orphans-identified-by-women-child-development-dept-to-get-monetary-education-support/articleshow/84356546.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Surat||Gujarat: Bharuch-Ankleshwar travel time reduced to 10 minutes||BHARUCH/SURAT: The newly constructed ‘Narmada Maiya’ bridge over river Narmada near Golden bridge in Bharuch was inaugurated by deputy chief minister Nitin Patel on Monday. The Rs 430-crore bridge built by the state government’s roads and buildings department is expected to ease traffic on the existing bridges over the river that has been witnessing huge traffic jams since 2011. Jams extending up to 12-15km were witnessed frequently on the Narmada bridge, especially when some repair work was on on one of the bridges. The Gujarat government had taken the decision to construct the ‘Narmada Maiya’ bridge in 2014 and allocated Rs 400 crore for it. The four-lane bridge is 1.46km long with an approach length of 2.13km and a 1.47km elevated corridor. The bridge will make Bharuch and Ankleshwar a twin cities in the true sense, said Patel. The construction of the bridge was completed in 66 months. “People from South Gujarat will be benefited from the construction of the new bridge,” said Patel at a gathering in K J Polytechnic ground of Bharuch. “This will also benefit workers of Ankleshwar, Bharuch, Dahej, Vilayat, Saykha industrial estates who have to cross the river daily,” he said, adding that the 140-year-old Golden Bridge may be converted into a heritage bridge in the future. The deputy CM also made an announcement for a six-lane road from Gadkhol Patia to ONGC Ankleshwar road at a cost of Rs.15.60 crore, another bridge near Shravan Chokdi on Dahej road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/bharuch-ankleshwar-travel-time-reduced-to-10-minutes/articleshow/84356575.cms||---
---||Nashik||70% of all Covid deaths in Nashik reported in four months||NASHIK: Deaths due to Covid in the four months — March to June — this year make up for almost 70% of the total fatalities reported during the pandemic in Nashik district. The district has recorded 8,349 deaths due to Covid since the pandemic began. Of these, 5,825 deaths were reported in March, April, May and June 2021, when the state was in the grip of the second wave of the pandemic. Of these, the highest death figures were reported in April and May (2,883 and 2,042 respectively), while the two other months reported fewer than 588 deaths. The death count was more or less the same in the rural and urban areas. Nashik civil surgeon Dr Ashok Thorat said, “The second wave, February 15 onwards, was challenging for the healthcare system. The hospitals were filled to capacity and everybody knows that oxygen shortage was a major issue.” As compared to the first wave, which peaked in September 2020 with 10,600 active cases, the second wave peaked in late April 2021 with 48,600 active cases in Nashik district. The second wave reported five-times more patients compared to the first wave. The unavailability of oxygen and ventilator beds, shortage of oxygen, co-morbidities and even late presentation of the patients were some reasons for the deaths. Dr Thorat, however, stressed that more than 80% patients were mildly symptomatic and treated at home. The condition of a few, who failed to stick to the medical protocol, deteriorated. “There were also people who presented themselves very late. They reached hospitals when even best of medicines failed to save them,” he said. Learning from the second wave, the health infrastructure has now been upgraded. Hospitals are now being equipped with the pressure swing adsorption plants and liquid medical oxygen tanks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/70-of-all-covid-deaths-in-nashik-reported-in-4-months/articleshow/84354294.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Dehradun||BJP MLA accused of rape approaches HC seeking protection from arrest; court gives state a week to come up with probe instructions||Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Monday gave the counsel appearing for the state of Uttarakhand a week to seek instructions from the government on the petition filed by Suresh Rathore, BJP MLA from Haridwar’s Jwalapur. Rathore has sought directions from the court to grant him protection from arrest and quashing of the FIR wherein he has been accused of raping a woman party worker. This comes as the single judge bench of Justice NS Dhanik asked JS Virk, the government's counsel, about the State's stand on the matter. Virk informed the court that there are allegations and counter allegations in the matter and therefore he will seek instructions from the officials and inform the court accordingly. After this, Justice Dhanik listed the case for further hearing on Monday. The FIR was registered on the orders of the magistrate after a woman party member of the BJP alleged that Rathore got her inducted into the party and then raped her. The court was also informed that the woman had approached the MLA around two and half years back for some work. The MLA then asked her to join the women's wing of the party. After several meetings, Rathore allegedly raped her and threatened to make her intimate videos viral if she disclosed the alleged crime to anyone. He also allegedly threatened to get her children killed if she revealed the alleged crime to anyone. The MLA, however, has alleged that the woman was trying to extort money from him and a case was also filed against her and four others, including her husband, at least a month before the woman made her complaint. Based on this complaint, the group also spent some time in jail and was released only because of the Coronavirus pandemic. The complainant woman, on the other hand, has rejected the arguments saying that she approached the police well before Rathore's complaint but no case was registered. She claims that Rathore used his clout as a sitting MLA and got her arrested the next time she went to file a complaint against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bjp-mla-accused-of-rape-approaches-hc-seeking-protection-from-arrest-court-gives-state-a-week-to-come-up-with-probe-instructions/articleshow/84356580.cms||Prashant Jha

Health officials said with adequate stock, vaccination took place at 240 vaccination centres in the district, including 109 centres in Nashik city. In the last four days, many centres remained closed as the vaccines were not available. As many as 33,798 beneficiaries were given the first and second shots of vaccines on Monday in the district. Ganesh Misal, the incident commandant for vaccination, said, “The availability of the vaccines is the major issue. The stock we received ended in a day or two due to the rise in the number of vaccination centres in the district.” “The vaccination programme, which was affected due to scarcity of the vaccines in the last four days, resumed on Monday. Apart from 240 government vaccination centres, 12 vaccination centres by private hospitals were functional on Monday,” he said. NMC has increased the number of vaccination centres from 35 to 120 centres in the last 12 days. Of which, 109 centres were operational on Monday. Meanwhile, Apollo, a private hospital, received a fresh stock of 1,200 doses of Sputnik and is expected to start administering vaccines to beneficiaries in a day or two.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Driver’s presence of mind saves three as car catches fire on PVNR Expressway||HYDERABAD: A gallant effort by a driver helped save the lives of three children, including a two-month-old infant, trapped in a burning car on PVNR Expressway on Monday afternoon. A delay in a few minutes may have resulted in a major tragedy. Rajendranagar police said the incident took place near pillar number 135 of Expressway at Attapur. Sailaja and her three children were travelling in a car, but suddenly a fire broke out from the engine. Sailaja, who was at the wheel, stopped the vehicle immediately. She came out of the car, but found that the vehicle’s rear doors got locked automatically. Meanwhile, the smoke started to fill the car. “I was travelling in the opposite direction along with my employer in a car to reach Shadnagar. At a distance, I saw a car on fire. When I was about to cross the other car, it came to a halt. Immediately, I stopped the car and ran to the other side of the road,’’ G Ravi, a professional car driver, told TOI. According to him, by the time he reached the car, smoke had filled the vehicle and fire started to spread from the bottom of the driving seat. “I heard an infant coughing due to the smoke. As the door near the driver’s seat was kept open by Sailaja, through that I managed to open the left front door. I went around and gained entry from the left front door and opened a back door from inside. Quickly, I pulled out the three children one after another. A delay of a few minutes, could have led to a major tragedy,’’ Ravi recalled, claiming he was happy that he could save three lives, especially that of the infant. Within a few minutes, the entire car got engulfed in a fire. Sailaja was heading towards Banjara Hills to visit a hospital when the accident took place. “What surprised me was that, everyone near the site was making videos on their phones, but no one made any effort to rescue them,’’ Ravi said. Meanwhile, police, who were on the governor’s bandobust duty, immediately rushed to the spot and called a fire extinguisher. Later, Cyberabad police appreciated the efforts of Ravi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/drivers-presence-of-mind-saves-three-as-car-catches-fire-on-pvnr/articleshow/84358909.cms||---
---||Nashik||91 Covid-free villages in Nashik report fresh cases||NASHIK: Fresh Covid cases have been reported in 91 villages across 15 talukas of the district. These villages had earlier been declared Covid-free, said the health authorities of the Nashik Zilla Parishad. At a time, when the state government is stressing on Covid-free villages, the need to travel and various other reasons including the rise in the number of social gatherings have resulted in the spread of the infection. According to the health department of Nashik ZP, of the 1,927 villages, 1,337 villages were Covid-free on June 23, which means they had zero active cases in the last five days at least. On July 11, a total of 1,246 villages were Covid-free, which means these 91 villages has reported at least one case post-June 23. “The villages in Sinnar and Chandwad taluka have seen the addition of Covid cases even as the tally across 13 other talukas remains the same,” said Dr Kailas Bhoye, the health officer of Nashik taluka. While 56 Covid-free villages in Sinnar registered Covid cases, the Chandwad taluka witnessed 35 villages losing the Covid-free tag after Covid cases were registered there. “The situation is dynamic. We cannot expect zero cases all the time. But people need to be careful about the spread of the disease. In most of the cases, social gatherings, like weddings, have been the cause of the spread of the disease,” he said. This has affected the plan of Nashik’s education department to start the schools in the Covid-free villages. “We are seeking the data of Covid-free villages for more than three months. Once we get these numbers, we will present it to the ZP CEO, after which, the matter will be discussed with the district collector,” said Vaishali Veer, the education officer of the secondary department, ZP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/91-covid-free-villages-in-nashik-report-fresh-cases/articleshow/84354322.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Delhi||Delhi: For juniors, return to school some way off||NEW DELHI: Schools have been closed since March 2020 and learning has been greatly affected. Teachers do realise that the learning process of the youngsters, particularly those in lower classes, has been hit. And though Delhi government has now allowed school auditoriums to reopen and hold meetings and training, principals view calling children to school a risk because the institutions aren’t able to maintain the level of sanitation and social distancing that the situation demands. They say schools can open for senior students, that too only after mass vaccination. Suruchi Gandhi, principal, Bal Bharti School, Dwarka, said, “It is needless to say that vaccination is a must. If we are thinking of resuming classes IX-XII, we have to set up a system for mass vaccination, but this is not yet evident. In the current scenario filled with the threat of super spreaders and a third wave of infection, I don’t think we are equipped to deal with physical classes. Our healthcare system too is underequipped to deal with any surge.” Gandhi added that in many schools, the campus was huge and the students proportionately fewer. “But our classroom size is average and we have a large number of students. In such crowded schools, even if we call students in groups, we cannot monitor or prevent the children mingling,” she said. As for junior students being called to school instead of the seniors, Gandhi felt that was not an option for the moment. She, however, added, “I am saying this though I know the students really need to be coming to school. They are missing out on life skills, which cannot be imparted through online learning. This is inculcated in school through peers, companionship and the environment.” Another educator who ruled out calling the students to school in batches was Madhulika Sen, senior advisor, Tagore International School, Vasant Vihar. “I have thought about this a lot. With the threat of a third wave, we cannot open schools till at least the adult population is vaccinated,” said Sen. “Having staggered timings or calling students in batches or having half the class in school and the other provided online teaching—these are setups that not all schools can cope with.” B K Sharma, principal, Shaheed Hemu Kalani Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya, Lajpat Nagar, is acutely aware that schools need to reopen in some manner or the other. “Without exposure in schools, the children are not being given what they actually need as part of their growth and education,” said Sharma. “There has to be a system to recall them to the campus. But, of course, we have to bide our time and win the trust of the parents, whose consent for school resumption isn’t yet universal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/for-juniors-return-to-school-some-way-off/articleshow/84358944.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad citizens demand new pipeline for no-network areas first||AURANGABAD: While a set of work for laying down a pipeline as part of the new water supply scheme for Aurangabad and outskirts has begun, stakeholders have sought distribution network first in no-network areas that are currently dependent on tankers. Few areas falling within the municipal limits of Aurangabad along with recently included Satara-Deolai and many fringe areas are considered as no-network areas in terms of water supply. Renuka Wagh, a home-maker from Satara area, said laying down the pipeline in uncovered areas would minimize endless wait of the citizens for water supply through tap. “A major chunk of the population resides in Satara-Deolai that are awaiting water through taps for over two decades now. Besides tanker supply, we rely on bore-wells that often go dry during summer and adjoining months,” she said. The new water supply scheme that will be completed in three phases with financial outlay of Rs 1,680 crore is currently witnessing construction of overhead tanks at 11 places in the city in early phase. Shiv Sena corporator Renukadas Vaidya, in a memorandum submitted to the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), said dependency of citizens on tankers would come to an end early if non-network area gets water connection sooner than other areas. “Around 13 localities situated within the AMC still do not get tap water posing issues before the citizens. It will be prudent if such non-network areas get tap water earlier than other localities,” he said. Kiran Dhande, in-charge of water supply department of AMC, said the demand raised by stakeholders for laying down pipeline in non-network areas would be forwarded to Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikarn (MJP), which is shouldering the responsibility of the project. “The new water supply scheme involves construction of 50 overhead tanks and distribution of water through a pipeline of 2,000km in length. The scheme is likely to get operational at one go when the desired infrastructure is put in place,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/citizens-demand-new-pipeline-for-no-network-areas-first/articleshow/84362738.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Jamia gunman arrested for hate speech in Noida, faces law as an adult this time||GURUGRAM: The youth who had last year fired at Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protesters outside Jamia Millia Islamia, and last week, called for attacks on the Muslim community at a mahapanchayat in Pataudi, was arrested on Monday. It’s the second time he has been taken into custody, but the first as an adult. For the Jamia shooting, the boy had faced the law as a juvenile because he was yet to turn 18 at the time. A Gurgaon police team picked him up on Monday from Gautam Budh Nagar, where the boy is from, after an FIR was filed at Patadi police station. The youth, now purportedly 19 years old, has been charged under sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc, and engaging in acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) and 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the IPC. The youth had made the remarks at the gathering that was called to discuss “love jihad”, among other things. The organisers had last week denied inviting the boy, claiming he had turned up on his own. The mahapanchayat was held at the Ramleela Ground in Pataudi on July 4. A video clip of his speech was widely shared on social media, leading to calls for legal action against the gathering and the speakers there. “If they can abduct our sisters, why can’t we abduct theirs? From Pataudi, I want to warn people with a ‘terrorist mindset’ that if I can go to Jamia in support of CAA, Pataudi is not very far,” he had purportedly said. Later, in another video shared where the boy is the purported speaker, he stood by the words and repeated them. The Pataudi FIR was filed based on a complaint filed by a Bilaspur resident. Police said the boy was produced before a Gurugram court, which remanded him in judicial custody for 14 days. Confirming the arrest, DCP (Manesar) Varun Singla said, “He was arrested and produced before Gurugram court and sent to judicial custody.” The Pataudi mahapanchayat was organised under the banner of Hindu Dharm Raksha Manch, led by its president Master Om Singh and attended by members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Karni Sena chief and BJP spokesperson Suraj Pal Amu and participants from 90 adjoining villages. The pamphlets distributed before the gathering read, ‘mahapanchayat against love jihad, market jihad, land jihad and religious conversion’. About 500-600 people participated, police said. Narender Pahadi, one of the organisers, had described ‘love jihad’ as a “serious” issue. Asked who invited the Jamia shooter, Pahadi had earlier told TOI he and his team had posted invites on social media, following which people had come on their own. After he fired a shot at protesters near Jamia on January 30 last year, the boy was booked for attempt to murder and under sections of the Arms Act. He was, according to sources, given bail after an assurance from him and his family that he was “repentant” and had been “misled”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/jamia-gunman-held-for-hate-speech-faces-law-as-an-adult/articleshow/84361108.cms||Bagish Jha

The state showed a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni certain confidential reports which the bench perused and handed back to the state’s additional government pleader. The high court then posted a PIL filed by Vaishnavi Ghovale, a lawyer, over the delay in filing in the SHRC vacancies, for compliance to September 14. The HC had last week asked the Maharashtra government why it had not yet appointed a chairperson for its State Human Rights Commission, a post lying vacant since the last chairperson retired in January 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/vacant-posts-in-shrc-will-be-filled-in-2-mths-maharashtra-state/articleshow/84361150.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Activists, residents irked by rampant tree-felling for development projects, try to lock down forest dept HQ||Dehradun: Several green activists and local residents, including senior citizens and students, marched up to the forest department headquarters in Dehradun on Monday and tried to lock down the premises. The move, the agitators said, was their way to protest against “rampant corruption in the department” and the manner in which permission is being given out by forest officials for various construction projects without bothering about the trees. Members of Citizens for Green Doon, Rajpur Community Initiative, Making A Difference By Being The Difference and Prayas Sangathan, among others were part of the protest. “We have tried all kinds of peaceful protests, but since the forest authorities fail to understand the importance of trees, locking them in their office was the only option left,” said Himanshu Arora, general secretary, Citizens for Green Doon. The activists said that Dehradun had lost 21,303 hectares of forest area in the past two decades.”Felling of trees is affecting water sources adversely. I have been born in Dehradun and have never seen a water crisis in our city. And now, we get water for only an hour a day. Why are officials failing to co-relate that trees and soils help in retaining our aquifers?” said an 80-year-old protester. The agitators said that the encroachment on forest and revenue land at Sahastradhara, Kimadi, Jharipani and Tapovan along with illegal construction work in these areas were some of the key reasons behind their decision to protest. Reenu Paul, founder of Rajpur Community Initiative, who has approached the courts on several environment-related issues, said, “The excessive tree-felling is being done for illegal real estate plots, as small hillocks are being transformed into plain area for commercial use.” Incidentally, the state has already lost 50,000 hectares of forest land to "developmental activities", mainly mining and hydropower plants, in two decades as reported by TOI last December. The state plans to fell 20,000 trees under the Char Dham road expansion project, 20,000 for an upcoming 'science city', 11,000 for the Mohund four-lane project, 800 for Barlowgang-Chamasari road and 720 for Santala Devi-Galajwari motor road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/activists-residents-irked-by-rampant-tree-felling-for-development-projects-try-to-lock-down-forest-dept-hq/articleshow/84354442.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Dehradun||Concrete cover in Dehradun increased by 600% between 1995 and 2015: Study||DEHRADUN: There has been a 600% increase in urbanisation – increase in concrete cover -- in Doon between 1995 and 2015. As a result, the city has lost over 18% of its seasonal streams, which have now converted into ephemeral (rain-dependent) seasonal streams. It has also led to a 1% decrease in permanent water cover of the city. This, in turn, has increased the risk of flooding during the monsoon season and led to greater water scarcity during summer months. These revelations are part of the City Water Balance Plan (CWBP) study, conducted by USAID along with the Centre for Urban and Regional Excellence (CURE) to analyse water use in Dehradun, and how to optimise groundwater use and recharge. The study was presented to the government earlier this month and, in fact, was conducted in collaboration with it. Researchers claimed that this study is one of its kind to be done in India. Pointing out areas more suitable for water recharge work, the study said southern zones of the city, which includes areas like Parade Ground have better chances of containing surface water and increase its percolation. This is because the southern part is less hilly and more suitable for recharge of ground water. “Identification of the areas which have better water recharge potential must be initiated to strike a balance between green-grey infrastructure, ensuring better ecological response,” said Swagatam Patnaik from Impact Dash, the technical partner agency of CURE. The study also highlighted that conversion of 25% of land use from barren and agricultural to urban use has put tremendous pressure on the city’s natural resources, like water. Experts said that the damage done by rapid urbanisation can be countered and minimised by increasing green spaces in the city that enable better percolation of rain water and storm water to the underground reservoirs. Adding to the water woes of the city is the fact that water loss due to transmission through water supply pipes is 30%, much higher than the usual 15-20%. On a brighter note, though, the study found that the city had witnessed conversion of 8% of land into streams, which means more surface water available for evaporation and, hence more rainfall. Talking to TOI, Shailesh Bagauli, secretary, urban development department, said, “The study focuses on the availability of water and its demand in the future. Uttarakhand Urban Sector Development Agency along with other stakeholder agencies will be looking into the findings and make a plan accordingly.” “The City Water Balance Plan is a comprehensive scientific study of Dehradun city’s water situation. The study points out water sufficiency for the near future but at the same time, it triggers us to plan and act all the more responsibly. The need is for ensuring equitable distribution of quality water along with adhering to the Jal Jeevan Mission mandate, especially intensifying rain water harvesting,” said Swagata Kainthola, city manager, CURE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/concrete-cover-in-doon-increased-by-600-between-1995-and-2015-study/articleshow/84356711.cms||---

Accused Dipak Sarkar, from West Bengal, was arrested along with his wife Ranjita D’Costa, also from West Bengal, during a raid at Calangute in February. Three victims of trafficking were rescued. During the course of investigation, the victims’ statements revealed that they were involved in commercial sexual activity and that the accused and his wife collected money from the customers and were living on their earnings. “As per the panchanama, the money that was used by the decoy customer was found in the custody of this accused therefore showing a clear nexus between the accused and the victims and prima facie confirming the fact that the accused was receiving money on behalf of the victims. The panchanama corroborates what the victims have stated. Furthermore, in the panchanama, the active role played by this accused is also apparent. The accusation therefore is well founded,” the court stated. The court further stated that the investigating officer has raised an apprehension that the accused indulged in transporting victims to Goa and lived on their earnings. “The learned counsel for the accused was unable to provide any documentary evidence to show what the accused would be doing for a living in Goa,” the court observed. The accused submitted to the court that he has suffered a lot due to the ongoing pandemic and no purpose will be served if he is kept in custody and that the other co-accused has already been released on bail The court held that he couldn’t be released on bail just because his wife was released on bail because, as a woman, she is governed by Section 437 (1) (ii) of CrPC, which weighed in her favour as there was no direct material to connect her to the offence. “In the instant case, the present accused is the main accused where there is direct prima facie evidence. Therefore, at least until and unless the victims are examined the accused cannot be released on bail,” the court held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/panaji-court-denies-bail-to-accused-in-trafficking-case/articleshow/84359004.cms||---

The consumer has allegedly developed back pain and skin issues after taking the weight loss treatment. Hasini Yadav K, the complainant, submitted that after going through an advertisement in electronic media, she approached Life Slimming and Cosmetic Clinic on September 15, 2017 and enquired about treatment for inch loss in hips, buttocks and thighs. After she was convinced that she would lose at least 10-15 kgs within three months, she paid the entire treatment fee—one lakh rupees, in the next couple of days to reduce her weight from 81 kgs and inch loss. She submitted that on September 19 and 20, the first set of probing was done on her hip, thighs and buttocks area. She was also asked to come back for maintenance sessions thrice every week, for 3-4 hour sessions for the next four months. Hasini claimed that even after four months, there was no inch or weight loss. She said that she started developing back pain and skin issues and the same was explained to the in-charge, who in turn assured to provide retreatment with special care and follow-up. She said that after the second probing session, hardly four or five maintenance sessions were conducted. She claimed that during her nine-month treatment, the physiotherapist was changed at least six times and it felt like she was being used as a model to learn and experiment. She filed this complaint after she felt that she felt cheated by the clinic twice and after she developed lots of issues due to improper treatment. The representative of the opposite party, in the written version, stated that the allegations levied by the complaint are totally false, baseless and hereby denied. They said that the complainant never raised any objection or query during treatment and that the weight management record, signed by the complainant, showed weight and inch loss and that she was satisfied with the treatment. They claimed that the complainant was advised to follow low-calorie foods and a high protein diet during treatment, but the same was not adhered to by the complainant. During the trial, the bench noticed that the opposite party had given repeated treatment. “Repeated treatment itself is evident that opposite parties are deficient in rendering proper services and showed their failure in reduction of weight of the complainant as promised by them,” said the bench and directed the clinic to refund 40% of the treatment fee. Hasini claimed that even after four months, there was no inch/weight loss. She said she started developing back pain and skin issues and when conveyed to the in-charge, the latter had assured to provide retreatment||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/weight-loss-fiasco-clinic-asked-to-pay-rs-55k-to-woman/articleshow/84358974.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

This has irked the secondary school teachers who claimed that the department is playing double games and is being unfair to a section of teachers. Last year, the same thing had happened where 800 primary teachers got their transfer applications’ accepted while secondary teachers didn't receive any. Recently, members of the state teachers’ association, secondary school teachers mostly, expressed reservation against the government’s recent decision to increase the salaries of the guest teachers. The union has claimed that they welcome the government's decision to increase the monthly allowance of the guest from Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000 but it should focus on the permanent teachers as well.

Residents in these colonies have decided to join hands and demand that the dump yard either be shut or relocated. They had planned to covene a meeting for the same on Sunday, but have deferred it until next week. A resident of Malani Enclave, Venkata Ramana tod TOI, “Residents are scared as there is a chance of a Zika virus outbreak as seen in Kerala. We predict that the chances of such cases are quite possible in the Cantonment also because of SCB officials’ apathy.” “Residents of the colonies adjoining the dumping yard, are unable to breathe freely due to the foul smell. Apart from this, roaring earth movers and movement of garbage vans are creating a nuisance and causing inconvenience. The ground water is also polluted,” said Samson, another resident of Trimulgherry. “We are also scared about the spread of diseases in the monsoon,” he added. Recently, representatives of resident welfare associations of nearly 10 colonies also met the Director General Defence Estates (DGDE), Prachuri Goyal, who had visited the Secunderabad Cantonment, to ask her to relocate the dumping yard. RWAs are also planning a plan of action to shut the dumping yard permanently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/scb-dumpyard-gives-residents-sleepless-nights-as-monsoon-sets-in/articleshow/84359038.cms||---
---||Delhi||Home away from home at protest site: These farmers are here to stay, come rain or shine||NEW DELHI: Sahalpreet Singh and Avi Shergill, friends of many years, met at Singhu border several months ago when they arrived in their tractor trolleys from their villages in Ropar and Mohali districts of Punjab for the farmers’ protest. But open to the elements, they felt the heat of summer and modified a trolley, fixing an air-conditioner and other amenities to it so 15 people could sleep in cool comfort. That was only an example of how the farmers aren’t letting the weather spoil their plans. And as the moisture-laden clouds blow into the region, the protesters are prepared for the rains too. Singh and Shergill spend their days doing seva at the langars. Whenever they take a break, they have the luxury of refrigerated water, television and soft mattresses. “We have also installed a generator and inverter in case of power failure,” said Singh, visibly pleased with the drawing-room look of his temporary quarters. “Now we neither have a problem with the heat nor are we worried about the rain. We are here for the long haul.” Shergill added, “A monsoon shower makes farmers happy. Many of our friends have gone back to their farms for the time being to prepare for the rains.” He said that the innovative group behind the AC accommodation is now thinking of beautifying the road on which the trolley is parked. Nand Lal of Ropar has preferred the old method of coping with the heat. The 75-year-old farmer and a few of his fellow villagers have built a mud hut with a thatched roof, very much like those back home that keep the residents cool during the summer. “Our sarpanch helped us build this and the village folks contributed a cooler and two fans. But this house is naturally cool and does not need mechanical cooling,” smiled Lal. “We will see off the heat and the monsoons in this village hut, even winter if the government still refuses to hear us out.” Harbhajan Singh has erected a large tin roof over his langar with the rain in mind. But weather is not a deterrent in any case. “The rains are welcome. We love the rain. In any case, we aren’t going to be affected by the cold, heat or rain. We are here for our rights and nothing else matters,” declared the Karnal resident. The protestors may take the sun and rain in their stride, but there is also the heat in the neighborhood, with local residents of both Singhu and Kundli villages losing patience at the disruption of life for over a year by the protests. “They are mistaken if they think they will achieve much by stay here for long,” snapped Prem Prakash, whose stationery business at Kundli has been affected by the protests. “Every day I get trapped in traffic when commuting. We, shop owners in the local market, have decided to block the road at Rai in Haryana and stop supplies to the farmers. The protests have gone on for too long.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/home-away-from-home-at-protest-site-these-farmers-are-here-to-stay-come-rain-or-shine/articleshow/84359135.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

Hence, we will stay till Sunday and will resort to once-a-week dry day on every Wednesday from next week,” he added. The NMC has a total water reservation of 5,500 mcft in 3,800 mcft in Gangapur dam complex, 400 mcft in Darna and 1,300 mcft. The water reservation period is between October 15, 2020 and July 31, 2021. The water level in Gangapur dam complex, the major source of the water for the Nashik city, has reduced to 26% of the capacity as against 38% during the same period last year. The total capacity of the Gangapur dam complex is around 9,350 mcft. Currently, the dam complex has a total storage of 2,439 mcft.

The activists also said that the Constitution of India through fundamental duties and the primary articles stipulates that the heritage and culture of this country needs to be preserved. “When the Constitution of India itself spells out that culture and heritage needs to be preserved and protected, it’s not anybody’s prerogative as an Indian citizen to decide that heritage is not important. Secondly, the Telangana High Court in 2019 passed a judgment clearly stating that Regulation 13, which accorded permission to 137 heritage buildings to be protected, is restored. OGH is also in the list of buildings included in the list,” said Deepak Kant Gir, managing trustee, Hyderabad Heritage Trust. The high court passed a judgment after it noticed that several monuments that need to be protected under the Telangana Heritage Act were left out after they re-did the Act in 2020. “Once a property is declared as heritage, it is always a heritage,” the court said. Meanwhile, a few activists also suggested that the government can leave OGH for people who are already here, decongest and construct new medical facilities outside the city. “For the population that we had when OGH was built, the architects decided to develop the Osman Sagar in the front and have the Musi river front alongside and have adequate open space in the surroundings. This is the way to plan instead of cramming everything. We can always leave OGH as it is, restore it and think of constructing new hospitals in the outskirts which will help create more job oppourtunities,” said Anuradha Reddy, co-convenor, INTACH-Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-one-can-legally-touch-ogh-say-activists/articleshow/84358992.cms||---

According to the pre-bid meeting last week, Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA) claims around eight agencies attended the last of its meetings, while two others agencies had shown interest. AUDA will begin the process of analysing the bid documents from Tuesday evening. AUDA, the city’s apex urban planning body, had invited proposals from consultants to assess venues and infrastructure required to host the Games on June 8 this year. The centre of the Olympics games will be the Rs 4,118 crore upcoming SVP Sports Enclave on the riverfront near Bhat village. The main pre-bid meeting that was held on June 18, saw a handful of consulting companies which have offices in Europe, US and India approach AUDA to participate in the bidding. “While most of the documents have been submitted in digital format, it may happen that a few documents face technical errors. Because of this we have fixed Tuesday where physical files can be brought in to give everyone a fair chance,” says a senior AUDA official. The winning consultant will assess sports and nonsports venues and city infrastructure for hosting the Olympic Games and identify options for host cities for the Olympics. An AUDA official told TOI that the choice of consultant will be crucial as after preparing the roadmap, the second major task will be to engage in ‘continuous and targeted dialogue’ for the Olympic bid and conform to IOC rules, the Olympic charter and the IOC code of ethics. A Gujarat government proposal which was sent to the Union ministry of youth affairs and sports mentions that a special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) will be formed would be hoping for generous funding. “They will be collaborating with AUDA. The state-central government share for funding will be 30%-70% or 50% each,” an official of the urban development department said. The official added, “We are also exploring the possibility of attracting Rs 1,100 crore in private investment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/auda-closes-bids-for-olympic-consultants/articleshow/84361257.cms||---

The directorate of women and child development has started issuing token numbers on a daily basis for the smooth disbursement to the beneficiaries of the scheme. Accordingly, the beneficiaries are called on a specified date to initiate the disbursement process while avoiding crowding. After issues regarding the disbursement of the scheme’s benefits were reported in the media, the department asked applicants not to panic and said that every eligible applicant will get the benefits. “On the day of disbursement, the original documents of Laadli Laxmi Scheme are handed over to the beneficiary which have to be presented in the beneficiary bank. The amount will be credited in the beneficiary bank account, once the original documents are deposited in the concerned bank of the beneficiary,” a statement by the department read. On deposit of Rs 37.49 crore in the nodal banks — HDFC Bank and State Bank of India — the department cleared 3,749 Laadli Laxmi Scheme applications in June. Those who have collected the original documents and produced it in the bank after July 5 are already in receipt of the money in their account, the department said. Laadli Laxmi Scheme was launched by then chief minister Manohar Parrikar “to address the undesirable tendency of female foeticides and with an aim towards erasing the general perception that the birth of a girl in the family is a burden on her parents/guardian during her marriage”. A beneficiary gets Rs one lakh under the scheme. Under the Griha Aadhar Scheme on July 6, Rs 18.1 crore was deposited in the HDFC Bank and disbursement is under process. “There is no need to produce income certificates issued by the mamlatdar for fresh cases. The cases which are marked to be doubtful have to produce the income certificate issued by the mamlatdars. The list of these doubtful cases is already available with the respective taluka mamlatdars.” the department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/all-eligible-applicants-will-get-benefits-of-laadli-laxmi-scheme-govt/articleshow/84359166.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Rare supernovae using borrowed energy to shine 10,000 times brighter, finds ARIES||DEHRADUN: Scientists from the Nainital-based Aryabhatta Research And Observational Science Institute (ARIES) have found that a rare superluminous supernovae — a powerful stellar explosion — that was discovered in January 2020 was using energy from an exotic neutron star to shine 10,000 times brighter than a normal supernovae. SN 2020 ANK is an extremely bright, hydrogen deficient, fast-evolving supernova spotted by Zwicky Transient Facility in the US. SuperLuminous Supernova (SLSNe) like the SN 2020 ANK are very rare and can help unravel the mysteries of the early universe. Only 150 such supernovaes have been found till date. Researchers at ARIES have been studying the celestial object and have found that it was illuminated using borrowed energy, a rare occurrence, and its illumination was 10,000 times higher than a normal supernovae. According to the scientists, the event took place four billion light years away from Earth. The study was led by Amit Kumar, a Phd student under SB Pandey, and was published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, found that the supernovae was being powered by an exotic type of neutron star with an ultra-powerful magnetic field. Neutron stars are formed when a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses, according to NASA. Pandey said neutron stars are more massive than normal lesser massive stars. “Less massive stars produce normal supernovae and more massive stars create superluminous supernovaes. They can provide clues to how the lifetime of more massive stars ended,” he told TOI. Superluminous supernovaes are a very rare phenomena, said Pandey. “They are 1,000 times rarer than normal core collapse supernovae,” he said. The first case was observed a decade ago. According to Pandey, “SLSNe are brighter than normal supernovae and higher energetic than typical supernovae but lower energetic than higher energy explosions like gamma ray bursts. Thus, they serve as a link between the brighter explosions like the normal supernovae and very very energetic gamma ray bursts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rare-supernovae-using-borrowed-energy-to-shine-10k-times-brighter-finds-aries/articleshow/84356800.cms||---

---||Nagpur||BJP is misusing media to spread lies against me: Patole||Nagpur: After his controversial remarks against alliance partners earlier, Congress state president Nana Patole backtracked and blamed BJP for misusing the media to target him. Speaking to the media, the Sakoli MLA said he had said nothing controversial and if chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and deputy CM Ajit Pawar invite him for a meeting in this regard, he would be happy to visit them. “There’s absolutely no differences between the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) constituents. If there is any confusion, we will discuss it and get it resolved. We will continue our full tenure of five years. All this hype is created by the BJP, which is our only opposition. It’s planting wrong news through the media, as it was getting apprehensive of Congress’ growing strength across the nation.” Accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government of destroying the country’s economy, he reiterated that the grand old party would continue to protest across the country against skyrocketing prices of petrol, diesel, and gas, and inflation. “We’re increasingly getting support from the people that is unnerving the opposition. Even at our midnight meetings, people enthusiastically participate in large numbers, as they’re fed up with the central government. The Modi-led government is responsible for the deaths of citizens, who failed to get vaccines in time. If a city like Mumbai is facing a big shortage of vaccines, leave aside the rural areas.” On Congress ministers, including his predecessor Balasaheb Thorat and energy minister Nitin Raut regularly meeting with the high command in Delhi, he said those were routine visits and didn’t necessarily mean that they were lodging any complaint. “Thorat is revenue minister, and he needs to visit the capital for his work. Similarly, Raut is chairman of All India Congress SC Cell, and he too needs to interact with Gandhis in this regard. There’s no differences among us, as speculated by the media. It’s again the opposition which is spreading these lies.” Endorsing health minister Rajesh Tope’s views, the former speaker said even the Congress wanted to ease restrictions, but the threat of a second wave continued with nearly 10,000 Covid-19 cases still active in Maharashtra. “The centre has miserably failed to provide vaccination to the entire country, due to its wrong policies. We’ve around 12 to 13 crore population, of which not even half is inoculated. If our population is vaccinated, we too could have relaxed restrictions and started schools and colleges like western countries,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-is-misusing-media-to-spread-lies-against-me-patole/articleshow/84385651.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Lucknow||Lucknow University’s undergraduate courses to cover Mahatma Gandhi, VD Savarkar, Ram Manohar Lohia||LUCKNOW: Undergraduate (UG) students of political science and economics in Lucknow University (LU) and associated colleges will now study about Indian political and economic theorists from the right to left of the spectrum – from Mahatma Gandhi, Swami Vivekanand and VD Savarkar to MN Roy, Ram Manohar Lohia and Chaudhary Charan Singh. In political science, for the first time two leading right-wing figures - father of Hindutva ideology and Hindu Mahasabha leader VD Savarkar and Deen Dayal Upadhaya, founder member of Bharatiya Jan Sangh (BJS) who propounded the theory of Integral humanism, will be included in the new paper on “Indian Political Thinkers”. In the same paper, the syllabus will now also include elaborate study of life and work of Swami Vivekananda and MN Roy, whose philosophies till now were only touched at UG level. Vivekananda established Hinduism in major world religions and introduced the west with the Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga, besides contributing to the concept of Indian nationalism and Hindu reform movements. On the other hand, Roy was an international leftist revolutionary and founder member of Communist Party of India and Mexican Communist Party. Similarly, for the first time, the UG syllabus of economics will include philosophies of Ram Manohar Lohia, Chaudhary Charan Singh and Deen Dayal Upadhaya. Lohia was a leading Gandhian, socialist and politician, also credited as an “original thinker” in developing socialism philosophy in the Indian context. His contribution in politics, sociology and economics will be taught. Singh was also a Gandhian and champion of farmers’ rights. He also served as chief minister of UP and fifth prime minister of India. His economic ideas and critique of the development discourse in India from agrarian and rural perspective will be the part of the paper. The economic nuances in the integral humanism theory of Upadhyaya, who is also an RSS icon and one of the architects of BJS, the predecessor party of the now ruling BJP, will be taught. And, last but not the least, there will be a detailed study of economic concepts propounded by the father of nation, Mahatma Gandhi, such as trusteeship principle, self-sufficient village units and an economic order based on simplicity, decentralization, cooperation, equality, non-violence and human values. There will not be a separate paper on these leaders in economics, but chapters on different issues will include their teachings. According to LU teachers, these inclusions have been done in the syllabus of the four-year UG course designed in accordance with New Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The proposals have been approved by the board of studies of political science and economics. Now, they will be tabled before Board of Arts Faculty and then LU’s academic Council for final approval. “It is essential for students to understand their country first through the mind of our `economic icons’. Foreign policies won’t work in the Indian context as our culture, challenges and practices are different. Our thinkers said the fruits of development should reach the last man,” said head of the economics department Prof MK Agarwal. When contacted, head of political science, Prof Manuka Khanna, “Students will learn Indian political theorists and how Indian political thought has impacted the western political thoughts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lus-undergrad-courses-to-cover-bapu-savarkar-lohia/articleshow/84361292.cms||Mohita Tewari
---||Dehradun||Indian Medical Association doctors write to Uttarakhand CM, caution against Kanwar yatra||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has written to chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, urging him to "learn from the state’s previous failures” in controlling the Covid-19 spread and cancel the annual Kanwar yatra. The letter, a copy of which is with TOI, said, “After the first wave, we let down our guard and could not follow the guidelines of the Central government delineated for this pandemic, which was a gross negligence on our part. Consequently, we lost several lives in the menace of the second wave...” Signed by secretary general of IMA Dr Ajay Khanna, the letter added that “... we should not allow pilgrims to enter the boundaries of our state and keep it safe from the third wave of Covid”. The letter comes days after experts warned the state government that the fortnight-long pilgrimage could be “five times more likely to be a superspreader event” than the Kumbh festival that took place in Haridwar in April. This year the Kanwar yatra was scheduled to start from July 25. Crores of pilgrims are expected to attend it, prompting fears that standard operating procedures (SOPs) would be difficult to implement. The chief minister has said a final decision on whether to allow the yatra or not would be taken after talking to neighbouring states. Member of IMA’s Central Working Committee, Dr D D Choudhury, said, “The Uttarakhand government should take lessons from the Kumbh mela. We lost so many people to the pandemic who would otherwise have been safe. The Kanwar yatra should not be conducted. The hill state should seal its borders from all sides else thousands might catch the infection in Uttarakhand and its neighbouring states." Choudhary added that chief ministers of both UP and Uttarakhand should not make the yatra a “political matter or an issue of prestige”. He said, “It should be a symbolic yatra where 10 to 12 pilgrims can do the rituals under strict supervision of health teams and with all Covid protocols in place."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ima-docs-write-to-ukhand-cm-caution-against-kanwar-yatra/articleshow/84356841.cms||Shivani Azad

Following the trap, the RTO official, Swapnil Pawar, and Abhijit Pawar, private person, were taken into detention by the ACB. Those privy to the probe have claimed the trap to be a result of internal rivalry between the arrested private personnel and the one who was working prior to him. When contacted, Aurangabad superintendent of police (ACB) Rahul Khade said, “ The Mumbai unit of ACB has carried out a successful trap in which the assistant RTO and a private person were detaind for demanding and accepting bribe.” The complaint was lodged by a motor vehicle driving school owner after he was allegedly being harassed for seeking bribe to renew about 30 driving licenses of the candidates from his training school. The bribe was allegedly accepted by Abhijit while claiming to be representative of Swapnil. Soon after Abhijit’s detention, the ACB team also detained the RTO official. This was followed by ACB teams carrying out searches at the houses of both the accused to check for disproportionate cash and assets.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 26 specialists, including IITians, help crack e-fraud targeting Shabana Azmi||MUMBAI: The scamsters who duped actor Shabana Azmi in an online liquor-order-placing fraud on June 24 have been identified and will soon be arrested, said the state cyber police on Monday. An officer said the breakthrough was achieved after the cyber cell hired 26 graduates, including from the IITs, as domain specialists to track increasing online offences in the state.  In Mumbai alone, 8,284 cases of cybercrime were registered from 2017 to 2021 (till May 31), of which 945 were solved. “The newly-hired 26 cyber specialists will help clear the backlog, not only in the city but across the state,” said a cyber police officer. A state cyber cell officer told TOI, “The hired specialists will also take care of cyber analysis and the government’s cyber audit. They are experienced in cases through Google’s cybersecurity audit, especially concerning overseas hackers. The team will oversee how to strengthen critical power and railways signal infrastructure to guard against cyber terrorism.” Azmi on June 24 had accused an alcohol delivery platform of allegedly duping her. In a tweet, she claimed that she was conned by the platform where she placed an order but didn't receive it. “Beware, I have been cheated by them. I paid upfront and when the ordered item didn’t turn up they stopped picking my calls," Azmi wrote, sharing details of her transaction with the platform. This was not the first time such an incident was reported in the city. A couple of months ago, a senior citizen in Andheri was similarly duped of Rs 68,000 after he had placed an order for alcohol. “Thanks to the hired specialists, this case has now been solved,” said an officer. Special inspector general of police Yashasvi Yadav said Maharashtra is the first state in the country to hire cyber specialists as consultants. “They will have a proactive role in the tackling and detection of all cyber offences in the state,” said Yadav. “They started working a week ago, since the process to hire them was completed in June. They will now scan through the database of the national cybercrime registry, where people submit complaints, and begin work.” Their role, said an officer, will be to prevent all kinds of cyber offences related to banking, child pornography and crimes committed through the darknet. “The decision to hire the specialists was taken after the October 12, 2020 cyber attack that led to a major power failure in Mumbai. It is suspected that power lines may have tripped following a cyberattack from another country. A ransomware attack on MIDC servers in March was traced to an east European country by the police,” the officer said. He said that to probe complex cyber offences, gathering evidence, and training officers, the experts will also audit government installations to ensure that these are not vulnerable to foreign attack.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-26-specialists-including-iitians-help-crack-e-fraud-targeting-azmi/articleshow/84359207.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

The route under curfew was traversed by 120 sailors who pulled the three chariots in a matter of three hours and 40 minutes instead of the usual 12 to 13 hours, making it the fastest procession in 144 years of the Rath Yatra’s history. The curfew to maintain Covid safety was imposed from 7am to 2pm, but was later lifted at 11.30am when the chariots returned to Jagannathji Temple at 10.50am. Ahead of the procession, Union home minister Amit Shah performed Mangala aarti (first prayers of the day) at 4am and offered special khichdi as prasad – made only once a year – to the deities. The eye covers from deities were removed and they were seated in the three chariots as CM Vijay Rupani and deputy CM Nitin Patel performed the Pahind ritual – symbolically cleaning the path with a golden broom – and gave the first pull to the chariots.

Chief metropolitan magistrate Gajender Singh Nagar granted the relief to Boota Singh and Gurjot Singh on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 50,000 with one surety of like amount each. Both the accused were granted bail last week in another case related to the violence. The court stated, “The accused have been implicated in both the cases on the basis of the same act. There is no specific role attributed to the accused in violence or other offences qua which the present FIR was registered.” It directed them not to tamper with the evidence and to join investigation as and when called. It also directed them not to commit similar offence. Advocate Jasdeep Singh Dhillon, appearing for Boota, argued that he was merely present at the site and not involved in any overt act. Dhillon further contented that the role of Boota in both the FIRs in which he has been arrested was absolutely identical. Advocate Jaspreet S Rai, appearing for Gurjot, claimed there was no specific allegation against him that he caused any injury to any police officer or any other person.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-court-grants-bail-to-2-in-red-fort-violence-case/articleshow/84359234.cms||Usha Das
---||Jaipur||Private schools in Rajasthan oppose order on admission without transfer certificate||JAIPUR: Association of private schools in Rajasthan organised a statewide protest against the recent orders issued by the state government on giving admissions to the students in government schools without transfer certificate (TC). Members of the association met MLAs, block development officials and collectors of various districts. A group of representatives also went to meet MLA Mahesh Joshi and Jaipur collector Antar Singh Nehra regarding this. School Shiksha Pariwar, who has more than 30,000 private schools as its members, opposed the order issued by Directorate of Bikaner on giving admissions to students in government schools from class I to VIII without TC. They claimed that now, the parents will go for admission in government schools without paying fees in private schools, until the physical classes start. Anil Sharma, president of School Shiksha Pariwar said, “We informed the MLA and the collector about the severe repercussions on us. Anyway parents are reluctant to pay fees and with this order, they will take their children out from our schools, get them admitted in government schools until the situation of school lockdown prevails and then once the pandemic is over, they will return. We will face severe financial losses.” Another point put forward by the private schools was that on April 9, 2020, the government itself issued order that any parent who wants to leave schools with transfer certificate, have to clear the due fees. Officials have given a reason that many private schools are not organizing online classes for the students while charging full fees. Many parents who want to shift to different schools are not given TC and for those students, the government has decided to give them admission provisionally until they get their certificates. Director of secondary education, Sourabh Swami while talking to TOI said, “The admission will be given on provisional basis and in our software (P) will be written to avoid any doubling of students. We will be cautious about this fact and will take TC documents from the students later. We will stand by the order and will take necessary precautions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pvt-schools-oppose-order-on-admission-without-transfer-cert/articleshow/84359191.cms||---

Those who had not stocked up essentials found it difficult to get milk and vegetables. Normalcy returned to these areas only after 11.30am when the curfew was lifted from the entire route of the Rath Yatra.

Pathan added: “Even milk deliverymen were not allowed to enter our locality till the three chariots had passed the area.” Internal movement was also restricted with the deployment of police inside localities. Some citizens, however, could get a glimpse of the chariots as they sped through the main roads. Passengers coming from the Kalupur railway station were caught unawares by the situation. They did not find any vehicle to get home. Jayendra Sunera, a passenger, said that he did not know about the curfew on the route.

As per the PRC commission’s report, state government has sanctioned 4,91,304 posts of which 3,00,178 posts are occupied and 1,91,126 posts are vacant. Another 1,08,528 posts are occupied by outsourced employees. The state government is not considering outsourced posts as being vacant. The notification will first be given to posts where there is very high demand and will be done in a phased manner. The filling of posts will take place not only through the Telangana State Public Service Commission (TSPSC) but also through institutes of various government departments. While TSPSC has not issued notifications, vacancies are being considered. Currently there are posts across 18 categories such as commercial tax offices, residential welfare officials, panchayat raj officials, deputy collectors, and DSPs in police, among others. The state government had issued Group-2 notifications around seven years back for posts under 12 departments. It has now announced that posts which are currently vacant will be filled first followed by those posts which have fallen vacant due to promotions. Details for posts which have fallen vacant due to promotions are currently being prepared and reliable sources within the government said that it will not issue notifications for those posts at the same time as other posts. Among the current vacant posts, many are available in the education department and are mostly that of teachers while there are also Group-3 posts such as computer operators. The finance department is also undertaking assessments of any legal complications in filling some of the vacant posts and posts available in multi-zones. CM K Chandrasekhar Rao had recently said that since the President had given permission for the zonal system, there should not be any problems. On Tuesday, the cabinet will give permission for filling up vacant posts after verifications of details as submitted by the various government departments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-likely-to-release-notification-for-phase-wise-recruitment-for-45k-posts/articleshow/84359175.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Cyient has joined hands with Esri UK and Xerox to deliver the project for HMLR that safeguards land and property ownership valued at £7 trillion, enabling over £1 trillion worth of personal and commercial lending to be secured against property. The land register contains more than 26 million titles showing evidence of ownership for more than 87 per cent of the landmass of England and Wales. The LLC programme is aimed at digitising and migrating millions of separately held local land charge records from local authorities into a centralised digital register that will enable HMLR to provide a single and simple-to-use digital service for homebuyers and conveyancers, Cyient said. The Hyderabad-based company will work with Esri UK to provide a fully configured and customised version of Esri’s software package, which will be used as the primary spatial capture and improvement tool for HMLR. On the other hand, Xerox’s Capture and Content Services, which use powerful artificial intelligence and machine learning, will automatically capture and validate information from digital and physical local land charge records, it added. Cyient said it will own the entire process and provide a central management information platform, allowing for “single pane of glass” reporting, with the ability to drill down to prove data integrity and provenance.

A food court, open air theatre, laser water show, and a tourist facility centre among others will be new attractions at the pilgrimage centre. Madhav Sharma, executive director of Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation, said that 90% of the civil works have been done. “All the remaining works are expected to be completed by September. The new facilities will be ready for the coming tourist season.” In 2017, the Union ministry of tourism had sanctioned Rs 18 crore for the projects under Swadesh Darshan Scheme. The facilities are developed as part of the spiritual circuit. Another Rs 5.50 crore had also been sanctioned for upgradation of the existing light and sound show at Chittorgarh by the ministry under the Swadesh Darshan scheme. The existing light and sound show system was installed in 2010, which has become obsolete over the years. Jitendra Joshi, executive engineer of RTDC, said, “Presently, cabling works, electrical circuit, control room works are going on. Light-fixture installation works are being initiated at the site. Project is expected to be completed by the end of next month.” The upgradation work involved complete replacement of existing hardware, equipment, light fixtures, audio equipment, control room, etc. RTDC was appointed as implementing agency for development of both the projects. Earlier, the projects had courted controversy after the former tourism minister Vishvendra Singh alleged irregularities in the tendering process. But RTDC had stuck to its stand and appointed implementing agencies for the execution of the projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sanwaliya-ji-temple-to-get-food-court-and-laser-show/articleshow/84359213.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||India, Bangladesh to set up ‘Bangabandhu chair’ at DU to give ties a further boost||NEW DELHI: India and Bangladesh strengthened their ties on Monday when the two neighbouring countries signed a pact to set up the ‘Bangabandhu Chair’ at the Delhi University, to focus on shared cultural heritage of both the countries with subjects like Anthropology, Buddhist Studies, Geography, History, Music, Fine Arts and Political Science. A memorandum of understanding to set up the chair was signed here to honour Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who led the country’s war of liberation and is known as the founding father of Bangladesh. The pact is in accordance with a decision taken by both the countries “a foreign visiting professor or a subject expert on Bangladesh, who is likely to be a person of Bangladeshi origin will be occupying the “chair” at the Delhi University, to commemorate 50th Anniversary of the Bangladesh Liberation War and Indo-Bangladesh Diplomatic relations. The decision to set up the chair was taken during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s last visit to Dhaka in March 2021, a press statement released by the Bangladesh High Commission said on Monday. Delhi University vice chancellor PC Joshi and ICCR director general Dinesh Patnaik signed the agreement, at Azad Bhawan, ICCR, in the presence of Bangladesh High Commissioner to India, Muhammad Imran and ICCR president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe. While foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla sent a message on the occasion, Indian high commissioner in Dhaka, Vikram Doraiswami joined the programme virtually from Dhaka. Speaking on the occasion, Sahasrabuddhe said, “we are proud to establish ‘Bangabandhu Chair’ at Delhi University in memory of an undisputed leader like Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/india-bdesh-to-set-up-bangabandhu-chair-at-du-to-give-ties-a-further-boost/articleshow/84359316.cms||Mohua Chatterjee

A rough estimate indicates a speed of 80 meters per minute for the chariots along with over 2,000 police officers and personnel accompanying the chariots! The speed was maintained throughout the route, said officials. The tired sailors pulling the chariots were changed at Saraspur as the new team took the chariots back to the temple, ensuring the momentum. Mahant Dilipdasji, talking to TOI after the procession got over, said that it was a ‘Na Bhuto Na Bhavishyati’ (Never before, never after) incident in the history of 144 years. “When the estimates of the time were given, even we were sceptical, and thus had given a conservative time of 1pm. But when the chariots were back even before 11am, we were glad,” he said. “It’s truly citizens’ victory that they followed the curfew and had a glimpse of the deities through digital screens.” The success lay in microplanning, said city police commissioner Sanjay Srivastava. “We had made several plans based on the possible outcome at specific spots on the route. More than usual police personnel were deployed to ensure that the procession passes peacefully. All stakeholders truly participated in the event, but support from the citizens was key to success,” he said. Giving an insight into the process, a top official said that they chalked out possible trouble areas, deployed personnel inside to create another layer of security. The possible challenge was to prevent citizens from coming on to the route. Thus, it was a three-layer security for the entire route. Rajendra Asari, additional CP, Sector I, said that more than force, it was to do with coordination with local leaders who convinced the citizens not to venture out. The procession did not stop at Saraspur for more than 10 minutes, as the chariots only had two persons atop to reduce its weight. Even in the morning, the elephants were brought in from one gate and taken out from another to save 10 minutes, said officials involved in the process. The entire route was covered by various teams several times in three days leading to Monday, they added, to familiarize the teams with the route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/80m-a-minute-how-chariots-traversed-18km-in-3-40-hours/articleshow/84361386.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Year after rebellion, Rajasthan former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot’s gripes remain||JAIPUR: It is the first anniversary of the rebellion by former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot against chief minister Ashok Gehlot that brought the Congress government to the brink of collapse. Pilot and 18 MLAs had left for Manesar in Haryana on July 12 demanding a change in the state leadership. They were accused of conniving with BJP to destabilise the Congress government. They were issued show cause notices by ACB and SOG for criminal conspiracy to destabilise the government by offering huge amounts of money to MLAs to desert Gehlot. The Congress had accused Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat of orchestrating the move through middleman Sanjay Jain after an audio came to the fore. So far nothing has been proved. Shekhawat refused to oblige the ACB by providing voice samples. The rebel MLAs had to return to the party fold as they were threatened with disqualification under the anti-defection law. They were short of one-third of the total Congress MLAs to effect a split in the legislature party. The central leadership also stepped in with assurance of addressing their grievances. A three-member AICC committee was formed with late Ahmed Patel, AICC general secretary (organisation) K Venugopal and new general secretary in-charge Ajay Maken to look into the issues and accommodate them in the government. However, nothing much has happened in the last one year. Ahmed Patel passed away in between. Though Maken set many deadlines, no concreate solution emerged. The Pilot faction of MLAs are clamouring for political participation but Gehlot has so far warded off any concession to them with the support of the Independents and the six former BSP MLAs who came to the CM’s rescue. “Pilot, once the powerful party state president and deputy chief minister, has now been sidelined with many of his supports deserting him. Perhaps his inexperience and impatience took a huge toll on his political career, but further side-lining may cost Congress dearly,” said a party leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/year-after-rebellion-pilots-gripes-remain/articleshow/84359252.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC wants probe against ‘all involved’ in Anil Deshmukh case, seeks CBI report||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday sought details of the CBI’s probe so far into its corruption case FIR against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh by Tuesday. Reiterating that the probe that was meant to instil public confidence must be “against all involved”, the HC again asked if Mumbai police officers on the panel for reinstatement of former assistant police inspector Sachin Waze last year could claim immunity for allegedly being unaware of his controversial past. “Corruption is the root cause because of which systems are paralysed. Nobody should be left out and everyone should be investigated,” said a bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar. “If we get to the root of this matter, Waze was collecting money. So who was behind his reinstatement? Can someone now say that he was not aware of Waze’s past, his record etc? That is why we are saying again and again that this episode was not a one-man thing. The crux of the HC order (of April 5 directing a preliminary enquiry into allegations of ‘corrupt malpractice’ made by former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh on March 20 as annexed in a complaint filed by advocate Jaishri Patil ) is to instil public confidence,” they added. “At the cost of repeating, we are saying the investigation must be against all involved. The normal way is that as long as things are going well, no one says anything. Once a transfer happens, all sorts of allegations are made,” the bench said while concluding Deshmukh’s plea seeking quashing of the CBI FIR against him. Additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi, the CBI counsel, said Deshmukh’s conduct was not part of his official duty as he is alleged to have asked Waze to collect money from restaurants and bars and so no prior sanction or consent was needed for a CBI probe. For Deshmukh, senior counsel Amit Desai argued prior sanction was essential under provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Lekhi said the prior sanction clause was not meant to protect wrongdoers. “The home minister (Deshmukh) gave a target to collect money to Waze. It’s not a minister’s job to give targets to police officers. This case is of maladministration and misgovernance.” The CBI counsel said “no one” was beyond the probe’s purview.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-wants-probe-against-all-involved-in-deshmukh-case-seeks-cbi-report/articleshow/84361410.cms||Swati Deshpande

The state government had challenged the high court order. Police said that an FIR was filed because of illegal extraction of iron ore at Asni Dongor, Curdi and Curpem in Sanguem taluka. Police said that there was extraction of iron ore in a forest area without a valid lease, forest clearances and mandatory permissions, thereby causing loss to the state exchequer. “We have heard the counsel for the petitioner. In the given factual matrix set out by the impugned order, we are not inclined to interfere under Article 136 of the Constitution of India. The special leave petition stands dismissed,” the Supreme Court said. In March 2020, the high court of Bombay at Goa dismissed the state government’s appeal against Sameer and Arjun in the case. Justice Nutan Sardessai dismissed the state’s revision appealing against the sessions court verdict. In 2019, the sessions court had discharged the two, stating that it was beyond the limitation of three years as the complaint was filed by the mines department in 2014 while the offence was allegedly committed in 2009/2010. The special investigation team (SIT) had filed the FIR in the case in 2014, and later filed the chargesheet. The SIT had filed 16 FIRs in the illegal mining cases, eight of which have been chargesheeted, three have been closed, and three transferred to the respective police stations. An official said that three cases have been quashed by the court. Presently, four police officers are investigating the illegal mining cases, even as the main mining case is pending for investigation. The SIT has been probing these cases for the past six years, but there hasn’t been much progress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sc-dismisses-states-appeal-against-salgaocar-brothers-in-mining-case/articleshow/84359307.cms||---

In this year alone, the commission has written at least a dozen times to the authorities regarding security of the women and this recent letter is after the NCW saw a Twitter post which said in the last six months, there has been a 30% increase in rape/sexual assault cases in the state and 19 cases are being registered everyday. The letter further said it had been mentioned in the same post that since the past few months and especially since June, there has been considerable increase in the number of rape/sexual assault cases in Rajasthan. The commission said the DGP was required to immediately take necessary steps to curb such crimes from happening on a daily basis. Police officers of all levels from every district of the state should be imparted special training to deal with women related crimes especially of rape and sexual assault. The initiatives taken to address the aforementioned issues should be apprised to the commission at the earliest. Also, every possible efforts should be incorporated so as to dispense safety and security to each and every women and girls of Rajasthan.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Buses hard to spot, cabs threaten strike||KOLKATA: Nearly two weeks have gone by since bus services have been resumed and still, private buses are hard to spot on city roads. Costlier fuel, operators said, was stopping them from taking buses out on the road. The operators are running a signature campaign among commuters on the necessity of a fare revision. Meanwhile, a section of taxi operators have threatened to go on a strike if the fare is not revised immediately. On Tuesday, transport minister Firhad Hakim will meet goods transport operators to resolve issues faced by them because of rising transportation costs. However, the government is in no mood to revise fare and put more pressure on people who are already at the receiving end of the pandemic. The number of private buses plying currently is less than 500, which is only 10% of the fleet that ferry passengers across the city. On a weekday, over 5,000 private buses ply across the city. “But we cannot recover the operating cost with old fares. Unlike government buses, we have no subsidy support,” said Joint Council of Bus Syndicates secretary Tapan Banerjee. “If 500 buses ply in the morning, they just disappear by the afternoon and we wait for hours for buses and finally hop on to a goods vehicle. This has been a routine for the last 10 days. Most of the private buses just don’t ply during evening peak hours,” said Naren Gupta, who daily travels from his Ganesh Avenue office to his Mayurbhanj residence. Commuters complained that even state buses had become very irregular. A WBTC officer said that some buses required overhauling because of the extra load and extra run. “We are often stretching our resources too much to meet the heightened travel demand,” he added. The West Bengal Taxi Operators’ Coordination Committee has threatened a taxi strike on July 26 if their demand of a fare revision is not met. “Our members face humiliation and embarrassment if they demand extra above the metered fare just to compensate for the high fuel costs. So we had requested the government to revise fare to save metered taxis, which will otherwise become extinct soon,” said Committee convenor Nawal Kishore Srivastava. The only way taxis and app-cabs can make some profit is to run shuttle service in specific high-demand routes like Esplanade-Shyambazar, Esplanade-Thakurpukur and Esplanade-Jadavpur routes. “On these routes, most of the cabbies take four to five passengers and each passenger pay anything between Rs 60 and Rs 100. So, at the end of the trip, they make some profit even after paying for costly fuel,” said Animesh Rudra, a resident of Shyambazar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/buses-hard-to-spot-cabs-threaten-strike/articleshow/84356900.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

NIA’s special public prosecutor had opposed his bail plea on grounds that he was part of the banned organisation, CPI (Maoist), and was propagating its ideology. The prosecution also said it was established that he had attended Shaniwarwada, the venue of Elgar Parishad, on the morning of the event. Refuting allegations that he was one of the conveners of Elgar Parishad, Teltumbde, in his bail plea said he had only made a brief visit to Shanirwada on December 31, 2017, to meet his wife’s nephew and sister-in-law and that he was in Pune to attend the wedding of his former classmate’s son. Teltumbde had moved the bail plea earlier this year. He was named in the supplementary chargesheet submitted by the ED last year. He has been lodged in Taloja jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-teltumbdes-plea-for-bail-turned-down-by-nia-court/articleshow/84359361.cms||---

During the meeting, Beniwal said the commission had started work for the eradication of these two issues and added that it was essential to free the minors from the swamp of child labour and begging so that the rights of children can be protected. To work on the same, labour department secretary Niraj K Pawan said, “To make the cities beggar-free, employment would be provided by surveying the beggars by linking them with skill training programmes which would solve their economic problems. The work of identification and survey of beggars will be done jointly by the police and administration.” Other department officials emphasied on creating awareness in rural areas as well as working in coordination with the states from where maximum number of children are coming to Rajasthan to be employed as labourers. During the meeting, it was felt that initially beggars should be identified and rehabilitated immediately followed by mid and long terms strategy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/meet-held-to-work-on-eradication-of-child-labour-begging/articleshow/84359311.cms||---

He recently asked on Twitter if the CM could be loaned to Australia so that they could “sort out the mess our hopelessly incompetent state premiers have created”. The UP government responded to Kelly, offering to host him in the state. “We would be happy to host you and share best practices which helped UP fight the pandemic under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and leadership of UP CM Yogi Adityanath. Let us collaborate and co-operate in this global fight against Covid-19,” it tweeted in response. The Indian state of Uttar Pradesh 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼Any chance they could loan us their Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to r… https://t.co/H5fn3C68pn— Craig Kelly MP (@CraigKellyMP) 1625897432000However, due to travel restrictions in Australia, the MP said that while he would be honoured to visit UP and learn how it implemented Ivermectin, he could not leave due to the restrictions. Kelly praised the CM on Monday as well for the “effective management in crushing the wave”. He said: “Brilliant that UP introduced ‘Ivermectin’ as preventive measure for health workers, patients and people exposed to infected people!! Congratulations to UP and its CM for showing the way on Ivermectin. We need strong leaders to do everything they can to save lives and use any medical treatments available to stop suffering, deaths and lockdowns,” (sic) he tweeted. Earlier, the MP had compared UP to UK, saying that while UP with its population of 230 million had “smashed scary Delta variant” with Ivermectin, UK, with a population of 67 million, “rejected Ivermectin and worshipped the vaccine”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/oz-mp-asks-if-yogi-can-help-his-nation/articleshow/84361440.cms||---

The MVA had claimed the support of 41 elected members (of the 67) in the ZP. Rahul Patil of the Congress and NCP’s Jaywant Shimpi won the president and vice-president posts, respectively, unopposed. The local BJP leadership was planning to field the candidates by meeting with the leaders of local fronts that have the support of few, but important, elected members. However, after the Congress announced the candidature of Rahul Patil, the son of Congress MLA P N Patil, for the president’s post, several smaller fronts, such as MLA Prakash Awade-led front, extended vocal support to him. P N Patil was Congress district president for 20 years and during this tenure, he had developed good relations with other leaders of his party who are now with other parties. This personal bond forced the MVA leaders, including ministers Satej Patil and Hasan Mushrif, to concede to P N Patil’s demand. NCP, which was earlier adamant to get president’s post, had to settle on vice-president’s post. Shimpi is a close confidant of Mushrif. Shiv Sena, the smaller ally of the MVA in the ZP, will get the posts of chairman of various committees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/mva-candidates-bag-president-vp-posts-of-kolhapur-zp-unopposed/articleshow/84362812.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Vax scammers may have given smaller doses to conserve vials||MUMBAI: Fake vaccine scam accused might have been worried about falling short of vials, police suspect. Students of a placement institute roped in to administer the jabs have now told the police they were instructed to give 0.3ml shots to people at two camps in Borivali, instead of 0.5ml universally given. These students from KCEP Group, a placement institute run by the key accused Dr Manish Tripathi, were instructed that administering jabs was part of their “practical training”. Police probe has reportedly established that Tripathi was procuring used vaccine vials and refilling them with saline water to be administered at the fraudulent camps. More than 4,000 people across Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai were given shots as part of the scam. Twelve FIRs have been registered and 14 people held. A student from KCEP Group, Karim Ali, has been arrested while two more, Roshni Patel and Ajit Benwasi, have been booked but not held yet. None of them have medical qualifications. They were allegedly promised better grades by Tripathi if they participated in the fake vaccination camps. “Between March 5 and April 28, Charkop-based Shivam Hospital was a designated private Covid vaccination centre (PCVC). We believe that some vaccine vials were not discarded by them after use. Tripathi and the hospital’s administrator, Rahul Dube (also arrested), procured used vials and saline water bottles from the hospital,” said an investigator. “We have now written to the BMC F-South Ward office to find out how many vials were allotted to Shivam Hospital when it functioned as a PCVC, who collected these vials on behalf of the hospital, and details about the login ID and password of the hospital,” he added The accused communicated with each other via WhatsApp and emails. Police will get their mobile phones examined by forensic experts. Borivali police have searched KCEP Group’s premises and recorded the statement of their business head, Amita Walavalkar. One of the accused, Chandan S, told police he got involved in the scam at the behest of Mahendra Singh, the alleged mastermind of the scam. “Chandan was an old acquaintance of Singh. He got hold of the login ID and password of Nanavati Hospital and entered the data of beneficiaries to generate vaccination certificates. Chandan’s associate, Nitin Mode, similarly got hold of the login ID and password of Lifeline,” said an officer. The certificates, though, bore incorrect dates, timings and camp locations which brought the scam to light.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vax-scammers-may-have-given-smaller-doses-to-conserve-vials/articleshow/84355653.cms||---
---||Jaipur||After Delta, five test positive for Kappa variant in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: Another double mutation Covid-19 variant, apart from Delta, has been found in Rajasthan. Five persons tested positive for the Kappa variant in the state. They were infected during the second wave. The Kappa variant is still not a variant of concern, but it is a variant of interest. Since the second wave was dominated by Delta variant and five covid-19 patients infected with it during April and May, the health department is now alert. SMS medical college confirmed that five cases of Covid-19 tested positive for Kappa variant. However, they denied any link of the cases to the state. “We have reported cases of Kappa variant but all of them belonged to other states. Rajasthan has not reported any case of Kappa variant, all the cases were from outside,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, SMS medical college, Jaipur. SMS medical college has been sending samples for genome sequencing to labs in Delhi and at National Institute of Virology, Pune since January. The state had recently received reports of genome sequencing. Out of the 174 samples, as many as 166 samples tested positive for the Delta variant collected from the state in April and May, and five were Kappa variant, also known as the B.1.617.1, which is a double mutant variation as it has the E484Q and the L453R mutations. “Apart from that, Rajasthan had already reported one Delta plus variant, while no Lambda variant case has been reported in the state so far,” said a senior health department official. Health department officials said that the genome sequencing reports they have been receiving show majority of the samples tested positive for Delta variant. However, only one Delta plus case has been found, which is from Bikaner. The health department’s teams continued camping in the area for over a week in Bikaner, from where the first case of Delta plus was reported. More than 500 samples were taken from the area but all of them tested negative for Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/after-delta-5-test-positive-for-kappa-variant-in-state/articleshow/84359401.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

Out of the 33 districts, 20 have reported decrease in institutional deliveries over the last 12 months. In Jaipur, institutional deliveries have gone down drastically by 15% in a year.

Jaipur’s Zanana hospital and mahila chikitsalaya have also reported reduction in deliveries. “In comparison to 2019-20, fewer pregnant women turned up for deliveries.

---||Pune||Elevated stretch on Shivane-Kharadi river road||Pune: The riverside road from Shivane to Kharadi, 17km long and 24m wide, proposed in the 1987 Development Plan but stuck for decades in land acquisition problems, may get going. The Pune Municipal Corporation is now looking at an elevated road. The civic administration will put out a detailed project report for the elevated route. The instructions to draft the report were given after a meeting with guardian minister Ajit Pawar. “A section of 2.1km is in the blue line and the option of building an elevated road here is being explored,” V G Kulkarni, head of the PMC’s road department, said. Civic officials said work on a 3.31km stretch had not even started as it was mired in land acquisition issues. The PMC will have to spend Rs 290 crore to acquire these parcels. Around 65,000 sqm of land is to be acquired. The blue line indicates a once in 25 years potential flood threat along any river’s banks. Kulkarni said the road need all environmental clearances, and guidelines by the court and other authorities will have to be followed. “We have discussed the possibility of this elevated road. An option of building it on a ‘single pillar’ set up can be explored,” Hadapsar MLA Chetan Tupe said. Before work begins, a feasibility report will be carried out and guidance from the National Green Tribunal will be sought, he added. Civic officials said the road will be a vital link between the Mumbai-Bengaluru and Pune-Ahmednagar highways. It will also work as an alternative to Karve Road and will reduce the load on Sinhagad Road. Environmentalists have opposed this road for long stating that any construction is harmful to the Mula Mutha river. Recently, the Bombay high court directed the Pune Municipal Corporation and the state government to remove debris from the Metro work sites on riverbed. Activists Sarang Yadwadkar, Arnavaz Aga and Arti Kirloskar had alleged that debris was being dumped on the riverbed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/elevated-stretch-on-shivane-kharadi-river-road/articleshow/84359379.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: Canacona fishermen upset over fuel prices, demand subsidy hike||POINGUINIM: Already reeling under a lean last season due to the lockdown, and with just three weeks left for the new fishing season to begin, fishermen in Canacona have a new worry, rising fuel prices. With fishermen claiming to have incurred losses running into lakhs of rupees last season, president of the Akhil Goa Kashtraiya Pagui Samaj, Ashok Dhuri, told TOI that in light of the steep hike in petrol and diesel prices, the government should increase the subsidy given to fishermen each season. The fishing community in Canacona taluka is interspersed across Polem, Galgibaga, Talpona, Rajbhag-Tarir, Patnem, Colomb, Palolem, Agonda, Matvem-Khola and Nuem. There are over 500 small and big motorised trawlers and fishing boats which go out into the sea. These are huge fuel guzzlers. Further, despite going into the deep sea, sometimes they return with a small catch, thus denting their profit margins. Rise in fuel prices affects operating time, frequency of fishing trips and the area covered during each trip, the fishermen said, adding that many fishing boats owners have stopped going into the sea altogether due to prohibitive fuel prices. This in turn, adversely affects consumers as lesser availability of fish leads to a price hike. “In such a situation, the government and fisheries department need to come to the aid of the Goan fishing community by providing diesel and petrol at a subsidised price,” Dhuri said, adding that if fuel prices continue to head north, fishing activities in the taluka could be severely hampered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/canacona-fishermen-upset-over-fuel-prices-demand-subsidy-hike/articleshow/84359455.cms||---

Launching the initiative on Monday, AKR Pannai (AKR farms) in Onbathu Karuppur village near Thiruppanandhal in the district gave away 5kg rice bags to 205 families on the first day. The family has planned to extend the incentive to 750 families having over 2,500 people in the 18+ years category in Onbathu Karuppur, Naganancheri and Srirangarajapuram. “There was a strong hesitation among the people in the three villages to take the vaccination despite the threat from disease. Only a negligible number of people had taken the vaccine. So we decided to take out the awareness about the vaccination to the mass and encouraged them to come forward,” said Radhika Santhanakrishnan, a member of the family, who lives in Chennai. On the first of the vaccination at a community hall constructed by the AKR family, in collaboration with the government in the village, 326 people took the jabs. The rice bags were given to those who got vaccinated on the production of a token issued by the family. “The drive will continue until all the eligible people get vaccinated,” said Radhika, who runs the NGO Pen Nalam in Chennai. The family also released a short film on the importance of taking the vaccine and dispelling rumours and wrong notions that prevented people from taking up the vaccine. “A few days before the launch of the programme, we aired the short film on the local cable television channels. The effort elicited a great response from the people,” said Radhika.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/in-this-village-rice-bags-given-as-incentive-to-take-the-jab/articleshow/84361453.cms||Gokul Rajendran
---||Mumbai||FRA plans grievance redressal to check arbitrary fee hikes||MUMBAI: Students from private and unaided professional colleges may soon be able to lodge their complaint against arbitrary fee collection on Fee Regulating Authority’s (FRA) grievance portal and also get faster relief. The FRA is planning to have a grievance redressal mechanism soon for students on fee-related issues. In a meeting held last week, the decision to set up a sub-committee was taken to ensure the fees fixed by the authority is followed and at the same time infrastructural facilities are not compromised on. The new FRA body is also planning to revisit existing norms and bring in changes, if any, wherever required. While the FRA regulates fees in private, unaided professional colleges, in many cases students are overcharged under various heads that are in violation of the norms. “The committee will devise a mechanism for disposal of these grievances,” said an FRA member. “We will also be looking at creating more awareness among stakeholders about the functioning of the FRA. Many students are unaware that FRA regulates fees in private professional colleges. The idea is to make the authority accessible to students. There will also be a mechanism in place to see how grievances received by the FRA can be disposed of,” said advocate Dharmendra Mishra, an FRA member. He said that feedback will be taken from all stakeholders. “We will have to ensure that students are not forced to pay arbitrary fee hikes, and at the same time infrastructure is also maintained and there is more accountability,” he added. The portal will make it convenient for students to write to the FRA, he said. The focus is to create a system which will balance both institutions’ and students’ needs. Sub-committees have also been formed to revisit the existing norms, if needed. “The committee will study all the details that are sought from colleges when they apply for a fee revision. Wherever there is a need for more, they may add some rules, some norms can be removed, if they are redundant,” said a member. The authority is planning to see if colleges can be physically inspected too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fra-plans-grievance-redressal-to-check-arbitrary-fee-hikes/articleshow/84359419.cms||Yogita Rao

Some associations, though, are going ahead with the programmes while a few have put them on hold. NGOs and housing societies are now planning to tie up with hospitals for vaccination. President of Hotel and Restaurants Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) Sudesh Poddar said it has stopped vaccination drives for the past 10 days. “We were doing off-site vaccination for a few weeks with our own set-up on our own sites. Now we are waiting for procurement of vaccines from the state,” he said. HRAEI has, so far, vaccinated over 6,000 workers from restaurants, hotels and bars. On the other hand, for NGOs, clubs and housing societies, all Covid vaccination drives are being routed through hospitals — both private and government. “Currently, we are organizing a vaccination camp for fringe residents in the Sunderbans. But we have tied up with the state, which is providing the vaccines, doctors and nurses, and is also updating the database of recipients. We are only facilitating the drive,” said a volunteer of O2Ku Shawbar, a voluntary organization. Multiple housing complexes where second-dose drives are underway are also tying up with hospitals.  “We will have a vaccination programme in our complex this weekend and have tied up with a private hospital. After the horror with fake camps, we believe in going through the right channel and depending on reliable hospitals,” said Deepak Agarwal, secretary of Diamond City West residents’ association. Some associations, like Confederation of West Bengal Trade Associations (CWBTA) and Indian Leather Product Association (ILPA), are going ahead with off-site camps. CWBTA president Sushil Poddar said it has permission from KMC for the drive. “We have undertaken 110 camps and 40,000 vaccinations so far. We are doing a lot of it for free,” he said. ILPA president J Gulati said it is organizing camps at Bantala leather complex. “We hope that from next week it will gather momentum as more vaccines arrive,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fake-camp-hits-off-site-drives-organisers-bank-on-tie-up-with-state-private-hosps/articleshow/84356961.cms||Udit Prasanna Mukherji

Meanwhile, district differently-abled welfare officer has said they are collating details about PwDs in the district. “The district administration has assured to provide adequate vaccine for the doorstep vaccination. We are surveying the interested PwD population,” R Ravichandran, district differently-abled welfare officer said. The absence of coordination between departments including Trichy Corporation, health department and differently-abled welfare department has resulted in delay in identifying PwD population interested to take the jab at the doorstep. There are also PwDs who are unaware of doorstep vaccination option. “There is no provision for enquiring or placing a request for doorstep vaccination. Paralysed people are finding it difficult to travel to the vaccination centres. A helpline to enquire the availability of vaccine for PwD will be of great help,” G Suvasini, a family member of a PwD in Trichy said. There are also people with disabilities waiting for the second dose of the vaccine for over two weeks now. Owing to the rush at vaccination centres, PwDs miss their second dose as there are long queue right from early hours and they are unable to wait in the crowd. “Both of my parents are aged and they cannot take me to a camp. All of us are immunocompromised,” a PwD waiting for the second dose said. While Trichy Corporation has vaccinated over 250 PwDs in the city so far, the district has vaccinated around 3,000 PwDs. Several of the disabled population still seek help for getting vaccinated at the doorstep but there is no dedicated helpline to contact for this, they say.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/pwds-seek-helpline-for-doorstep-vax/articleshow/84361463.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Service industry sectors bat for vaccinated staff to resume work||PUNE: Representatives in the service industry, such as tourism and shopping malls, have urged district and state authorities to allow the fullyvaccinated employees to work freely to kick-start the ailing sectors and increase employment levels. Due to new curbs imposed by the local administrations across Maharashtra on account of increasing positivity rates, sectors such as shopping malls, restaurants and tourism have once again closed doors or have had their operational hours reduced, putting thousands of jobs at risk again in sectors that have already borne the brunt of the pandemic’s economic effects.Industry representatives said that the lion’s share of their employees have now been fully vaccinated, while their businesses continue to remain shut. “We have made appeals multiple times to multiple authorities that employees who are fully vaccinated should be allowed to work freely in malls and cinemas. As of now, 90% of the staff across our industry have been fully vaccinated. There are vaccination camps still operating at malls, where the working staff are getting vaccinated. But malls are shut across Maharashtra,” said Mukesh Kumar, chairman, Shopping Centre Association of India. Other sectors like tourism or restaurants, which have been the “first to shut and last to open” due to the restrictions are in favour of employees, who have been fully vaccinated, to resume work on the ground that it will encourage others to get themselves vaccinated. “Employees in sectors like tourism, malls, and restaurants should be allowed to work more freely if they have received both shots, with the caveat that the concerned premises should follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. Malls are careful in ensuring capacity and vaccination of their employees. Restaurants should be allowed to operate for longer hours, but with capacity restrictions. This will encourage more people to get vaccinated and resume work,” said Prashant Girbane, director-general, Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture. Experts in others sectors also echoed similar sentiment. Tourism, which is one of the largest employment generators across India, has been hit badly due to the pandemic. “Maharashtra still has the RTPCR test requirement for entries into the state, but that control is only at the airport, and not at the railway station. Ir should be done away with for fully-vaccinated travellers, and we should also expedite overall vaccination,” said Deepak Garg, chairman, Pune zonal council, Confederation of Indian Industry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/service-industry-sectors-bat-for-vaccinated-staff-to-resume-work/articleshow/84359388.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

Altogether 11 of his buses were seized by representatives of a non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) last year after he failed to pay the monthly installments as schools shut down due to the pandemic. “Now, they are after 48 more buses, which I had bought last year before the pandemic. I am being threatened with legal actions and I am stressed. They send their strongmen who speak roughly and threaten me with dire consequences. How can we pay when there is no business for one-and-a-half year? I have been in this business for the past 14 years and have never missed out on payment,” he said. More than 120 transporters, most of them bus owners, visited the offices of five nonbanking financial companies on Monday, requesting them not to use force to recover loans and confiscate buses. Kiran Desai, transporter and secretary of the Pune Bus Owners’ Association, told TOI that since last year more than 300 buses of the transporters have been confiscated. “If this continues, we will surrender the vehicles to the RTO offices,” Desai said. He added that the issue needs to be taken up seriously. “We have met the Pune collector and the divisional commissioner and appraised them of the issue, but no steps have been taken so far. We have given the NBFCs one week to take corrective steps,” Desai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/transporters-plea-to-not-take-away-buses/articleshow/84359406.cms||Joy Sengupta

The retailers’ body said that shopkeepers in different areas faced action on Sunday, despite essential shops and grocery stores being allowed to operate on weekends till 4pm. “We received inputs from retailers from areas like Kondhwa, BT Kawde Road, Aundh and Mundhwa about action taken. We have approached the authorities in this regard. Shopkeepers who have been following the 4pm deadline on all days will continue to do so,” Sachin Nivangune of the retailers’ association said on Monday. He said that such actions may lead to confusion among traders, hence the association is attempting to establish better coordination with the administration and the police. “Our association members on Monday approached the local police stations. We also discussed the matter with mayor Muralidhar Mohol who has assured us that no unnecessary action will be initiated against shopkeepers,” Nivangune said. A PMC official said that teams have been formed at the ward offices to conduct regular checks in the markets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/retailers-slam-weekend-action-against-shops/articleshow/84359427.cms||---
---||Trichy||After a decade, Trichy Corporation initiates expansion plans||Trichy: As a preliminary move to address the long-pending demand of urban planners, Trichy Corporation has embarked on a study after a decade to add adjoining panchayats to its fold. The limited availability of land, which is concentrated in a few localities, has become a barrier for implementing infrastructure projects. The expansion plan will increase the land area and it will add to the growth of the public and private sectors, which are rallying on the connectivity of the city located in the central part of the state. After Trichy West MLA, K N Nehru, took charge as the minister of municipal administration, urban and water supply in the new government, the proposal to expand the corporation’s boundaries was revived. It is learnt that the authorities have identified 23 village panchayats in the northern, western and southwestern parts of the city. Panchayats such as Somarasampettai, Thayanur, Nachikurichy, Pitchandarkoil and Olaiyur will likely be amalgamated in the proposal. While Thuvakudi and Manachanallur are the nearest municipality and town panchayats, it is not clear whether the two major towns will be added to the corporation. The 23 village panchayats may add a 131sq.km area to the city. Officials said that not all the 23 panchayats may be included in the city’s jurisdiction. “Panchayats that qualify as per the norms set for the amalgamation will only be considered. The state government will disclose the extent of the area. We are at a preliminary phase,” an official source said. The 23 panchayats have an overall population of 2 lakh. As the development schemes from the Union government are devised based on a city’s population, adding the suburbs will help the local body avail more funds. From 146 sq.km in 2007, the area of Trichy city was expanded to 167 sq.km in 2011 after the amalgamation of a few panchayats in Thiruverumbur. Even then, the civic body’s land availability was restricted to Panjappur on Madurai NH. Trichy Corporation has an acute shortage of land even in Srirangam to initiate infrastructure projects. Defence and Railways hold significant land parcels in the city and suburbs. “Expansion plan should be shared with the local people concerned and suggestions should be sought from the public,” H Ghouse Baig, secretary, consumer protection council, Ponmalai branch, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/after-a-decade-trichy-corpn-initiates-expansion-plans/articleshow/84361472.cms||Deepak Karthik

The earning was higher by almost 54% compared to May, when Covid curbs were more stringent. However, officials said the rise in the state’s income is not solely because of higher tax collections after curbs were lifted. It’s also because GST payment deadlines for May were extended, leading to higher collections in June. In addition, the Centre released a tranche of GST compensation cess, although the bulk of it is still pending. “Since a share of the income came from the extension of GST payment deadlines, it’s still too early to interpret the rise in the state’s income as a sign of economic recovery,” said a senior official. The state faces a debt of over Rs 6 lakh crore for the year. In June, it had imposed a 40% cut in its expenditure to save Rs 52,000 crore in order to prepare for a possible third wave of the Covid pandemic. Till the end of June, the state had earned Rs 57,382 crore, which is 16% of its annual revenue target. However, expenditures outstrip revenue, resulting in borrowings of roughly Rs 12,000 crore, said officials. Tax collections have improved in June compared to May when Covid restrictions were at their peak. In June, the state collected taxes worth Rs 12,735 crore which are higher by Rs2,060 crore than the previous month. The taxes include stamp duty and registration fees from real estate transactions, excise collections from liquor sales and motor vehicle tax from the sale of vehicles. The state feels its financial position will improve if it receives the pending GST compensation dues from the central government, which now amount to Rs 30,351 crores. In the last fiscal , its dues had amounted to Rs 24,304 crore, and it finally received compensation worth Rs 4,112 crore from the Centre. In April-May this year, the dues increased by another Rs 9,130 crore. However, officials point out that the economic hit of the lockdown was not as severe this time since the manufacturing, agriculture and construction sectors were kept open. The state also feels that the migrant exodus was lower than last year mainly because the construction sector which employs a large number of migrants was kept open.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-at-rs-22985cr-states-earnings-in-june-highest-yet-this-fiscal/articleshow/84359452.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

With 41 lightning deaths in a single day being a highly unusual occurrence, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath expressed grief over the deaths. Maximum 14 deaths were reported from Prayagraj. “Families of people who died due to lightning strikes are given ex gratia relief of Rs 4 lakh each under the state disaster relief fund. Families of the deceased from Prayagraj were issued compensation on Monday evening itself while payment will be released to the remaining families at the earliest,” Relief Commissioner Ranvir Prasad said. The casualties include five each in Kanpur Dehat and Fatehpur, three each in Firozabad and Kaushambi, two each in Chitrakoot, Unnao, Hamirpur and Sonbhadra and one each in Mirzapur, Hardoi and Banda. At least 23 people were injured in lightning strikes in seven districts. “Those injured are being treated in government hospital free of cost,” Prasad said. Meanwhile, the department has also made changes in regulations for issuing compensation in cases of snake bites. Citing delays in medical reports after which compensation was released, Prasad said a primary post-mortem report would be the sufficient proof for release of compensation. “Earlier, the viscera of the victims was preserved and sent for medical analysis. This was a time-consuming process. It has been decided that after clearance from Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, compensation can be released on the basis of primary post-mortem report,” Prasad said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rs-4l-ex-gratia-for-kin-of-lightning-victims/articleshow/84361505.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: 3,800 prisoners released since May to decongest jails||NEW DELHI: To decongest jails in the city, authorities have released around 3,800 prisoners. The release of these prisoners began in the second week of May and 3,000 undertrials and 800 convicts have been released so far.  Currently, Tihar, Mandoli and Rohini prisons have no active cases of Covid-19. The prison authorities said that the number of prisoners had increased during the lockdown and as a preventive measure to keep the prison infection-free, the inmates have been released. Earlier, around 400 inmates and over 200 staff members had tested positive for Covid. Explaining the decongestion process, Sandeep Goel, DG Tihar, said, “This year, the release process started from the second week of May and approximately 3,800 inmates have been released. The vaccination drive is also going on to ensure that not just the staff, but even the prisoners are vaccinated. All precautions are being taken for those who are being arrested and sent to prisons and even those who return from parole are all isolated first before being sent to their respective prisons.” The current prison strength of inmates is around 16,000 and as on Monday, 7,578 inmates in all the three prisons have been vaccinated. In Tihar Jail, 1,230 inmates above the age of 45 (1,127 with first dose, 103 with second dose) and 3,339 inmates below 45 years had been vaccinated. Similarly, 132 inmates above 45 and 600 below 45 have been vaccinated at Rohini prisons while 483 prisoners above the age of 45 (302 first dose, 181 second dose) and 1,794 below 45 years have been vaccinated at Mandoli prisons. This decongestion process started last year when the pandemic hit the country. Since the prisons were overcrowded, inmates were released on interim bail and emergency parole. The process began by the end of March last year. Around 5,500 undertrials were released on interim bail while 1,184 convicts were released on emergency parole. Out of this, approximately 2,400 undertrials and around 90 convicts are yet to surrender. The prison authorities are also in touch with the police to ensure that those released during the pandemic last year are traced and returned to jails. Most of those who were released got involved with crime again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3800-released-since-may-to-decongest-jails/articleshow/84359457.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Citizens with big families fret over ‘high’ Covaxin price at private sites||PUNE: City resident Sanket Gaikwad (27) has for now put on hold the plan to vaccinate his family members on finding the price of Covaxin, his preferred choice of shot against Covid, too steep for him to afford. “I am currently not working and do not wish to get Covishield. It has been tough to get a slot for a free-of-cost Covaxin shot from the government centres. We have now decided to wait till its availability increases at the free-of-cost sites,” he told TOI. Garima Mishra, a city-based working professional, “It seemed impractical in the current circumstances, when most employers have significantly slashed their staffers’ salaries, to spend thousands of rupees on vaccination. This was one of the reasons why we ultimately decided to take Covishield.” Limited supplies in government vaccination sites are making it difficult for many citizens to get Covaxin for free of cost. CoWIN on Monday showed around 10 private sites in Pune district administering Covaxin, with the price per shot ranging from Rs 1,200-1,260 at three private inoculation facilities and Rs 1,410 at the rest. Gaikwad told TOI, “My mother on Sunday took a Covaxin shot at a private site for Rs 1,200. There were no slots available at any government site. We thus had to opt for a private centre, despite the high cost. Several in my family need a Covaxin shot. We have decided to wait till the vaccine is easily available at the centres administering the shots free of cost.” Prem Prakash, a Mumbai resident, said, “I cannot see any slots available at the government sites in Pune for Covaxin shots for a week. I have been searching for free sites for a friend, who has eight members in his family. All of them want Covaxin. But they cannot afford to spend Rs 19,000-Rs 22,000 for two doses in a month. I am on several Telegram groups disseminating information about slot availability. But these also show limited government sites offering Covaxin. Slots for free shots are already booked by the time I go to CoWIN.” Prakash said the friend’s family has been holding off vaccination as it would be a big burden for them to shell out so much of money on inoculation within a month. “People from the economically weaker background usually have joint families and cannot afford to spend thousands of rupees in a month on vaccination alone,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/citizens-with-big-families-fret-overhigh-covaxin-price-at-private-sites/articleshow/84359481.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cop caned ‘druggie’ as he misbehaved with her, says GRP||MUMBAI: After a video clip of a female police constable caning a man on his legs at Wadala railway station went viral, the GRP responded that he had consumed drugs and had misbehaved with her. The man, Akram Khan, 20, was booked under the Maharashtra Police Act and let off after a warning. The incident was reported on July 10, around 1pm. The female constable was patrolling at Sewri station when she noticed a man inside the general compartment of a local train drinking out of a bottle. Suspecting that he was consuming a banned substance, she asked him to stop and get out of the train. She also enquired if he was an essential commuter. “The man continued to down the liquid and just as the train started to move, he made lewd gestures at her,” said an officer. She called up the Wadala GRP chowky, gave the accused’s description and asked a constable to deboard him at Wadala station. She then got into the next train and reached Wadala station. “Khan showed no remorse and started boasting of his contacts in a human rights body,” said the officer. After caning him with a lathi, the female constable brought him to the Wadala GRP chowky where he was booked for a non-cognisable offence. Lawyers said the policewoman should have desisted from taking matters into her hands and should have pressed charges against him.

Seventeen shops and five chicken stalls in the fish section of the market were gutted in a fire that broke out in the early hours of March 14. Since then the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) has been unable to initiate work at the site. State Public Works Department (PWD) inspected the site and pegged the cost of repairs at Rs 2.5 crore, following instructions by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. However, the district administration told the PCB to pay half the cost of the work in the last meeting. Amit Kumar, PCB’s CEO, said, “Unless we pay or deposit Rs 1.25 crore with the district administration, we won’t be able to get financial assistance from them.” On June 30, the PCB had told the traders and vendors to pay their pending rents and dues within two weeks so the required money could be raised. Kumar said the traders have sought extra time to pay their rents. Some traders and vendors said it would be difficult for many to clear pending dues. “Some vendors couldn’t reopen their stores due to poor financial condition. The market was shut for almost two months so many couldn’t pay rents,” said Manzoor Shaikh, president of traders and vendors association of the Shivaji market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/renovation-of-shivaji-mkt-may-get-further-delayed/articleshow/84359449.cms||Sandip Dighe

Rajeev Sorte, president of Rashtriya Bahujan Mahasangh, said, “Since last three months Panhala has been kept closed for tourists and the small businesses depending on tourism are facing heavy losses. We had given a letter to the sub-divisional officer requesting him to open the Panhala fort premises, but no decision has been taken till now. Hence, we held this agitation to raise our voice. The administration should take a note of this and open Panhala for tourists by following all the rules and regulations.” Anil Patil, another protest who runs a small restaurant at Teen Darwaja, said, “We have to pay our EMIs, electricity bills and water bills. As Panhala has been kept closed since the last three months, people like me who are dependent on tourism sector are facing severe financial losses and are unable to carry our monthly expenses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/traders-demand-opening-of-panhala/articleshow/84362822.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: At 45, single-day Covid case tally at its lowest in over a year||NEW DELHI: The national capital on Monday recorded 45 Covid-19 cases — the lowest single-day rise in over a year— and three deaths, while the positivity rate stood at 0.08%. Officials in the state health department said 55,019 tests were conducted in the past 24 hours, of which 43,661 (79%) were RT-PCR. “The positivity rate continues to be low, which is a good sign. But there is no room for complacency. We are advising people to avoid visiting crowded places and wear a mask,” said an official. He added that the rate of vaccination also needed to go up to ensure maximum people were protected against severe illness in case there was a third wave. Delhi faced a brutal second wave that claimed many lives daily. The rapid rise in the number of cases led to a shortage of medical oxygen at various city hospitals. On April 20, the city had reported a record 28,395 cases. On April 22, the case positivity rate was 36.2%, the highest so far. At 448, the highest number of deaths was reported on May 3. Dr Shamsher Dwivedee, head of Covid taskforce at VIMHANS, said the key to prevent another crisis in the eventuality of a third wave would be to impose localised restrictions in places where there were new cases. “It is not possible to put the whole city or the country under lockdown. We need to do lockdowns at ward or district-levels to break the chain of transmission and, therefore, prevent sudden increase in cases that can overwhelm the healthcare infrastructure,” he added. Delhi has recorded 14,35,128 coronavirus cases since the pandemic started last year. Over 14.09 lakh patients have recovered so far. The death toll stands at 25,018, stated the data shared by the state government. On Sunday, Delhi recorded 53 cases with a positivity rate of 0.07% and three deaths. On Saturday, it saw 76 cases with a positivity rate of 0.19% and one death. On Friday, 81 cases and three deaths were recorded, while the positivity rate stood at 0.11%. As many as 244 people are under home isolation in Delhi, while the number of containment zones stands at 526, the bulletin said, adding that there are 693 active cases in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/at-45-single-day-case-tally-at-its-lowest-in-over-a-year/articleshow/84359504.cms||---

Shinde said that he has been looking for other sources of income to supplement his earnings. “I am unable to meet the monthly expenses due to the reduced income. Along with tailoring, I am now planning to run a small grocery shop,” Shinde shared. Prachi Shelar used to run a small home care unit for children but she had to shut it down. She has now turned into a home chef. “I was taking care of children at my crèche but during the Covid-19 restrictions it was shut down and now parents are still hesitant about sending their children to home care,”Shelar added. “I had to wind up the service and look for other options to generate income. The pandemic has changed the course for many people,” Shelar added. Like Shinde and Shelar, there are a number of citizens who have lost their livelihoods because of the Covid-19 pandemic and are looking for alternative sources of generating income. Before the pandemic, Aditya Soni ran a travel services business but, this summer, he was busy selling mangoes. “The vehicle rental services that I used to run was badly hit because of the Covid-19 restrictions. Even now, business is not back to normal.” “I had to look for alternatives to sustain my income. So, I started selling mangoes along with my friend this summer,” Soni added. Kiran Moghe, who has been working for domestic helps and the unorganised sector, said that the government should announce a compensation package of Rs 50,000 each so that people from the sector can start new businesses. “A number of people, who worked as domestic helps, have lost their jobs during the pandemic. These people do not have any strong financial support. “Moghe said. “The government needs to extend support to them. Also, there is a need to introduce employment guarantee scheme in urban areas for the unorganized sector,” Moghe added. Nitin Pawar, a coordinator of various organisations which work with labourers, said that the government should not ignore the unorganized sector, which has faced the maximum hardships during the Covid-19 pandemic. “The aid should reach beneficiaries. There is a need to provide financial assistance to the people in need,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/restrictions-push-small-entrepreneurs-to-look-for-alternative-income/articleshow/84359471.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: BJP leader Kirori Lal Meena demands inter-discom transfer policy for employees||JAIPUR: BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Kirori Lal Meena on Monday submitted a memorandum to the CMD of three discoms and demanded that a new policy for inter-discom transfer of employees should be framed. He also demanded that free power connection should be provided to the farmers in Rajasthan on similar lines as Punjab. He also demanded that, like Delhi, power supply should be made free in the state up to 300 units. “We met the CMD of the discoms (Dinesh Kumar) and submitted a memorandum. He assured us he will discuss the issues with the energy minister (B D Kalla) and get back to us,” said Meena. “In Maharashtra, there is only one discom. However, in Rajasthan there are three discoms. But, there is an issue with regard to inter-discom transfer of employees. So, we demanded that either the three discoms be converted into one or frame an inter-discom transfer policy for employees,” he said. He also said, “Fuel charges, electricity duty and other charges should be withdrawn from the tariff. Also, since 2012, around 3.87 lakh applications for new power connections are pending. I have demanded that this should be cleared at the earliest. Even as they are providing connections in tribal areas (tribal sub plan areas) on demand, the applicants in the rest of the 28 districts are deprived of power connection. Hence, the pendency should be cleared.” Meena also stated in the memorandum that VCRs (vigilance checking report) should be filled on the spot. “They don’t fill the VCRs on the spot and delay it for one week to 10 days. We have also demanded an investigation into declaring fake transmission and distribution (T&D) losses. Though in the state, there is 35% T&D loss, the state government shows only 18%. If they show reduced T&D loss, it will lead to further losses and the consumers will have to bear the burden of higher tariffs,” said Meena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-leader-demands-inter-discom-transfer-policy-for-employees/articleshow/84359464.cms||---

The ATS had on Sunday claimed to have busted a module of Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind, an auxiliary unit of Al-Qaeda, with the arrest of Minaz Ahmad and his associate Masiruddin. Their remand will begin from July 13 morning. The ATS sleuths had also claimed to have recovered an improvised explosive device (IED) in the form of a pressure cooker bomb and a 9mm countrymade pistol from the house of Minaz. Inspector general of police, ATS, GK Goswamy said during remand, the operatives would be quizzed about their association with Umar Halmandi, a listed Al-Qaeda operative based somewhere along the Pakistan/Afghanistan border, how they got in touch with him and the places they were planning to attack. “We will try to find out the duration of their association with terror groups, along with their travel history. We have written to emigration authorities to check the travel history of the duo to any foreign country. Details of their bank account have also been sought,” the IG said. Another officer privy to the probe said the mobiles of the two operatives would be scanned and their social media chats and exchanges would be decrypted. “An improvised explosive device (IED) in the form of a pressure cooker bomb was made in the house of Masiruddin. Some residues were recovered during searches while the duo had transferred the IED cooker to the house of Minaz and were planning to use it soon when the calls were intercepted and the ATS commandoes nabbed the duo,” said an official privy to the probe. ATS sleuths continued to hunt for the missing accomplice, Shakeel, in Kanpur and some districts near National Capital Region (NCR). Unconfirmed reports said an aide of Minaz and Masiruddin was picked up from Kanpur but there was no official confirmation about the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/qaeda-module-2-terror-accused-sent-to-14-day-police-custody/articleshow/84361542.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

---||Pune||Water from Bhama Askhed dam turns costly for Pune Municipal Corporation||PUNE: Drawing water from the Bhama Askhed dam is turning out to be a costly affair for the PMC with the irrigation department demanding additional charges from the civic body. The irrigation department has told the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to pay double the charge for the use of water on the ground that the civic body was drawing water from the dam more than the sanctioned quota. The contract between the irrigation department and the PMC had finalised a quota of 11.5 TMC of water for the latter. Additionally, 2.6 TMC of water is given to the civic areas from Bhama Askhed. The civic body will have to pay Rs3 crore per year, if the increased charges are to be paid. The rule states that no additional amount is charged if consumption is up to 115%. But if up to 140% water is drawn, then the charges are 1.5 times more. When the water usage goes beyond 140 %, then two times the amount is charged. As per the water supply rate, Rs 0.30 is charged for 1,000 litre of water. The charges go up to Rs0.60 if the use of water goes beyond 140% of the sanctioned quota. A PMC official said the civic administration has urged the irrigation department not to apply the rule for water supply to it. “The civic administration is getting its share of water from two sources — Khadkwasla and Bhama Askhed. Hence, the rule should not be applied. If the PMC had drawn water from one source, then the logic of paying more could have applied,” the official said. Aniruddha Pawaskar, head of the PMC’s water department, said, “The civic body has conveyed its stand to the irrigation department. We have not paid any additional amount as of now.” The irrigation department stated that the PMC was lifting water more than the stipulated quota and, hence, should be charged more.“Though the civic body is lifting water from different sources, the user is the same. The additional charges are, hence, valid,” read a statement issued by the irrigation department. Political leaders are also against charging this additional amount. They said the water quota should be based on the population and amount charged accordingly. “The civic administration is providing water to various areas. These areas have seen a rise in population. Water should be provided in proportion to the population. Demanding additional money is not correct,” said Sunil Tingre, who represents Wadgaonsheri in the Maharashtra Assembly. He said the PMC was yet to get the total quota of water from Bhama Askhed. “Around 60% of the water promised from it is currently being lifted,” Tingre said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/water-from-bhama-askhed-turns-costly-for-civic-body/articleshow/84359527.cms||Prasad Kulkarni
---||Jaipur||BJP leader demands inter-discom transfer policy for employees||Kota: Police’s response to complaints of gang war and personal rivalry apparently reflect their failure in handling such issues. The key accused (Hemant Rathore) in teen’s murder in Baran had approached the Sadar police station to file a report on Friday against the teen and his aides. Apparently, the victim had threated Rathore. However, police did not lodge a case and instead put it aside for investigation. Country-made pistols and revolvers are easily available at a low price in Baran and youths involved in criminal activities, belonging to various groups, easily get them. These weapons are then used to spread terror and panic among members of rival groups, a senior activist of Baran city told TOI. The activist also raised the issue of gang war in the community liaison group meeting on Sunday night and noted that encroachment, illegal occupation, extortion and supply of illegal arms and weapons are leading to increase in crimes. He alleged that the failure of local police in taking measures led to the teen’s murder on Saturday. SP Vineet Bansal said that this is the first incident of group rivalry and personal enmity since he joined. However, he will take action to check such incidents, he added. According to local sources Hemant Rathore who sold canvas sheets on road side was regularly facing threats to his life from the deceased (Azad) and his aides identified as Sameer, Golu Pathan, Mubrik Saha and Firoz Khan. On the day of the incident Azad and his aides were moving around Hemant’s stall for around 40-50 minutes and threatened him. Hemant reportedly called his family members and told them that ‘he would either kill someone or be killed’ and minutes later, he shot at Azad that killed him. However, an angry Hemant further hit Azad multiple times till his body became limp.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-leader-demands-inter-discom-transfer-policy-for-employees/articleshow/84359493.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Goa||Goa: One of world’s biggest insects, Atlas moth, spotted at Caranzol||KERI: The Atlas moth, endemic to South-East Asia, which attracts the attention of nature lovers due to its beauty and grandeur, was sighted recently in Caranzol, Sattari. This moth is considered to be one of the largest moth species in the world. In fact, the wing span of the female Atlas moth is nearly 10-12 inches across, wider than the human hand. During the monsoon, the village of Caranzol, situated amid the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary, comes alive with a variety of butterflies and moths. However, the Atlas moth is not easy to sight as it ventures out in the night. Interestingly, Vithoba Gawade spotted the moth seated on the twig of a tree in the day. “I got the opportunity to see this moth spreading it wings on leaves in daytime,” Gawade said On account of its big size and the snake tipped edges of its wings, the moth is known as the Atlas. Despite its large size, it has no mouth to eat from after emerging out of the cocoon. It makes use of fat that was retained during the caterpillar stage for survival. In fact, after spending about a month in a cocoon, Atlas moths do not live beyond a week. Ramesh Zarmekar, a wildlifer from Sacordam said, “During the daytime the moth rests, whereas at night it goes in search of a mate. The female releases pheromones which male can detect from far distances with the help of feathery antennae.” The caterpillar of the moth produces the brown wool-like silk that is considered very durable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/one-of-worlds-biggest-insects-atlas-moth-spotted-at-caranzol/articleshow/84359540.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar
---||Delhi||Covid-wary: Ramlila for and by only fully vaccinated this year in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Luv Kush Ramlila Committee has announced that only fully vaccinated people will be allowed to see the enactment physically from the mela ground in the Red Fort foreground. Last year, most of the major organisers were forced to suspend the Ramlila celebrations due to the rising number of Covid cases. All the participants and artistes will also need to show a certificate to prove that they are fully vaccinated, said members of the committee that ropes in celebrities and famous artistes in its annual event. Ashok Agarwal, head of the committee, said that the celebrations would be held from October 6 to 16 in the Red Fort ground. “Keeping the prevailing situation of Covid-19 in mind, it has been decided that people would be allowed to enter the venue only if they produce the double vaccination certificate. Preparations have already started for the event and our music director has finalised 40 songs that will be used in this year’s enactment,” Agarwal said. Arjun Kumar, general secretary of the committee, said that the artistes had been instructed to get vaccinated. “All the workers, artistes and helpers will have to submit the vaccination certificate to our office by October 2. Bollywood actors who are likely to participate in this year’s celebrations have also been informed regarding this,” he added. Agarwal said that this year’s enactment would witness scenes organised around 40 specially composed songs and devotional bhajans produced by bollywood singer Dharmendra and music director Shankar Sahney. “We are hopeful that religious festival celebrations will soon be allowed by the government.” Dalip Bindal from Indraprastha Ramlila Committee, which holds the event in East Delhi, said that they were also planning to make vaccinations mandatory for adults and artistes. “Since no vaccines have been approved for children so far, we can’t make it mandatory to have the vaccination certificate for everyone in the audience. It will also depend on vaccine availability in the coming months,” he added. Other Ramlila organisers are also gearing up for the annual festivities. Rahul Sharma from Nav Sri Dharmik Ramlila Committee said that a meeting of the committee would be called soon to discuss the plan of action for organising this year’s festival. For only the second time in almost 100 years, some of the major Ramlila committees did not organise the manchan in the city last year. The pandemic led to such a situation that most organisers found it impossible to make the preparations for the grand festivities. Almost every major committee had then pointed out that the government released the guidelines for festivals late.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-wary-ramlila-for-and-by-only-fully-vaccinated-this-year/articleshow/84359582.cms||Paras Singh
---||Pune||People selling gold to tide over pandemic crunch, say Maharashtra jewellers||PUNE: From meeting hospitalisation costs to paying school fees and shop rents, a growing number of people are selling their gold jewellery to tide over the economic crisis caused by the Covid pandemic. Sources in the state jewellers’ associations said there has been an uptick in the number of citizens resorting to encashing their gold assets. “This trend has been fuelled by mounting expenses, such as payment of online school fees, hospitalisation costs and house rents, in face of slashed salaries and job losses. The number of people selling off gold jewellery has doubled in the last few days in comparison to the pre-Covid period,” Fatehchand Ranka, president of the Maharashtra Rajya Saraf Suvarnakar Federation, told TOI on Monday. Ranka said not only people from economically weaker sections, but also those from the upper and middle classes were resorting to such measures. “Gold jewellery, such as wedding ornaments like mangalsutras, have also been sold by families to tide over the economic hardships,” he said. Kumar Jain, president of the India Bullion and Jewellers Association Limited, Mumbai, told TOI, “24-carat gold, which people may have had bought for around Rs 30,000 in the past, is now fetching around Rs 49,000 per 10 gram. Several business owners are selling family-owned ornaments to pay shops rents, electricity bills and staff salaries. It has been over a year since the pandemic began and financial crisis has only worsened, as the restrictions on businesses continue.” Jain said the trend has been more pronounced since the past three to four months with the Covid restrictions becoming more severe during the second wave of the pandemic in comparison to the end of the first wave. Shailesh Ranka, owner at Ranka Jewellers Private Limited, said, “More people are coming to sell off jewellery since a couple of weeks, especially those who have upcoming weddings and need cash to organise such events. The economic crisis caused by job losses and business shutdowns has worsened for many during the second wave and people have to still pay school fees, repay bank loans and ensure household expenses. Till last year, people had reserves. Many also took loans to meet bigger expenses. The reserves are now exhausted and and people do not want to go into further debts by availing more loans.” Jewellers in Mumbai are however not reporting an unusual rise in the number of people coming to pawn or sell their gold ornaments. Albeit the lockdown has caused hardship, citizens are ploughing into their meagre income and savings to make the ends meet or fulfil medical expenses. TOI spoke to large and small firms that offer cash for gold, and only one reported a marginal rise. Arjun Singhvi (Jain) of Mahavir Jewellers in Borivli’s local Zaveri Bazar said a few families have been arriving to sell chains, mangalsutras or bangles to pay medical bills. Representatives of Jugraj Kantilal and Chokshi Arvind, two major gold purchasers in Zaveri Bazar, said the situation in Mumbai was not dire enough to warrant people to sell the precious asset. Ketan Parekh of Chokshi Arvind Jewellers said, “Perhaps that is true of lower income groups or daily wagers who live a hand-to-mouth existence. But one cannot generalise that the middle class Mumbaikars are flocking to sell their jewellery. It is true that jobs have been lost and businesses are losing 20-50% of their income due to lockdown. But families have also automatically had to reduce expenditure. Since malls, theatres and restaurants are closed, their expenses have reduced. The work-from-home culture has reduced overhead costs.” In Bandra, Nilesh Soni of Thanks Gold! near Linking Road said the trend was next to negligible. He said, “I have clients who come to sell gold to buy property but not those that are facing a financial crisis. Maybe such sellers approach small, local goldsmiths.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/people-selling-gold-to-tide-over-pandemic-crunch-say-jewellers/articleshow/84359522.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Pune||PhD aspirants in Pune may get stuck without guides||PUNE: The failure to make changes in the software to enable assistant professors to apply for PhD guides positions as per the changes in the rules by the Savitribai Phule Pune University last month has deprived many of opportunities. Meanwhile, the university’s PhD application process for students started on Monday. The students who will apply now can only see the old list of approved guides and vacancies which means many may not apply if there are no vacancies in their fields of choice. Moreover, even if SPPU does change the software for applying for a guide, many professors will become guides but will not have any students to mentor for the following 1-2 years. The norms to get recognised as PhD guides had two rules among many others till 2015. Either the applicant should have completed three years after being awarded a PhD degree with a minimum 10 years of teaching research experience out of which a minimum of two years must be at post graduate level. Alternatively, the applicant having a degree at the time of appointment must have five years of teaching/ research experience out of which two years should be at postgraduate level. “In 2015, University Grants Commission changed the criteria and said that the applicant is eligible to apply directly for guideship if he or she has a PhD among other rules. They removed the three years/five-year norm which was then followed by the university’s academic council and a circular was issued by the then vice-chancellor W N Gade. However, in 2018, another circular on PhD guideship was issued which reverted to the old norms which were in conflict with what the UGC had prescribed for all colleges. This circular brought back the 3 or 5-year rule. This again prevented many eligible guides from applying for guideship and hence in effect many eligible students were denied admission,” said Ajay Darekar, president, Bharatiya Eligible Students-Teachers Association. In February, in a meeting organised by higher and technical education minister Uday Samant, Darekar and others raised their grievance after which the university decided to amend the eligibility criteria and issued a circular in June. “But the software has not been changed and whenever an assistant professor with a PhD tries to apply, the system does not accept his or her application. In the meantime, the PhD admission process has started and when students go to the portal, the old list is shown. There should be a note on the university website stating that the number of guides is expected to increase in various subjects ,” added Darekar. A senior university official said, “The university recently changed the rules and within a couple of days, it will change the process too. It is not true that anyone applying for a guideship will be granted the same as there is a big process of selection. That process requires about two to three months. The PhD entrance is slated in August and even after the results, it will take time to begin. I think students who are interested in doing a PhD will apply no matter how many seats are available. Also by the time they are selected after the entrance and the process starts, the list of new guides will also be available.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/phd-aspirants-may-get-stuck-without-guides/articleshow/84359576.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Pune||Pune: Yemul guruji tells family to torture woman, held||PUNE: The Chatushrungi police arrested a ‘godman’ in a domestic violence case on July 10. Police said a family, which runs a few businesses and a company in Aundh, tortured their daughter-in-law as per the directions given by the arrested man. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta said, “We arrested the suspect after the woman claimed that he had incited her husband and inlaws against her. The man had instilled fear into the family by saying that if the woman stayed in their house, it would bring bad luck to the family. The family would not make progress financially and politically. Following this, her husbands and in-laws tortured her.” A team headed by senior police inspector Rajkumar Waghchaure of Chatushrungi police station arrested Raghunath Rajaram Yemul (48), also known as Yemul guruji, of Baner on July 10. “He was produced before a city court, which remanded him in police custody till July 11,” Waghchaure said. Waghchaure said, “We produced him before the court on Monday and his police custody was extended till Monday”. Waghchaure said, “A married woman (27) from Aundh lodged a complaint of domestic violence against her husband and in-laws with the Chatushrungi police station last week. The woman had claimed that her family was torturing her after receiving the direction of a Yemul Guruji”. “The woman got married in January 2017. Following this, her in-laws visited Yemul with her birth details (patrika) to take advice from him. However, Yemul told them the woman would bring bad luck and she needed to be treated harshly. He suggested few methods to torture her. The family members tortured her mentally and physically so that the complainant would divorce her husband,” he said. Police had registered the case under the sections 498a (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 392 (Punishment for robbery), 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 325 (Punishment for voluntarily causing grievous hurt), 406 (Punishment for criminal breach of trust.), 420 (Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 120 (B) (Punishment of criminal conspiracy) and 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC. Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti has issued a statement saying that police should invoke provisions of The Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act, 2013, in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/yemul-guruji-tells-family-to-torture-woman-held/articleshow/84359534.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Hotel company FIR says private bank officials tweaked loan terms, cheated Rs 120 crore||MUMBAI: The director of a hotel group has lodged an FIR against some ICICI Bank officials and an asset reconstruction company (ARC), accusing them of cheating him of Rs 120 crore. The complainant told the police that the bank had sanctioned his loan application for Rs 351 crore. It then sanctioned Rs 25 crore as the first disbursement and took Rs 15.5 crore as processing fee and service tax. He got Rs 9.5 crore. Later disbursements stopped, but the bank continued charging interest. Vishal Sharma, 48, director of Hotel Horizon Pvt Ltd, has named several officials of the bank, the ARC firm and others. The FIR, filed at the BKC police station, has been transferred to the economic offences wing. Niket Kaushik, EOW chief, said: “Facts are being disputed by both parties. Our probe is on.” In 2011, Sharma sought the Rs 351-crore loan to build a luxury hotel in Juhu. “The complainant said the bank deducted Rs 15.5 crore from the first disbursement of Rs 25 crore in the first quarter and the remaining Rs 9.5 crore was deposited in the loan account in the second quarter,” said a police officer. Sharma told the police the bank declared the processing fee as profit in its audit report. “The complainant said he wanted Rs 65 crore as first disbursement. However, the bank’s management team gave false information that Rs 25 crore was needed for construction and approved it,” said an officer. Sharma has also alleged that some management committee members inserted false terms in a revised loan agreement and his company’s assets worth Rs 1,200 crore were mortgaged. Sharma paid interest for a year and stopped since he did not get the second disbursement in 2013. The bank declared the loan an NPA in 2016, said police. “The complainant told the police that members of the management team submitted a false proposal to the credit committee, saying his firm was ready to pay the full outstanding of Rs 47 crore. The bank sold the loan to an ARC. The complainant said a burden of Rs 120 crore (interest) has been placed on his mortgaged assets worth Rs 1,200 crore while they got only Rs 9.5 crore loan. He further alleged that the accused conspired to mislead the company by submitting false proposals to the credit committee without informing the company. We are probing,” said an officer. An ICICI Bank spokesperson said: “The company is a defaulter. The previous complaints by the company were rejected not only by the EOW, but also by the banking ombudsman. We will continue to co-operate with the investigating authority.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hotel-co-fir-says-pvt-bank-officials-tweaked-loan-terms-cheated-rs-120cr/articleshow/84359590.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Pune||Pune: Four nabbed on charge of murdering PMPML bus driver in Handewadi||PUNE: The crime branch of the Pune police crime on Monday arrested four out of five men on the charge of bludgeoning to death a PMPML bus driver from Phursungi with heavy stones in the bushes at an isolated spot in Handewadi on Sunday afternoon. “We have arrested autorickshaw drivers Hrishikesh Bargave (31) from Phursungi and Akshay Jadhav (21) from Bhekrainagar from a lodge at Omarga in Osmanabad district. We have also arrested their accomplices, Prajwal Jadhav (20) from Kalepadal and Tushar Jagtap (21) from Gadital, after digital evidence collected by the police established their involvement in the murder,” said senior inspector Ganesh Mane from crime branch (unit VI). Mane said, “The victim and Salunkhe were known to each other and there was an old dispute between them. On Sunday afternoon, Salunkhe and the suspects visited the isolated place for consuming liquor when a dispute broke between them over the previous dispute. The suspects in a fit of anger attacked Salunkhe and bludgeoned him to death with stones before taking to heels.” He said,“There are no CCTV cameras at the incident spot. While conducting a parallel investigation, we came across one of the footages capturing images of a few men alighting from the autorickshaws and Salunkhe prior to his murder. We then traced the vehicle numbers, established identity of the suspects and collected intelligence information about them. We conducted technical investigation and a police team led by assistant inspector Narendra Patil and policeman Nitin Mundhe and others took Bargave and Jadhav into custody from a lodge in Osmanabad and brought them to Pune. We then arrested Jadhav and Jagtap. They have admitted to their involvement in the murder.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/four-nabbed-on-charge-of-murdering-pmpml-bus-driver-in-handewadi/articleshow/84359601.cms||---

As many as 96 new cases were reported in the state in the past 24 hours. Sultanpur is another district of concern. Here, 20 new cases were reported on Sunday while five new cases were recorded on Monday. The two districts were recording cases in ones and twos over the past week. Reviewing the situation with Team-9, the CM expressed concern and dispatched a team of experts to find what is happening in the two districts. Health teams from the surveillance unit have reached Sitapur and Sultanpur to collect details. Samples of patients will also be sent for genome sequencing. Nodal officer Sitapur Dr PK Singh said, “The patients belong to three different areas. None of them has a travel history. Each of the 28 cases was asymptomatic. In fact, some of them were attendants of patients brought to the health facility. Strangely, they tested negative.” In Sultanpur, 25 cases have surfaced in two days. CMO Dr DK Tripathi said 10 of these 25 belong to the same family while others are scattered over five villages. “The source of infection in the family of 10 is a youth who returned from Kolhapur while the others belong to other villages. Containment and contact activities were carried out in all places,” he said. Meanwhile, 96 new cases were reported from 33 districts. Also 42 districts recorded zero cases. The new cases took the total to 17,07,446 of which 16,83,170 (or 98.6%) have recovered. The state recorded two Covid deaths taking the total loss of lives to 22,700. There are 1,576 active cases now with three districts having zero active cases and another three having more than 100 active cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/spl-teams-study-sitapur-sultanpurs-covid-surge/articleshow/84361612.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Thane||Maharashtra: Rs 8 crore Rolls Royce owner booked in Rs 35,000 electricity theft case||KALYAN: A Shiv Sena functionary-cum-developer from Kalyan, who recently bought a Rolls Royce worth Rs 8 crore, has been booked in a nearly Rs 35,000 power theft case. The FIR was registered against Sanjay Gaikwad by the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL) last week. Sources said that in March, a team, led by MSEDCL additional executive engineer Ashok Bundhe, inspected Gaikwad’s construction sites in Kolsewadi area in Kalyan (E) and found power was being pilfered. The MSEDCL immediately sent a bill for Rs 34,840 to Gaikwad and also imposed a penalty of Rs 15,000. When Gaikwad failed to pay up for three months, Bundhe filed a complaint at Mahatma Phule police station last week. MSEDCL spokesperson Vijaysingh Dudhbhate said after the police lodged the FIR last week, Gaikwad, on Monday, paid the full bill amount as well as the penalty. Dudhbhate further said that electricity theft attracts a maximum penalty of up to three years in prison or a fine, or both. Gaikwad, however, issued a statement claiming that the state power distribution company had filed a false complaint against him. “If I have stolen electricity, then why were my meters at the sites not removed?” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-rs-8cr-rolls-royce-owner-booked-in-rs-35000-electricity-theft-case/articleshow/84359634.cms||Pradeep Gupta

It also resulted in the accumulation of mud and rocks at the pool bed. Considering the risks, authorities have "banned" the entry of tourists near the pool since Sunday. Speaking to TOI, station officer Kempty, Naveen Chandra Jural said that owing to incessant rains since Saturday night the flow of water had increased significantly in the waterfall while the pool bed is filled with mud and rocks. “Due to the risks owing to high flow of water and debris, tourists are not being allowed to enter the pool,” Jural added.

---||Nagpur||Six english medium Nagpur municipal corporation schools from this session||NAGPUR: Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari on Monday announced to start English medium schools in six assembly constituencies from this academic session (2021-22). “The constituencies where the six state board-affiliated English medium schools will start functioning include Rani Durgawati Primary School (North Nagpur), Babhulvan Marathi Primary School (East), Swargiya Baburaoji Bobde Marathi Primary School (South-West), Rambhau Mhalgi Nagar Marathi Primary School (South Nagpur) and Swargiya Gopalrao Mothghare Hindi Upper Primary School (Central),” said the mayor. “In the current session, only three classes — KG-1, KG-2 and Standard 1 — will be in English medium and later one class will be added every year,” said education committee chairman Dilip Dive. Like Marathi, Hindi and Urdu schools, NMC will provide education free of cost in these schools besides providing textbooks, school uniforms, he said. “The NMC has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Akanksha Foundation to run six English medium schools from this academic session for 20 years,” said NMC education officer Preeti Mishrikotkar. The civic body will provide other basic amenities and spend Rs2.66 crore per annum. Each school would have a capacity to enrol 40 students and impart free education from KG-1 to Std X. “If we get good response, more sections will be added,” said Dive. At present, the NMC runs 101 primary and 29 secondary schools. Of these, only one school — Banatwala — is English medium. The total strength of students in these schools is around 18,000, and 952 teaching staff. Dive said the NMC has already approached central government to start CBSE-affiliated English medium classes in eight of its schools. The proposal is not yet cleared. But we are positive to start CBSE schools from next academic session (2022-23), he said. The foundation will incur around 30% expenses on salaries of teachers and employees, in the first year, 35% in second, 40% in the third year and 45% in fourth year. NMC administration will take care of school building, basic facilities, electricity, water bills, school building construction and maintenance, students’ uniform, books, nutritious food, safety and cleanliness expenses. The entire school management and administration will be under NMC, while teaching staff will be provided by the NGO and all will get salaries as per Sixth Pay Commission recommendation, said Dive. Meanwhile, the NMC has started counselling for students passing out of standard 10th and 12th for higher studies. The civic body, which has roped in an academic, is providing the service free of cost, said the mayor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/6-english-medium-nmc-schools-from-this-session/articleshow/84359648.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Mumbai||Serbian norms leave 200 desis stranded at airport||MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: A sudden seven-day quarantine imposed by Serbia for arrivals from India has left the travel plans of scores, including 15-year-old chess player Kabir Wadhawan from Delhi, in disarray. Over 200 Indians, a large majority of them students, were stranded at Belgrade airport on Sunday for hours till the Indian embassy came to their rescue. On Sunday night (in India), photos of the stranded Indians made their way to social media. “Help! There are 300-400 Indian students, citizens stuck with children at Belgrade airport. Everyone has connecting flights to somewhere but the police are asking for seven-day mandatory quarantine. We can’t, all are exhausted and hungry,” tweeted RealNick05. tnn Later, the embassy said 120 of the stranded Indians managed to leave by Lufthansa. “Indians travelling by other airlines will fly today or tomorrow (Monday-Tuesday). Embassy officials are in touch with airport authorities, airlines to ensure departure of all Indians,’’ it tweeted. In the past two months, Belgrade had turned into a popular transit halt for Indians going to countries like Canada, the US, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE that had banned direct entry of passengers from India, said Bhushan Kamble of Akbar travels. People travelling from India to Canada, for instance, would stay for three days in Belgrade, take an RT-PCR report as Canada doesn’t accept reports from Indian labs, and continue their journey, he said. Canada may partially relax restrictions on travel from India from July 21. However, the transit-in-Belgrade plan collapsed on Friday, after Serbia notified the seven-day mandatory quarantine. To be fair, all countries have been changing their quarantine rules and other travel requirements during the pandemic at short notice. But it meant hardship in already difficult times. Chandni Bhayani, a Canada-bound passenger, tweeted: “We are stuck in Germany now. They are not allowing us to board the flight to Serbia .” While the problem of the over 200 stuck at the airport has been resolved, those who have plans to travel via Belgrade in the immediate future are fretting. Budding chess player Kabir, who studies in a Delhi school, has his first match in Serbia on Saturday (July 17) and accordingly booked tickets to reach Belgrade with his father a day before on Friday (July 16). Now the quarantine means he misses a few matches. “I was invited to participate in four chess events in different Serbian cities between July 17 and August 12, 2021, and was very excited. Just a few days before I was scheduled to leave, fresh quarantine conditions have been imposed. Now, I fear missing at least the first event on July 17,” said Kabir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/serbian-norms-leave-200-desis-stranded-at-airport/articleshow/84361667.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Zilla parishad gears up to conduct tests on a mass scale in 110 ‘hotspot villages’||PUNE: The zilla parishad will conduct Covid-19 tests on a mass scale in 110 “hotspots villages” in 11 tehsils of the district on Tuesday and Wednesday. The zilla parishad (ZP) has also decided to conduct either RTPCR or rapid antigen test (RAT) of at least one person of a family in such villages. The district administration earmarks a village as a “hotspot village”, which has 10 or more active Covid cases. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer of the zilla parishad, told TOI, “We are expected to test about 22,000 people of the ‘hotspot villages’ in next two days. The aim is to identify the Covid patients at an early stage and provide them with necessary health assistance. The drive will help us containing spread of the virus in the district.” Prasad said the administration has minutely studied a trend of Covid cases of these villages reported over the past four weeks. “We have come across a consistency in positive cases in these villages. As a result, we have decided to go for testing at a mass scale,” he further said. “The testing inventory of the zilla parishad is currently under-utilised because the Covid cases in other villages have significantly declined. We have made avaliable adequate testing kits for the drive. About 700-800 health staffers, including doctors, have been roped in for the task,” he said. Health officials of the zilla parishad and Prasad held two online meetings with the sarpanch of these villages to formulate a srategy for the drive in the past five days. “During the meetings, we have made them understand our testing plans. We will not face any issue during the drive in the villages,” said Prasad. Rural Pune, which has a 7.3% Covid positivity rate for the past one month, is still in the Level 4 category of restrictions. Hotels, restaurants and eateries are not permitted to reopen dine-in facility. Essential and non-essential shops continue to operate with the restrictions. All tourists spots and temples in 13 tehsils and 14 municipal councils in the rural areas are closed for people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/zp-to-conduct-covid-tests-of-22kpeople-in-110-hotspot-villages/articleshow/84359664.cms||Sandip Dighe

Taking a significant step in this direction, the youth from a tribal village in Dahod has secured a seat in the Indian Institute of Technology, (IIT) Kharagpur. The 21-year-old already has a BTech in biotechnology from Navsari Agriculture University under his belt. He appeared for the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) and has got into the premier institute where he will pursue MTech in Agriculture Biotechnology. Like many tribal boys from a humble background, Baberiya studied till Class 8 in a government school and then joined a grant-in-aid school in his village. After clearing the Class X exam from this school, he took admission in the state-run Adarsh Nivasi Shala in Dahod. After Class XI exams in 2017, he got admission to Aspee Shakilam Biotechnology Institute in Surat, which is affiliated to Navsari Agriculture University. “My elder brother and some peers motivated me to study science,” he says. His elder brother Nitesh is pursuing a diploma in medical laboratory technology. Baberiya has three sisters, too. His parents would go to Ahmedabad to toil as masons and earn a living. “When I entered Class XI, I began helping them out whenever possible. I continued this till the first three years of my graduate course so that I could help contribute to the family income,” he said. Baberiya said that he stopped going to work only in the fourth year so that he could focus on his studies and prepare for GATE. “I did not take any classes or coaching for the exams and prepared on my own,” he said. After completing IIT, Baberiya plans to take a job through campus placements. “I might also explore the possibility of doing a doctorate and focus on research,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/mason-couples-son-turns-iit-dream-into-reality/articleshow/84357192.cms||Sachin Sharma

Under this, the state health department will attend to the medical, social and even emotional needs of the elderly persons especially if they belong to the ‘homeless’ or cancer inflicted or renal disease affected categories. Issuing relevant instructions in this regard on Monday, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said: “Ensuring safety, security and all-round welfare of the needy is our duty. Complete assistance must be provided to them through project Elderline.” Officials informed TOI that the health department will rely on the network of ASHA workers to collect information on the elderly in need especially those living in difficult to reach areas. “The ASHA workers will keep tab of their health condition and flag the health system about their specific needs. They will also support them in getting tests done and secure medicines for them,” an official statement said. The reach of the programme can be gauged from the fact that more than 10 lakh ASHA workers are working in the state. In addition to this, the CM instructed health department to strengthen services for the senior citizens. Project Elderline comes in addition to the existing service of a dedicated helpline for the elderly – 14,567 to address the concerns and grievances of the people aged above 60 years of age. The helpline also provided mental health and emotional support to distressed elderly amid the Covid-19 crisis. The CM has instructed officials to publicise the helpline for the elderly to ensure that anyone in need is able to call for help. In the days to come, the helpline will also add medicine delivery and ambulance service to elderly with special needs and high dependency. The CM also directed health officials to ensure adequate arrangements for proper healthcare and treatment of the people as ‘Aarogya Melas’ are not been organised due to the Covid-19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/project-elderline-for-senior-citizens-to-be-launched-soon/articleshow/84361663.cms||Shailvee Sharda

---||Nagpur||Pre-monsoon vaccination of livestock in limbo as vets on ‘non-cooperation’ stir in Maharashtra||NAGPUR: Veterinary paramedics, who have been on agitation for the last three months for their various demands, have stopped vaccination, online work and making monthly and annual reports in Maharashtra. Due to this, the pre-monsoon vaccination of livestock, goats and other animals — which is an annual ritual — has not started yet. Vaccination protects cattle and goats from many infectious diseases. The association of veterinary paramedics has made it clear that the practitioners will do only ‘artificial insemination’ from July 16 and no other job. As a result, cattle owners, especially from rural Maharashtra, might face major problems as the rainy season will bring many infectious diseases among cattle herds. Dr Pawan Bhagwat, treasurer of the state veterinary practitioners association, said, “Diploma/certificate holder veterinarians are agitating for their 11 demands for the last many months. As the government is not serious about our demands, we will now perform only the duties designated to us as per the provisions in Veterinary Council Act, 1984.” According to this act, diploma or certificate holder veterinarians are designated to do only artificial insemination. However, as more than 2,000 posts of livestock development officers and assistant commissioners have been vacant for many years, these practitioners handle all other works right from vaccination, report marking to online registration of animals. “Diseases like black quarter, haemorrhagic septicemia and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) can result in huge cattle fatalities if vaccination is not carried out. Our members visit remote villages and conduct this vaccination every year to save thousands of livestock, which is backbone of the rural economy. But the government is not serious about our demands,” said Dr Bhagwat, adding that the agitation would be intensified from July 16. There are more than 4,500 posts of livestock supervisor and assistant livestock development in the state and only 2,850 of them have competent officers appointed. All other posts are vacant and diploma/certificate holder veterinarians are doing their work. They also head many veterinary hospitals and clinics in rural area. Animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar is from Nagpur district and the veterinarians in Vidarbha have demanded his special attention. “We have submitted memorandums to the minister, chief minister and all officials. Now, we are helplessly stopping our work,” said a senior office-bearer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pre-monsoon-vaccination-of-livestock-in-limbo-as-vets-on-non-cooperation-stir/articleshow/84359675.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Ambergris, a waxy substance discharged by the sperm whale, is found floating in deep seas and is used in manufacturing perfume and certain aphrodisiacs. The sperm whale is a protected species as per the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, and keeping the ambergris or any other thing related to such endangered class is considered illegal, said forest officials. Gajendra Hire, deputy conservator of forests, Thane, said the Mumbai range staff of the Thane forest division was recently tipped of about two deals of ambergris to be conducted at different locations in the western suburbs on July 8 and 10. “We sent decoy customers and trapped the sellers. In the first raid, four people were arrested with 8kg of ambergris, and in the second raid, one man was arrested with 19kg,” said Hire. All five accused have been remanded in forest department custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-rs-26cr-whale-vomit-seized-in-2-separate-raids-five-held/articleshow/84359706.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Delhi||Delhi: To save time, cut Covid risk, NDMC to go online with healthcare facilities||NEW DELHI: To simplify the process of patients’ registration, visits, testing and pharmacy facilities at its hospitals, dispensaries and polyclinics, New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) plans to introduce the e-hospital concept by the month-end. The civic body is currently uploading registration details on software provided by National Informatics Centre to help patients access medical facilities conveniently. In later stages, the system will also have information about the type of testing, medicines, etc available at the hospitals and dispensaries. “The concept was planned thoroughly and implemented in sequence. To begin with, we will make the registration process online. Patients will need to register their appointment department-wise at the counter of hospitals, dispensaries and polyclinics. Later, this facility will be available on NDMC’s 311 app,” said a senior official. The official added, “This will save time and commuting cost as visitors will be able to take appointments from their home after registering on the app through their mobile number. They can confirm the hospital, polyclinic, department, date and timings they want to visit. There will be a limit on bookings for a department on a particular day. However, unlike private hospitals, we will not give the option of selecting doctors.” After completing the registration exercise, the next step for NDMC would be uploading patients’ details/prescription on the software. This would be followed by uploading details of laboratories and pharmacies. “When all background details of patients are online, we will persuade doctors to issue e-prescriptions. This will do away with the need to carry a hard copy of the doctor’s prescription on each visit. Also, doctors will be easily able to refer to the case history and prescriptions given by their colleagues,” said the official. Two hospitals — Charak Palika and Palika Maternity Hospital — are currently providing a number of testing facilities at very nominal rates. “We will upload the details of these tests, rates and availability on a particular day on the website and app. When the patients avail of the facility based on the doctor’s prescription, the test results will automatically be attached to their account. Patients can check the test results after logging into their password-protected account,” the official said. “Similarly, when certain medicines are prescribed by doctors, the details will go to the pharmacy and, accordingly, patients can check their availability. In fact, by the time a patient reaches the pharmacy counter, he will be already in queue and need not wait for long to get the medicines,” the official further stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/to-save-time-cut-covid-risk-ndmc-to-go-online-with-healthcare-facilities/articleshow/84359711.cms||Vibha Sharma

Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday announced 300 units of free electricity for each household in a month if voted to power in Uttarakhand. The ruling BJP a few days ago announced 100 units of free power and thereafter 50% discount on consumption between 101 and 200 units. The Congress, too, has not been far behind, with former CM Harish Rawat on Sunday announcing 100 units free electricity for the first year if voted to power and, thereafter, 200 free units from the second year. Kejriwal, in his first visit to Dehradun since AAP announced its willingness to contest all 70 assembly seats, has also promised free power to farmers for agri purposes and waiving off of pending power bills. The issue started when newly-appointed power minister Harak Singh Rawat promised to provide 100 units of free power supply to domestic consumers last week. Meanwhile, reacting to the announcements made by Kejriwal, Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami said, “We are already giving 24x7 electricity to people at low rates. In future also, we will take any decision keeping in mind public interest." "He (Kejriwal) may have an agenda for election, but for BJP, the focus was always on working for the people. We are not working for any polls and our agenda is development of people and the state,” Dhami had earlier said. Congress also took a swipe at both BJP and AAP for promising free electricity. Congress state vice-president Suryakant Dhasmana told TOI, "AAP is promising freebies keeping in mind the 2022 election. Irony is that BJP at the end of its term is also promising to provide free electricity upto 100 units, while it did not do anything for four years."

The formal handover is likely to take place in the next few days. “The MMB will hand over the Carter Road promenade to the BMC so that it can be maintained as it is one of Mumbai’s most popular open spaces. The MMB and BMC have agreed as to how they will share revenue,” said Aslam Shaikh, minister for ports and fisheries, which controls the MMB. TimesViewThe Carter Road promenade, which was being maintained by a local citizens’ association till last year, was in danger of falling into disarray due to lack of initiative by the BMC and Maharashtra Maritime Board. That both these authorities have resolved the differences between them is welcome. The BMC must appoint a dedicated full-time agency to maintain the promenade and also ensure it remains encroachment free.After nearly two decades of maintaining the promenade, the Bandra West Residents’ Association (BWRA) surrendered it to the MMB, which owns the land, as its agreement expired in June 2020. Since then there has been no full-time agency for its upkeep. While the BMC was carrying out sweeping of the area, the security guards, gardeners and civil works contractors deployed by the residents’ association were withdrawn. Officials said there was a tussle over revenue-sharing from the sea-facing promenade between the BMC and MMB because of which there was a delay on deciding which agency would maintain it. Local Congress corporator Asif Zakaria then took up the issue and a joint meeting was called between Shaikh and environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray, along with BMC and MMB officials. “This is a welcome move. The entire space must be spruced up. There can be revenue generation, but the sanctity and character of the space must remain untouched. The MMB must formally hand over the place to the BMC and there must be no delays due to red tape,” Zakaria said. Patrica Nath, president of BWRA, said, “The formal handover must happen soon so that the promenade doesn’t suffer...The promenade is not in a good shape now and the maintenance is no nowhere close to when the BWRA was maintaining it. Responsibility must be fixed and this can’t become no man’s land.” The BWRA, which was chaired by late Darryl D’Monte and late trustee Roshan Dabhoiwala, was a citizens’ initiative since its inception in 2002 till last month. The 1.2 km Carter Road promenade was designed by urban planner PK Das using funds of former MP -actor Shabana Azmi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mmb-to-hand-over-carter-rd-promenade-to-bmc-for-upkeep-residents-welcome-move/articleshow/84359723.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Kochi||Kerala: Marthoma Paulose II, prelate of the poor, leaves enduring legacy||KOTTAYAM: Baselios Marthoma Paulose II, the supreme head of Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church of India, passed away at Parumala St Gregarios Medical Mission Hospital in Pathanamthitta early on Monday. He was 74. The Malankara metropolitan and Catholicos of the East breathed his last at the church-owned hospital at 2.35am. He was on ventilator support for the past several days following post-Covid complications. The senior priest had been suffering from lung cancer since December 2019 and had recovered from Covid in February this year. He will be laid to rest at the church headquarters at Devalokam on Tuesday. The mortal remains will be kept for public homage following the Covid protocol there from 8am. Marthoma Paulose II had stood for the cause of the poor and was instrumental in initiating several path-breaking changes in the church. He was anointed the eighth Catholicos of the East & Malankara Metropolitan in November 2010. PM Narendra Modi and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan were among those who paid tributes to him. "…He leaves behind a rich legacy of service and compassion. In this hour of grief, my thoughts are with the members of the Orthodox Church. RIP," the PM tweeted. A pillar of strength for the sufferingThe doors of the Catholicate palace in Devalokam here have always been open for the needy. Though Catholicos Baselios Marthoma Paulose II who resides here could not meet them all personally sometimes, he directed his office staff to attend to the needs of the suffering people who came to him. The majority of them were either in need of help for medical treatment, conducting marriages or for constructing houses. He ensured that they all returned happily. Born into an agricultural family, the catholicos easily understood the difficulties of the poor and needy. He was particular not to publicize the help he extended to those suffering. The catholicos came to know through media reports in 2018 about a unique friendship between two Class 7 students —Anugrah, with cerebral palsy, and his classmate Fathima — one a Hindu and the other a Muslim. Fathima took care of all the needs of Anugrah in school and was instrumental in bringing miraculous changes in the boy. The catholicos travelled to Kozhikode to bless them and hand over financial help to both. Scholarships of around Rs 70 lakh extended to around 600 students, jointly by the church and a charity organization, is proof of the care shown by the catholicos for needy students. Under his direction, the church with the help of a charity organization provided a fixed deposit of Rs 16 lakh for the hearing and speech impaired parents of Roji Roy, a nursing student who had jumped to her death from the tenth floor of a private hospital. On the 70th birthday of the catholicos, the church launched ‘Snehasparsam’ cancer care project. Around 100 financially-backward people benefit from this project every year. He also took the initiative to launch ‘Sahayahastham’, a project for dialysis and liver transplantation patients. The catholicos was also concerned about the environment. He directed to plant trees in all vacant land belonging to the church. He launched several projects to encourage farming and extended financial support for it. During his tenure the church introduced a monthly pension for widows among the church members. Recently, his initiative provided financial aid to families of those who died of Covid. The 11-year tenure of the catholicos was a period of crisis too for the church due to its dispute with the Jacobite faction and related legal issues. He was one of the church leaders who deeply wished to restore peace in the Malankara church. “We have a dream. We are one with the same faith and rituals. We need peace. We should be residing under one roof and worshipping God as a single body,” he had said about the dispute during his speech at the Catholicate centenary meeting at Marine Drive in Ernakulam on November 25, 2012. Based on the Supreme Court verdict on the church dispute, the catholicos earnestly wished that the Orthodox and Jacobite factions united. Though he had made a call for unity, it could not come to fruition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/a-pillar-of-strength-for-the-suffering/articleshow/84357276.cms||---

Ever since the probe was handed over to the premier investigating agency by the HC on October 17, 2016, there’s been hardly any progress in the murder. The HC bench has asked CBI to file a status report within two weeks. The senior citizen was shot five times by assailants when he was returning from a morning walk on September 6, 2016, at Lal Imli Chowk. The Tehsil police had registered a case of murder and formed as many as 15 squads to trace the assailants. In his 70s, the deceased allegedly had many disputes with builders and developers over property worth Rs200 crore, which is slated to be the main reason for his assassination. Eight shots had been fired at him, of which five bullets pierced his body, police said. After the police failed to find the culprits for a long time, his son and lawyer Anupam had approached the judiciary, demanding inquiry by CBI. His family members had also claimed the police had been pressurizing them to make confessions and were shoddy in their investigations. The petitioner questioned efficiency of cops to probe the murder, said other family members were under threat till the accused are not caught. He had even demanded police protection for his family members. However, even the CBI failed to make any headway in the killing and filed a closure report in the court in December last year. Then, in March this year, the city police claimed to have cracked the murder mystery and rounded up nine out of 14 accused, claiming it was a case of contract killing for Rs5 crore. According to them, it was carried out by an interstate gang that included a sharpshooter from Uttar Pradesh. A Kamptee-based don was said to be the mastermind. The police have handed over the accused to CBI along with a list of their accomplices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-seeks-status-report-from-cbi-in-nimgade-murder-case/articleshow/84359698.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Delhi||Delhi: Surprise visit by minister, DCW chief finds shelter to be ‘jail-like’||NEW DELHI: Several issues were noticed during a surprise inspection of a private shelter home in Kamla Nagar by women and child development minister Rajendra Pal Gautam and Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chairperson Swati Maliwal. The shelter home was found very congested, housing 78 children, and the rooms were very small and suffocating. The home was closed from all sides. The superintendent said that many of the children and staff had contracted Covid-19 and some had to be hospitalised too. During the inspection it was observed that even now Covid protocols were not being followed, as most of the children and staff were not wearing masks and social distancing was not being maintained. Though the shelter had coolers, they were not used during the day, forcing the children to sit in scorching heat. The rooms were also dirty and there were no sanitation staff, due to which the children were made to clean their own rooms. The home had no space for children to play outdoor games on the premises and they were not allowed to go out, forcing them to stay indoors all the time. Gautam and Maliwal both tasted the food prepared at the home and found it to be satisfactory. However, the kitchen was kept very dirty. Further, the staff manning the kitchen were not wearing masks, gloves or head gear — exposing the children to the risk of contracting Covid-19. It was also found that male staff had been employed in the kitchen. The minister told the home in-charge to immediately get female staff. It was also observed that the Home did not have enough computers and mobile phones to enable the children to attend their online classes. Gautam asked the WCD department to urgently ensure that the home was provided proper space to ensure a healthy life for the girls. He also sought an action taken report in the matter. Gautam stated, “We decided to conduct a joint surprise inspection of the private shelter home. When we reached the place, it seemed as if we had entered a jail complex.” Maliwal said, “The children living in these shelter homes need special care and love. We need to ensure that each child gets proper rehabilitation and is able to integrate to a normal life. We found several discrepancies at the shelter home.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/surprise-visit-by-minister-dcw-chief-finds-shelter-to-be-jail-like/articleshow/84359758.cms||---

The council of ministers had unanimously decided on October 29 last year that the 12 names sent to the governor had not incurred any disqualification as contemplated by Article 191 of the Constitution. The PIL questions the delay by Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari in clearing the 12 appointments as recommended by the state cabinet. The HC had, at an earlier hearing, directed that the secretary of the governor be made a party. The hearing will continue on Friday. It was submitted on behalf of the PIL Petitioner Ratan Soli Luth that the PIL seeks setting aside of the “inaction” of the Governor in failing to make nominations of the 12 MLCs to the Legislative Assembly of the State of Maharashtra pursuant to the advise of the Council of Ministers of the State submitted to him in November, 2020 and a declaration that the Governor is bound by the decision of the Council of Ministers for such nominations of MLCs under the Constitution For Luth, counsel Aspi Chinoy with Mukul Taly read from paragraphs 10 to 12 of the Affidavit of the Government which says that the Governor has no discretion in these matters. Chinoy also cited several judgments of the Apex Court to support his submissions. The governor has so far in “breach of his Constitutional obligation” till date not nominated these members said the PIL. It said that despite two reminders on March 1 and 2, 2021, Koshyari “failed to nominate the 12 persons” for the last six months. Luth’s counsel, Mukul Taly and Gaurav Srivastav, had said that by failing to act on such nomination, the legislative council as well as the citizens of Maharashtra are deprived of such nominated councillors who have special knowledge and practical experience in fields of literature, science, art, cooperative movement and social service. The secretary of Parliamentary affairs also said in the affidavit that “term of all 12 such Members, nominated earlier ended only on account of the efflux of time. Some of these positions out of 12 positions in the Legislative Council of Maharashtra are vacant since 6th June 2020 and the remaining since 15th June 2020.” “The session of the Assembly was going to be convened and the Legislative Council needed to have the benefit, at the earliest, of the special knowledge and/or the practical experience of those persons, from various fields…” it added that the Even the larger public interest requires that the citizenry benefits from the “healthy traditions” . The affidavit said, “power of the Governor to make these nominations does not fall in the category of the ‘discretionary powers’ “ but he has “to exercise this power of nomination strictly in accordance with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-governor-hasnt-acted-on-advice-of-council-of-mins-hc-told/articleshow/84359774.cms||Swati Deshpande

Known to attract the better foreigners to India, the Goan side has have recruited Guinean forward Sekou Sylla after keeping a close watch on him for two years. The 29-year-old last played for Yangon United in Myanmar. “We were following him for the last two years and were one the verge of signing him last season but couldn’t get the deal over the line. Churchill Brothers is always a club that recruits goal-scoring machines and we expect nothing short from Sylla,” Churchill Brothers CEO Valanka Alemao told TOI on Monday. Churchill assembled a formidable squad last season and were cruising in the first half of the league stages, but lost hold at the top after injury to Lebanese centre-back Hamza Kheir. After initially setting the stage on fire along with strike partner Luka Majcen, forward Clayvin Zuniga also suffered niggles and couldn’t be at his best in the final phase. Spanish coach Fernando Varela was on the cusp of glory until Churchill lost the title on the final day of the championship with Gokulam Kerala FC emerging champions. After their campaign in the I-League last season, all four foreign players, including midfielder and captain Bazie Armand, moved on to other clubs. “His (Sylla) stats speak for himself with 39 goals in 58 games for Yangon United. Twelve of those goals have come in AFC competitions. We are hoping for a good season,” said Valanka. Churchill have appointed Romanian Petre Gigiu as their coach for the season.

---||Patna||NDA ally Nitish Kumar opposes population control laws||PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday said mere framing law will not serve any purpose so far as the issue of population control is concerned. He stressed the need for proper education and awareness among women to achieve the objective. Talking to the media on the sidelines of his ‘janata ke darbar mein mukhyamantri’ programme, Nitish said he was not concerned about what other states were doing on this front. “My opinion is very clear on this point and it may differ from other states,” he added with reference to the draft bill prepared by the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh. He said what he was saying was based on the data collected after various research works and surveys conducted in that direction. He said during a survey, it was found that the birth rate in Bihar was less compared to the national average. The CM said Bihar’s birth rate was 1.6% compared to the national average at 1.7% in the case of women having education up to intermediate level. Earlier, the birth rate was 2%, both in the country as well as in Bihar in the case of women having education up to matriculation level. Nitish said there was a time when the state’s birth rate was above 4%. “It has been reduced to 3%. This is the result of the government's initiative in Bihar. I have firm belief the birth rate will start declining in the country by 2040,” he added. The CM, however, hastened to add that he didn’t mean the laws will not be helpful in population control. “What I mean to say is that education will prove to be a major tool in birth control. At the same time, it will impact all communities,” he asserted. Without taking the name of RJD chief Lalu Prasad, the CM said there have been instances when even educated people have many children. “These are exceptions,” he said. Referring to China, Nitish said the people of that country have adopted the policy of having two children only and that too is being looked into to control the birth rate. A day earlier, senior BJP leader and Union minister Giriraj Singh had stressed the need for population control. Giriraj had said Bihar should also make law in this direction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/only-framing-law-will-not-control-birth-rate-nitish/articleshow/84356330.cms||Ramashankar

The TRS leadership has been holding talks with the former minister for the past few weeks through minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao, who invited Ramana into the pink party. Initially the talks could not go ahead as the party did not assure him a ministerial berth, which he was insisting apart from MLC. Though the deal between party leadership and Ramana is unknown, Ramana met CM K Chandrasekhar Rao a couple of days ago. However, Ramana told the media earlier that he was joining the party ‘unconditionally’ and would serve to strengthen the party in the state, especially the erstwhile Karimnagar district. TRS roped in the former minister and president of Telangana TDP reportedly in view of the upcoming bye-election to Huzurabad assembly constituency. Ramana—belonging to the weavers’ community, a BC community—had earlier served as Kariminagar Lok Sabha MP. Huzurabad constituency also has a good number of BC voters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ramana-gets-on-trs-bandwagon/articleshow/84361792.cms||---

The Malankara metropolitan and the Catholicos of the East was under treatment at St Gregorios Medical Mission Hospital in Parumala, which is owned and controlled by the Orthodox Church. He was on ventilator for the past several days after developing breathing difficulties. According to the medical bulletin, the catholicos breathed his last at 2:35am. The catholicos was ailing from lung cancer since December, 2019 for which he was being treated at Parumala hospital. He recovered from Covid in February this year, but post-Covid lung complications worsened the health condition. The Catholicos will be laid to rest in a specially-made crypt adjacent to the chapel at the Catholicate palace in Devalokam here which is the headquarters of the Orthodox Church at 5pm on Tuesday. The mortal remains will be kept for public homage adhering to Covid protocol at the Catholicate palace from 8am. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in his condolence message said that he was always in the forefront to help the suffering people and also played an important role in elevating women to positions of leadership in the administration of the church. Born on August 30, 1946, at Mangad near Kunnamkulam, Thrissur, as the son of late Kollannur Iype and late Pulikkottil Kunjeetty, the boy K I Paul had his early education in local schools. After graduating from St Thomas College, Thrissur, Paul joined the Orthodox Theological Seminary, Kottayam, from where he obtained degrees from Serampore University. He obtained Masters in Sociology from CMS College, Kottayam. At the age of 36 years, the church parliament elected Fr K I Paul as bishop. On May 15, 1985, he was consecrated as bishop with the name Paulose Mar Milithios. Subsequently, he was elevated as the first metropolitan of the newly-formed Kunnamkulam diocese on August 1, 1985. The Malankara Syrian Christian Association held at Parumala on October 12, 2006, unanimously elected him as the catholicos-designate and the successor to the Malankara metropolitan. On November 1, 2010, following the abdication of his predecessor, Baselios Marthoma Didymus I, Milithios Metropolitan was enthroned as the catholicos of the East and Malankara metropolitan with the new name Baselios Marthoma Paulose II. He was the eighth catholicos of the East in Malankara. He has authored a few devotional and contemplative books in Malayalam. Meanwhile, the PRO of the church informed that the metropolitan, after falling sick, had issued orders on July 3 giving charges to senior metropolitan Kuriakose Mar Clemis to oversee and preside over the Malankara Syrian Christian Association meeting slated to be held in Parumala on October 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/catholicos-to-be-laid-to-rest-at-devalokam-today/articleshow/84357388.cms||---

Choubey was allegedly harassing a vehicle contractor by not releasing his payment despite his mentioning about the pandemic hardships. The contractor had a bill of around Rs 1.7 lakh pending towards car rental. Choubey was learnt to be repeatedly asking him to bring some or the other documents to delay the payment. It’s learnt that Choubey was initially demanding 10% of the payment for releasing it. The demand was negotiated down to Rs 10,000. The contractor had, in the meantime, approached the CBI which laid a trap. Searches were conducted at the office premises of Choubey, his official residential quarters near Bhole petrol pump and also at his native place in Beitul, Madhya Pradesh. He would be produced before the special court on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cbi-nabs-senior-rly-official-taking-graft-rs-10000/articleshow/84359837.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Local linkman helped JMB men with lodging||KOLKATA: The module of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh—the Bengaldesh terror outfit—which was busted by the Kolkata Police Special Task Force (STF) at a rented home in Haridevpur on Sunday, was suspected to have local “linkmen” who provided logistical support to the members, police said. This module might have been active for more than two months. The police suspicions were based on interrogations of the arrested accused— Naziur Rahaman Pavel (22) alias Joyram Byapari, Mikail Khan alias Sk Sabbir (30) and Rabiul Islam (22) — who claimed to have been in touch with Haridevpur resident Selim Munshi. He passed himself off as an umbrella and fruit trader and had kept changing his address, moving from one rented home to another, but never left Haridevpur for the past one-and-a-half decades. Munshi is missing. It was Munshi, who had arranged rooms for Pavel, Sabbir and Islam, whom he had introduced as his “friends from Murshidabad”, raising concern he might have ensured safe passage for other JMB extremists. One of the three were related to Munshi, police said. The probe revealed another “linkman”, Sk Shakeel, had promised to get Aadhaar cards for the three. Shakeel, too, has gone missing. “It is certain the three arrested men received help locally,” said an STF officer. “Each phone number noted down in a seized diary is being checked.” The Jihadi literature are mostly in Bengali, suggesting the activities were limited to Bengal. Though the arrested said they had been living there for 45 days, locals said at least Sabbir had been around for over eight months. “He claims to be here since June but many have seen him for longer,” claimed Jan Mohammad, a local. Sabbir was the social media expert, his primary job being recruitment and arranging funds. “He would always be online,” said an officer. Pavel was a relative of JMB ideologue Al-Amin, who, along with JMB commander Nahid Tasnim, was currently in Kashimpur jail in Bangladesh. Police said the accused came to Kolkata with two objectives: to raise funds and expand the organization. “Several JMB leaders are jailed in Bangladesh and the gang needs funds to release them. We are questioning the arrested to find if they were planning a strike,” said an officer. Bangladesh Counter Terrorism had said in April the main JMB had set up a robbery wing to raise funds. STF said it was grilling Pavel whether he had conducted a recce for a robbery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/local-linkman-helped-jmb-men-with-lodging/articleshow/84357393.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Hyderabad police in May filed two separate chargesheets against Chinese national Zhu Wei alias Lambo. Police kept Lambo behind bars ever since his arrest along with his company’s manager Nagaraju. Lambo used Nagaraju’s bank account to upload 30 financing apps on the play store. On Monday, Rachakonda police said they are yet to file a chargesheet against Chinese woman Liang Tian and HE Jian alias Mark. Both are out on conditional bail.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||ECI urged to permit service of new CEO in Kerala govt too||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In an unusual move, state government has requested the Election Commission of India (ECI) to allow IAS officer Sanjay Kaul to retain his existing portfolios in the government though he took over as the new chief electoral officer (CEO), the representative of ECI in Kerala. The government had submitted a list of two officers to ECI to choose the successor of Teeka Ram Meena who was repatriated to the government by ECI. Government had forwarded the names of secretary (finance expenditure) Sanjay Kaul and additional chief secretary (forests and wildlife) Rajesh Kumar Sinha. ECI chose Kaul, who was the additional CEO during the previous assembly elections and had played a significant role in conducting elections. However, in the order appointing Kaul as CEO, the government had said that he will continue to hold the posts of secretary (finance expenditure) and CMD of Kerala Finance Corporation, subject to ECI approval. Appointing an officer as CEO would mean that he is then on deputation to ECI, leaving the state cadre. However, in the case of Kaul, the state’s move, requesting him to retain his posts in the state government, is because of the extreme shortage of officers in the rank of secretary to hold all existing portfolios, it is learnt. In the past, former CEO Nalini Netto had played a similar, dual role, under another set of circumstances. Netto – who had put in 12 years of service as the CEO – had requested ECI to repatriate her to the home cadre, when the government wanted her back in service as the additional chief secretary (home and vigilance). ECI had asked her to continue as the CEO till a new CEO was found and appointed. The government had appointed her as ACS (home and vigilance) with the additional charge of CEO. She was subsequently replaced by EK Majhi as CEO. Kerala is short on officers, especially in the rank of secretary. IAS officers from the batches 1997 to 2003 are presently in the secretary grade, in which there are only 10 officers now. While there are only 10 secretary-ranking officers, there are only 12 officers in the ranks of principal secretary, who together are holding charges of portfolios that are more than thrice their total number. On an average, every officer with the rank of principal secretary or secretary grade is holding two to three additional charges in state. “It is under these circumstances that government has requested ECI to allow Kaul to retain his portfolios in the government. Though there is a conflict of interest with respect to holding twin duties, the government is hopeful that ECI will grant the state’s request as there are no elections in the near future,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/eci-urged-to-permit-service-of-new-ceo-in-state-govt-too/articleshow/84357492.cms||KP Saikiran

The list of equipment includes a face set with a full HD camera system (expected to cost Rs 69 lakh) and specialised drills (to cost about Rs 35 lakh). The equipment will be sent to the Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital (YCMH), where patients with the fungal infection are currently being treated. The PCMC's standing committee had approved the purchase last week. Rajendra Wabale, dean of the YCMH, said the civic hospital has so far operated on more than 100 mucormycosis patients. He said, “The first few surgeries were performed using available or demonstration equipment. With this purchase, treatment will get better.” Aniket Lathi, professor and head of the ENT department, said the equipment offers precision while operating on patients. The HD cameras will prove useful not only for mucormycosis patients, but for patients with other ENT problems as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-set-to-buy-devices-worth-rs-1-crore-to-treat-fungal-infection/articleshow/84359895.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Over 1 lakh immunised in day’s drive, but many return disappointed||MUMBAI: Over a lakh were vaccinated in the city on Monday with 304 public centres resuming the drive after a gap of three days. More than twice or thrice that number is estimated to have queued up outside the centres for a shot. Due to limited availability, many centres on Monday had kept merely 100 or 200 slots open, of which 50% were for online appointments and 50% for walk-ins. Within those categories, slots were further divided for first and second dose recipients. Many who lined up, some starting at 4am, were told to come back another day. In all, 1,06,904 took the shots of which 67,494 were at the BMC and state-run centres. Adarsh Shastri (52) reached the BKC jumbo centre in Bandra at 6am to find a crowd gathered to collect coupons. He had to return without one as the centre’s quota for the day was exhausted. He and his wife recently completed 84 days after the first dose and are trying to get the second shot of Covishield. A 69-year-old doctor said he and his brother couldn’t get a shot at ESIS Hospital, Worli. “We have made multiple attempts to book online slots but have been unsuccessful to get one for a second dose of Covaxin,” he said. Wadala resident Dr Kedar Chandak (68) and his wife Urmila (65) recalled their experience last week when they had to queue up outside Dadar Parsee Gymkhana for three days to get their second shots. Dr Kedar said he didn’t get a coupon on the first day despite reaching the centre at 7am or the second day when he joined the queue at 6am. He finally managed it on the third day after queuing at 5am. “There were people standing before me since 4am,” he said, adding that with online slots difficult to book, getting a second dose has become tough for senior citizens. Suresh Kakani, assistant municipal commissioner, said the corporation has been instructed to vaccinate using the 50:50 model (50% online and 50% walk-in). “If we want to increase walk-in slots, we also have to increase online slots, which we can’t due to limited availability of doses,” he said. In May, the civic body was vaccinating through walk-ins for the first three days of the week and through online appointments for the other three days. However, the Centre had told the BMC that it was against the vaccination rules. Kakani added that people should try their best to come with an online appointment. “They shouldn’t unnecessarily rush or wait if they don't get a token. Vaccines will be available in the near future and everyone will get it,” he said. A fresh batch of 35,000 doses of Covishield arrived on Monday. Prior to that, the city had 85,000 doses on Saturday. The state on Monday could vaccinate over 4.80lakh people against its capacity of 8-10lakh.  Overall, 3.70crore vaccines have been administered in Maharashtra, including 61lakh doses in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-over-1-lakh-immunised-in-days-drive-but-many-return-disappointed/articleshow/84359877.cms||Sumitra Debroy

He also Devendra Fadnavis announced compensation of Rs 2 lakh on behalf of BJP for the nearest kin of Thawkar. Fadnavis, who was also a home minister, said Thawkar was beaten for not wearing mask, which should have been penalized through a fine at the most, but certainly not by thrashing or arresting. “I would try to take up the issue of availing job to the nearest kin of the victim by speaking to the chief minister,” said Fadnavis. He also pointed out that there was a 14% increase in crime in Maharashtra, even during the lockdown period. The former CM said the city police should have suspended the erring cops even as state CID would continue the probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pardis-custodial-death-nothing-but-murder-fadnavis/articleshow/84359903.cms||---
---||Kolkata||A para that no longer trusts next-door tenants||Kolkata: Jagaroni Sangha D Block, a lower-middle class neighbourhood in Ward 122 sandwiched between Saroj Gupta Cancer Centre & Research Institute and the more urban Sodepur in Behala, has emerged as a hub for low-cost homes rented out to fruit sellers, umbrella makers and cobblers who arrive in the city from districts to earn a living. The innocuous pattern of their lives were suddenly shattered with the arrest of three suspected JMB members on Sunday. Unsure about the next-door tenant and wary of a potential terrorist lurking somewhere in the locality, residents felt background checks, which were rarely carried out in the neighbourhood, were a must before letting homes out. Sk Mintu, owner of the two rooms where the accused had put up, claimed to have known Selim Munshi, who repaired umbrellas and sold fruits, for close to one-and-a-half decades. When he approached him for a room for Mikail Khan alias Sk Sabbir, Mintu did not suspect anything amiss. “Sabbir moved in on June 15. Around July, Naziur Rahaman Pavel, who went around by the name of Jayram Byapari, and Rabiul Islam joined him. I asked Sabbir for an ID card, but he said he would arrange for his Adhaar card photocopy soon. But he never handed it to me,” said Mintu. While Sabbir claimed he was a fruit trader-cum-seller, the other two claimed to be umbrella makers. “I found nothing suspicious. They left in the morning and returned by 4.30pm. No outsider came to the house,” said Mintu. Neighbours Tapati Dey, a housewife, and Sk Jan Mohammad, a court clerk, said they had seen Pavel in the locality months before he moved in with Sabbir and Islam. “It’s a peaceful area and renting out rooms through word of mouth is common here. Sabbir had rented a room in a different area of this neighbourhood eight months ago but changed address. He claimed the place had waterlogging problems and frequent power-cuts,” said Jan Mohammad. The landlord of the old rented place said, “He left, citing waterlogging. It was good he left on his own or I would have asked him to leave as he was not submitting his documents.” Residents seemed most worried about people like, Munshi, who acted as the linkman between the locals and the three accused. He has now gone underground. “Munshi has been in the area for a long time. He managed to live in multiple houses without submitting any document,” said Mintu. Residents now want the local police to play a more proactive role. “We have learnt our lessons. Next time, no one can stay here without documents. But we want police to help us complete the background checks,” said Dey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/a-para-that-no-longer-trusts-next-door-tenants/articleshow/84357399.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Lucknow||Population policy not targeted at any community: Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has responded to the criticism that his government has formulated the Draft Population Policy 2021-30 keeping Muslims in mind by clarifying that there is “no intention to target any individual, caste or community”. “The problem is that those who are narrow-minded make statements according to what they think and talk about that only. The motive of the government is clear, that we have to move forward with our policies keeping in mind the welfare of 24 crore people,” Yogi told Times Now in an exclusive interview. Countering the criticism that his government was adopting politics of polarisation, Yogi said that this was not the first time that a state government was coming up with a population policy. ‘Aim of law is to bring prosperity to UP’He said the population bill, among other things, aimed to achieve sustainable goals by working towards poverty alleviation, education for all and health sector penetration. “The aim of this law is to bring prosperity to the residents of the state and ensure that resources reach everybody. But some netas who don't want to do anything want to see politics in everything,” he added. Yogi pointed out that it was the UN that had charted the sustainable goals programme in 2016. “And in UP vidhan mandal this issue was discussed for close to 36 hours. Based on the discussion we have proposed this policy. The bill aims to focus on areas that are facing problems of population control and proposes to spread awareness in such areas,” he said. The CM hailed BJP’s victory in the recent rural local body elections as a reflection of people’s faith in his government’s works and policies. “And these results are not an aberration. But what these local polls have established is the fact that from panchayat to Parliament, people have entrusted their faith in just one party -- the BJP,” he said. He denied that candidates in the recent polls were threatened or coerced. “The accusations have come from those parties who ensured open goondaraj during their rule and they are busy playing politics on Twitter,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/population-policy-not-targeted-at-any-community-yogi/articleshow/84361892.cms||---

Holding that Section 48-B of the Land Acquisition Act,1984, does not confer any right to the parties to claim reconveyance (transfer back) of the property which was acquired by the government, the court on Monday observed that the provision merely empowers the government to transfer the land, provided, the conditions specified in the said provision are fulfilled. The court made the observation while dismissing a petition filed by R Rajathi, who sought to reconvey the land which was acquired by the government from her father-in-law Balakrishnan. The government had acquired several land parcels including the 7.68 acres owned by Balakrishnan at Nagamangalam village in Trichy district for establishing a law college in 1982. The government had paid a compensation of Rs 37,405 to Balakrishnan for the land. Since the government decided to withdraw from the process of acquisition of lands in 1990, Balakrishnan submitted representations to the authorities seeking to reconvey the land back to him. Since the petitioner’s father-in-law and her husband Ravi Chandran died in 1991 and 1997 respectively, the petitioner sought the authorities to reconvey the land back in her favour and other legal heirs of Balakrishnan. The authorities in 2014 had rejected her application on the ground that the land was required for allotment of house site patta to people belonging to the backward community (BC) and most backward community (MBC). Challenging the order, the petitioner had filed the present petition in 2014. Justice N Anand Venkatesh observed that while dealing with the scope of Section 48-B, a division bench of this court had held that the question of transfer of land to the original landowner would arise only in case, the government is satisfied that it is not required for the purpose for which it is acquired. Taking into account the facts that the land was vested with the government and that compensation was also paid to the petitioner’s father-in-law, the judge observed that earlier judgments stand in the way of this court from granting the relief sought for by the petitioner. Hence, the judge held that this court does not find any legal right for the petitioner to seek for reconveyance of the land, more particularly, when the state has already initiated steps to use the land for public purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/once-vested-with-state-land-cannot-be-transferred-back-says-madras-high-court/articleshow/84359893.cms||Kaushik Kannan

A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that the block development officer who appeared through video conference said that steps are taken by the government to construct houses for the people. In the meantime, some remedial measures have to be taken immediately as the houses are on the verge of collapse. Hence, the judges directed the collector to file a report on the remedial measures. The court was hearing the public interest litigation filed by A Alagu, resident of Kanmaipatti village at Melur taluk. The petitioner stated that the colony houses were constructed by TAHDCO some 30 years back. The houses have now become unfit to reside as they are in a dilapidated condition. She stated that portions of the roof have started to fall apart posing a threat to the people. She stated that at present 25 families are residing in these houses. Due to poverty, they are unable to move to any place and are residing there by risking their lives. Though the residents have submitted several representations to renovate and reconstruct the houses since 2005, no steps were taken in this regard. Hence, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench seeking for a direction to renovate or reconstruct the houses at the village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/take-steps-to-protect-those-in-dilapidated-houses-hc/articleshow/84359896.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Movements of all politicians tracked, it’s their duty, says Nana Patole||MUMBAI: Nana Patole’s statement on his movements being reported to the CM and Dy CM caused embarrassment to the MVA government on Monday. A senior Congress minister told TOI, “We have huge differences, but people like Patole are creating even more problems for smooth functioning of the government. It is high time they observe restraint.” Addressing a district-level convention of the Congress at Lonavala on July 9, Patole had alleged he was under watch and his movements were being informed to the CM and deputy CM. Patole on Monday said in his clarification, “I explained to our party workers the role of law-enforcing agencies. Long ago, efforts were made to ensure I do not enter my own constituency. My information is that police personnel give a daily briefing on my movements to both the CM and DCM. In fact, they are tracking movements of all politicians, it is part of their duty. It is a regular process, they even keep track of the movements of CM and Dy CM for security reasons.” Patole reiterated that his phone was under surveillance for a long period in 2016 and 2017, when the BJP was in power in the state, along with the phones of several other politicians. “For the phone-tapping agencies, my name was Amzad Khan. Following my complaint, the home department has now set up a three-member committee to probe the phone-tapping episode,” Patole said. Patole made it clear there was no threat to the MVA government and it will complete its term. “ Thackeray will remain in office for five years. The BJP is making efforts to destabilize the government, but it will not succeed,” Patole said. However, senior cabinet members said that in the recent past, the Congress high command has had to face embarrassing situations owing to Patole’s remarks. In the recent past, he said that the Congress will contest future elections on its own while the party high command has not taken any such decision, a cabinet member said. NCP spokesperson and minister Nawab Malik said Patole was making wild statements without doing adequate homework. “I think Patole will have to secure more information on the role and duty of law- enforcing agencies,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/movements-of-all-politicians-tracked-its-their-duty-in-mumbai-patole/articleshow/84360033.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Uncontrolled urbanisation triggering more flooding episodes; Study||HYDERABAD: The city has grown 16.5% in the last 20 years, but this rapid urbanisation has resulted in a changed topography that fails to bear the onslaught of even small monsoon rains, causing flooding and misery. A research study, based on satellite data from 2000 to 2020, reveals there was uncontrolled urbanisation, leading to higher flood volumes and more flooding episodes. The study was conducted by researchers from National Institute of Technology (NIT), Warangal, comparing two major episodes of urban flooding — August 2000 and October 2020 — in Hyderabad . The risk between 2000 and 2020 flood events went up by 50%. According to the study, rapid unplanned urbanization, ignoring the regional and local hydrological landscape has aggravated the flooding severity. “Uncontrolled urbanization (16.5% increase) over the last two decades have substantially influenced the urban hydrology, producing higher flood volumes for comparatively small rainfall event,” the study said, emphasising the need for “regulating urbanization, providing enhanced drain capacity, rejuvenating the water bodies and streams” to check and reduce the spatial flooding extent. Apart from researchers of NIT, Warangal, those from Sree Vidyanikethan Engineering College, Tirupati, and Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun, were also part of the study published in the recent issue of ‘Current Science’. The team comprised Vinay Ashok Rangari, CM Bhatt and NV Umamahesh. Though Hyderabad had not recorded the quantum of rainfall it got in September 1908 resulting in the Musi deluge in the last 113 years, the severity of the flooding has been on the rise. This the researchers attributed to unplanned growth of the city and encroachment of water bodies. “The August floods of 2000 (241.5 mm rainfall in 24 hours) caused huge property loss and more than 90 residential colonies were submerged (2 to 4 metres of water level). Hyderabad witnessed another intense downpour on October 13, 2020, and the event points to the persistent warnings that people chose to overlook over these years… the massive flooding… impacted more than 120 colonies, 20,500 homes and causing as many as 80 deaths,” the researchers said. Satellite data showed a significant reduction in open land and an overall decline in the number of water bodies and their spread. The researchers focussed on Zone-12 that comprises Begumpet, Ameerpet, Madhapur, Kukatpally, Rajiv Gandhi Nagar, Chandra Nagar, Tulasi Nagar and Laxmi Nagar. The Zone-12 had 65% impervious area in 2000. It has now increased to 89%. This, in other words, means it witnessed 23.75% concretisation in the last 20 years. “The increase in imperviousness occurred at the cost of encroachment of vegetative areas, open land parcels and water bodies at 0.95%, 15% and 0.65% respectively. The increased imperviousness limits the infiltration process, thereby increasing the total runoff from the urbanized catchments up to six times and peak flows up to 1.8 to 8 times, thus leading to flooding,” the study said. The study revealed that in October 2020 rainfall event, water started accumulating at about seven hours of rainfall in the areas along the streamline. The water level started building up with the passing time that caused the spreading of floodwater in adjoining low-lying areas at around 14 hours. “We can observe a more than 50% rise in high risk for the October 2020 event. Similarly, there is significant rise in low and medium risks compared to the August 2000 event,” the researchers added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/uncontrolled-urbanisation-triggering-more-flooding-episodes-study/articleshow/84357470.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Kolkata||‘Friends’ kill van puller for Rs 100||Kolkata: Hours after a van rickshaw puller — identified as Ranjit (38) — was allegedly murdered at the Zakaria Street-Balai Dutta Lane Crossing in central Kolkata late on Saturday morning, the Jorasanko police has claimed to have cracked the case with the arrest of three persons. The motive, though, was a trivial one, claimed the investigators. “The three accused — identified as Haru Karmakar (38), Md Samir (19) and Firoz Khan (36) — had murdered Ranjit when he refused to pay them Rs 100. They had planned to buy liquor with that money,” said an investigating officer. The police said that the accused were nabbed with the help of CCTV monitoring. “We went through the available footage and decided to pick up the accused for questioning. During the questioning, the accused gave conflicting answers. They finally broke down and confessed to the murder,” the officer stated. All three accused were known to the victim. They are all local labourers, who had come from Sonarpur and as far as Darbhanga in Bihar. Samir though is a local resident. The victim, said cops, was found with his neck slit and injuries on his head. Ranjit also suffered injuries on his fingers and forehead. The Jorasanko police have registered a murder case in this regard and the forensics team has already picked up evidences from the spot. “Prima facie, we knew that he was murdered after an argument with others, on Saturday night hours before the death of Ranjit, was heard by many. We believe he was smothered and was also hit repeatedly with a heavy object. However, we are waiting for the postmortem report to ascertain our theory on how he was murdered. All other angles — including personal enmity — is being probed,” said an officer. He added that checking of call records from the area has also begun. The anti-homicide squad visited the spot and offered technical help. However, DD is not taking over the case presently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/friends-kill-van-puller-for-rs-100/articleshow/84357485.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Virudhunagar district collector J Meghanath Reddy has warned that criminal cases would be registered against people who are involved in illegal manufacture of crackers. If people are involved in repeat offences, then they would be booked under the Goondas Act, he said. On July 5, the collector constituted five special teams comprising officials from revenue, police, fire and rescue services, industrial safety and health departments to inspect firecracker units and villages where crackers are manufactured illegally. During the last week, the teams have inspected 66 units and identified 23, which were functioning with major violations. The officials suspended the licences of these 23 units and closed them temporarily. The teams during the inspection at Vijayakarisalkulam village noticed that a person Davidraja was manufacturing crackers illegally at his house. Similarly, the officials also found out that another person Karuppasamy was illegally manufacturing crackers by setting up a shed near his house at Kananjampatti village. The officials seized the illegally manufactured crackers and lodged a complaint. The Vembakottai police booked both these people under sections of the Explosives Act, 1884 and are conducting investigations with them. Collector Reddy said that a new set of officials have been deputed to these special teams who would carry out such inspections from July 12 to 17 in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/23-firework-units-lose-licence-for-major-violations/articleshow/84359928.cms||---

A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi also sought a status report from the authorities on the steps that are proposed to be taken to maintain the crematoriums. The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by N S Ramaraj, a resident of Rajapalayam who sought the municipality officials to maintain the burial grounds in a clean and hygienic manner. The petitioner stated that there are no basic facilities at the municipal crematoriums. Places which have been allotted by the municipality for burial and cremations are covered by thorny bushes due to which the people are facing difficulties. The petitioner stated that though he had submitted a representation to the authorities to properly maintain the creatoriums, no steps were taken. Hence, he moved HC Madurai bench seeking relief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-tells-municipality-to-maintain-crematoriums/articleshow/84359918.cms||---

The number of new cases has been dropping, officials said. In May, the district had recorded as many as 421 cases of CAM. In June, there were 375 new cases. Out of the 1,238 cases, 607 patients have recovered completely from the invasive fungal infection that mainly attacks the sinuses. A total of 459 patients are undergoing treatment at various hospitals in the district. “We were reporting an average of 120 new CAM cases every week in the previous two months. The weekly numbers have now gone down substantially, along with the steep drop in Covid-19 cases,” a senior health official said. A total of 172 from the 1,238 patients succumbed, accounting for a 13% mortality rate, which experts said is far below the reported mortality rate — (minimum 30% to a maximum of 50%) that was seen among mucormycosis patients before Covid. Experts said swift efforts by doctors and rational use of available anti-mucormycosis drugs like posaconazole and isovuconazole managed to keep the death rate under control, despite nationwide shortage of important drugs such as amphotericin B. Healthcare activists, however, said CAM-associated fatalities were likely to be higher as many patients were unable to continue hospital treatment due to exorbitant costs and their deaths at home may have gone unreported. They said that only long-term follow-ups will be able to determine true toll. “Covid-linked mucormycosis is very different from the mucormycosis pre-Covid,” said ENT surgeon Ashesh Bhumkar, who is on the state CAM task force. He said, “In post-Covid mucormycosis, the patient is immunocompetent and fights the fungus very hard. A sizeable number of patients are younger and they heal better. Besides, the diagnosis is made very early and treatment starts quickly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/district-records-drop-in-covid-linked-mucor-cases/articleshow/84359923.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Finally, private hospitals find a smooth route to vax stocks||MUMBAI: Even as public centres reel under erratic and insufficient supply of vaccines, private hospitals have been able to procure doses smoothly by placing orders directly through Co-Win since last week. Many received the stocks within 3-4 days of placing orders with the manufacturer, particularly Pune’s Serum Institute of India. Joy Chakraborty, COO of PD Hinduja Hospital, said they managed to place orders through Co-Win last Wednesday and received doses within four days. “At this point, the new system is meeting expectations,” he said. Dr Prince Surana, CEO of Surana Group, said they placed an order for 40,000 doses on Friday and vaccines were delivered on Monday morning. “I was surprised… previously it would take weeks to a month,” he added. Orders, however, can only be placed for Covishield and Covaxin through Co-Win and not for Sputnik as yet. The central government on June 29 released new operating protocols for private hospitals saying they cannot vaccine manufacturers directly and must place orders through Co-Win for transparency. A formula for the maximum quantity they can procure was also unveiled. The maximum would be triple their average daily consumption from one of their best performing weeks in previous months. Last week, senior officials from the Centre held online meetings with private hospital representatives training them to use Co-Win to place orders. Prior to that, most mid-level and smaller hospitals couldn’t buy vaccines due to lack of access to manufacturers. It had also led to major groups hoarding stocks. Some hospitals said they are still exploring the system. Zubin Pereira, medical superintendent of SRCC Children's Hospital said they have placed orders for vaccines and made the payment. “We are awaiting confirmation from the Serum Institute. We are hoping to get delivery soon since we have vaccines only for a week,” he said. Dr Sunil Agrawal, who heads Sanjeevani Hospital in Malad said they will be placing orders on Tuesday. The 100-bed hospital struggled for weeks to buy vaccines when hospitals had to contact manufacturers directly. Dr Santosh Shetty, executive director of Kokilaben Hospital, said they intend to place fresh orders in a week’s time. Private hospitals see an unusually high footfall when the public centres run out of doses, Chakraborty said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-finally-pvt-hospitals-find-a-smooth-route-to-vax-stocks/articleshow/84359979.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Chief minister Hemant Soren and his wife Kalpana Soren visited the temple but they did not step inside and prayed from outside the Dol Mandap, where the deities are kept. Praveer Shahdeo, a descendent of the temple’s founder Ane Nath Shahdeo, said, “We had invited the CM today as he visits the temple every year during the Rath Yatra.” Meanwhile, devotees arrived at the temple in large numbers despite the restrictions. Abhishek Roshan, a member of the Rath Mela Suraksha Samiti, said, “Hundreds of people had gathered at the entrance gates of the temple since early in the morning. However, the gates remained shut.” Police said throughout the day, they requested the devotees on loudspeakers to avoid gatherings but didn’t work. SP (city) Saurav said, “Many people from the rural areas arrived since they didn’t know that gatherings were restricted this year also. Police are carrying out a drive to inform people that fairs and gatherings are not allowed. The administration would set up drop gates on the roads leading to the temple from Tuesday to stop the devotees. Around 700 police personnel would be engaged to implement the government’s restrictions during the nine-day event.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/devotees-throng-city-temple-on-rath-yatra/articleshow/84357988.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Rath Yatra: Jamshedpur's Kolhan division keeps it low key, avoids rush||JAMSHEDPUR: For the second consecutive year, devotees witnessed muted Rath Yatra celebrations in different parts of the Kolhan division on Monday. Keeping the Covid-19 pandemic in mind, organising committees observed the rituals in a low-key manner in the presence of only a handful of festive enthusiasts, temple volunteers and servitors. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON)-run Jagannath temple Rath Yatra in Golmuri saw a small group of people turning up at the chariot-pulling event. “Although, chariot movement was confined to a 10-metre radius within the temple compound, the enthusiasm was the same,” Jamshedpur MP Bidyut Mahato, who attended the chariot-pulling event at the ISKCON temple, said. Draped in new clothes, the presiding deity, Lord Jagannath, looked spectacular while his siblings, Lord Balabhadra and Devi Subhadra, looked majestic in their new attire. Vedic hymns and chants of ‘Hari Bol’ filled the air as soon as the rath rolled down the temple compound. Showering of flower petals on the impressively decorated chariot, beating of the drums, singing of bhajans and kirtan and the blowing of the conch at frequent intervals transformed the atmosphere within the temple compound. “There’s no comparison between Rath Yatra now and those in pre-Covid times. This year also we had a symbolic celebration but organisers ensured there’s no compromise on vedic rituals in observing the festival,” Shankar Agarwal, one of the devotees who attended the Rath Yatra at Beldih Naga temple, said. The Jagannath temple in Seraikela also observed the annual ritual in a token manner following Covid-19 guidelines. “Starting from Maha Snan to Netra Utsav and now Rath Yatra, the rituals were performed in a traditional manner sans grandiose owing to the Covid-19 protocols,” Brahmanand Mahapatra, the head priest of the Jagannath temple in Seraikela, said. Rath Yatra organising committees of the Jagannath temple in Jugsalai’s Rath Gali and Jagannath temple in Khasmahal, among others, observed the Rath Yatra festival in a modest way. “The excitement of the festive crowd, the mela and the mouthwatering halua were missing this year. Hope Lord Jagannath listens to our prayers and make our city Covid-free by next year, so that the festival can be celebrated in a grand way in 2022,” a Sakchi resident, Rabi Pradhan, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/kolhan-keeps-it-low-key-avoids-rush/articleshow/84357196.cms||B Sridhar
---||Ranchi||No Rath Yatra in Simdega for second consecutive year||GUMLA: Simdega district, which shares borders with Odisha and has the oldest history of Rath Yatra in Jharkhand dating back to the 14th century, did not celebrate the festival for the second consecutive year on Monday because of the restrictions put in place to control Covid-19. In the 14th century, a descendant of the Puri king shifted to Bolwa and later his sons settled at Udte Keshalpur and finally at Birugarh in Simdega which shares the boundary with Odisha. “It is the second consecutive year when the Rath Yatra couldn’t be held in Simdega. Only prayer was offered by temple priests," said one of the members of the Birugarh princely family. He said Hathanbar Dev, a descendant of Puri king Kapilendra Dev Maharaj, had settled in Bhambhalpur and his son Kalbhanjan Dev came down to this area and made his seat first at Bolwa in Simdega, where the first of Rath Yatras took place in the state. Durgavijay Singh Dev, a prince of the Birugarh royal family, said, “Kalbhanjan Dev, son of Hathanbar Singh Dev, travelled down to Bolwa. He was given territory in the Simdega area by Ratu Maharaj, who was the ruler of the Chhotanagpur region, for a big diamond. It was Hathabar who first got Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath organised at Bolwa in 1326." Since then, all his descendants were following this tradition, he said, adding that the tradition of conducting the Yatra spread to other places of Simdega thereafter. Durgavijay also said the Gajpati royal family had several princes who went to different places to find their kingdoms in different parts of the country. “Wherever they went, they carried with them the idols of Lord Jagannath, Devi Subhadra and Lord Balabadhra and conducted Rath Yatras and built temples for Lord Jagannath,” he said. Another member of the royal family, Kaushal Singh, said, “on Monday, priests performed rituals observing social distancing and statues of deities were carried to Mausibadi by hand." In adjoining Gumla, the Rath Yatra is also an old tradition. In 1761, a temple of Lord Jagannath was built at Nagfeni on the bank of river Koel south in Gumla. This year, the temple premises looked deserted because of the Covid curbs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/no-rath-yatra-in-simdega-for-second-consecutive-year/articleshow/84357185.cms||K A Gupta

The incident has put a question mark over the safety of female patients at the government-run healthcare centre. While the hospital staff caught hold of the tea shop owner, Kishun, and has been handed over to police, the ambulance driver identified as one Sanjay Das is said to be absconding. Following the incident, the SNMMCH management has constituted a five-member committee consisting of heads of medicine, gynaecology, radiology, clinical pathology and emergency medicine departments to probe the incident and identify the persons responsible for allowing outsiders to enter the female ward in the dead of the night. According to reports, the ambulance driver along with the tea shop owner entered the female medicine ward around 11 pm and lured the woman to a deserted place inside the hospital and raped her. When some hospital staff got a whiff of it, they rushed to her rescue but the alleged rapist managed to escape. The tea shop owner is, however, denying his involvement in the crime. SNMMCH superintendent A K Choudhary said, "The woman was admitted to the hospital by some unknown persons on June 26 and since she is not able to speak and is mentally challenged, we are not able to ascertain her identity. I got information from the ward boy that around 11.15 pm about the incident after which I directed the officials concerned to inform the police and hand over the tea stall owner to the police/" He further said the ward is normally locked by 9 pm and no outsider is allowed in the female ward. "We have constituted the internal committee just to ascertain how the duo managed to enter the female ward and why the staff nurses and ward boys could not stop them. We have informed the police to take up legal action after investigating into the matter and all those found guilty of dereliction of duty would be punished," he added. When contacted, ASP (law and order) Manoj Swargiyari said the police are seeking the assistance of expert counsellors to talk to the woman before sending her for a medical examination. "We are also interrogating the tea joint owner, he added.

---||Ranchi||No need for population control laws in Jharkhand: Grand alliance||RANCHI: A day after the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh — one of the country’s most populated states with about 220 million people — unveiled its new population control draft bill intending to reduce the growth rate to 2.1% over the next 10 years, key ruling alliance parties in Jharkhand dubbed it as a poll gimmick by BJP. In the past, Assam, too, had brought a similar bill. While JMM, the key ruling alliance party in Jharkhand, maintained that no such law was required in the tribal state, Congress, on the other hand, said anything related to population control is always the domain of the Union government and that the states are not empowered to do it. Opposition BJP, however, has already begun raising chorus for a similar law in Jharkhand. Talking to TOI on their party’s stance over the issue, JMM’s central general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said, “We see it as another gimmick by BJP ahead of the Uttar Pradesh election. What happened to CAA and NRC which was raked up during the Lok Sabha election?” The JMM leader also accused BJP of often resorting to divisive politics to divide society for its political agenda. “The Constitution doesn’t even permit having any such law to control the population if one goes by the clause of the right to freedom and individuality,” he claimed, adding that more than the law, the need of the hour is inclusive awareness, education to people to make a conscious decision. “Every parent is aware of well-being and always concerned about the future of his or her children. So, there is no need for any law to tell them how many kids, one should or should not have,” he said. JMM’s ally, Congress, said, "Even though population is often related to equitable distribution of resources but any law on this is the jurisdiction of the Union government. It involves a host of considerations to be taken into account to maintain an equilibrium within society,” remarked state Congress president and finance minister Rameshwar Oraon. Meanwhile, the party’s one of the co-working presidents, Irfan Ansari, termed the UP government's move as another attempt by BJP solely to attack the Muslim community. “Whatever laws BJP regimes bring, they are always an attempt to target and humiliate the Muslim community. But having said so, as a lawmaker, this is the issue which needs to be tackled through education and awareness and there is no need for any law,” he said. BJP, however, raised the demand for a similar bill in Jharkhand, too. The party's Ranchi MP, Sanjay Seth, said, “I strongly believe that such a law is for the overall betterment of the state and the country and demand that the Hemant Soren government brings in a law to control the population." The party's spokesperson, Pratul Shahdeo, added, “BJP demands that that population control law must be enforced in Jharkhand, too. We should remember that the population explosion is one of the major problems in demand and supply gap in this country.” According to the 2011 census, Jharkhand, a tribal-dominated state, has a population of about 32.96 million and is estimated to grow at about 1.57%. About 26% of the total population comprised tribals. However, over the years, many have expressed concerns over the dwindling population of the tribals here. Former MP and tribal rights activist Salkhan Murmu, however, maintained that the population control has nothing to do with the fall in the tribal population. “Among the major reasons for dwindling population of tribals could be migration, lack of proper medical facilities for mother and children and malnutrition among others,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/no-need-for-population-control-laws-in-jkhand-ga/articleshow/84357204.cms||ASRP Mukesh

She will be succeeded by former Tripura Governor Ramesh Bais, who is scheduled to arrive in the state on Tuesday afternoon and take the oath of office next day at Raj Bhavan. On Monday, chief minister Hemant Soren, accompanied by chief secretary Sukhdeo Singh, DGP Niraj Sinha, additional chief secretary Sailesh Kumar Singh, principal secretary to CM Rajiv Arun Ekka and principal secretary Vandana Dadel, among others, was present at the airport to bid her farewell and present her with bouquets before she boarded the flight. She was given a guard of honour. Besides being the first woman governor to serve Jharkhand, Murmu was the first tribal governor to serve the state. She is also the first person to have completed a full term of six years in the state. Despite being a BJP member, there was any never bad blood between Murmu and the JMM-led government, barring one occasion when there were differences of opinion between her and the ruling dispensation over the nomination of members to the Tribes Advisory Council (TAC). Murmu had returned the file containing the names of the nominated members to the government twice, following which the latter introduced changes to the TAC rules and authorized the CM to nominate members. In 2017, Murmu returned the Chhota Nagpur Tenancy and Santhal Pargana Tenancy amendment bills to the then Raghubar Das-led BJP government, following protests by the tribal community. Though the exact reason for her decision to return the bill was not known, during her last interaction with media persons, she emphasised the need for amendments to the age-old acts and said that changes are necessary for the betterment of tribal community in the state. As the chancellor of universities, she focused on higher education, holding regular meetings with the vice-chancellors. During her last week in office, she met various educationists, including VCs of over half a dozen universities, social organisations and bureaucrats. Meanwhile, barring BJP’s Union minister Arjun Munda, who met Murmu at Raj Bhavan ‘as a courtesy call’, none of the party members met her or gave her a formal farewell. When asked, a party leader said that since she was the constitutional head of the state, it was responsibility of the government to give her a farewell. “For us, she continues to be associated with BJP, which is a national party. So there was no point in giving her a farewell.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/droupadi-jharkhands-longest-serving-guv-bids-farewell/articleshow/84357567.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The inoculation drive was partially suspended on Saturday and Sunday as the vaccine stock had run dry on Friday evening. According to the state health department, a record 18,111 people were administered vaccines on Sunday, leaving a total of 38,700 doses for Monday. However, the drive was affected on Monday morning too as session sites ran dry of stocks within a couple of hours after it started. Talking to TOI, Ranchi district reproductive, child health officer Dr Shashi Bhushan Khalko said, “We only had a few thousand doses left with us on Sunday evening, therefore, the vaccination drive on Monday was affected. On Sunday too, many beneficiaries who had to take Covishield had to return as we ran out of doses.” Meanwhile, after the state health department co-ordinated with the Union government over the shortage of vaccines a fresh consignment arrived at Birsa Munda International Airport on Monday afternoon which was subsequently dispatched to all 24 districts. Asked whether fresh doses of Covishield have landed, Dr Khalkho said that he has received around 22,000 doses on Monday evening and there will not be any disruptions in the vaccination drive. However, several beneficiaries had to return home without getting the vaccine on Monday as they were informed that there were no doses at the centre. In Ranchi, people were seen returning from session sites which were functional till Saturday but they were suspended on Sunday and Monday due to shortage of doses. Sudha Singh, a resident of Airport Colony, Hinoo, said, “I have to take the second dose between July 3 and 17 but I didn’t get the jab on Sunday or on Monday as they said that there were no Covishield doses. I have been asked to visit the centre on Tuesday.” The state had experienced similar vaccine shortage between June 29 and July 2. This is second time that Jharkhand had to suspend its vaccination drive due to shortage of doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/vax-drive-to-resume-today-after-2-5l-doses-arrive-in-jharkhand/articleshow/84357637.cms||Gaurav Pandey

While hearing a petition filed by Pathak, the court ordered that his passport be released by the lower court to enable him to travel abroad. However, Pathak will have to surrender his passport before the lower court in Ranchi after his return, the HC said. Pathak is an accused in the 34th National Games scam and was the treasurer of the Games organising committee formed that was hosted by Jharkhand in 2011. He also headed several other committees under the committee. The committee had made huge expenditures for developing infrastructure and other amenities for hosting the Games and later it was found that as much as Rs 28.38 crore was embezzled in the name of buying equipment, apparatuses and sports gear. Proper accounting documents were not furnished and Pathak being the treasurer was in charge of monitoring the accounts. The case was investigated by the anti-corruption bureau which submitted a charge sheet against Pathak. He was taken into custody in June 2018 and was subsequently granted bail by the high court on October 4, 2018. The high court had then imposed a condition on Pathak to deposit his passport for his release on bail. Pathak will file a petition for the release of his passport which is deposited before the lower court and with an undertaking that he will surrender his passport after his return.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/natl-games-scam-accused-gets-hc-nod-for-tokyo-olympics/articleshow/84357171.cms||---

He said that several steps have been taken in the past two years to curb narcotic trade. “I am happy to say that the last one-and-a-half years have been the golden time for India in terms of seizure of narcotics. But as long as they are not scientifically analysed and stopped using a different strategy, such physical campaigns do not deliver us success,” said the MP from Gandhinagar who is on a three-day visit to Gujarat. Shah said India has made several changes in the system to deal with narcotics — right from coordination, hierarchy and law, as more changes are on the way. The home minister lauded the role of forensic sciences to curb the menace. “The field of forensic science leaves no scope for casual approach or laziness if we have to meet or even stay two steps ahead of the challenges that our country of 130 crore population face wherein people follow different religions, speak different languages and cultures,” he said, citing the issues of border security unlike any other country and changing face of crime because of neighbouring countries. He also added that the time to use ‘third degree’ (torture to glean information) is over. “Forensic Science Laboratories (FSLs) play a big role in modernising police and making investigation scientific, and get the criminals punished based on the same scientific evidence,” Shah said. “Even the toughest person can be broken and brought to book based on scientific evidence with proper work by FSL.” He also stressed the need for cyber security for growth and development of the economy. Shah also visited the NFSU campus and reviewed various facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/narco-terror-a-cause-of-concern-for-india-amit-shah/articleshow/84364125.cms||---

---||India||Clarify Supreme Court's comments on ‘single list’ of OBCs: Panel||NEW DELHI: The landmark Supreme Court judgment on the 102nd Constitutional amendment may have kicked up a storm for denuding states of their powers to identify the Mandal castes for reservations in state jobs and related purposes, but the ruling appears to cut much deeper: Among other things, it may have a direct effect on the ongoing study on “sub categorisation of OBCs”. Besides handing the power to identify the “state list of OBCs” to the Union government, three judges in the Constitution bench have also remarked about there being in future a “single list” of OBCs — the one that the SC ruled should be issued by the President (Union government) on the recommendations of the National Commission for Backward Classes. The ruling on having a “single list”, which according to many is interpreted as a merger of the central list and state lists, has brought the work on “sub-categorisation of OBCs” to a halt. J K Bajaj, member of Justice Rohini Commission that is tasked with sub-categorisation of central list of OBCs, told TOI, “Three judges on the said SC bench have said that there should be one list of OBCs. It implies the central list and state lists have to be combined. We need clarity on this issue. Till this issue is resolved, the report on sub-categorisation cannot be given.” In the post-Mandal scheme of reservations, there are two lists of OBCs — central and state, with former identified by the Union government dealing with the quotas in the central jobs, while the state lists are the mandate of state governments catering to local reservations. As reported by TOI, Thaawarchand Gehlot, who just left the charge of social justice ministry, said the government is mulling an amendment to the 102nd Constitutional amendment to ensure that states retain the right to identify the Mandal castes for state lists. Given the SC ruling on “single list” and its effect on many issues including subcategorisation, the government may have to tailor the proposed amendment in such a way that the concern raised by the Rohini Commission is also taken care of. Alternatively, the Union government may think of seeking a clarification from the apex court on “single list” of OBCs. The Rohini panel’s mandate of “sub-categorisation” involves division of the central list of OBCs into groups of castes, and apportioning of the 27% Mandal reservation among them. The scheme is designed with the supposed idea of ensuring equitable distribution of reservation benefits among caste groups by neutralising the chances of monopolisation of affirmative action by some dominant groups that a single central list makes possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/clarify-supreme-courts-comments-on-single-list-of-obcs-panel/articleshow/84364182.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

---||Goa||Goa finally notifies rules to streamline medical services||PANAJI: After two years of enacting the Goa Clinical Establishment (Registration and Regulation) Act, the government on Monday finally notified the rules for its implementation. The rules broadly lay down minimum standards that registered clinical establishments in the state should maintain in terms of infrastructure and qualified manpower. The old legislation – Goa Medical Practitioners’ Act – that was repealed after the new legislation came into force, lacked in many aspects. Under the new rules, every clinical establishment requires to maintain certain minimum standards of facilities and services. The rules have also specified minimum personnel — doctors, paramedics and technical staff — that a registered unit will have to appoint. Trainee staff in nursing, paramedical and medical fields will not be considered as such. A specialised service provider should at least have a registered medical practitioner of modern medicine — who has a minimum qualification of a post-graduate diploma or degree in a relevant discipline — to supervise, perform, and conduct tests or procedures. Such a practitioner should also be able to interpret and convey results. Such a service provider should have a registered medical practitioner available on duty at each consultation room of the out-patient department (OPD) clinic during OPD hours to ensure the availability of services described in the mandatory display by the clinical establishment. The in-patient department (IPD), should have two kinds of medical staff: Consultants and duty medical officers. As soon as a patient arrives, he should immediately be attended to by a duty medical officer while a consultant should see him as soon as possible. If necessary, the duty medical officer may refer the patient to a suitable specialty consultant A trainee doctor should not be considered as the service provider. There should be at least one duty medical officer to act as a resident medical officer in case of a maternity/nursing home and should be available round the clock. In the case of in-patient-based facilities with more than 30 beds, one duty medical officer should be available. In addition, the number of consultants required in in-patient-based facilities should depend upon the type of services being provided: General, specialty or superspecialty. A nursing home providing medical facilities should have a physician available on-call, round the clock. A nursing home providing surgical facilities should have a surgeon and an anaesthetist available on call. In case emergency surgical facilities are also provided, then a surgeon and an anaesthetist should be available on-call, round the clock. The resuscitation of a newborn should be under the supervision of a trained registered medical practitioner, preferably a paediatrician. Maternity homes should have a gynaecologist/surgeon, anaesthetist and paediatrician. Nursing staff must have a diploma or degree in nursing/midwifery from any recognised institution registered with the Goa Nursing Council. Currently, several private clinics and hospitals recruit nursing staff from Karnataka and Maharashtra. It is also mandated that 70% of the nursing staff should have qualifications mentioned under the new rules, and that 30% should be trained staff, having passed at least Class X and having experience of working in a hospital for two years. The rules are applicable to practitioners of alternative medicines such as ayurveda and homeopathy, too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-finally-notifies-rules-to-streamline-medical-services/articleshow/84360829.cms||Bindiya Chari
