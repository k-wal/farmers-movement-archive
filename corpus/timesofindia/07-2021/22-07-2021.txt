Glenn Chin, the former supervisory pharmacist for the New England Compounding Center, was resentenced to 10 1/2 years in prison after the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals threw out his eight-year punishment and ordered US District Judge Richard Stearns to reconsider the case.  It comes two weeks after the same judge tacked on more than five years to the sentence for Barry Cadden, the former owner of the New England Compounding Center. Cadden was resentenced to 14 1/2 years in prison.  Before Wednesday's longer sentence was handed down, Chin told families of victims who had gathered in the courtroom: "I completely understand why you hate me. I apologize to each and every one of you. Please know I never intended to harm anyone."  Cadden and Chin were both acquitted of second-degree murder charges after trials in Boston's federal court but were subsequently charged with murder in Michigan state court, where the cases are still pending.  An appeals court tossed their sentences last year and ordered the judge to re-examine whether certain enhancements in sentencing guidelines that call for stiffer punishments should apply.  Throughout Chin's trial, prosecutors portrayed him as a callous employee who cut corners and ignored warning signs of unsafe production methods to boost production and profits. Chin's attorneys said Cadden was the one calling the shots that there was no evidence Chin caused the drugs to become contaminated.  Prosecutors had called for a new sentence of more than 17 years for both men, who were convicted of fraud and other crimes stemming from the outbreak caused by mould-tainted steroid injections produced by the compounding pharmacy.  This story has been corrected to reflect that Chin's resentencing came two weeks, not one after the former owner of the compounding pharmacy was resentenced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/pharmacist-in-meningitis-outbreak-gets-more-prison-time/articleshow/84622991.cms||---

Sheriff's deputies brought the 69-year-old convicted rapist into court in a wheelchair. He was wearing a brown jail jumpsuit and face mask. Attorney Mark Werksman entered the plea for the disgraced movie mogul a day after Weinstein was extradited to California from New York, where he was serving a 23-year prison term. Weinstein spoke only to say "thank you" to Judge Sergio Tapia, who wished him good luck as the hearing ended. He now awaits a second trial on a second coast, and the possibility of another lengthy sentence. Weinstein's charges involve five women and span from 2004 to 2013. Most are said to have taken place in the hotels in Beverly Hills and Los Angeles that the New York-based Weinstein would make his headquarters for Hollywood business. Some took place during Oscars week, when his films were perennial contenders before the #MeToo movement brought him down. He pleaded not guilty to four counts of rape, four counts of forcible oral copulation, two counts of sexual battery by restraint and one count of sexual penetration by use of force, charges that together could bring a sentence of 140 years. The women were not named in the charging documents. A New York jury found Weinstein guilty of raping an aspiring actress in 2013 in a Manhattan hotel room and forcibly performing oral sex on a TV and film production assistant in 2006 at his Manhattan apartment. He is appealing that conviction, seeking a new trial. Weinstein maintains his innocence and contends that any sexual activity was consensual. Los Angeles prosecutors first charged Weinstein in January 2020, just as jury selection was getting underway in the New York City case. More charges were added later in the year, and in March, he was indicted by an LA County grand jury. The pandemic and procedural delays meant that Weinstein's extradition took well over a year. His attorneys cited his declining health as they sought to keep him at a state prison near Buffalo, New York, until jury selection began in the Los Angeles trial. Weinstein's time in custody in California will count toward his New York sentence, officials said. Once a major power in Hollywood along with his brother Bob and their movie companies Miramax and The Weinstein Co., Harvey Weinstein would be marked as the archvillain of the #MeToo movement starting late in 2017, when women's accounts were published in the New York Times and the New Yorker. He would be arrested in New York seven months later. Rumors about Weinstein's behavior swirled in film industry circles for decades, but he silenced many accusers with payoffs, nondisclosure agreements and the fear that he could crush their careers. The Los Angeles charges came from a task force established to tackle sexual misconduct in Hollywood as #MeToo gained momentum. Weinstein and porn performer Ron Jeremy are among the few charged by the team, which declined to prosecute more than 20 famous men because the allegations against them were too old or could not be corroborated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/weinstein-pleads-not-guilty-to-sexual-assaults-in-california/articleshow/84623051.cms||---

Acting on a tip, police stopped the car on Interstate 295 in Gardiner on Tuesday, and a drug-sniffing dog found 4 pounds (2 kilograms) of cocaine worth $200,000 on the street, the MDEA said. Also seized was $1,900 in cash.  About 2 pounds of the cocaine was disguised as a marble cake with coffee grounds used to cover up the scent, officials said.  The two were released on bail and were expected in court on Wednesday. It was unknown if they had a lawyer.  Agents believe the drugs were to be distributed in Kennebec and Somerset counties. The MDEA was assisted in the investigation by the Winslow Police Department, Maine State Police, and Homeland Security Investigations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/cocaine-disguised-as-cake-seized-from-vehicle-in-maine/articleshow/84623000.cms||---
---||World||Morocco threatens legal action over spyware allegations||RABAT: Morocco's government on Wednesday threatened legal action against anyone accusing it of using the Israeli spyware programme Pegasus, and deplored what it called a "false, massive, malicious media campaign". A government statement "categorically denied the false and unfounded allegations" that the North African country's intelligence services had used the software. The authorities said a judicial inquiry to identify those behind the accusations was being opened. News outlets had reported on Sunday that the software, developed by Israeli firm NSO Group, had been used by governments to spy on activists, journalists, lawyers and politicians around the world. The bombshell claims were based on a leaked document containing 50,000 numbers of people identified as potential targets via Pegasus between 2016 and June 2021. Numbers from 10 countries, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Hungary, India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, figured particularly often on the list. On Monday, Morocco said it had "never acquired computer software to infiltrate communication devices". French newspaper Le Monde reported the next day that French President Emmanuel Macron and members of his government were among the potential targets, allegedly due to the interests of a Moroccan security agency. Also on Tuesday, Radio France had reported that the Moroccan king was on the list of 50,000 numbers, which also included "a large number" of Moroccan royals. Wednesday's statement by the Moroccan government said it would "opt for a judicial process, in Morocco and internationally, against any party taking up these spurious allegations". The public prosecutor said in a later statement: "A judicial inquiry is being opened into these false allegations and accusations in order to identify the parties responsible for their publication." Pegasus is a highly invasive tool that can switch on a target's phone camera and microphone, as well as access data on the device, effectively turning a phone into a pocket spy. In some cases, the software can be installed without the need to trick a user into initiating a download. Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based media nonprofit, and Amnesty International got access to the leaked numbers, which they then shared with media organisations including The Washington Post, The Guardian and Le Monde. NSO has denied selling the software to authoritarian governments for the purposes of spying on dissenters, and insists it is only intended for use as a counter-terror and anti-crime tool.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/morocco-threatens-legal-action-over-spyware-allegations/articleshow/84622999.cms||---

Sources said developing the 275-km Parikrama Marg to a two-lane NH could cost around Rs 3,000 crore, but the Centre will take a final call on whether to make it a 2-lane or 4-lane NH. On Wednesday, Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari tweeted that his ministry has issued a draft notification to declare the road as an NH. In March 2017, the ministry had given in-principle approval to develop it as an NH it’s mythological and religious importance. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath welcomed the decision and said this will help rejuvenate the ancient glory of Ayodhya and this will be a big boost for religious tourism. The development master plan for Ayodhya, which is now in works, has also identified the development of the Parikrama Marg as a key component. Sources said the Centre would try to complete the widening of the road in the next two years when the Ram temple is opened to devotees. Tourists from the country and abroad will be able to do 84 kosi parikrama in Ayodhya through the revamped road. The eighty-four Kosi Parikrama Marg passes through five districts, including Ayodhya, Ambedkar Nagar, Barabanki and Gonda. Currently, the condition of the Marg is not in good condition. Those doing the parikrama need to cross the river by boat. Sources said the new plan will also incorporate a traffic plan covering these religious places for convenience of devotees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/longest-parikrama-marg-in-ayodhya-to-be-developed-as-national-highway/articleshow/84623147.cms||Dipak K Dash

The organisation which challenged the West Bengal government’s own version of the real estate law has now written to the housing ministry to address the issue, citing no hearing of home buyers’ complaints in the state since May 5. In a letter addressed to the Union housing and urban affairs secretary, the Forum for People’s Collective Efforts (FPCE) has said the delay in implementation in RERA in West Bengal is causing immense hardship to home buyers and people can’t file fresh complaints as well. “It was imperative upon West Bengal government to take immediate necessary steps to implement the decision of the Supreme Court and constitute the regulatory authority, appellate tribunal and adjudicating officer and also to make subordinate rules and host a platform for detailed project/agent information under the Act, in letter and spirit as envisaged under RERA,” Abhay Upadhyay, president of FPCE said in the letter. FPCE, which was earlier known as Fight for RERA, played a key role in raising the demand for enacting the RERA. Upadhyay has highlighted how the online hearings of WB-HIRA that were scheduled to be held on May 6 and May 7 and subsequent dates have also been adjourned until further order. “Such indefinite adjournment is causing immense hardship to homebuyers as justice is being delayed and those considering filing fresh cases have nowhere to go. The limbo has created a vacuum of any kind of grievance redressal mechanism for homebuyers in West Bengal,” the letter said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/home-buyers-body-urges-centre-for-implementation-of-rera-in-bengal/articleshow/84623270.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||World||Wildfires in US West blowing 'so much smoke' into East Coast||PORTLAND: Smoke and ash from massive wildfires in the American West shrouded the sky and led to air quality alerts on parts of the East Coast on Wednesday as the effects of the blazes were felt 2,500 miles (4,023 kilometers) away. Haze hung over New York City, New Jersey and Pennsylvania as strong winds blew smoke east from California, Oregon, Montana and other states on the opposite end of the country. The nation's largest wildfire, Oregon's Bootleg Fire, grew to 616 square miles (1,595 square kilometers)- just over half the size of Rhode Island. Fires also burned on both sides of California's Sierra Nevada, Washington state and other areas of the West. The smoke blowing in to the East Coast was reminiscent of last fall, when large blazes burning in Oregon's worst wildfire season in recent memory choked the local sky with pea-soup smoke but also affected air quality several thousand miles away. So far this year, Seattle and Portland have largely been spared the foul air as the weather and winds push the smoke east. People in parts of New Jersey, Pennsylvania and elsewhere with health issues like heart disease and asthma were told to avoid the outdoors. Air quality alerts for parts of the region were in place through Thursday. "We're seeing lots of fires producing a tremendous amount of smoke, and ... by the time that smoke gets to the eastern portion of the country where it's usually thinned out, there's just so much smoke in the atmosphere from all these fires that it's still pretty thick," said David Lawrence, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. "Over the last two years, we've seen this phenomenon." The Oregon fire has ravaged the sparsely populated southern part of the state and has been expanding by up to 4 miles (6 kilometers) a day, pushed by gusting winds and critically dry weather that's turned trees and undergrowth into a tinderbox. Fire crews have had to retreat from the flames for 10 consecutive days as fireballs jump from treetop to treetop, trees explode, embers fly ahead of the fire to start new blazes and, in some cases, the inferno's heat creates its own weather of shifting winds and dry lightning. Monstrous clouds of smoke and ash have risen up to 6 miles (10 kilometers) into the sky and are visible for more than 100 air miles (161 kilometers). Authorities in Oregon said lower winds and temperatures Tuesday allowed crews to improve fire lines, and they hoped to make more progress Wednesday. The fire was approaching an old burn area on its active southeastern flank, raising hopes it would not spread as much. The blaze, which is being fought by more than 2,200 people, is about one-third contained. It was within a few hundred acres of becoming Oregon's third-largest wildfire in modern history. At least 2,000 homes have been evacuated at some point during the fire and an additional 5,000 threatened. At least 70 homes and more than 100 outbuildings have burned, but no one is known to have died. Thick smoke hangs over the area where residents and wildlife alike have been dealing with months of drought and extreme heat. Extremely dry conditions and recent heat waves tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/wildfires-in-us-west-blowing-so-much-smoke-into-east-coast/articleshow/84623287.cms||---

Around 4am, a drone was found hovering over the civil airport and a similar object was seen flying over Peer Baba area in Satwari, near Jammu Air Force base sometime later,” said a source. Later, these UAVs disappeared and authorities concerned were informed, following which a massive search was launched to trace these flying objects. On June 27, two bombs were drone-dropped at the Jammu Air Force station, leaving two IAF personnel injured. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is investigating the case. Following the attack, the district authorities had banned commercial/private use of drones in Samba, Ramban, Kathua, Rajouri, Poonch, Baramulla, Srinagar, Jammu and Ganderbal districts of J&K. On July 15, a drone was again spotted near the Jammu Air Force station, while another was spotted along the LoC in Pallanwala. The two incidents were reported within 24 hours and on July 14, BSF had forced a suspected drone to return to the Pakistan side after it was seen hovering over Jammu’s Arnia area. Expressing concern over the proliferation of drones, J&K DGP Dilbag Singh had earlier said that drones have added a new dimension to security threats from terror groups. In an interview in Srinagar on Tuesday, Singh said an investigation into the attack on the Jammu IAF station last month showed involvement of non-state actors, supported by state actors such as the ordnance factory of Pakistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/drones-spotted-near-jammu-air-force-station/articleshow/84623343.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||Greece: Tear gas fired during protest of vaccine mandate||ATHENS: Police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters who gathered Wednesday in Athens to oppose coronavirus vaccination requirements proposed by the Greek government. The demonstration in front of the parliament building took place hours after the government submitted legislation to make Covid-19 vaccinations mandatory for employees at nursing homes and care facilities. Under the draft bill, staff members could be suspended without pay starting in mid-August if they fail to comply. Officers fired the tear gas and water cannons after protesters attempted to break through a police cordon. Several thousand people also joined a protest rally in Greece's second-largest city, Thessaloniki. Vaccinations already were made mandatory for rescue personnel employed by the country's Fire Service, which began transferring non-vaccinated members of its rescue service to other departments this week. The Greek government is worried that slowing vaccination rates will hurt the country's economic recovery after a steep recession last year caused by lockdowns and the pandemic's impact on the tourism industry. Roughly 45% of the country's population has received two vaccine doses, according to daily public health data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/greece-tear-gas-fired-during-protest-of-vaccine-mandate/articleshow/84623356.cms||---

Justice Chamberlain will hand down judgment as to whether Nirav will be granted permission to appeal his extradition in the coming weeks. If he denies permission, Nirav will have to be extradited to India within 28 days of his order unless he obtains an emergency injunction, known as interim measures pursuant to Rule 39, from the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France. Interim measures are usually decided in 48 hours. Nirav, 50, who is accused of causing losses to Punjab National Bank of over $1 billion, money laundering, destroying evidence and intimidating witnesses, appeared via video link from Wandsworth prison. He was represented by Edward Fitzgerald QC, dubbed the "Rolls-Royce of barristers", who successfully defended Jabir Motiwala, Julian Assange and Lauri Love. Fitzgerald told the court that Nirav was so mentally unwell he would qualify for being "sectioned" under the UK’s mental health act, and that he had a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, which ran in the family as his mother had jumped off the balcony when he was eight. Arguing that district judge Sam Goozée in the lower court, in sending Nirav’s case to the home secretary, had been wrong to dismiss his state of depression as "far from unusual" and the risk of suicide as not "immediate", Fitzgerald said Nirav had considered killing himself with razors "to avoid being killed". Helen Malcom QC, representing the Indian government, said it was not oppressive to extradite "anyone who is depressed and has considered suicide". But Fitzgerald argued it would be oppressive to extradite Nirav if he could become unfit to plea in the future. Fitzgerald also argued it was "perverse" of the judge to say a video of Barrack 12 at Arthur Road Jail demonstrated better conditions than Wandsworth prison, saying that the jail was overcrowded and Covid-infested, and the "healthcare system in India was on the brink of collapse". Fitzgerald claimed Nirav would be denied a fair trial in India as there was an "increasing politicisation of Indian judges" and there had been repeated public denunciations "prejudging Nirav’s’ guilt" by Indian government ministers, including Ravi Shankar Prasad and Nirmala Sitharaman, as well as "gratuitous condemnations pre-trial" by judges, including Justice Manmohan Singh. He cited the "freezing of assets of Amnesty International" and the UN working group on arbitrary detention’s verdict on Christian Michel’s "mistreatment" as examples of " undermining the rule of law" in India. But Malcolm said India had a proud independent legal tradition and there had never been an extradition case refused because of denial of fair trial in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/nirav-modi-makes-last-ditch-attempt-at-appeal-against-extradition-in-uk-court-states-he-is-suicidal-and-wont-get-fair-trial-in-india/articleshow/84623404.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||World||Covid-19 cases in US triple over 2 weeks amid misinformation||MISSION: Covid-19 cases tripled in the US over two weeks amid an onslaught of vaccine misinformation that is straining hospitals, exhausting doctors and pushing clergy into the fray.  "Our staff, they are frustrated," said Chad Neilsen, director of infection prevention at UF Health Jacksonville, which is canceling elective surgeries and procedures after the number of mostly unvaccinated Covid-19 inpatients at its two campuses jumped to 134, up from a low of 16 in mid-May.  "They are tired. They are thinking this is deja vu all over again, and there is some anger because we know that this is a largely preventable situation, and people are not taking advantage of the vaccine."  Across the US, the seven-day rolling average for daily new cases in the US rose over the past two weeks to more than 37,000 on Tuesday, up from less than 13,700 on July 6, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Health officials blame the delta variant and slowing vaccination rates. Just 56.2% of Americans have gotten at least one dose of the vaccine, according to the the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  "It is like seeing the car wreck before it happens," said Dr. James Williams, a clinical associate professor of emergency medicine at Texas Tech, who has recently started treating more Covid-19 patients. "None of us want to go through this again."  He said the patients are younger - many in their 20s, 30s and 40s - and overwhelmingly unvaccinated.  "People were just begging for this," he said of the vaccine. "And remarkably it was put together within a year, which is just astonishing. People don't even appreciate that. Within a year, we got a vaccine. And now they are thinking, 'Hmm, I don't know if I will get it.'"  As lead pastor of one of Missouri's largest churches, Jeremy Johnson has heard the reasons congregants don't want the COVID-19 vaccine. He wants them to know it's not only OK to get vaccinated, it's what the Bible urges.  "I think there is a big influence of fear," said Johnson, whose Springfield-based church also has a campus in Nixa and another about to open in Republic. "A fear of trusting something apart from scripture, a fear of trusting something apart from a political party they're more comfortable following. A fear of trusting in science. We hear that: 'I trust in God, not science.' But the truth is science and God are not something you have to choose between."  Now many churches in southwestern Missouri, like Johnson's Assembly of God-affiliated North Point Church, are hosting vaccination clinics. Meanwhile, about 200 church leaders have signed onto a statement urging Christians to get vaccinated, and on Wednesday announced a follow-up public service campaign.  Opposition to vaccination is especially strong among white evangelical Protestants, who make up more than one-third of Missouri's residents, according to a 2019 report by the Pew Research Center.  "We found that the faith community is very influential, very trusted, and to me that is one of the answers as to how you get your vaccination rates up," said Ken McClure, mayor of Springfield.  The two hospitals in his city are teeming with patients, reaching record and near-record pandemic highs. Steve Edwards, who is the CEO of CoxHealth in Springfield, tweeted that the hospital has brought in 175 traveling nurses and has 46 more scheduled to arrive by Monday.  "Grateful for the help," wrote Edwards, who previously tweeted that anyone spreading misinformation about the vaccine should "shut up."  In New York City, workers in city-run hospitals and health clinics will be required to get vaccinated or get tested weekly as officials battle a rise in Covid-19 cases, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday.  De Blasio's order will not apply to teachers, police officers and other city employees, but it's part of the city's intense focus on vaccinations amid an increase in delta variant infections.  The number of vaccine doses being given out daily in the city has dropped to less than 18,000, down from a peak of more than 100,000 in early April. About 65% of all adults are fully vaccinated, but the inoculation rate is around 25% among Black adults under age 45. About 45% of the workforce in the city's public hospital system is Black.  Meanwhile, caseloads have been rising in the city for weeks, and health officials say the variant makes up about 7 in 10 cases they sequence.  "We need our health care workers to be vaccinated, and it's getting dangerous with the delta variant," de Blasio told CNN.  In Louisiana, health officials reported 5,388 new Covid-19 cases Wednesday and said it's the third-highest daily count since the beginning of the pandemic in early 2020. Hospitalizations for the disease rose to 844 statewide, up more than 600 since mid-June.  In New Orleans, officials weighed a possible revival of at least some of the mitigation efforts that had been eased as the disease was waning.  Mayor LaToya Cantrell and the city's top health official, Dr. Jennifer Avegno, were expected to make an announcement later Wednesday. On Tuesday, Cantrell spokesman Beau Tidwell said "all options are on the table."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/covid-19-cases-in-us-triple-over-2-weeks-amid-misinformation/articleshow/84623445.cms||---

In a statement on Wednesday, United Nations spokesperson Farhan Haq said the Secretary-General has been concerned by recent devastating floods in different parts of the world and has been in touch with the leaders accordingly.  "The Secretary-General sent a letter to German Chancellor Angela Merkel to express his condolences for the lives lost due to these floods and his sympathies to all those who have suffered losses. And the Secretary-General is sending a letter to President Xi Jinping to convey his heartfelt condolences on the tragic loss of lives and devastation."  Last week, deadly floods in Germany caused by heavy rains affected most of western Europe. Around 165 people have been reported dead across western Germany, with many more fatalities across Europe, DW reported.  Meanwhile, China has also been hit by heavy rains and flooding that resulted in at least 25 deaths in the province of Henan. More than 160,000 people were evacuated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/un-chief-condoles-loss-lives-in-deadly-floods-in-china-germany/articleshow/84623523.cms||---
---||World||France requires Covid-19 pass for Eiffel Tower and other sites||PARIS: Visitors now need a special Covid-19 pass to ride up the Eiffel Tower or visit French museums or movie theaters, the first step in a new campaign against what the government calls a "stratospheric'' rise in delta variant infections. As the new rule came into effect Wednesday, tourists who came to the Paris landmark unprepared lined up for quick virus tests at the site. To get the pandemic pass, people must show they are either fully vaccinated, have tested negative for the coronavirus or recovered from Covid-19. "The world is facing a new wave, and we must act,'' Prime Minister Jean Castex said. The solution is "vaccination, vaccination, vaccination,'' Castex said on Wednesday on TF1 television, urging his compatriots to sign up for vaccine injections to avoid new lockdowns. Of France's 18,000 new coronavirus cases reported Tuesday, 96% involved people who were unvaccinated, he said. But people opposed to vaccines and being asked to present passes showing their immunity status are growing increasingly vocal. A group of protesters attending an anti-pass demonstration in the Alpine city of Chambery broke away and entered the town hall, removing a portrait of French President Emmanuel Macron from a wall and taking it away. "The city of Chambery condemns this intrusion with the greatest firmness,'' the local government said in a statement. At the Eiffel Tower, masked workers scanned QR codes on digital health passes and checked printed vaccine or test certificates. The pass requirement took effect Wednesday at cultural and tourist sites in France, following a government decree. Attitudes toward the requirement were mixed. "I wanted to come here with my mom so I had to take to the test to be able to travel,'' said Juan Truque, an accountant visiting from Miami, who is not vaccinated. "They are forcing you to wear face masks and do similar kinds of things that are some kind of impositions to me that are violations to your freedom.'' Johnny Nielsen, a Danish tourist traveling with his wife and two children, said, "In Denmark, you need the pass everywhere.'' So while he questioned the usefulness of the French rules, he said that didn't make them reconsider the family's travel plans. Meanwhile, Macron wants to expand the Covid pass requirement to all French restaurants and many other areas of public life, as well as requiring that all health workers get vaccine shots. The lower house of parliament on Wednesday noisily debated a bill that would allow those mandates. The government wants to rush the bill through as soon as possible despite the resistance in some quarters. More than 100,000 people protested the measures around France over the weekend, and the prime minister said on Wednesday that the government will seek approval from the Constitutional Court, which will also take time. Already the government had to delay plans to require teenagers to use the passes starting next month, amid criticism from parents, restaurant owners and others. The government wants the pass to apply to everyone age 12 and over and will launch vaccination campaigns in middle schools and high schools starting in September, Castex said. France's daily infections dropped sharply in the spring but have shot up again over the past two weeks. Some regions are re-imposing virus restrictions. The government is worried that pressure will grow on hospitals again in the coming weeks. France has registered more than 111,000 virus-related deaths. Overall 46% of the population is fully vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/france-requires-covid-19-pass-for-eiffel-tower-and-other-sites/articleshow/84623375.cms||---
---||World||Federal judge blocks Arkansas trans youth treatment ban||LITTLE ROCK: A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked enforcement of Arkansas' ban on gender confirming treatments for transgender youth while a lawsuit challenging the prohibition proceeds.  The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit in May asking U.S. District Judge Jay Moody in Little Rock to strike down the law that made Arkansas the first state to forbid doctors from providing gender confirming hormone treatment, puberty blockers or sex reassignment surgery to anyone under 18 years old, or from referring them to other providers for such treatment. The ACLU sought the preliminary injunction while its lawsuit proceeded.  Moody found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed with their challenge and that allowing it to be enforced would hurt transgender youth currently receiving the treatments.  "To pull this care midstream from these patients, or minors, would cause irreparable harm," Moody said.  The law had been set to take effect July 28.  The ACLU filed the lawsuit on behalf of four transgender youths and their families, as well as two doctors who provide gender confirming treatments. The lawsuit argues that the prohibition would severely harm transgender youth in the state and violate their constitutional rights.  "This ruling sends a clear message to states across the country that gender affirming care is life-saving care, and we won't let politicians in Arkansas - or anywhere else - take it away," said Holly Dickson, executive director of the ACLU of Arkansas.  An attorney for the ACLU had said the ban was forcing some families to consider uprooting from their homes to move to other states where the care was legal.  "This care has given me confidence that I didn't know I had," Dylan Brandt, a 15-year-old transgender boy from Greenwood who is one of the plaintiffs, said at at a news conference after the ruling.  Arkansas' Republican-dominated Legislature overrode GOP Gov. Asa Hutchinson's veto of the measure. Hutchinson vetoed the ban following pleas from pediatricians, social workers and the parents of transgender youths who said it would harm a community already at risk for depression and suicide.  Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, a Republican, said she planned to appeal the decision.  "I will aggressively defend Arkansas's law, which strongly limits permanent, life-altering sex changes to adolescents," Rutledge said. "I will not sit idly by while radical groups such as the ACLU use our children as pawns for their own social agenda."  Moody issued the ruling shortly after hearing arguments from the law's opponents and the state for about an hour and a half.  The judge appeared skeptical of the state's argument that the ban was targeting the procedure, not transgender people. For example, he questioned why a minor born as a male should be allowed to receive testosterone but not one who was born female  "How do you justify giving that to one sex but not the other and not call that sex discrimination?" Moody asked.  Arkansas argued that the state has a legitimate interest in banning the procedures for minors. Republican attorneys general from 17 states asked Moody to uphold the ban.  Several major medical groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, filed a brief with the court challenging the ban. The state Chamber of Commerce and the Walton Family Foundation, which was founded by relatives of Arkansas-based Walmart's founder, also asked the court to block the ban.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/federal-judge-blocks-arkansas-trans-youth-treatment-ban/articleshow/84623594.cms||---

"If that occurred, the government would be unable to pay its obligations fully, and it would delay making payments for its activities, default on its debt obligations, or both," the non-partisan CBO said in a statement. It noted this timeline could change depending on the pace of revenue collections and government outlays. A failure to work out differences over whether government spending cuts should accompany an increase in the statutory debt limit, currently set at $28.5 trillion, could lead to a federal government shutdown - as has happened three times in the past decade - or even a debt default. President Joe Biden's fellow Democrats narrowly control both the Senate and House of Representatives. No senior Republicans have mentioned a shutdown threat in recent public statements. Democrats are insisting on a "clean" debt limit increase unfettered by a fight over spending reductions. The top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell, said on Wednesday that members of his party would be unlikely to support a debt limit increase given the current Democratic drive for a multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure investment bill. "I can't imagine there will be a single Republican voting to raise the debt ceiling after what we've been experiencing," McConnell told the Congress-focused Punchbowl News. McConnell suggested Democrats address the debt limit in a second spending measure they are expecting to pass without Republican votes in a maneuver called reconciliation. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called McConnell's remarks "shameless, cynical and totally political." Schumer said Republicans did not raise such concerns during the presidency of Republican Donald Trump and that some of the debt is related to emergency aid in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 'DO IT QUICKLY' Another leading Democrat, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, accused Republicans of trying to launch a protracted debate over the cost of popular federal programs such as Social Security to cloud the debt limit issue. Wyden rejected McConnell's suggestion that a debt limit bill be attached to a Democrats-only infrastructure investment bill that could advance this fall, saying, "We're going to do it quickly" through more conventional procedures. The Treasury Department on July 31 technically bumps up against its statutory debt limit. Much like a personal credit card maximum, the debt ceiling is the amount of money the federal government is allowed to borrow to meet its obligations. These range from paying military salaries and IRS tax refunds to Social Security benefits and even interest payments on the debt. Since the government spends more than it receives in revenues, it keeps operating by borrowing more and more. For many years, the statutory debt limit was raised to a specific dollar level. More recently, Congress has set the limit to a specific date in the future. Lawmakers often try to extend borrowing authority to beyond the next US election so that it does not become a campaign issue. The midterm elections that will determine whether Democrats retain control of Congress are set for November 2022. If Congress does not raise the debt ceiling from its current $28.5 trillion by the time that the Treasury Department's borrowing authority runs out, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is expected to take special steps to avoid a government default. Such stop-gap measures are effective for only a short period. Failure to raise the debt ceiling could lead to a repeat of the government shutdowns that occurred in 2013, January 2018 and 35 days from late December 2018 into January 2019. Other factors also were in play during those disruptions. In a sign of Wall Street's worry about the approaching limits, yields on short-term U.S. Treasury debt have inched up to around 0.05%, after having hovered near zero since early in the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/partisan-fight-brews-as-forecaster-warns-us-could-hit-debt-limit-by-fall/articleshow/84623563.cms||---

Until the J&K Grant of Domicile Certificate (Procedure) Rules 2020 were amended, the term "spouse" was applicable in this context only to non-Kashmiri wives of native men. According to the order issued by commissioner and secretary of general administration Manoj Dwivedi, any outsider married to a native will be eligible to seek a domicile certificate on the basis of the husband or wife's domicile status. Native women married to non-Kashmiris could so far get only their children to apply for domicile certificates. The documents required for the issuance of a domicile certificate to either non-native spouse include the partner's papers and a valid proof of marriage. The designated authority for issuance of a certificate is the tehsildar. Till Articles 370 and 35 A were nullified, there was no provision for issuance of permanent resident certificates to husbands of native women married outside J&K. This had created a situation in which a local man who married outside J&K could confer permanent residency on his wife while local women married outside would forfeit their rights. J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina termed the change "a historic decision to end the injustice meted out to the girls of J&K by previous governments". Former deputy chief minister and senior BJP functionary Kavinder Gupta said, "As of today, our daughters and their spouses will be able to get ownership rights of their already existing properties, besides the properties which they now purchase in J&K."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-tweaks-rules-to-give-non-local-spouses-of-native-women-domicile-certificates/articleshow/84623583.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||China's offensive threat growing faster than projected: US Air Force General||WASHINGTON: China is building up its offensive air capabilities far faster than US military planners expected in their national defence strategy three years ago, an Air Force General said on Wednesday.  In a US Senate Appropriations Subcommittee hearing, Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff for Planning and Programs Lt. Gen. David Nahom told Congress said, "The threat is accelerating much more than we thought back in 2018,"  Speaking on the issue of Navy and Air Force weapons systems divestments, Nahom said that China was pushing ahead as fast as it could to expand its military power including air combat capabilities.  "China's actions show a sense of urgency, they see a future that is different from the one that we would want to see and they are taking action to realise that future," Nahom said.  "Their efforts include a massive build of military power and a clear intent to use that military to gain an advantage."  The US Air Force has said it plans to divest more than 200 aircraft with its fiscal 2022 budget request. According to the US Air Force, they wish to use the cuts to free up USD 1.3 billion to reinvest in their sixth-generation fighter, hypersonic weapons and other emerging technologies.  Earlier this month, the United States had expressed concern about China's accelerated build-up of its nuclear arsenal after a Washington Post report revealed that Beijing has been constructing more than 100 new missile silos in a desert area located in the western part of the country.  "These reports and other developments suggest that the PRC's (China) nuclear arsenal will grow more quickly and to a higher level than perhaps previously anticipated," State Department spokesperson Ned Price said when asked about reports that Beijing is building more than 100 nuclear missile silos.  "This build-up is concerning and it raises questions about the PRC's intents."  The spokesperson stressed that China's nuclear buildup reinforces the need for arms control measures and urged Beijing to work together on arms control in order to avoid arms races.  Ties between the US and China continue to deteriorate under the Biden administration and both global powers have clashed over several economic and human rights issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/chinas-offensive-threat-growing-faster-than-projected-us-air-force-general/articleshow/84623750.cms||---

Jammu-based defence spokesperson Lt. Col. Devender Anand said, “Indian Army and Pakistan Army exchanged sweets on the occasion of Eid-Al-Adha at the Line of Control (LoC) at the Poonch-Rawalakot crossing point and Mendhar-Hotspring (Tattapani) crossing point in Poonch district. It can be seen as a confidence-building measure in the backdrop of ongoing ceasefire between the two countries.” Similar engagements were held at Kaman Aman Setu in Uri and Tithwal crossing on Kishanganga river in Tangdhar, Kupwara. Anand said the gesture was appreciated by both the armies and is expected to promote goodwill and mutual trust. The BSF and Pakistan Rangers also exchanged sweets to mark Eid celebrations along the international border in Jammu region at Hiranagar, Samba, Ramgarh, RS Pura, Arnia and Pargwal sectors and Attari in Punjab. “There has been no cross-border shelling for a long time and farmers on both sides of the border have been able to carry out their farming activities peacefully,” a BSF spokesperson said. An official at Attari said the usual border tradition of greeting each other on significant and religious occasions was suspended after the outbreak of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-pakistan-forces-exchange-eid-sweets-for-first-time-since-pulwama/articleshow/84623826.cms||---

The woman's body was found near the small community of Rustic, about 100 miles (161 kilometers) northwest of Denver, after a mudslide sent a large amount of debris into a scenic, winding canyon Tuesday evening, destroying at least five structures, the Larimer County Sheriff's Office said. It's not clear if homes were destroyed or smaller buildings.  Divers were trying to recover the woman's body and a vehicle from the Cache la Poudre River that runs through Poudre Canyon west of Fort Collins, while crews on foot searched for the two missing men with help from drones, the sheriff's office said.  After the rain on Tuesday, the flooding occurred along a 30-mile (48-kilometer) stretch of Highway 14, a popular place for camping, fishing, and rafting during the summer. The flooding triggered about six mudslides, temporarily closing the road, a state Department of Transportation spokesperson told the Coloradoan newspaper. The debris left along the river included propane tanks, stovepipes, lawn chairs, dishes, and an American flag, the newspaper reported.  The area burned last year in the 326-square-mile (844-square-kilometer) Cameron Peak Fire, which likely contributed to the flooding and mudslides, sheriff's spokesman Jered Kramer said. Fires torch vegetation that usually helps absorb rain, making those areas more vulnerable to flooding, especially in steep sections. The soil in burned areas can also repel rain.  Rain and flooding was possible again Wednesday in the area, which is near where another wildfire, the East Troublesome Fire, chewed through land last year.  Mudslides in areas scorched by wildfires affected several other Colorado roadways, including Interstate 70 in the Glenwood Canyon area in western Colorado, which has repeatedly been closed by debris since last year's 640-square-mile (1,657-square-kilometer) Grizzly Creek wildfire.  Some 46 miles (74 kilometers) of the state's main east-west highway were closed because of mudslides overnight, and officials were watching for the possibility of more rain there, too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/woman-dead-2-missing-after-flooding-in-colorado-burn-area/articleshow/84623730.cms||---
---||World||Biden nominates Victoria Kennedy for Austria ambassadorship||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden is nominating Victoria Kennedy, an attorney and the widow of Sen. Ted Kennedy, to serve as his ambassador to Austria. He's naming a top political fundraiser - Comcast CEO David Cohen -- to serve as his ambassador to Canada, the White House said Wednesday.  Kennedy, a gun control advocate, came to know the president during the years when Biden served with her husband in the Senate.  She is the president of the board and co-founder of the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate, a non-partisan nonprofit that educates the public about the U.S. Senate, and also leads the education committee of the board of trustees for the Kennedy Center in Washington.  Kennedy has also served on the boards of gun control advocacy groups, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence in Washington, D.C., as well as Stop Handgun Violence in Boston. She founded the group Common Sense about Kids and Guns, aimed at reducing guns deaths and injuries to children.  Biden is also giving serious consideration to another member of the Kennedy family.  Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of President John F. Kennedy who served as ambassador to Japan during the Obama administration, is being weighed as a contender to serve in a high-profile ambassadorial role -- perhaps in Asia or Australia, according to a person familiar with the deliberations who was not authorized to comment.  Cohen is a top executive at the cable company Comcast and previously served as chief of staff to another powerful Biden ally, Ed Rendell, when Rendell was the mayor of Philadelphia. He was an early backer of the president's third White House run, hosting Biden's first 2020 presidential campaign fundraiser.  The White House also announced that Biden was nominating Jamie Harpootlian, a South Carolina attorney and influential Democrat in the early primary state, to serve as his ambassador to Slovenia. She is married to another powerful South Carolina Democratic operative and Biden ally, state Sen. Dick Harpootlian.  The president's victory in the South Carolina primary turned out to be the turning point for a campaign that struggled out of the gate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-nominates-victoria-kennedy-for-austria-ambassadorship/articleshow/84624004.cms||---
---||India||Navjot Singh Sidhu hosts '62 MLAs' in show of strength||CHANDIGARH/AMRITSAR: Navjot Singh Sidhu’s meeting with “62 MLAs” at his residence on Wednesday, followed by a trip to the Golden Temple to pray, MLAs in tow, was seen as a major show of strength by the newly appointed Punjab Congress chief in his running feud with chief minister Amarinder Singh. Those siding with Sidhu criticised Amarinder for refusing to meet the new PCC chief unless the latter tendered a public apology for his “derogatory” tweets against the CM. They advised the CM to agree to an unconditional truce. Amarinder had opposed the appointment of Sidhu as Punjab PCC president. Sidhu’s camp claimed that there were 62 (Congress has 80 MLAs) Congress MLAs, including Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Tript Singh Bajwa, Sunil Jakhar and Raja Waring, present when he went to the Golden Temple. The group then offered prayers at Durgiana Temple and Ram Tirath, and paid homage at Jallianwala Bagh. At Durgiana Temple, Sidhu, in a brief media interaction, said he was “happy with what he had received and his well-being was in the well-being of Punjab”. With the battle lines drawn, party insiders are concerned at the impact the slugfest could have on the functioning of the state government. Given Wednesday’s flaunting of MLAs and a few ministers by Sidhu, there are murmurs about the possibility of the Sidhu camp approaching AICC president Sonia Gandhi to replace Amarinder with Sidhu. A tweet on Wednesday by the PPCC chief seemed to hint at this: “Winds of Change — of the people, by the people, for the people, Chandigarh to Amritsar.” Punjab cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa said, “Capt Amarinder seems to be challenging the orders of the high command. If he had some reservations about Sidhu, he should have shared these during his meetings with Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Punjab AICC in-charge Harish Rawat. We all have to abide by the decision of the high command. No one can be allowed to indulge in indiscipline or to split the party.” Sidhu loyalist MLA Pargat Singh asked why he should apologise. “In that case, Capt Amarinder should also apologise to the people of Punjab for not solving the issues of the state. We should focus on the welfare of Punjab and shed personal ego. Amarinder should show magnanimity as it cannot be a clash of personalities.” Congress MLA Madanlal Jalalpur, too, backed Sidhu: “The CM should show a large heart and make up with Sidhu. His advisers are not giving him the right advice. Partap Singh Bajwa never apologised to Capt Amarinder but the two have called a truce.” Randhawa added that they were “loyal to the party, not to any individual”. He said they had “sided with Captain Saab because of the party” and that today, too, they stood with the party. “Shortcoming has been because of the advisers. Will retired officers and the CMO dictate terms to us? The party workers are demoralised. We have been raising issues like the power purchase agreements (PPAs).” Randhawa said he did not agree with his cabinet colleague Brahm Mohindra’s views on supporting the CM over the apology demanded of Sidhu. “He should have facilitated a meeting between the two,” he said. “Look at the derogatory words that Sukhpal Khaira used against the CM during the Assembly session. The dispute between Amarinder and Partap Bajwa had flared up and we had welcomed Bajwa despite being Amarinder loyalists. There is no place for indiscipline in Congress,” said Randhawa, adding that he, along with Tript Bajwa and Sukhbinder Sarkaria, had gone to the house of Punjab Mandi Board chairman Lal Singh to convey that they, along with Sidhu, would walk up to the CM if he agreed to meet. Another Congress MLA, Amarinder Singh Raja Warring, said, “I believe there is some annoyance (sic) between Amarinder and Sidhu, which will be resolved soon... There are differences between leaders of other parties as well.” A political analyst saw the developments as the end of the Amarinder era in the party. “A formidable group of Amarinder loyalists is now siding with Sidhu as if they have realised, or have been told, that Amarinder has not delivered his promises in the last four-and-a-half years, and the same could cost Congress dearly in the assembly elections,” analyst Kuldip Singh said. Sidhu and the MLAs backing him have decided to invite Capt Singh to Sidhu’s installation ceremony at Congress Bhavan in Chandigarh on Friday. It remains to be seen whether Amarinder will be willing to bury the hatchet and attend in the absence of a public apology by Sidhu. Sources said a letter to this effect was endorsed by the MLAs who had converged on Sidhu’s residence in Amritsar to make a request for Amarinder’s presence. Working president Kuljit Singh Nagra has been deputed to hand over the letter to Amarinder on Thursday and he has sought an appointment with the CMO. However, sources close to Amarinder, said no such letter had been received by the CM till Wednesday evening. Cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa confirmed the development to TOI, adding that he had made a prior attempt on behalf of Sidhu to reach out to Amarinder through a loyalist, former MLA Lal Singh. He, however, rejected reports that the MLAs passed any resolution in Amritsar. “We had gone there to pay obeisance at the Golden temple and not to pass any resolutions,” he said. Harish Rawat is likely to attend the event. There are plans to invite Rahul Gandhi for the official takeover, besides Congress leader Kamal Nath and the Rajasthan CM. However, there was no official confirmation of this. “On Tuesday evening, a message was sent out to the MLAs to come over to Amritsar, and those present signed the letter to the CM. There were around 60 MLAs present at Sidhu’s residence. Any new president who takes over goes to the Golden Temple, but in this case the entire turn of events is being overhyped due to the annoyance of the CM,” said an MLA. Sources in the party said that the Congress leadership was in touch with both sides and that the decision by the Sidhu camp to offer an olive branch to Amarinder with an invitation followed their intervention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/navjot-singh-sidhu-hosts-62-mlas-in-show-of-strength/articleshow/84624035.cms||Vibhor Mohan
---||World||Infrastructure bill fails first vote; Senate to try again||WASHINGTON: Senate Republicans rejected an effort Wednesday to begin debate on a big infrastructure deal that a bipartisan group of senators brokered with President Joe Biden. But supporters in both parties remained hopeful of another chance in coming days.  Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York had scheduled the procedural vote that he described as a step to "get the ball rolling" as talks progress. But Republicans mounted a filibuster, saying the bipartisan group needed more time to wrap up the deal and review the details. They sought a delay until Monday.  The party-line vote was 51-49 against proceeding, far short of the 60 "yes" votes needed to get past the Republicans' block. The Democratic leader switched his vote to "no" at the end, a procedural step that would allow him to move to reconsider.  The nearly $1 trillion measure over five years includes about $579 billion in new spending on roads, broadband and other public works projects - a first phase of Biden's infrastructure agenda, to be followed by a much broader $3.5 trillion second measure from Democrats next month.  Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, a lead negotiator, flashed a thumbs up sign as he ducked into a private lunch before the vote, indicating the senators had sent Schumer a letter seeking more time. "We will be ready by the end of this week," he said during a CNBC interview.  Six months after Biden took office, his signature "Build Back Better" campaign promise is at a key moment that will test the presidency and his hopes for a new era of bipartisan cooperation in Washington.  Biden, who headed to Ohio later Wednesday to promote his economic policies, is calling his infrastructure agenda a "blue-collar blueprint for building an American economy back." He has said that Americans are overwhelmingly in support of his plan.  However, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has said big spending is "the last thing American families need." White House aides and the bipartisan group of senators have huddled privately every day since Sunday trying to wrap up the deal, which would be a first phase of an eventual $4 trillion-plus package of domestic outlays - not just for roads and bridges, but foundations of everyday life including child care, family tax breaks, education and an expansion of Medicare for seniors.  The next steps are uncertain, but the bipartisan group insists it is close to a deal and expects to finish soon. The senators were joined for a private lunch ahead of the vote by the two leaders of the House's Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan group generally supportive of the effort.  Senators from the Republican side asked to delay the vote, and 11 Republicans signed on to a letter to Schumer saying they would support moving forward with a yes vote on Monday, if certain details about the package are ready.  Schumer said senators are in the fourth week of negotiations after reaching agreement on a broad framework for infrastructure spending with the White House. He said Wednesday's vote was not meant to be a deadline for having every detail worked out.  "My colleagues are well aware that we often agree to move forward with debates on issues before we have the text in hand," Schumer said. "We've done it twice this year already."  McConnell called the vote a "stunt" that would fail, but emphasized senators were "still negotiating in good faith across the aisle."  "Around here, we typically write the bills before we vote on them," he said.  A core group of Republicans are interested in pursuing a more modest package of traditional highway and public works projects, about $600 billion in new funds, and say they just need more time to negotiate with their Democratic colleagues and the White House.  Republican Sen. Todd Young of Indiana was among the Republicans who signed the letter seeking the delay and said he was "cautiously optimistic" they can reach a bipartisan deal.  Senators from the bipartisan group emerged upbeat Tuesday from another late-night negotiating session with Biden aides at the Capitol, saying a deal was within reach and a failed vote Wednesday would not be the end of the road.  In fact, Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said the test vote Wednesday could be useful in helping to "advance and expedite" the process.  "We are so close," said Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana.  Biden has been in touch with both Democrats and Republicans for several days, and his outreach will continue "until he has both pieces of legislation on his desk to sign them into law," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday.  While Biden proposes paying for his proposals with a tax hike on corporations and wealthy Americans who earn more than $400,000 a year, the bipartisan group has been working almost around the clock to figure out a compromise way to pay for its package, having dashed ideas for boosting the gas tax drivers pay at the pump or strengthening the Internal Revenue Service to go after tax scofflaws.  Instead, senators in the bipartisan group are considering rolling back a Trump-era rule on pharmaceutical rebates that could bring in some $170 billion to be used for infrastructure. They are also still haggling over public transit funds.  Ten Republicans would have been needed in the evenly split Senate to join all 50 Democrats in reaching the 60-vote threshold required to advance the bill past a filibuster to formal consideration. Schumer can set another vote to proceed to the bill later.  Many Republicans are wary of moving ahead with the first, relatively slim package, fearing it will pave the way for the broader $3.5 trillion effort Democrats are preparing to pass on their own under special budget rules that only require 51 votes. Vice President Kamala Harris can break a tie.  Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been working to keep restless liberal Democrats in her chamber in line, as rank-and-file lawmakers grow impatient with the sluggish Senate pace.  "Time's a-wasting, I want to get this work done," Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told reporters Tuesday.  Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, dismissed the Senate's bipartisan effort as inadequate. He wants more robust spending on the transportation elements and said, "We want an opportunity to actually negotiate."  Democrats hope to show progress on that bill before lawmakers leave Washington for their recess in August.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/infrastructure-bill-fails-first-vote-senate-to-try-again/articleshow/84624046.cms||---
---||India||UP seeks SC okay to install statues in public places||NEW DELHI: Keen to install statues of saints, religious leaders, political figures, freedom fighters and martyrs in public places, the Yogi Adityanath government has moved the Supreme Court seeking relaxation of its eight-year-old order banning such activities. The SC’s order came in a case from Gujarat, where a 2006 court order for removal of religious structures encroaching public places, including roads, at Vadodara had led a mob to pelt the district court with stones and damage vehicles. A series of reports by TOI on this incident was taken cognisance of by the Gujarat HC, which directed the authorities to remove all religious structures from public places. Times ViewThe decision of the apex court eight years ago was arrived at after thoughtful deliberation and has served the nation well. Whatever the UP government’s reason for demanding a relook, the earlier decision need not be altered unless there’s an extremely compelling reason to do so.It had led to further impasse. However, the then UPA government at the Centre moved the SC and got a stay. After passing several orders, often in vain, for removal of illegal structures from public places over the years, the SC on January 18, 2013 directed state governments “not to grant any permission for installation of any statue or construction of any structure in public roads, pavements, side-walks and other public utility places”. The SC had clarified that this order would not apply to installation of high mast lights, streetlights or construction relating to electrification, traffic, toll or for development and beautification of streets, highways, roads and relating to public utility services. The UP government’s application, moved last year, came up before the SC for hearing on Monday, only to be adjourned for two weeks again on the request of the state counsel. The UP government said, “Many a time, it is desirable to raise a statue of some religious or political figure for development of an unused or ignored land in a picnic spot or something alike and such statue etc helps that place to be developed and established properly and also to be maintained in a better way.” Seeking relaxation of the 2013 ban on installation of statutes, the state said it was seeking directions and guidelines for erecting statues at abandoned public places and road-dividers. It said, “Raising statues on road-dividers would not cause inconvenience to the general public and serve aesthetic purposes. Erecting statues on such public places connect people of that area to their cultural roots and reflect the same to visitors and it makes people relate with the place. It helps in encouraging tourism and preserving the culture and history of that particular place or region.” “Guidelines may be issued for raising statues of freedom fighters, martyrs and great Indian saints in order to instil a sense of patriotism and values in the populace and future generations... Having statues would help the place look aesthetic and better maintained without causing any prejudice to anyone,” the state said. It said, “Blanket ban on raising of any statue in any public place is ambiguous. The Supreme Court may kindly issue necessary directions clarifying the nature and extent of the structures, statues and public space to be utilised for such purpose.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/up-seeks-sc-okay-to-install-statues-in-public-places/articleshow/84624075.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Her first effort at reaching out to audiences beyond the state — since she defeated BJP in the battle for Bengal — through a virtual address, saw leaders of opposition parties attending the screening of her speech at the Constitution Club in Delhi, where she virtually made an appointment to meet the opposition leaders next week when she plans to be in Delhi, for the first time after winning a third term in office in May NCP chief Sharad Pawar and his daughter and party MP Supriya Sule, senior Congress leaders P Chidambaram and Digvijay Singh, Samajwadi Party MPs Jaya Bacchan and Ramgopal Yadav, DMK MP Thiruchi Siva, AAP MP Sanjay Singh, RJD’s Manoj Jha, Keshav Rao (TRS), Priyanka Chaturvedi (Shiv Sena) and Balwinder Singh Bhundar of the Shiromani Akali Dal were seated among the TMC MPs present at the programme. The party’s second “virtual rally” in as many years was beamed live across several thousand venues in Bengal and other states. Giant screens were put up across Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Tripura, Delhi and Tamil Nadu to beam the TMC chief’s virtual address. Mamata asked Pawar and Chidambaram whether a meeting of opposition parties could be arranged on July 27, 28 or 29, when she would be in Delhi. “At least we can talk,” she said, adding that she was planning a rally at Kolkata’s Brigade Parade Ground “if the Covid situation is over... during the winter” for which she would send out invites to all opposition leaders and CMs. However, she made it clear that she didn’t harbour prime ministerial ambitions. “I am only a worker. I will carry out instructions of senior leaders,” she said. “Elections are two-and-a-half years away but we need to start work together. (Even) independence is at risk with BJP — a highly loaded virus, even worse than corona — in office,” she said, adding that the BJP-led government was now “only a conductor of (central) agencies”. “BJP-r mogoje morubhoomi (BJP has a barren brain),” she added, accusing the Centre of being a “monumental failure” in tackling Covid. “The PM praises UP’s handling of Covid when bodies are dumped in the Ganga and it is left to us to find and cremate them with the respect they deserve. They do not respect even the dead. Where are the vaccines? We need 14 crore vaccines, have got only 2.1 crore. When will everyone be vaccinated?” she asked. Mamata showcased the Bengal model of development and urged states to replicate it. “Bengal is the model and not Gujarat. We all have seen what happened to Gujarat,” she said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/didi-tries-to-rally-opposition-for-2024-but-says-no-pm-aspirations/articleshow/84624104.cms||---

The Delta variant — which has high transmissibility and is more virulent as compared to others — contributed to a majority of clinical cases in vaccine breakthrough (infections post vaccination) but very few cases needed hospitalisation, a latest study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) shows. Only 9.8% cases required hospitalisation and fatality was as low as 0.4%. Read AlsoDelta variant of Covid-19 mutates into Delta Plus: All you need to knowNEW DELHI: Around 40 cases of the Delta plus variant, classified as a variant of concern (VOC), have been detected sporadically in Maharashtra, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh, the Union health ministry said on Wednesday. The govt has written to these states to take up immediate containment measures inUnderlining the importance of vaccination and the need to continue with Covid-appropriate behaviour like use of masks, physical distancing and hand hygiene, INSACOG said: "Continuing outbreaks across India are attributable to Delta, a susceptible population, and opportunities for transmission. Public health measures to reduce transmission and vaccination remain critical." Read AlsoCovid Delta variant to dominate within months: WHODelta, which was first detected in India, has now been recorded in 124 territories - 13 more than last week - and already accounts for more than three-quarters of sequenced specimens in many major countries, the WHO said.Even outside India, Delta remains the most rapidly rising lineage globally that is responsible for multiple outbreaks, including in Southeast Asia, which shows the fastest growth in new cases globally. However, regions with high vaccination and strong public health measures, such as Singapore, continue to do well. Even as a growing range of mutations are seen in the UK, the US and India, other "variants of concerns" (VOCs) continue to be very low in India and are declining relative to Delta globally, the consortia said. "While these mutations will be tracked and investigated, there is currently no evidence of any new Delta sub-lineage that is of greater concern than Delta," INSACOG said in its latest bulletin. Clusters of cases containing new mutations of known clinical significance will continue to be specifically looked for, it added. Several districts in Kerala and Maharashtra are seeing a spurt in cases, whereas many in Rajasthan and north-eastern states are also seeing high positivity. On Tuesday, 42,015 new cases were recorded from across the country. The Delta variant (B1617.2), which was first detected in India and is now sweeping the globe, represents 87% of the sequenced samples in May and June in India. According to the US CDC, the variant represents 83% of Covid-19 sequenced samples in America. The latest national serological survey conducted by the ICMR shows around one-third of the general population is still vulnerable to infection. Health officials have also pointed that some states and districts in particular where positivity is high can also lead to further spread, causing a third wave.

---||Business||WHO boss says vaccine IP waiver not a property 'snatch'||GENEVA: The World Health Organization on Wednesday sought to reassure pharmaceutical companies that a proposal to suspend patent rights on Covid-19 vaccines was not a bid to "snatch" their intellecutual property rights. With more than four million dead and the toll likely to reach much higher, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said vaccine makers should be offered incentives in return for temporarily waiving their rights. "Of course, we can't snatch your property," Tedros said via video link from Tokyo at the start of a meeting with the World Trade Organization, pharma companies and global financial institutions. "With so many lives on the line, profits and patents must come second," he said, without giving any details on the proposed financial incentives. Waiving intellectual property rights would help meet the 11 billion doses of vaccine the WHO says are needed to protect 70 percent of people in every country by mid-2022. This is the second meeting in Geneva to try to bridge differences on how to increase supply of jabs and cut the vaccine inequity that sees rich countries eyeing booster shots while health workers in poor countries go without. Of the 1.1 billion doses produced globally in June, "only 1.4 percent went to Africans, who account for 17 percent of the global population", WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweal said in her opening speech. "Only 0.24 percent went to people in low-income countries. And both shares declined even further in the first half of July," she said. In addition to the suspension of patents, barriers to the trade in vaccine ingredients must be removed and laboratories agree to transfer their technology, Tedros said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/who-boss-says-vaccine-ip-waiver-not-a-property-snatch/articleshow/84624370.cms||---

Indian security establishment officials on Wednesday said latest intelligence reports also show China has even made it “mandatory” for each Tibetan family to send at least one young male member for recruitment in the PLA in some areas like the Ngari Prefecture of the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR). The stepped-up recruitment of Tibetans and the increase in PLA activity in all sectors stretching from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh along the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control come ahead of the 12th round of corps commander-level talks between India and China. Read AlsoIndia closely watching Xi’s ‘intriguing move’ on LACIndia is closely examining President Xi Jinping’s “unusual and intriguing move” to replace the overall commander of the Western Theatre Command (WTC), which handles the border with India, barely seven months after he took charge. Xu Qiling (58), commander of the ground forces in the western theatreThe military talks, after a long gap since the 11th round on April 9, will be held towards end-July or early-August in another bid to de-escalate tensions in the 14-month military confrontation in eastern Ladakh. “The stalled troop disengagement at Gogra and Hot Springs may be taken forward. But any resolution of the blocking of Indian patrols by the PLA in the Depsang region is not on the cards as of now,” said an official. Read AlsoLhasa building boom heightens divisions in TibetA huge infrastructure and building drive in Tibet has brought airports, roads, railways and new flats, which Beijing says are improving life across the remote mountainous plateau.The frenetic pace at which the PLA has converted its temporary structures, ammunition dumps, helipads and surface-to-air missile batteries across Ladakh into permanent positions as well as upgraded its major air bases like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa (Ngari Gunsa), Lhasa-Gonggar and Shigatse for additional fighters and bombers, clearly indicates China has no plans to de-escalate any time soon. There is also the renewed focus on the induction of Tibetans in militias as well as in the Special Tibetan Army Unit (STAU) under the PLA, with concerted drives being conducted in the TAR with an element of coercion, said officials. The PLA has also recruited over 70 Tibetan students, aged between 17 to 20, from various universities for admission in the military academy in TAR this year. “It is also engaging Tibetan residents of border villages, who have good topographical knowledge of the LAC, to work as guides to accompany its patrolling parties,” said an official. As was earlier reported by TOI, the PLA has simultaneously raised a new set of militias in the Chumbi valley, opposite Sikkim, under the Yatung County in the TAR. One of these militias is known as ‘Mimang Cheton’ (MC), which means 'for the public’, and consists of local Tibetan youths trained by the PLA. At least two batches of MC, with around 100 youths in one batch, have been deployed at various locations in Chumbi Valley in areas like Yutung, Cheema, Rinchengang, PB Thang and Phari after having finished their training.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-woos-young-tibetans-to-join-pla/articleshow/84624395.cms||Rajat Pandit

Heroin consignments are frequently being caught at airports in the past few weeks, with three cases in Hyderabad alone. It is suspected that heroin is sourced from Afghanistan and destined to Australia and other western countries via Mozambique, Johannesburg, Doha, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and New Delhi. In all the three cases booked in Hyderabad, mules from African countries travelled from Johannesburg.

From there, it goes to Johannesburg, Doha and then to Indian cities, and is further destined to Australia and other countries. They (smugglers) are avoiding South Africans and using other African nationals to avoid agencies in Johannesburg. While the Taliban is the source, the operation is done by African drug cartels. What is caught at the airports could be the tip of the iceberg. Seaports are the real concern,” a senior DRI official told TOI.

Local terror recruitment too was lower at 57 cases till July 16 this year as compared to 73 in the first half of 2020. Sources in the central security establishment attributed the positive signs to concerted efforts by the UT administration to engage J&K youths with entrepreneurship initiatives and recreational activities like sports, etc. Of the 57 locals who joined terror ranks until July 16 this year, 34 have been neutralised and 11 have surrendered, leaving only 12 new recruits still active, as per data related to terrorism in J&K accessed by TOI. As many as 78 terrorists were killed in counter-terror operations across the UT till July 16 this year, down from 123 in the first half of 2020. Officials said the lower numbers were largely on account of the slowdown in counter-terror engagements coinciding with the lockdown imposed due to the second wave of Covid-19. “The encounters have picked up in the past few days and many terrorists have been neutralised,” said an officer. Around half a dozen security force personnel were killed till July 16 this year, as against 62 security personnel killed through 2020. Also, 14 civilians were killed by terrorists this year (till July 16) as against 37 killed through last year. Explaining the fall in numbers of local youths joining terror outfits, a senior government official claimed that the push to entrepreneurship through measures such as offering commercial vehicles to youngsters for self-employment, skill development initiatives and constructive engagement through sports and other recreational activities helped dissuade local youths from picking up the gun. A total clampdown on gatherings at funerals of slain terrorists ensured that there were no “breeding grounds” for potential terrorists. “It was noticed that funerals of felled terrorists offered conducive conditions for radicalising young Kashmiris to rebel and choosing the path of violence. Each funeral would earlier drive at least 3-4 locals to join terrorism,” an officer told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/big-dip-in-jk-terror-incidents-in-2021/articleshow/84624531.cms||Bharti Jain

Russia yet to decide||NEW DELHI: Even as it backs a stronger role for India in the Afghanistan peace process, Russia is yet to make up its mind on India’s participation in the extended troika format involving US, China, Russia and Pakistan. The group is promoting a negotiated settlement with comprehensive and permanent ceasefire. After Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov’s remark last week in Tashkent that Moscow was considering India and Iran’s participation in the format, President Vladimir Putin’s special envoy for Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, said India can’t join the group because “it has no influence with the Taliban”. “The format of the extended troika ...is convened exclusively to facilitate the launch of the intra-Afghan talks leading to national accord. Only countries that have an unequivocal influence on both sides (of the conflict) participate,” said Kabulov in Moscow on Tuesday. Kabulov, according to Russian agency TASS, said that India-Pakistan “contradictions” were being “projected” on the Afghanistan situation. “The Indians suspect the Pakistanis of striving to use Afghanistan as a strategic rear (sic). The Pakistanis suspect India of wanting to use Afghan territories to harm Pakistan’s interests,” he said. Asked about Kabulov’s remarks, diplomatic sources said he meant to say that the format remained unchanged as Moscow is yet to take adecision on India’s participation. Reacting to media queries, the embassy said that Russia’s “dedicated cooperation” with India as an active participant in dialogue mechanisms on Afghan issues and “the special and privileged strategic partner is natural, trusted and forward-looking”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-in-extended-troika-on-afghanistan-russia-yet-to-decide/articleshow/84624581.cms||---

She urged the Supreme Court to take suo motu cognisance of the Pegasus row and order a probe by a special investigation team. “Pegasus, dangerous, ferocious,” said Mamata, holding up her phone —with the camera lens covered by a plaster tape — while addressing her party’s Martyrs’ Day rally. “Only the judiciary and people can save this democracy." "They are snooping on Abhishek (Banerjee) and Prashant Kishor. I talk to them. My phone is tapped. So I have plastered it,” she said, urging voters to “plaster” the BJP government to save India from being ruined. “All opposition leaders know their phones are being tapped. I cannot speak to Sharad Pawarji, Chidambaramji or other opposition leaders and CMs even if I want to. We are being snooped and spied on by the Centre,” said Mamata. “But snooping on us will not save BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha poll,” she said, adding: “You stooped so low but Bengal did not choose you.” “Pegasus would be the Modi government’s “nabhishwas” (last breath) as India has become a surveillance state. “Pegasus is worse than the Watergate scandal,” she said. “There are three important things in a democracy — media, judiciary and the Election Commission — and Pegasus has captured all three. I would appeal to the SC to come to the nation’s help. Save the country, save our democracy. Can’t you (SC) take suo motu cognisance when even phones of judges are being tapped? Please set up a special investigation team,” said Mamata. “There is spy-giri going on. While vaccines and medicines are scarce, they are spending money on surveillance. Phones of even their own ministers are being tapped. They cannot even trust their own,” she said. Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh on Wednesday pointed a finger at the CM and her government, alleging they have been using Pegasus spyware for long. “Mamata Banerjee and her government use the spyware to keep a tab on opposition and her own men.

With the Pegasus Project releasing reports of widespread snooping over the past few days, EGI said it is shocked over the “brazen and unconstitutional attack” on freedom of speech and press. “This act of snooping essentially conveys that journalism and political dissent are now equated with ‘terror’. How can a constitutional democracy survive if governments do not make an effort to protect freedom of speech and allows surveillance with such impunity?” an EGI statement said. Demanding that the Supreme Court-led inquiry committee comprise people with impeccable credibility from all walks of life, including journalism and civil society, EGI added, “This is a moment that demands deep introspection and inquiry into the kind of society we are heading towards, and how far we may have veered away from the democratic values enshrined in our Constitution.” With NSO, the Israeli company that manufactures the Pegasus spyware, claiming that it only sells the software to government clients vetted by the Government of Israel, the Pegasus Project reports, EGI said, “deepens suspicion of involvement of Indian government agencies in snooping on it’s own citizens”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/editors-guild-wants-sc-monitored-probe/articleshow/84624638.cms||---

The report in ‘The Wire’ said the then Maharashtra government had set up a special investigation unit to investigate firms that were allegedly selling or releasing unapproved herbicide-tolerant (HT) transgenic cotton, or Bt cotton, seeds in the state. “A few months prior to the formation of the SIT, in October 2017, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) had also set up the Field Inspection and Scientific Evaluation Committee (FISEC), under the department of Biotechnology, to probe the proliferation of unlawful seeds,” the report said. Former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis has said no illegal surveillance took place when he was in office. “In 2018, as both probes continued, the phone numbers of six officials from Mahyco Monsanto Biotech (India) Pvt. Lt and Monsanto India were selected as possible candidates for surveillance, investigations under the Pegasus Project e revealed,” according to the web portal. Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel on Wednesday claimed his government has authentic information that representatives of NSO, which manufactures the spyware, had visited the state in a secret mission when it was being governed by BJP, according to ‘The Wire’ report.

The committee said there has been a drastic drop in reporting levels by states. States should tell vaccinators to report all events of concern occurring within 28 days of Covid-19 vaccination, committee head NK Arora said, adding that the reports should be uploaded on CoWin platform. Due to low reporting, India may be missing rare adverse events that could be of relevance to the community, Indian regulators and other countries, as some vaccines here are also deployed globally, he said. Malini Aisola, co-convenor of the All India Drug Action Network, said the current reporting system is extremely weak and unresponsive. “Many people have faced difficulties while reporting AEFI, let alone securing medical support from the vaccination programme, even though there is a provision for medical management in the protocols,” she said. She said the quality of evidence while probing AEFI at the local level is very poor with many events being brushed aside as unrelated to vaccination, even before the evidence has been collected. The slow pace of reporting, too, does not serve the purpose as only 91 AEFI investigations were completed till May 27. Recently, the AEFI committee approved a report of 60 serious adverse events, ruling that 55 of them — most of which needed hospitalisation — were associated with vaccination as per the causality assessment. The remaining five cases, including the death of a 57-yearold man in February after a Covishield jab, were ruled as “coincidental” and not directly linked to vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/may-be-missing-rare-aefi-due-to-poor-reporting-by-states-panel/articleshow/84624685.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Class-XI cut-offs raised marginally||KOLKATA: The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education has after almost 17 years increased the cut-off in certain subjects for a student to take up science based-elective subjects in Class XI. The minimum percentage has been increased from 34% to 45%. The last revision was in 2004. Principals and teachers of government and government-aided schools said the cut-off has been raised as 100% Madhyamik candidates this year passed and more than 90% scored a first division. After Madhyamik was cancelled due to the pandemic, the final scores were calculated, based on a formula, considering Class IX annual exam and Class X internal test marks. But the revised percentage might not affect students this year owing to the high scores and almost all are expected to meet the criteria. “Almost every student this year is likely to qualify for the 45% cut-off this year as Madhyamik was not held and marks were awarded based on Class IX annual exam and Class X internal exams,” said Hardas Ghatak, president of Advance Society for Headmaster & Headmistresses. “But next year or whenever exams are held next, this new criteria will mean many students may not qualify for those subjects. The council must review the decision.” West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education on Wednesday also published dates for Class XI admissions. Schools will admit their own students between August 2 and 14. Students from other schools will be admitted between August 16 and 31. This year, almost 11 lakh students cleared Madhyamik but higher secondary does not have so many seats. “Fewer seats will lead to difficulty in accommodating all the students. Schools up to Class X can’t be upgraded to Class XII overnight. Those with HS classes can take in only a handful,” said Saugata Basu, general secretary, West Bengal Government Teachers’ Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/class-xi-cut-offs-raised-marginally/articleshow/84623485.cms||Zeeshan Javed

RCP Singh, who was chosen the JD(U) president on December 27 last year, is under pressure to quit the party’s top post ever since he was inducted into the Narendra Modi cabinet on July 7 this year. Voices are being raised within the party that Singh should sacrifice one of the two posts on the principle of ‘one man one post’. The ongoing pressure politics came to the fore on Sunday when Singh, while addressing a meeting of Bihar JD(U) office-bearers, categorically said he was capable of working both as a Union minister and the party president. “I will perform the role of a minister firmly along with working for the organization with the same zeal. But, if the party decides, I will definitely give this responsibility to a ‘strong colleague’,” Singh had said, giving enough hint about a likely change of guard in the JD(U)’s top leadership in the days to come. Sources in JD(U) said Bihar CM Nitish Kumar has given enough hints to senior party leaders to ‘elect’ a new party chief at the forthcoming national executive body meeting. Former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha, who merged his 8-year-old Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) with JD(U) on March 14 this year, is said to be the front-runner for the top party post. It was a “homecoming” for Kushwaha, who had quit the JD(U) in January 2013 after political differences with Nitish and formed the RLSP on March 3, 2013. Soon after the merger, Nitish appointed Kushwaha as the JD(U)’s national parliamentary board chairman. Subsequently, Kushwaha was made an MLC on the JD(U) symbol and also allotted a huge bungalow in the state capital. Nitish, while addressing the JD(U) Bihar unit office-bearers’ meeting on Sunday, also praised Upendra’s recent move to tour different districts of the state to strengthen the organization. When contacted, JD(U)’s national spokesperson KC Tyagi told TOI, “As of now, the agenda of the July 31 meeting is not finalized. But all senior party leaders are expected to attend the meeting.” Talking to reporters on Wednesday, Upendra Kushwaha said, “The party’s national executive meeting is scheduled to be held on July 31. Since the agenda is so far not very much clear, discussion can be held on any issue. It is some way a routine meeting. The executive body meeting has to meet once in a year. Last year’s meeting was held in December. This year’s meeting has not been held so far. Hence, this meeting has been called.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-natl-executive-on-july-31-may-elect-new-party-president/articleshow/84622273.cms||Madan Kumar

It is unfortunate for students with good academic record. More institutions will start relying on entrance tests for postgraduate admissions. Many autonomous colleges in the city have already started doing this,” he said. Mumbai University has conducted three semester exams in the pandemic so far. As the final exam for the outgoing batch of 2020 was done in a hurry in October, there was no scope to control the exaggerated results. The exams were decentralised and conducted independently by colleges. Question papers only had MCQs then. TimesViewMumbai University could have evolved methods after the first two exams to bring in uniformity. If conducting online exams across seven districts simultaneously is not a solution, it could do random checks to ensure quality of question papers is maintained and proctoring methods and software are robust.After two exams, while the university made an attempt to bring in uniformity in postgraduate exams this semester (May 2021) by setting their timetable and question papers, a large number of undergraduate exams are still decentralised and are being held at college cluster level. “For undergraduate professional courses such as engineering, law, pharmacy and architecture, the university changed the question paper pattern to include 50% subjective questions, where results were slightly still better,” said Vinod Patil, director, board of examination and evaluation. While individual scores are not unrealistic with the changes introduced, a large number of students continue to clear the exam. Pune University, on the contrary, has continued to hold centralised exams even in the pandemic to maintain uniformity. After introducing video proctoring, the current exam also used audio proctoring for exams. MU may consider centralising more exams in October, said Patil. A principal pointed out that difficulty level of question papers also makes a difference. “If high-order-thinking questions are included as MCQs, it will not be easier for students to score. But the online teaching-learning process is not the same as offline. If difficult questions are included, students may agitate, so many colleges may prefer to keep it simple,” said the principal. All this, however, will have a bearing on jobs. “A majority of university students even in non-Covid times were not considered employable, this will only prove to be a disaster,” he added. Employers will know students have cleared their graduation in Covid times. It will be worse for batches who have not seen college at all, said a principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaiinstitutes-will-rely-on-entrance-test-over-results/articleshow/84624087.cms||Yogita Rao

This revision on tariff has reflected in the average non-Covid medical claims.For example, 65-year-old Ramalingam (name changed on request), who underwent two surgeries – Bypass and valve replacement- was charged at Rs 6.4 lakh, of which, about Rs 1.5 lakh of the bill was quoted under additional charges for Covid disposables.. A senior admin official at Chennai-based multispecialty hospital confirmed there is a change in the tariff of non-covid surgery packages this year. Over the past five years, there has not been any revision in hospitalization and surgery package charges. However, now there has been an additional cost of Rs 30,000 under room charges due to Covid-19 outbreak. A knee-replacement surgery which was charged under a package of Rs 3.5 lakh in 2019, now is quoted for Rs 4 lakh.Max Bupa Health Insurance company recorded a 60% increase in non-Covid related claims in July, over April and May, 2021. “The claims size has also increased significantly. We do not understand this need for tariff revision for non-covid treatment, this will eventually have bearing on the claims,” said Bhabatosh Mishra, its director of underwriting, products & claims. Suman Pal, SVP, Head of Claims, Acko General Insurance says there is atleast a 5% rise in the claims sizes besides the usual annual inflation-led increase of 12%-15%. Hospitals conduct pre-surgery tests from HIV, haemogram to blood sugar level, which now includes mandatory Covid test too. Hence, this will add to an additional one-day hospitalization charge till the test results come. Hospitals have also tightened their sanitation and hygiene protocol, which has added up to the cost such as PPE kits, room hygiene costs, etc. These additional Covid charges are built well above the surgery package quoted.Amit Chhabra, head of health insurance at Policybazaar.com, says the average claims size of – both Covid and non-Covid- has gone up from Rs 40,000 to upto 80,000 between March, 2020 and now. The average claim amount for Covid 19 claims stands at Rs 1,18,000 while for non Covid it was Rs 78,600.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/non-covid-claims-size-on-the-rise-as-hospitals-revise-tariffs-citing-covid-management-costs/articleshow/84623037.cms||Mamtha Asokan
---||Delhi||Delhi: Transport department may seek some relaxation in seating norms for buses, Metro||NEW DELHI: Delhi Metro and bus commuters may get some reprieve from long queues at metro stations and crowding at bus stops. The transport department is likely to propose some relaxation in the stringent norms regarding seating capacity in public transport to Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA). A complete lockdown was imposed in Delhi from April 19 due to the exponential rise in number of Covid-19 cases and positivity rate. Since May 31, as both the figures have been coming down, the gradual unlock process was initiated. However, despite the gradual relaxation in economic activities, stringent curbs on the number of passengers allowed in public transport have remained unchanged since June 7, when even those not engaged in essential services were allowed to travel by metro and buses. Since then, only 50% seating is allowed in both Delhi Metro trains and public transport buses and no standing passengers are allowed in either, which has led to a drastic dip in the carrying capacity of both modes of transport. As a large number of people have returned to work and markets and commercial complexes have reopened, the demand for public transport has increased substantially too. However, due to the strict norms put in place to curb the spread of Covid-19, hapless commuters are compelled to wait for nearly an hour on average to enter busy metro stations during peak hours and bus stops also remain crowded at rush hour. Sources said that the transport department was likely to propose that full seating might be allowed in public transport in view of the low number of new Covid-19 cases being reported at present and the positivity rate hovering around 0.1%. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), however, wants standing passengers to be allowed to travel in its trains. Last month, DMRC had written a letter to the divisional commissioner of Delhi, who is also secretary, DDMA, requesting that standing passengers be allowed since metro systems are designed to provide more standing capacity in order to carry large number of commuters during peak hours. It had written that at present, its carrying capacity has been reduced to 10-15% of the capacity its train coaches are designed for. Apart from problems faced by commuters, the reduced carrying capacity is also resulting in revenue losses. DMRC’s managing director Mangu Singh had recently told TOI that the corporation is spending two and a half times the amount it is earning from passenger revenue and other sources to keep the network operational.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/transport-dept-may-seek-some-relaxation-in-seating-norms-for-buses-metro/articleshow/84623540.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Kolkata||Season’s first good hilsa catch fails to bring down prices in Kolkata||KOLKATA: The first good catch of hilsa after a gap of nearly two years brought cheer to fishermen, but not to customers. The absence of mid-sized hilsa weighing 800g-900g pushed the price of those weighing 1kg or more to Rs 1,800 a kg, forcing the fish practically beyond reach of average households. Amrita Roychowdhury had been delighted when she spotted the fish at Lake Market, but the price left her flabbergasted. “We have been waiting for hilsa for over a month now. So when I saw the fish on Wednesday, I could not help but get drawn to it. My grandson has been asking me when we would have hilsa this season. Unfortunately, I had to defer the purchase because the price was atrocious,” she said. The sky-high price, however, did not deter Abhaya Das Roy from buying a 1.2kg fish for Rs 1,900. “I just couldn’t miss the opportunity. The wait has been long enough. By the shape and size of the fish, I can tell it will be great to taste,” he said. Vendors hoped more pocket-friendly, mid-sized fish will arrive from Diamond Harbour soon. “Connoisseurs will not mind paying for the fish on offer. Others will have to wait for the catch to increase so the prices cool off,” said Vijay Singh, a trader at the Sealdah fish auction market. Amar Das, a fish vendor at Lake Market, said the hilsa that arrived were either 400g-500g or over 1.1kg. While the former sold for Rs 900-Rs 1,100 per kg, the latter sold in excess of Rs 1,800 per kg. Fishermen caught the hilsa near the border with Bangladesh, said Kakdwip Fishermen’s Association secretary Bijon Maity. “Though the catch was of 1.5 tonnes against 3 tonnes-4 tonnes we would net in a single trip five years ago, we are hopeful the tide will turn in our favour,” he said. Hilsa shoals appear to have left the Indian section of Bay of Bengal due to rampant fishing of juvenile hilsa and moved towards Bangladesh where the ban on juvenile catch is stringently implemented. Debasish De, principal scientist and officer-in-charge, Central Institute of Bra-ckishwater Aquaculture, Kakdwip, said reckless fishing is pushing hilsa into extinction in Indian waters of Bay of Bengal. “It won’t be long before hilsa will only be viewed in photographs. The taste of a hilsa matures when it swims back to sea after laying eggs. During its stay in sweet water for three months, it becomes rounded. But we often catch them with eggs. Hence, hilsa population is declining,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/seasons-first-good-hilsa-catch-fails-to-bring-down-prices-in-city/articleshow/84623499.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty
---||Business||High court order on diabetes drug patent may reduce prices||MUMBAI: The cost for treating diabetes is expected to come down with the Delhi high court having dismissed an appeal by AstraZeneca, which had sought the restraining of the generic versions of a blockbuster drug. The global pharma firm was also suing a host of domestic companies for the infringement of patents covering the drug. The HC order paves the way for more affordable versions soon by domestic companies of the blockbuster anti-diabetes drug Dapagliflozin in the market. In a judgment on July 20, a division bench of the Delhi high court dismissed AstraZeneca’s appeal, saying it found no reason to interfere with earlier orders of last year on two patents. In November, the court had rejected AstraZeneca’s application seeking a restraining order against marketing of the anti-diabetes drug by generic companies, including Intas, Alkem, Zydus, Eris LifeSciences, USV, Torrent, MSN, Micro Labs and Ajanta. With nearly a dozen companies launching generic versions at competitive prices, the stage is set for a price war between the players to get a slice of the growing Rs 15,000-crore diabetes market, experts said. AstraZeneca holds two patents for Dapagliflozin in the country — the first (IN 147) expired in October last year, while the second (IN 625) will expire in May 2023. Simply put, the second patent was not found to have inventive merit over what was already existing in prior art (earlier patent), legal experts told TOI. AstraZeneca’s Dapagliflozin is sold under the brand Forxiga, and is part of a popular class of drugs called SGLT2 inhibitors, valued at around Rs 5,000 crore. S Majumdar, representing the generic companies’ side, said, “It’s a landmark decision in patent law, recognising the need to avoid double-patenting. In this case, it has a direct impact on diabetic patients since, after the expiry of the term of first patent of Astra for Dapagliflozin, various generic companies are able to also make available the drug at competitive prices.” The bench said, “We, at least at this stage, are unable to, in the face of the aforesaid pleadings of the appellants/plaintiffs themselves, find any difference between IN 147 and IN 625.” The order, accessed by TOI, said, “In our opinion, with respect to one invention, there can be only one patent. The appellants/plaintiffs herein, however, while claiming one invention only, that is, DAPA, are claiming two patents with respect thereto, with infringement of both, by the respondent(s)/defendant(s). The same alone, in our view, strikes at the very root of the claim of the appellants/plaintiffs and disentitles the appellants/plaintiffs from any interim relief.” Imposing a fine on AstraZeneca, the order said, “There is thus no merit in the appeals, which are dismissed, with costs assessed at Rs 5 lakh to the respondent(s)/defendant(s) in each of the suits.” The overall fine will be Rs 45 lakh.Significantly, the bench noted, “To hold, that an inventor, merely on the basis of his work, research, discovery and prior art, but which has not yielded any product capable of commercial exploitation, is entitled, by obtaining patent thereof, to restrain others from researching in the same field, would in our view not be conducive to research and development and would also be violative of the fundamental duties of the citizens of this country, enshrined in Article 51A of the Constitution of India, to develop the scientific temper and a spirit of inquiry. The same will enable busy bodies to, by walking only part of the mile, prevent others also from completing the mile.” “We are also of the prima facie view that once the appellants/plaintiffs, before the USPTO applied for and agreed to the validity period of US patent equivalent of IN 625 ending on the same day as the validity period of the US patent equivalent to IN 147, the appellants/plaintiffs, in this country are not entitled to claim different periods of validity of the two patents,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hc-order-on-diabetes-drug-patent-may-reduce-prices/articleshow/84623779.cms||Rupali Mukherjee
---||Patna||State political undercurrent shows signs of massive flux||PATNA: After the death of LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan and the JD(U) ending up as the third largest party in the state in terms of MLAs in the assembly after the RJD and BJP, Bihar’s political scenario has been left wide open, leaving a role for RJD chief Lalu Prasad to play, observers feel. Also, Bihar’s political undercurrent has been showing signs of massive flux and shifts and, accordingly, not only the RJD, but all other major political parties stand on the cusp of massive inner transformation and uncertainty, they add. In the situation, the questions being asked are if the state’s social equations and political scenario, as also the existing lot of political parties, will remain the same by the time the 2024 parliamentary elections or even the 2025 state assembly elections come? While the four-party NDA combine comprising major components BJP and JD(U) is in power in the state under CM Nitish Kumar, all the eyes concerned are focused on the grand alliance partners – RJD, Congress, Left parties and even on the minor NDA partners like Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) led by former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) led by minister Mukesh Sahani, not to speak of the Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM that has five MLAs in the state assembly for the first time. The erstwhile Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) led by former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha has already merged with JD(U) and Kushwaha is made the JD(U) parliamentary board chairman. On the other hand, LJP has split with both the factions in disarray. Pashupati Kumar Paras, the leader of the LJP’s bigger parliamentary group, has become a Union minister while late Ram Vilas’s son Chirag Paswan has been trying hard to ensure that he will not turn into fiction. The options before him are limited. For, he has to first build his group’s stock among people, so that as a result of the usual realpolitik practised by the BJP’s national top brass, he could be accommodated in the NDA by PM Modi. Alternatively, Chirag could be in tight embrace with Tejashwi, courtesy blessings from Lalu. That, in effect, has forced BJP and JD(U) to cobble up social groups and combination afresh. Even before Paras had staged the coup in the LJP, senior BJP leaders like state BJP chief Dr Sanjay Jaiswal and party’s MP Janak Ram, among others, latched on to raising the Dalit matters, by coupling it with either ‘love jihad’ or by pointing out that the Muslim minority sections had been harassing the Dalits in various Bihar districts. In between, even the BJP national brass sat with HAM(S) leader Jitan Ram Manjhi in Delhi. It was a clear signal that BJP was out to woo the Paswans and Manjhis (Mushahar) caste people among the Dalits, as they together make the big share of the Dalit population in Bihar. Similarly, by promoting Upendra Kushwaha, Nitish has tried to forge again the Lav-Kush (Koeri-Kurmi) combination from among the OBC groups. However, attempts are being also made to wean away the extremely backward caste (EBC) groups from Nitish, as it was reflected in the recent verbal attack from the former JD(U) leader Pramod Chandravanshi from the Magadh region on Union minister and JD(U) national president R C P Singh. Despite these emerging pulls, pressures and fissures in the social combination, BJP is almost cock-sure that the NDA is in right shape to rule Bihar. “The four-party NDA will continue to rule in Bihar on its agenda to give corruption and crime free state, along the path of sustainable development,” BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said, adding: “The NDA will sail through not only the 2024 parliamentary elections, but also the 2025 assembly elections.” The BJP and JD(U), at the same time, keep attacking RJD, Lalu and Tejashwi, and also astutely play up the ambitions of Misa Bharti and Tej Pratap to cause confusion in the RJD and its larger social constituency – that the RJD leadership has to first manage the family matters of Lalu. Occasionally, to the advantage of the NDA camp, the news also keeps circulating if the Congress MLAs will split to join hands with Nitish, but Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has taken strong anti-RSS line, implying that RJD and Congress will remain on course, observers feel. As at present, they appear to be keenly watching the moves of Lalu, who is out of jail on bail in the fodder scam case, and the position the leader of opposition in the state assembly Tejashwi will enjoy in the RJD’s organizational structure, besides the roles that could be played by his elder brother Tej Pratap Yadav, not to say of his sister Misa Bharti, a Rajya Sabha member. Given the fact that Tej and Misa could throw up the imponderable factor in the future to disorient the RJD rank and file, the view in the party is that Tejashwi should not be presently elevated to the post of the party’s national president, observers feel. “Why should there by a need for it? What is the need for it? Tejashwi, as seconded and endorsed by the RJD legislature party and its office-bearers, is the party leader. He carried himself as a leader during the assembly elections (2020), but he should continue to take lessons from Lalu ji. Experience is not something you learn in schools and colleges,” RJD senior and former Rajya Sabha member Shivanand Tiwari told a section of the media on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-political-undercurrent-shows-signs-of-massive-flux/articleshow/84622235.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||People follow Covid norms to celebrate Bakrid at home||PATNA: Eid-ul-Adha or Bakrid was celebrated with religious fervour while adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour on Wednesday. As the authorities had disallowed gatherings, most of the Muslims offered namaz in their houses. General secretary of Imarat-e-Shariah (a religious Islamic body with jurisdiction over Bihar, Jhakhand and Odissa), Maulana Shibli Al Quasami said the celebration was affected because of pandemic, but people followed the norms and offered special namaz at home. “The festive celebration started with offering namaz in the morning, followed by the sacrificing ritual, which is considered to be the most important part of the festival. All my family members offered prayers for peace and prosperity at home. Traditionally, we used to meet and wish people on the occasion, but this time it was just a family affairs because of the pandemic,” said Muntazir Quadri, a resident of Anisabad. Sabeela Rasheed, a resident of Ashok Rajpath area, said: “Every year I try to sacrifice one bad habit. So, it is not just about sacrificing the animals for me. I believe in the symbolic gesture that I follow. I celebrate Bakrid on a more spiritual level. I prepared some sweets and delicacies and had a small feast at my home,” she said. Forced to stay indoors due to the Covid-19, Firoz Ahmed of Shahganj said, “I offered namaz at home along with my kid and brothers. It was a quiet celebration. We had a family feast and also distributed food among the needy. Eid is all about sharing the happiness with others, especially the less privileged,” he said. “This was the second time that we celebrated Bakrid amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Since the government took a decision not to allow mosques to offer prayers, we celebrated Bakrid in our own way. All the rituals started after the namaz at home with the family members. We neither met neighbours nor asked them to visit us,” said Silviya Irshad of Haroon Colony at Phulwarisharif. “Bakrid is the holiest festival of Islam. It promotes devotion and submission to God. So, we must inherit this in our personality for the greater good of the world and remember that humanity should always be placed above religion,” Silviya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/people-follow-covid-norms-to-celebrate-bakrid-at-home/articleshow/84622130.cms||---
---||Surat||Gujarat: Two teen ‘thieves’ hang selves in police station||SURAT: Two teenagers who were detained for alleged bike theft hanged themselves to death inside Chikhli police station in Navsari district early on Wednesday morning. Sunil PawarThe duo, identified as Ravi Jadhav and Sunil Pawar, both 19-years-old, were picked up by cops from Chikhli police station on suspicion of stealing two bikes. They were kept inside a room at the police station for interrogation. However, even before they could be formally arrested, the labourer-duo from Waghai taluka of Dang district, hanged themselves from the ceiling fan using computer cables. “Two bikes were recovered from them, but detection of only one bike was done. Investigation for the other bike was still going on. So, the staff decided to initiate complaints of both the bikes and subsequent procedures together before arresting them,” said deputy superintendent of police S G Rana. As the two were not arrested formally and had been kept under detention for investigation, they were not kept in the lock-up but in a room of the police station. Rana said that the duo did not have any criminal background. Police said that they duo were completely fine till 5 am when the staff had last seen them. Around 8 am, when a sweeper entered the room to clean, she was shocked to find the duo hanging. As the incident came to light, the police station staff too started to worry as soon senior officials including the superintendent of police and deputy collector reached the police station to know what had transpired. Even the BJP and Congress MLAs of Gandevi and Vansda too reached the police station along with their supporters. After a meeting of senior officials and the MLAs, a four-member investigation team headed by DySP Rana was formed. “The probe will be on who had brought the two deceased to the police station and what happened inside it after they were brought in. After our probe, we will inform the human rights commission which will ask a magistrate to conduct an inquiry to know the reason for their deaths,” said Rana. The officer further said that to know the cause of their deaths, their bodies were taken for post mortem to New Civil Hospital in Surat for further forensic investigation. Meanwhile, to avert troubles at the police station following the deaths, additional police force has been deployed at the Chikhli police station. Mitesh, a kin of one of the suspects told TOI, “I met them on Tuesday at the police station and they said that they were picked up while on their way for work. It is impossible to believe that they could commit suicide because they seemed normal when I met them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/teen-bike-theft-suspects-kill-selves-inside-police-station/articleshow/84622005.cms||---

The initiative has been taken in the wards of GMC, which came into existence in 2007. As per the initiative, Rs 10 to Rs 30 lakh will be given for infrastructure development to the wards falling in rural areas. “Estimate is being prepared for the wards for infrastructure development like construction of road and drain, installation of street lights and other development initiatives. Ward numbers 1, 27, 29, 30, 47, 46, which came into existence in 2007, include rural localities where infrastructure like town area is needed. Budget allocation to different wards for infrastructure development will be decided according to availability of fund,” municipal commissioner Sawan Kumar said. Before 2007, GMC had 44 wards, which have been increased to 53 now. In absence of concrete roads and drains, people have to face lot of problem in communication due to waterlogging, especially during the rainy season. Work has already started in ward number 29. Councilor of ward 29 Rakesh Kumar said, “Major portions of ward number 29 fall in rural area. GMC has sanctioned Rs 50 lakh for construction of roads, lanes and drains in the ward. From the available fund, work on construction of pucca road and drains has started. There is also plan to install street lights.” As part of the development initiative, work is already going on for widening the KP road in Gaya town, while widening work of GB road has been completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cvic-body-to-develop-infra-in-rural-gaya/articleshow/84622389.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Unmasked Bhopalis inviting third wave||BHOPAL: You can confront an ironic situation like this at a market place any day. A shopkeeper with his face mask tied to his cheeks arguing with his three customers (all of them without mask and clinging to the counter of the shop) on whether there is any possibility of a third wave of Covid-19 or a “hoax” is being created to scare people so that they continue following Covid guidelines. All over the shop, you can see slogans like ‘Mask nahin maal nahin’ and ‘Aap ki jaan hamare liye kimti hai, kripya vaccine lagawaiyein.’ But neither the shopkeeper nor customers streaming into the shop seem bothered. “They will not let us breath easy. On the one hand, reports say that there are hardly any Covid cases left and at the same time, they would suggest that a third wave is eminent and in the month of August or September itself,” said a youngster, who was among the customers participating in the debate over third wave. People who appeared to be really scared of the virus following the devastating second wave, are back with arguments on why it’s difficult to keep wearing the mask all the time or difficulty in maintaining a safe distance from one another in offices, markets, banks and other public places. There is a section though, which is still following the Covid protocol in right ernest but their numbers are consistently declining. And, the most callous of the lot are youngsters, who can be seen flouting Covid norms everywhere - be it a market place or a picnic spot or a tea stall, which again have crowds of youngsters leisurely sitting and gossiping. “What we are requesting people to do is not so difficult. We are only asking them to wear masks, observe social distancing norms and avoid going into a crowded place. I don't think for one's life and health, it should be a big deal for anyone,” said a senior official of the district administration. However, the administration, BMC and police have also become slack in enforcing the Covid protocol in markets and other public places as the Covid-19 cases see a sharp decline in the city. "We do hope and insist that people wear masks but with cases down to five or even less in a day, imposing a fine for not wearing masks is perhaps little too much", said the officer. Meanwhile, state convener of Covid Combat Team in the state, Dr Lokendra Dave, said that sharp decline in corona infection cases in Bhopal raises hope that third wave can be averted but it is all in the hands of people themselves. \He further said that people of Bhopal have to ensure that there is no third wave of corona in the city and it can be done but for this people must not get into a crowded place, not allow people to assemble at a place, santise themselves before going to market, wear masks and sanitise again once back from the market. The mask should be of a good quality so that it's effective and disposable mask should be used only once. If the mask is made of clothes, it should be washed daily and dried under the Sun. He further said that the district administration should put up ropes/barricades at places which usually remain crowded. Dr Dave said that elderly persons, pregnant women and children are the most vulnerable sections to Covid infection. Children have to be saved from deadly virus more than anyone else because vaccine for children has not come as yet. As far as possible, children, old age people and pregnant women should avoid going to a crowded place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/how-serious-is-bhopal-about-the-third-wave/articleshow/84622807.cms||Ashutosh Shukla
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: UK backpacker, missing for five months, found in New Town||KOLKATA: A 30-year-old British backpacker out on a world tour, who had apparently gone untraced by her family in the UK for the last five months, turned up at the RWA office of a high-rise complex in New Town on Tuesday and pleaded with the residents and officials to send her home. The RWA officials immediately contacted New Town police, who rescued her, reached out to the British Deputy High Commission in Kolkata and put her up at a Park Street home for the time being. A British Deputy High Commission in Kolkata spokesperson confirmed the developments and issued a statement saying, “We are aware of a British national in Kolkata and are providing consular assistance.” Tanya Jeal, a resident of Bromley in England, had set off from her home in early November in 2019 with a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. After trips to Italy, Egypt, Myanmar and Thailand, she reached India late in December 2019. According to information uploaded on a popular English charitable organisation providing overseas crisis support for cases relating to missing persons, Jeal had stopped directly contacting her family in August 2020, when she was in Kolkata. The website says, “On 22nd February 2021, she was briefly in contact again from Delhi, India. However, there are concerns for her safety.” Residents of Rail Vihar housing complex in New Town said the woman first approached the RWA office on Monday evening and came back on Tuesday asking for help. “The woman said she had been staying here as a paying guest for the past year with her dog. She had planned to leave India, but was caught up in the travel restrictions and had run out of money. She said she was staying here with a young couple, also tenants, in a third-floor flat at Block K. Jeal claimed the couple mistreated her and her dog, and gave them very little food,” said Subrata Saha, the joint secretary of Rail Vihar RWA. Saha said they spoke to the tenants who claimed they had given shelter to the woman considering her troubled situation, but denied having held her captive or snatching her belongings. “We have informed the matter to the flat owner and got in touch with cops and a local NGO,” said Saha. Ankur Roy Chowdhury of NTFN NGO, which facilitated the rescue, said the woman seemed sick and was in need of medical attention. Cops said the woman told them her Visa had expired last December, following which she moved in to the New Town flat by herself. “She said she doesn’t want to stay there any more and wants to head home. She sought assistance from us and we got her connected to the British Deputy High Commission in Kolkata. The commission officials said they need some time to verify her data and send her back. Hence, we arranged for a safe stay at a government home for the time being,” said an officer. The officer said the woman didn’t speak about any mistreatment before them and didn’t lodge any official complaint against the persons with whom she was staying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/uk-backpacker-missing-for-5-months-found-in-new-town/articleshow/84623475.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

As per the Union ministry of health and family welfare data, Bihar was 7th in the country with regard to active Covid-19 cases as on Wednesday morning. The state reported 589 active cases after 129 patients recovered in the last 24 hours. Total three deaths owing to Covid were reported by the state government on Wednesday. With new cases and discharged patients, Bihar’s recovery rate improved to 98.59%, which was 1.23% higher than the national average of 97.36%. According to the state health department figures, Patna reported the day’s maximum 11 new patients, followed by Katihar (8) and Khagaria (7). Patna was, thus, the only district in the state with fresh Covid cases in double digits. Altogether 10 districts reported zero fresh cases and eight had one case each in the last 24 hours. Patna continues to have the highest number of active cases at 93 on Wednesday, followed by East Champaran (51) and Bhagalpur (31). Buxar had no active cases on Wednesday, while 14 other districts had corresponding figures in single digit. The other districts having less than 10 active Covid cases include Banka (2), Jehanabad (2), Siwan (2), Aurangabad (3), Gaya (3), Kaimur (3), Sheohar (4), Gopalganj (4), Nawada (5), West Champaran (6), Lakhisarai (6), Munger (8), Sheikhpura (9) and Sitamarhi (9). No oxygen-related deaths in Bihar: Health ministerA day after the Centre told Parliament that no deaths were reported by states and UTs due to lack of oxygen during the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, state health minister Mangal Pandey made similar claims about Bihar. He said though there was delay in availability of oxygen to some patients during the peak of the second wave of the pandemic, but no causality happened due to lack of oxygen. “We made oxygen available to all patients in government as well as private hospitals. We made available up to 232 metric tonne of medical oxygen during the peak of the second wave, which was 14 times higher than the normal requirement of the same. Oxygen was made available to all hospitals through smooth coordination by the central and state governments,” Pandey told reporters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/88-new-covid-19-cases-3-more-deaths-in-state/articleshow/84622045.cms||---

The Union government would allocate Rs 418 crore (60% share of the total plan), while the state government has to expend Rs 278 crore for this emergency plan, totalling Rs 696 crore. As per the Union government’s guidelines, each district should have at least one paediatric care unit. These units can be established at medical colleges or district hospitals depending on the local context. Andhra Pradesh has proposed these dedicated paediatric units at 14 district hospitals and 12 teaching hospitals in the state. This is expected to cost about Rs 101 crore. The state has proposed the establishment of 40 ICU beds in every area hospital, totalling to 1,120 beds. Units with six beds would come up in every primary care centre, while 20-bedded units have been planned at every community health centre. As per the guidelines, the states shall establish 50 bed/100 bed field hospitals for Covid-19 management. Andhra Pradesh has proposed the establishment of 14 field hospitals with 50 beds each in seven districts. Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, West Godavari, Prakasam, Anantapur, Kadapa, Kurnool would get these field hospitals with Rs 49 crore. The state has proposed a Rs 1 crore budget for essential drugs in Covid-19 management in each district. The state has planned one crore RT-PCR tests. Together, these would cost about Rs 63 crore. In a bid to enhance human resources for Covid-19 disease management, the state would recruit 2,089 postgraduate medical students, 2,890 undergraduates, 1,750 MBBS students and 2,000 nursing students proposed for Covid four months with about Rs 80.12 crore. Under this emergency plan, Andhra Pradesh would conduct capacity building and training programmes for paediatricians and others with about Rs 1 crore. The Union cabinet recently approved the ‘India Covid-19 emergency response & health system preparedness package: phase-II’ amounting to Rs 23,123 crore for the 2021-22 financial year. The scheme aims to accelerate health system preparedness for early prevention, detection and management. Special focus will be laid on health infrastructure development, including paediatric care. It mandates creating paediatric units in all districts and establishing one paediatric centre of excellence in each state/Union Territory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/readying-for-3rd-wave-ap-earmarks-26-hosps-for-covid-paediatric-units/articleshow/84621784.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

After more than two months of constant decrease in cases, the picture has completely changed. Now, government labs have ramped up capacity and trained manpower, and also limited number of samples. They are providing results within 24 hours, and people prefer the free testing in government labs. Private labs are mainly catering to foreign travellers, flyers etc. State-wide statistics compiled by a group that monitors all testing labs in Maharashtra shows that 70.33% of RT-PCR tests done between May 30 and July 21 were conducted by government-run laboratories. Leaving less than 30% tests for private labs. When second wave was at its peak, private labs conducted about 40% of total RT-PCR tests in Maharashtra. According to experts, there are several reasons behind this shift. “People used to prefer private lab testing because government labs used to be loaded with samples and it used to take time. Private labs used to provide results in time. Now, this issue is resolved. Most importantly, tests in government labs are free of cost,” said a senior official from GMCH laboratory. Private lab owners have also admitted that the rush has gone down now, but they are not willing to comment on record. Director of a lab that used to conduct a large chunk of tests during first and second wave said the number has gone down but those who want comfort and doorstep collection are still calling private labs. Rush has also gone down at government sample collection centres due to fewer cases. “We are conducting nearly 7,000 tests per day in Nagpur. Contact tracing is limited now. So, majority of these tests are coming from government’s own initiatives like random testing or mobile van tests. These samples go to government labs only. So, the share of government run labs has gone up for sure,” said an official from divisional health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/people-preferring-free-covid-tests-at-govt-labs-now/articleshow/84622813.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Constructions have been found near Beur Central jail, district jails at Hajipur, Katihar and Sitamarhi and Bhagalpur special central jail. Home department sources said the process is going on to earmark the other such prisons. Sources said owners of 40 residential and commercial buildings around Beur jail and 31 owners of such properties around Katihar district jail have been served notices in the last one week as per law before taking up the demolition drive. At present, there are eight central, 33 district and 17 sub-jails across the state. Sources said additional chief secretary (home) Chaitanya Prasad had written a letter to all civic bodies to take up measurement work, earmark private properties around prisons and demolish them as these are security hazards. When contacted, IG (prisons and correctional services) Mithilesh Mishra on Wednesday said there should be no private or commercial construction in the 50 metres radius of a central jail boundary, 30 metres of district jail and 20 metres of a sub-jail perimeter wall as per law over security concerns. “Only state or central government buildings are exempted,” he said. Mishra said jail authorities in the districts have been asked to get measurement done by the civic bodies and then initiate action to demolish those structures. “We are receiving reports from prison authorities one by one,” he said. He said either such constructions are illegal with no sanction from civic bodies or permitted unlawfully. Beur jail sources said antisocial elements gather near the main entrance due to commercial establishments. “No one knows if anyone is an associate of a terrorist, Maoist or a dreaded criminal. Besides, residential houses are just adjacent to the periphery walls and anyone there can see our activities inside the jail,” a source said. “Civic authorities allowed such constructions over decades. We hardly ever flagged the issue or lodged protest against such constructions,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pvt-structures-around-jails-to-be-demolished/articleshow/84622327.cms||Debashish Karmakar

This would make it one of the top spenders on the running event. The Indian company’s association with the long-distance race format started in 2008 as a junior sponsor of the Mumbai marathon. Since then, it has emerged as the title holder of half a dozen running events held in New York, London and Sweden. On Wednesday, TCS said it has retained the title rights for the New York marathon until 2029. It has been sponsoring the New York race, the world’s largest, since 2014. Significantly, the US is TCS’s biggest market, contributing more than 50% to its $22-billion revenues. “Marathon is an example of human potential and is closely related to TCS’s positioning,” said chief marketing officer Rajashree R. A month ago, it won the headline slot for the London marathon, the world’s fourth biggest. The marathon association helps the Indian company in boosting its image and educating participants and spectators about its tech offerings. It is the technology partner of all the events it sponsors. Many of its customers, employees and other stakeholders take part in these marathons, entailing “community participation in the places we operate”. Besides marathon, the company has sponsorship deals in motor racing, ice hockey and golf. “80% of our sport sponsorship budget is allocated towards marathons and the rest for other competitive games,” said Rajashree. It will spend up to $40 million per year on running race sponsorships from 2022 to 2029. The company is considering adding more marathons to its sponsorship list, especially those held in North America and Europe. Berlin and Chicago are two large marathons where it is not the title sponsor. TCS, a part of India’s largest conglomerate Tata Group, is the second-most valued company (at nearly Rs 12 lakh crore) after Reliance Industries (RIL). Interestingly, RIL is the biggest Indian sponsor of sporting events though Tata’s connection with competitive games dates back to 1920. Story has it that when Sir Dorabji Tata, the son of founder Jamsetji Tata and the second chairman of the Tata Group, noticed peasant athletes running barefoot but were clocking creditable timings close to international standards, he decided to finance the first Indian team to the Antwerp Olympics in 1920. Over the decades, the group has been supporting hockey, football, archery, tennis and cricket. Another homegrown group that has emerged as a big sponsor of sporting events is JSW, owned by industrialist Sajjan Jindal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tcs-to-spend-320mn-on-marathons/articleshow/84623876.cms||Reeba Zachariah

He said the three brothers — Ram Vilas Paswan, Ram Chandra and himself — started their journey from a remote village in Khagaria district and reached the highest temple of democracy — Parliament. Paras wished that the four sons, including Chirag and Prince Raj, of the three senior Paswans, gain more popularity and success in their political career. “Both Chirag and Prince Raj are like my sons and I wish them all the best,” Paras said. Chirag offered floral tributes to the departed leader in the presence of his mother Reena Paswan and some close relatives. He said the last two years have been very tough for the family as well as the party. In Patna, the Chirag faction organised a function at his SK Puri residence to pay tributes to the departed leader.

The boy, accused of killing his uncle, spent four months in district jail at Sasaram. Only after his parents fought a legal battle that the boy was released on bail recently by a local juvenile court. “There was no sufficient evidence against the boy. The accusation against him prime facie appears to be untrue,” the DIG told this newspaper on Wednesday. According to sources, one Gopal Dubey, a grade IV employee in a private school, was shot dead by his nephew Madhaw Dubey outside his house in Lasakariganj area at Sasaram. In retaliation, Madhaw was also stoned to death allegedly by the family members of the deceased on the same spot. Later, in the FIR, the boy, his father Ajay Dubey and two uncles were made named accused for killing Madhaw. Subsequently, police arrested the trio the same day and sent them to jail. “Our plea that the child is a minor and he should be sent to a remand home failed on deaf ears,” rued Dayanand Dubey, the boy’s uncle. He said the boy was housed in the same jail barrack where hardcore criminals and Maoists were also lodged. Dayanand further said he met all the police officers, right from SHO to Rohtas SP, and produced documentary evidence in support of the boy’s age. But, instead of taking any action, the police submitted charge sheet against the boy on May 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dig-orders-action-against-io-for-sending-minor-boy-to-jail/articleshow/84622314.cms||Alok Chamaria

The last date for finalising the financial bids of all four participating firms was June 30, 2021. After that, the National Mission of Clean Ganga (NMCG) extended the deadline till July 31. The Munger project is estimated to be around Rs300 crore. State will have to bear 30% of the project cost. The Patna high court on Monday made state development commissioner as chairman of technical committee by replacing UDHD principal secretary for fresh evaluation of the bids by the four private players as BUIDCo had blacklisted two of them — M/s EMS Infracon private limited and M/s LC Infra Projects Private Limited. The HC quashed the BUIDCo order to blacklist them. The other two bidding firms are Toshiba Water Solutions Private Limited and L&T. The BUIDCo order had made the two firms ineligible to compete in the technical bid. The NMCG has already apprised BUIDCo that the World Bank extended the bid validity one last time till July 31, 2021 to issue its no-objection followed by the Letter of Award. “We would like to highlight upfront that the bank may not favourably consider requests of extension of bid validity beyond July 31, 2021…,” the communication read. As per the official communications between NMCG and World Bank, recommendations were already made to the bank for technically qualifying all four participating bidders and open their financial part of the bid. The bank had also no objection to the recommendations for qualifying all four bidders and open their bids’ financial parts. The bank had clearly stated in its communication to the Centre that all procurements under the project financed by it will follow the Work Bank’s Procurement Guidelines and Consultant Guidelines of January 2011.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-may-lose-wb-funds-for-munger-stp-project/articleshow/84622307.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The couple was in love and had fled from their village to get married some days ago, but the locals tracked them down on Tuesday morning. Chhota Udepur police have arrested nine persons in connection with the incident. Last month too, a couple was flogged in Chhota Udepur for being in a relationship. Eighteen-year-old Keena Dhanun, a resident of Chaliyavant village, told police that she was in a relationship with Arvind Dhanuk who stays in the same village. On July 18, Keena and Arvind, who is also 18 years old, fled from their homes to get married. The duo reached Kanchetpani village and stayed at Arvind’s relative’s house.  Police said Arvind’s relatives reached Keena’s home and threatened her parents to track the down the duo. On Monday morning, Arvind’s maternal uncle Ditaliya Dhanuk reached Kanchetpani along with three others after he got information that the couple was hiding there. But before Ditaliya could catch hold of them, both Arvind and Keena fled into the forests nearby. On Tuesday morning, Ditaliya, Gordhan Dhanuk, Raju Rathwa and Resham Dhanuk again reached Kanchetpani when the couple was sleeping at Sartan Dhanuk’s home. The four then dragged Arvind and Keena out of the house, forced them to sit on their motorbikes and took them back to Chaliyavant.  They tied the couple with a tree and flogged them brutally with sticks. One of the accused, Arvind Dhanuk made a video of the incident wherein Keena is seen crying profusely out of pain and asking for help. After the video went viral on Tuesday, the Chhota Udepur cops swung into action and filed an FIR against the accused at Rangpur police station. “We have arrested all the nine accused who are from Chaliyavant village. They were opposed to the marriage as Arvind had earlier fled with some other girl,” said N M Bhuriya, police sub-inspector, Rangpur police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/couple-in-love-tied-to-tree-flogged-mercilessly/articleshow/84621751.cms||---

ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar said railways is committed to running adequate number of special passenger trains by strictly following Covid-appropriate behaviour. “Railways has been put on mission mode to carry passengers safely to their respective destinations from different places falling under ECR’s five divisions,” he said. Despite many problems faced by the frontline railway staff during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, railways is running at least 279 pairs of special mail and express trains from different stations falling under the jurisdiction of the ECR. Besides, 74 pairs of local special passenger trains are running daily from the ECR jurisdiction. “During the pre-Covid period, railways was running at least 307 pairs of mail and express trains while 190 pairs of local passenger trains were running on different sections under the ECR jurisdiction spread over Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh,” he said, adding railways intends to run more special passenger trains soon after getting approval from the Board. About eight lakh passengers were travelling daily from different places under the ECR jurisdiction, yielding Rs9 crore as revenue per day for the ECR during pre-Covid days . “Though railways has not assessed a tentative loss to revenue per day due to cancellation of passenger trains in the Covid period, however, it intends to restore services of more local passenger trains like MEMUs and DEMUs to cope with passengers’ rush,” the CPRO said, adding railways is still issuing reserved coach tickets to passengers only to maintain Covid protocol during journey. Meanwhile, senior divisional commercial manager of Samastipur, Saraswati Chandra, said the division added a feather to its cap by standing first in all 67 railway divisions across the country in maintaining 100 per cent punctuality of passenger trains for three consecutive days on July 18, 19 and 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/railway-boards-nod-sought-to-run-more-special-trains/articleshow/84622110.cms||Kumod Verma

The incident came to light on a Sunday after the victim’s 10-year-old brother witnessed the incident and screamed for help. According to Venkatagiri police, the accused was separated from his first wife and later married another woman who already had two children – a son and a daughter. Cops said that the incident has been recurring for the past six months and the girl’s mother was reluctant to trust the word of her own daughter.

The questions vary from its likely intensity to the impact on children and how to protect them. IT shows the level of anxiety about the return of the Covid-19 wave with unknown impact, said Dr Anil Kumar, head of trauma and telemedicine department at AIIMS-P. Dr Vijay Kumar of general medicine and Dr Shwetlina of dermatology department are the other experts who answer the people’s queries. About 50% questions asked at a zoom meeting with about 100 residents of a housing society at Noida with AIIMS-P doctors were on impact of the third wave on those who suffered the infection in the second wave and people already vaccinated with both doses and above all safety of children, from newborn to below 18 years of age. Dr Anil said hair fall in the post-Covid patients, stress and anxiety, lack of sleep and the measures to protect children were among the other issues on which people sought medical advice. Mostly being aware through media information, many people also wanted to know whether Kappa and Lambda variants, in addition to Delta plus, were likely to spread in the country and whether our health system was ready to face them, he said. “There is no need to fear. The ongoing vaccine trials at AIIMS Patna and Delhi have showed sero positivity (developed antibodies) in about 50% of the children in their mandatory medical test before being selected for getting trial shots,” he said. Though the level of immunity in children is higher than adults, the only need is to increase their nutritional status for keeping them strong enough to face the threat of future waves of the pandemic, he added. Dr Vijay, “Our children are near the status of herd immunity. While some had it naturally, others incidentally developed it by contracting symptomatic or asymptomatic viral infections by coming in contact with any family member or friend.

Officials said though the proposed flyover’s environmental reports were prepared based on the earlier alignment proposals, the consultant will need to prepare a modified report which will contain an exhaustive study according to the observations of national wetlands committee under the Union ministry of environment, forest & climate change. The report should also have a detailed account of positive and negative impacts the elevated corridor may have on the environment since a small portion of it is shown to cross the East Kolkata Wetlands area, officials said. The fresh EIA and IEMP reports will include a detailed management plan for restoring the wetlands’ ecosystem with emphasis on improvement of habitats of migratory birds. KMDA officials said the present proposed alignment has been drawn up according to the recommendations of the national wetlands committee with minimum interference with the wetland. KMDA will also conduct a topographical survey to identify locations of the piers. Officials said all environmental safeguard measures will be taken during construction, including setting up a sound barrier and disposal of waste. Also, compensatory water bodies will be created if any portion of the wetlands is used for the flyover’s piers. According to plans, the flyover will start near Metropolitan crossing and move over Chingrighata, Salt Lake Bypass, Sector V and Mahisbathan, crossing over a small portion of the wetlands before ending at Street No. 2222 of New Town. The project cost has been pegged at Rs 598 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-town-flyover-impact-study-raises-green-hopes/articleshow/84623496.cms||Suman Chakraborti

She noted that creating awareness about banking operations and government schemes, particularly among women, would play a key role in their financial empowerment. She launched the first centre for financial literacy (CFL) of the state in Amaravati on Wednesday. She also launched nine other centres in Guntur district through the virtual mode. Addressing a meeting, Nikhila said that simplifying KYC norms for opening accounts and recognising opening of savings account under the ombudsman scheme of RBI were also part of financial inclusion. “Financial literacy has been recognised as an integral component and imperative of financial inclusion process as it enables people to make informed choices with regard to financial services-savings, credit, insurance, payment services and pension,” said Nikhila. She said that commercial banks, regional rural banks and small finance banks are designated as the hub of financial inclusion whereby people will have access to all financial services through the banking system. She said that RBI had recognised the challenge of reaching out to all segments of population, particularly the unorganised sector and felt the need for adopting a multi stakeholder approach in spreading financial literacy. In view of this situation, it has been decided by RBI to engage with development NGOs, civil society organisations and other resourceful academic institutions and foundations to run block level CFLs. She said that the Union Bank of India would operate CFLs in AP in association with an NGO, SST of Kurnool. State Level Bankers Committee convenor and UBI chief general manager Bramhananda Reddy said CFLs would also create awareness of how banks engage business correspondents (BCs) to handle their services. The RBI will engage with development NGOs, civil society organisations and other academic institutions and foundations to run block level centres for financial literacy.

---||India||BPaL regimen can cut time for treatment of drug-resistant TB||NEW DELHI: Even as Covid-19 has disrupted screening and treatment of tuberculosis derailing efforts to eliminate it, TB Alliance's BPaL regimen to reduce TB treatment time from 18 months to 6 months and reported success rate of 90% can be crucial in the fight against TB. BPaL is a six-month, all-oral, three-drug regimen that is used to treat people with highly drug-resistant forms of TB. It consists of the TB Alliance’s developed antibiotic pretomanid, along with two other antibiotics: bedaquiline and linezolid. While the BPal regimen was approved by the drug regulator in India last year, TB Alliance’s latest trial results show that the high efficacy of the BPaL regimen can be maintained with lower dosing of linezolid, which is associated with challenging side effects including peripheral neuropathy. This is expected to boost the use of the drug. “TB Alliance is encouraged by these results, which support the use of reduced linezolid dosing in the six-month, three-drug, all-oral BPaL regimen,” the Alliance President and Chief Executive Mel Spigelman says. While many patients stop treatment due to the length of the present treatment, old treatment regimens require more than 18 months of five or more drugs with low treatment success rates. India accounts for more than 1 in 4 of all cases of active TB diseases, including nearly 1.20 lakh cases of drug-resistant forms of TB. “Innovative approaches are urgently needed to turn the tide on TB and are essential to meeting national and global targets for TB elimination. Short, simple, safe and effective therapies must be a cornerstone of any TB control effort. By significantly reducing the cost and treatment time required for highly drug-resistant forms of TB, TB programs can be freed up to devote scarce resources to easier to treat forms of the disease and other serious challenges like COVID-19 control,” says Spigelman. A national TB control programme in India registered a 25 percent fall in the detection of new patients during the first half of 2021 when compared with the corresponding period in 2019. WHO estimates that these Covid-19 related disruptions in access to TB care could cause an additional half a million deaths, losing progress of a decade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bpal-regimen-can-cut-time-for-treatment-of-drug-resistant-tb/articleshow/84624695.cms||Sushmi Dey

---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: Non-bailable warrant against Salman Khurshid’s wife in decade-old case||AGRA: Former MLA Louise Khurshid, wife of former Union minister Salman Khurshid, faces arrest in a case of alleged misappropriation of central grants for a trust she ran with him after a local court in Farrukhabad issued a non-bailable warrant against her. The next hearing is on August 16. “I will file an application on Thursday for the withdrawal of the order. My wife had been granted interim bail in this case by the Allahabad high court over a year ago,” senior Congress member Salman Khurshid told TOI on Wednesday. Chief judicial magistrate Praveen Kumar Tyagi had issued the warrant against Louise and trust secretary Athar Farooqi on Tuesday. Farrukhabad SSP Ashok Kumar Meena said he hadn’t received the order yet, “but that could be because of the public holiday.” Wednesday was Bakri-Eid. The case goes back to 2010. The Dr Zakir Husain Memorial Trust in Delhi, a government-funded organisation which, among other things, also runs the Zakir Husain College, had received a grant of Rs 71.5 lakh from the Centre for distribution of wheelchairs and hearing aids among the disabled in 17 Uttar Pradesh districts, including Farrukhabad. Government officials’ signatures were allegedly forged and fake seals used to show that distribution camps had been organised. A news channel claimed that the money meant for the disabled had never been used. Louise, a former Kaimganj MLA, filed a defamation suit against the channel in Delhi high court — it was eventually settled in 2015 — while the trust was issued a notice by the Allahabad high court. In 2017, an FIR was lodged against Louise and Farooqi by the Economic Offences Wing, which had taken over the case by then, for forgery, forgery for cheating, fraudulent use of forged documents and criminal conspiracy. The charge sheet was filed in 2019, after which Louise got anticipatory bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/non-bailable-warrant-against-khurshids-wife-in-decade-old-case/articleshow/84621738.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

In an appeal filed through advocate Rizwan Siddiquee, Ranaut claimed that the Andheri metropolitan magistrate’s court initiated proceedings against her by relying only on the police’s report and did not examine witnesses independently. Akhtar filed a criminal complaint against Ranaut in November 2020 for allegedly making defamatory comments against him in television interviews. In December, the court directed the suburban Juhu police to conduct an inquiry. After the police stated in its report that an offence was made out, the court initiated criminal proceedings against Ranaut and issued a summons to her in February 2021. “The metropolitan magistrate did not use his own powers for an inquiry but blatantly used the police machinery to collect the signed witness statements...which is completely unheard of,” said the actor in her petition. The HC is likely to hear Ranaut’s plea next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-actor-kangana-moves-hc-to-quash-case-by-javed-akhtar/articleshow/84624102.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Covid: No cover for umbrella business in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Umbrella manufacturing and trading in the state has taken a huge beating due to the pandemic. This is the second consecutive year that the segment has been hit because of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Umbrella manufacturers and traders say that with the delayed monsoon in most parts of the state, sales of umbrellas have been further hit. There are about 20 to 25 umbrella manufacturers in the state which had a combined turnover of around Rs 25 crore prior to the pandemic. Kalpesh Dabgar, 47, a manufacturer of umbrellas in Ahmedabad said that while umbrella production was almost negligible last year, this year too, only about 30% of umbrellas have been manufactured. “Schools and colleges are closed and people have been working from home. Moreover, there has been a delay in monsoon as well. All these factors have hit umbrella sales hard,” said Dabgar. Most traders purchase umbrellas from manufacturers between March and June. Jayesh Dabgar, whose family has been trading in umbrellas for many decades, said that umbrella sales in the retail market are almost zero. “Last year, the total season failed. This year, the second wave was at its peak when traders normally purchase umbrellas from wholesalers and manufacturers. And to make matters worse, existing stocks are not getting sold because the monsoon has got delayed,” Jayesh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-no-cover-for-umbrella-business/articleshow/84623555.cms||---

He received a call from the college saying that he got a seat and an office staff asked Rajesh to pay the first semester fee of Rs 23500 through UPI payment gateway to confirm the seat. “It was unlikely to be a fake call as the office staff read out all the credentials that I had submitted online including the application number,” said Rajesh. “Ideally, an arts and science college must receive applications from students and prepare a merit-based list. However, spot admissions go unchecked in these colleges over lack of monitoring,” says T Nedunchezhian, a retired Tamil professor from an arts and science college in the city.He said students or parents are not coming up to raise alarm over such irregularity over the fear of losing their seats.The higher education minister K Ponmudi, on Tuesday instructed colleges to carry out admission process from July 26. Nevertheless, most colleges have been doing so even before the Class 12 results were announced. “The guideline clearly mentions cost of application to be fixed by colleges, rule of reservation and other instructions like publishing the rank list, filling seats in self-financing courses after seats in aided courses are filled,” said AUT general secretary M S Balamurugan.Speaking to TOI, regional joint director of collegiate education A Mekala said she has received complaints and she would instruct colleges to hold admissions only after July 26 as directed by the high education minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/delay-in-issuance-of-guidelines-leads-to-admission-anomalies/articleshow/84622841.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Sambit Patra, BJP spokesperson, emphasised that public health is a state subject and that the reply was based on reports provided by state governments and UTs. He accused Congress and AAP of indulging in petty politics and double standards. He said AAP made a big issue of 21 deaths in Jaipur Golden Hospital in April, attributing them to oxygen shortage. However, in an affidavit filed in court, the Kejriwal government cited the report of a committee of experts to deny lack of oxygen as being the cause of death. He said the Maharashtra government filed an affidavit before Bombay HC to deny reports that people had died due to oxygen shortage during the second wave of Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-cites-delhi-maha-affidavits-says-oppn-playing-politics-on-oxygen/articleshow/84624706.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Virar hospital authorities knew fire could break out but did nothing, says chargesheet||MUMBAI: The Arnala police last week filed a chargesheet against the owners and directors of the 90-bed Vijay Vallabh hospital in Virar where a fire in the intensive care unit (ICU) caused by a blast in the air-conditioner had killed 15 Covid-19 patients and injured three in the early hours of April 23. The chargesheet stated that the accused knew there could be a fire incident but took no steps. The chargesheet, filed in the Vasai sessions court, has named hospital owners Bastimal Shah, his son, chief executive officer Dr Dilip Shah (56), and chief administrative officer Dr Shailesh Pathak (47) under Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Dr Shah and Dr Pathak, who were arrested on April 25, are out on bail. Bastimal, a senior citizen, was not arrested due to the pandemic. No other medical staff of the hospital was booked. The hospital remains sealed. The first hearing is likely to be held in October. Additional public prosecutor Jayprakash Patil said there is sufficient evidence against the hospital. In the chargesheet, the investigating officer stated that the doctors Shah and Pathak had knowledge that there may be a possibility of an incident of fire in the hospital, but no steps were taken by them. The investigating officer stated that there was a delay of over 30 minutes in reporting the fire to the Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation fire brigade. The call was received by the fire brigade at 3.13 am. The fire vehicles reached the hospital at 3.18 am, by which time the second-floor ICU was completely charred, the chargesheet stated. Investigations were done by the Mira Bhayander Vasai Virar (MBVV) crime unit 2. While bodies of 13 patients, including five women, were found in the ICU, two male patients who were rescued died while being shifted to other hospitals. The three injured patients included two women. The chargesheet mentioned that the hospital management had not followed provisions of the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act and no permanent safety agency was appointed to carry out fire audit of the building. The hospital had not obtained a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation for the year 2021-22, the chargesheet mentioned. The NOC issued by the VVMC on March 14, 2020 was valid till March 31, 2021. The a/c installed in the ICU was of smaller capacity, leading to excess load in unit, which ultimately blasted, resulting in innocent patients succumbing to injuries, the chargesheet mentioned. Dr Shah and Pathak, whose bail pleas were rejected by Vasai sessions court in April, were granted bail by Bombay HC on May 13. Meanwhile, families of victims on July 12 received the Rs 2 lakh ex-gratia announced by Centre, while the kin of the injured got Rs 50,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaivirar-hospital-authorities-knew-fire-could-break-out-but-did-nothing-says-chargesheet/articleshow/84624122.cms||Sandhya Nair

Only four countries—the US, India, Brazil and Russia —have a higher toll. The data reconciliation exercise also added 2,479 cases to the state tally, which on Wednesday increased to 62 lakh. The state started its reconciliation drive this year on May 17 and has added 30,874 old deaths since then. The previous highest single-day registration of old deaths were on June 14 and June 11. State health minister Rajesh Tope said the exercise is an attempt to not hide facts. “About 3,500 deaths have been reconciled on Tuesday. This is because private hospitals had not submitted death reports in time and we could not compile it in real time,” he said. The state will send a notice to private hospitals to submit Covid-related data on a daily basis to avoid the need for reconciliation. “I will instruct officials to issue strict guidelines in this regard,” said Tope. The state registered 8,159 new Covid cases, after two days of reporting lower figures. The state Covid-19 update showed 165 new deaths. Mumbai, which registered the lowest tally (348) in five months on Tuesday, registered a slight increase in cases (430) and deaths (13) on Wednesday. The active cases in the state and city are constant. BMC officials said that daily test positivity rate in the city has been below 2% for weeks, indicating the second wave has ebbed. Dr Pradeep Awate, who heads the epidemiology cell of the state public health department, said that cases in Kolhapur were dropping. “Kolhapur witnessed a peak much later than the second wave peaks in other districts of Maharashtra. However, the situation is now improving,” he said. Kolhapur recorded 21 deaths, the highest in the state, while Sangli registered 19 and the rural areas of Satara and Ahmednagar and the Pune municipal area reported 14 deaths each.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maha-adds-3509-old-deaths-in-single-day/articleshow/84624105.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

The vendors are worried if the situation continues for more time, they will have to shut down their business. Schools without uniforms are unimaginable. However, Covid pandemic has changed the scenario completely. Online classes do not demand uniforms and here is where the loss began for the manufacturers. Uniform manufacturers said that there is almost a business of Rs 7 to 8 crore in the state capital which has hit hard. “I have had a turnover of almost Rs 1 crore before the pandemic began. Now, the business is in very bad shape. I do not know what is the future of this business,” said Amit Takhtani, a retailer of school uniforms in Bhopal. Citing an example of poor condition of the business, Takhtani said, “Before lockdown, there were 22 workers at my shop. Now, I am left with 6 workers who are working with 25%-30% salaries.” Lockdown was imposed last year from March 25. “We had made bulk orders for the students as they were supposed to buy uniforms for the next class that was supposed to start from April 1, 2020. However, schools were not opened and we had to face huge losses, said another uniform seller. Vendors’ hopes revived again after schools were declared open in December 2020. “After schools were declared open, we made fresh orders last year and now this year the situation is even worse than last year as schools are again closed,” said a vendor without quoting his name. Vendors were also banking on the students of class 9 to 12 but they also did not turn up. “As students went to school after reopening in less numbers, our hopes of revival also vanished again. Now, the situation is completely blank infront of us,” said a vendor Mukesh. Several sellers are in huge debt. “I have not paid the amount of the uniforms I brought to my shops last year. I do not know how I will be able to survive in such a situation,” said a vendor Vikas Singh. While some are struggling to cope with the tragic turn of events, many have used their entrepreneurial skills to diversify their business to keep up with the times. “I have shifted my work towards garment selling now,” said a vendor without quoting his name. Vendors said that they have contacted schools. “Schools are also helpless. They said that the situation will clear only after campuses reopen,” said a vendor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/schools-shut-vendors-saddled-with-uniform-stock/articleshow/84622852.cms||Ramendra Singh

It clearly shows the increasing reach of Hindi.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/numbers-up-100-foreign-students-from-31-countries-to-learn-hindi/articleshow/84621768.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Aurangabad||In Aurangabad city, zero vaccination on Wednesday||AURANGABAD: Neither the state-run vaccination centres nor the private hospitals reported administration of the first or second dose of Covid vaccine in Aurangabad on Wednesday, revealed the official data Dr Neeta Padalkar, the health officer of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), said the civic administration has exhausted its entire stock of Covishield and Covaxin vaccines. “We have been waiting for the fresh supply of vaccines for the past four days. Citizens are requested to have patience. The vaccination drive is likely to resume soon,” she said. As regards private hospitals, Padalkar said Wednesday being a holiday on account of Eid might have led to no vaccinations. “We keep a record of private hospitals, but these health facilities too did not carry out any vaccination on Wednesday,” the officer said. The health authorities in the municipal limits of Aurangabad have been receiving only 30% of the total doses supplied to Aurangabad district, which is cited as one of the reasons behind the slackened pace of vaccination. “As per official data, the rural areas of Aurangabad were showing nearly 2,000 balance vaccine doses. If such doses are diverted to Aurangabad city, the beneficiaries waiting for vaccines can get immunized,” a senior health official said, preferring anonymity. With no vaccination on Wednesday, the total number of vaccinations remained stagnant at 5,27,292 in the city. A significant number of citizens is in queue for the second dose, besides a large number of beneficiaries still waiting for the first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/in-aurangabad-city-zero-vaccination-on-wednesday/articleshow/84620860.cms||Prasad Joshi

Sunny Yadav, the arrested teenager, said to the police that his mother, Mary (40), would frequently nag him and his sister for money to buy alcohol. On Tuesday, Mary was reportedly drunk and wanted more money. Yadav’s 22-year-old sister was the family’s sole breadwinner after their father’s ill health and death last year. Yadav could not pursue higher studies after Class XII as the family could not afford it. Senior inspector Kalyanrao Karpe said the family had rented a flat in Aayush building in Koliwada and Yadav’s sister worked in a departmental store in Vasai. On Tuesday, when the sister returned to their third-floor flat, her brother and mother were arguing. Yadav pushed his sister out of the flat, locked the door and strangled his mother with his leather belt, said Karpe. The banging on the door by the sister alerted residents of the ground-plus-four storey building around 9.45pm. Yadav opened the door and confessed to his sister about murdering their mother. The police were informed. The body was found on the floor. The belt used in the crime was seized by the police. Yadav said to the police that he had picked up the belt that was closest to him and strangled his mother. The police said the teenager was in a state of shock when brought to the police station. Yadav was remanded in police custody on Wednesday. In her police statement, the sister mentioned her mother’s addiction to alcohol. Youngsters in the building described Yadav as a “quiet boy” who wanted to pursue higher studies. Neighbours said the family had come to live in the flat three years ago. The Yadavs earlier lived in a joint family in Koliwada but that flat was sold and the money split among all the members. Yadav’s parents and sister moved to the rented home. Building residents said Mary was an addict and would fight with her husband and daughter for money to buy liquor. A relative said one reason the Yadavs sold their flat was Mary’s addiction. The flat sale money too was blown up by her, said the relative .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-eighteen-year-old-arrested-for-strangling-alcoholic-mother/articleshow/84623561.cms||Sandhya Nair

---||Kolhapur||8,300 patients in Kolhapur spent Rs 57 crore at private hospitals||KOLHAPUR: As many as 8,300 Covid patients from Kolhapur city have spent around Rs 57 crore on treatment at 67 private hospitals in the city during the the current wave of the pandemic, revealed the data accessed from the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation’s audit department. The KMC had deployed 27 auditors to scrutinise the bills issued by the private hospitals to Covid patients and their relatives. Like during the first wave, most patients were referred to public facilities such as Covid care centres and Covid hospitals like the Chhatrapati Pramila Raje civil hospital and KMC-run Isolation Hospital. However, around 8,300 patients were admitted in the private hospitals. Varsha Parit, KMC’s chief auditor, said, “We carried audited the treatment bills for the period starting from April 1. The state government has fixed the charges for various components of the treatment in the private hospitals. We carried out the scrutiny based on the government guidelines.” The KMC had asked the patients and relatives not to pay the bills unless they have been scrutinised by the auditors of the local body. Parit said the hospitals had charged Rs 2.74 crore in excess of the permitted limit of the treatment cost fixed by the government. She said the excess amount has been struck down and the hospitals have been asked to issue revised bills. However, many hospitals have refused to issue the revised bills — as was found by the KMC’s team of senior officials. “We found 14 hospitals denying the revised bills. We have made the hospitals pay Rs 2 lakh to the patients in seven such cases. The hospitals are yet to pay the additional sum to the patients in remaining cases,” said Parit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/8300-patients-in-kolhapur-spent-rs-57cr-at-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/84620866.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur administration to seek additional RT-PCR lab||KOLHAPUR: The Kolhapur district administration will seek an additional RT-PCR testing laboratory to speed up the testing of Covid suspected patients.  Currently, the district has two RT-PCR testing labs, one in the public domain and another in the private domain. The daily testing capacity of these labs is around 7,000 swabs per day. The district has the highest positivity rate in the state. The government has asked the district authorities to increase the number of tests conducted. Initially, the administration increased rapid antigen test, however, the government now has decided only to consider RT-PCR test results to calculate the positivity rate. Therefore, the district administration started sending the swab samples to a Mumbai-based private laboratory. However, the test results arrive late and the treatment gets delayed. During a recent visit, health minister Rajesh Tope had said he will make the RT-PCR tests arranged at the National Institute of Virology and Sassoon Hospital in Pune. However, the decision is unlikely to be implemented as the cases in Pune and nearby districts are also rising. Rahul Rekhawar, Kolhapur district collector said, “I have asked the civil surgeon to draft the proposal seeking one more RT-PCR lab for Kolhapur. We will write to the state health department to get the lab approved. Currently, the test results arrive within 48 hours. The results of the swabs sent to the Mumbai-based lab arrives a little late. So we need an additional lab. We have, however, asked authorities to ensure the treatment of the suspected Covid patients is started when the symptoms starts showing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-admin-to-seek-additional-rt-pcr-lab/articleshow/84620874.cms||---

Out of these 171 villages, 131 get cut off due to the floods and as per the flood experience in 2019, it becomes difficult to provide aid to the residents of these villages. Given the possibility of such situation may arrive during the current monsoon season, experts had advised the district authorities to ensure 100% vaccination of all villagers above 18 years. However, shortage of supply has forced the health authorities to provide vaccination only to targeted villagers. “We have completed 70% vaccination of the villagers above the age of 45. Now, before the flood sets in we will ensure all vulnerable groups such as senior citizens, comorbid villagers and pregnant women get the shots at the earliest. We have issued orders to the local authorities to ensure these villages are given priority for vaccination. We are requesting the state authorities to make doses available in adequate quantity so that we can carry out vaccination in these villages as early as possible,” Yogesh Sale, district health officer, said. In 2019, around 2 lakh villagers were rescued from these 171 villages. Also, around 1 lakh people were stuck in their homes for five days in the first week of August. District collector Rahul Rekhawar has asked disaster authorities to focus on these villages to ensure rapid rescue and accommodate them in shelter homes. The NDRF teams are also expected to arrive soon. The health authorities have been asked to ensure healthcare workers assist NDRF jawans when rescue operations will be carried out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/only-at-risk-residents-of-171-flood-prone-villages-in-kolhapur-dist-to-get-jabs-now/articleshow/84620882.cms||Abhijeet Patil
---||Delhi||70% of Delhi’s Southern Ridge to be a ‘forest’||NEW DELHI: Almost 70% of Delhi’s Southern Ridge, spread over around 6,200 hectares, could soon be a notified forest and get legal protection under the Indian Forest Act, 1927. Delhi’s forest and wildlife department has initiated steps to notify nearly 4,400 hectares of it under Section 20 of the Act, declaring it “encumbrance” and encroachment free, officials said. For the remaining 1,800 hectares, work is going on, which includes setting up of boundary walls, removal of smaller encroachments and temporary structures, settling legal cases and larger encroachments in the form of multistorey buildings. For this, demolition drives are planned at Tughlaqabad, Asola, Pul Pahladpur, Jaunapur, Bhatti, Maidangarhi, Dera Mandi and Sahurpur in the next few months. “The notification could be out in the next few months. Documents will go through several stages and initially, 4,400 hectares will be notified. Following that, more villages could be added one by one,” said a senior forest official. The work has been impacted due to the pandemic, but around 110 bighas — around 10 hectares — of the encroached forest land had been reclaimed in the last six months, said officials. Before the last lockdown was announced in Delhi, encroachments were removed in Prem Nagar and Dera Mandi. According to a meeting held by Ridge Management Board earlier this year, recent encroachment removal drives had reclaimed 40.8 hectares of the land and 314 hectares are still left. A forest official said that while the remaining parts might not have dense encroachments, paperwork for notifications were being submitted village by village. Densely encroached areas are yet to be covered, which includes parts of Ayanagar, Neb Sarai and Saidulajab. The protection of 4,400 hectares does not mean that the remaining part would stay with encroachments, said the official. “In some cases, legal matters are delaying the process, and in some areas, boundary work is going on. We can always issue a fresh notification later to add more area to the initial forest land. Once notified, it will enjoy legal protection under the forest Act,” the official added. The forest department has been acting on directions of National Green Tribunal after a petition was filed in 2015 to demarcate Delhi’s Southern Ridge. After surveys were carried out to prepare maps of Southern Ridge, along with the revenue department, physical work began on the ground to remove structures falling within this forested area. Forest officials said rehabilitation of slum dwellers, however, may also play a role in slowing down the remainder of the process. “In some locations, dense unauthorised colonies now exist on the forest land. For that, a strong police force, a district task force and a number of earthmovers will be needed. But first, they will have to be rehabilitated. It is even more difficult to do that during a pandemic,” said another forest official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/70-of-southern-ridge-to-be-a-forest/articleshow/84623590.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Especially, the crime against women cases including rape and molestation almost doubled in June as compared to May this year. Apart from that there was a considerable rise in property related offences including loot, theft and burglary. The vehicle theft cases increased by more than double and in fact the number of vehicle lifting cases reported in June were higher than vehicle theft cases reported in April and May combined. The crime rate increased last year too as ‘Unlock’ started in June after 71 days of lockdown but the figures have been higher this year. During the lockdown last year, the crime rate declined much more as compared during the corona curfew this year. Police officers claimed that the lockdown last year was much stricter than this year’s corona curfew in which multiple exemptions were given for movement of people. If we compare crime against women cases, 96 rape cases, 155 molestation cases and 153 abduction cases were reported last year in the first six months till June 30. This year the figures are quite high with 164 rape cases, 260 molestation cases and 178 abduction cases been reported till June 30. As far as major crime cases are concerned this year 26 murder cases and 45 attempt to murder cases have been reported till June 30 while last year 33 murder cases and 34 attempt to murder cases were reported during the same period. If we compare property related offences, 18 loot cases, 282 burglaries, 653 theft cases and 569 vehicle theft cases have been reported this year till June 30. During the same period last year 26 loot cases, 293 burglaries, 720 theft cases and more than 500 vehicle theft cases were reported during the same period. The data compiled by police suggests that there has been a slight decline in property related offences. Still, the graph of property related offences has been on the rise as the corona curfew restrictions were relaxed in the city. While the crime rate increased in the month of May as compared to April, it further spiked as the unlock started.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/crime-unlocks-as-curbs-ease-city-sees-over-70-jump-in-rape-cases68-rise-in-molestation-cases/articleshow/84622892.cms||Sudeept Mishra

---||Delhi||HC May Examine DJB Move On Infra Charge||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Thursday is likely to examine the Delhi Jal Board’s decision to re-introduce “infrastructure charges” for new water and sewerage connections on plots sized larger than 200 sqm. The owner of one such plot has moved the court challenging the decision of DJB and the AAP government to bring back these charges that were waived off temporarily in 2019. The plea alleges that DJB has imposed the levy in an arbitrary and “wholly illegal” manner while the basis of fixing the rate is also not clear. It argues that “enhancing and imposing an unreasonable and baseless charge/cess/penalty/tax by DJB is beyond its competence.” Seeking the court’s intervention, the plea claims that DJB has increased the burden on homeowners of plot sizes larger than 200 sqm by “merely granting a paper permission for water connection, in a newly constructed plot under the guise of infrastructure charges.” After waiving the infrastructure charges for new water and sewerage connections in November 2019, DJB had restarted levying them on such properties since last year. The petition argues that “right to access water and sewage disposal is a fundamental right akin to the right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India and the State is obligated to ensure the availability of the same at a no profit cost.” It slams DJB for being “wholly oblivious of the same” and claims “the Board is under an impression that since it enjoys complete monopoly over water access and waste management in Delhi, it can impose its whim on the petitioner and similarly placed individuals who own a plot in excess of 200 sqm in Delhi.” As per the plea, DJB merely grants paper permission for water and sewage connections and neither bears the cost of piping nor even that of the meter, which is borne by the homeowner. Last year, DJB decided to increase these charges by 5% every year, but no sewer infrastructure charge was to be levied on properties with zero liquid discharge systems. In its circular, the agency said that “the rates vary as per the property tax classification of the colonies.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-may-examine-djb-move-on-infra-charge/articleshow/84623574.cms||Abhinav Garg

The youth was admitted to a private hospital on Wednesday after his condition started deteriorating. The victim’s family approached BJP MLA Yogendra Upadhyay and narrated the incident. Upadhyay assured them that he would speak to senior police officials. Yash’s elder brother Prashant Verma has a shop in Khalsa Gali where they polish silver jewellery. Yash also visited the shop frequently to help his brother. Prashant told media persons that there was a theft reported in one of the shops in the area on Sunday. Next day, police had called everyone who were present in their shops that day, for questioning. All of them were released in the evening after inquiry. On Tuesday, chowki incharge Peepli Mandi, called Yash to the police station and allegedly beat him up and forced him to admit to the crime, which he did not commit, claimed Yash’s elder brother Prashant. Talking to TOI, Yash’s uncle Mithan Lal Verma said that his nephew, a student of class XII, is innocent and police beat him up brutally over suspicion of theft. His condition was bad, so he has been admitted to the hospital. “We have reported this to BJP MLA Upadhyay and urged him for justice in the matter,” he said. When contacted, Chhatta police station incharge RK Singh said that “though all allegations are baseless, the matter is being inquired into”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/19-year-old-brutally-beaten-by-police-over-suspicion-of-theft/articleshow/84621782.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Mumbai||300 lives lost to landslides in 20 years, 1.5 lakh families still live on Mumbai hill slopes||MUMBAI: Over 1.5 lakh families in Mumbai are believed to live on hill slopes, putting them at risk of landslides, especially during the monsoon. The estimate has been arrived at by activists and experts, following Sunday’s landslides in the city at Mahul and Vikhroli, in which around 30 people were killed. Hill slopes can be found across the city, but are concentrated in the western and eastern suburbs. A 2010 survey by Mhada’s Slum Improvement Board and BMC had shown that close to 1 lakh families lived on hill slopes in Mumbai, out of which 22,483 families were living in designated dangerous or vulnerable zones. A decade down the line, experts have added an estimated 50,000 families to the list of those living on slopes, taking the number to 1.5 lakh. BMC officials say around 291 landslide-prone zones are present across the city, especially in areas like Ghatkopar, Bhandup, Asalpha, Kurla, Sakinaka, Jogeshwari, Dindoshi and Malad. Smaller settlements are present on hills even in the island city. Activists say around 300 people living on hill slopes have died in the last two decades. ‘Slums on slopes are captive vote banks’The trend of heavy rainfall becoming more intense every year puts families living on slopes at heightened risk. Close to 10% of the city’s population is estimated to be living on hill slopes. There have been 50 rain-related deaths this year alone, mostly due to landslides and house collapses. The authorities say warnings are issued before heavy rainfall, to no heed. After Sunday’s incidents, the BMC said warnings were issued at Mahul and Vikhroli too. But activists say that the mechanism of warnings and subsequent action is far from perfect, as locals, who are mostly poor, are often at a loss to know where exactly can they shift from their homes. “There was a survey done in 2010. After this, no comprehensive survey of slum dwellers on hill slopes or below the slopes has been done. They are in a very vulnerable condition. Everytime there is a landslide and people die, the state government and the BMC evict residents but the others remain there. Every year it is the same old story. It is either landslides or retaining-wall collapses that kill them,” said RTI activist Anil Galgali, who has compiled data on hill slope slums. He said that as per the 2010 survey, 49 locations were dangerous in the island city and 278 in the suburbs. A total of 327 zones were identified as dangerous zones on hill slopes. The BMC has now sprung into action and on Tuesday moved residents from four homes near GTB Nagar's Mukundrao Ambedkar Road after a landslide was reported on a portion of the nearby Salamati Hill late on Monday night. But thousands continue to live in dangerous zones in other parts of the city. At several locations, the BMC is yet to reconstruct retaining walls that crashed in the past. Two years after a wall collapse in Malad’s Kurar Village killed 31 persons, the BMC is yet to begin work on constructing a new wall. Over 70 families are still living at the same point where the retaining wall had crashed, killing their neighbours amid falling rocks and torrents of mud and water during heavy rain. While officials say that 86 families were allowed flats at Project Affected Persons (PAP) buildings in Mahul, around 75 families are still living at risk two years on. “We are living in a death trap. Every time there is heavy rain, 40kg rocks roll down the slopes. Only residents of those homes that were completely crushed or of homes where people died were given new houses in Mahul. The BMC must provide accommodation to us,” said Tejpratap Tripathi who lives at the Azad Nagar slum in Kurar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/300-lives-lost-to-landslides-in-20-years-1-5l-families-still-live-on-city-hill-slopes/articleshow/84624135.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The list includes details of 33 farmers who allegedly committed suicide during the protests. Citing media reports and other records, an open blog carried details of residential addresses of the deceased and causes of their death at different protest sites over last seven months. Terming the minister’s statement as “shameful and regrettable”, the farmer unions, protesting for repeal of three central farm laws, said, “SKM would like to remind Tomar and his colleagues that in December 2020, the entire official delegation stood up in silence to pay respects to martyrs of the movement.” In response to a Parliament question whether the government is aware that a number of agitating farmers have died or fallen ill during the movement, Tomar said, “The government of India has no such record. However, the government during discussion with farmers’ Union (during December-January) appealed to them that children and elders, especially women, should be allowed to go home in view of the cold and COVID situation.” Meanwhile, the SKM will on Thursday begin its protest at Jantar Mantar as part of its plan to have “Kisan Sansad” near Parliament House. A batch of 200 farmers will take part in this protest in rotation on each working day of the current monsoon session of the Parliament till August 13. The Morcha claimed that its plan will be executed in an “orderly, disciplined and peaceful manner” and 200 selected protestors will leave from Singhu Border each day for Jantar Mantar with their respective ID cards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/skm-confronts-govt-with-list-of-537-tillers-who-died-since-nov/articleshow/84624711.cms||Vishwa Mohan

It is becoming increasingly clear that the party high command might have wanted peace between the duo but the two can’t work together and both sides are closing their options of rapprochement. If Amarinder’s media adviser made it clear on Tuesday night that he would not meet Sidhu unless he apologised for his tweets attacking the CM and senior minister Brahm Mohindra also thowing his lot behind Capt, MLA Pargat Singh on Wednesday hit back saying Amaridner should instead apologise to the people of the state for not keeping his promises. Pargat spoke out as he and other MLAs accompanied Sidhu to Darbar Sahib Amritsar. Read AlsoNavjot Singh Sidhu hosts '62 MLAs' in show of strengthNavjot Singh Sidhu’s meeting with “62 MLAs” at his residence on Wednesday, followed by a trip to the Golden Temple to pray, MLAs in tow, was seen as a major show of strength by the newly appointed Punjab Congress chief in his running feud with chief minister Amarinder Singh.According to well-placed sources in Congress, Amarinder, also a Sidhu, hardening his stand despite several MLAs joining the Sidhu camp reflects that he is ready for the final round of the duel between the two, focussing more on inflicting damage on the latter without caring for his remaining term. “When his image and prestige have already been bruised with Sidhu’s appointment as the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president despite his opposition, his chair can also be in danger with several MLAs rushing to Sidhu to express their support, as was evident on Wednesday. He may have to choose between the two and his hardening stand shows that he may be preparing to not let Sidhu go unscathed. Only a bruised Sidhu and embarrassed party high command in Delhi can help him have some satisfaction of taking the revenge,” said a Congress MLA.

Sources in the party’s state unit said that Congress MPs joining hands with him and specially his bete noire Partap Singh Bajwa burying the hatchet was also an indication that now more focus was on making Sidhu’s life tough and to make CM’s chair elusive for him.

Rupani, who was chief guest, said at the convocation, “Given the location of this university, which is close to the coastline, forests and having a number of notable religious sites around it, there is a huge scope for quality research on these subjects at this university. Courses ought to be designed around these subjects.” “The government has a lot of expectations from BKNMU. There is a huge scope of foreign students enrolling in this university,” the CM said.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Parent-teen tensions amplified in lockdown, say psychologists||MUMBAI: News stories of teens killing their parents do not surprise psychologists anymore. Acknowledging Tuesday’s Vasai case in which a teen strangled his “nagging” mother with a belt as an extreme, mental health experts say strained relations between teens and parents have become commonplace, especially since the lockdown began last year. The Covid-19-induced uncertainty and exposure to “desensitising content” have aggravated violent impulses in teenagers, say experts. Clinical psychologist and psychotherapist Seema Hingorrany sees the Vasai case, in which the teen told the police his mother was an alcoholic and things worsened after his father’s demise last year, as a manifestation of “unprocessed trauma”. “He must be reeling under the grief of his father’s loss. In families with alcoholic parents, psychotic depression is common among kids as they have no one to turn to for processing their emotions,” says Hingorrany, adding that the spur-of-the-moment act may have been the fallout of many months of built-up trauma. Over the past few months, cyber psychologist and psychotherapist Nirali Bhatia encountered clients between the ages of 16 and 24 years old who are stressed about an uncertain future. “The typical human mind needs a framework, something to look forward to. But the external uncertainty of the last two years along with prolonged exposure to the highlight reels of peers and violent content on OTT platforms, has impacted many kids during teenage, a precarious time when the brain undergoes chemical changes. They are not able to learn values such as patience,” says Bhatia, who has not only seen cases such as a mother come in with “blue-black eyes” after being beaten up by her child for taking away his device but also knows of instances where children who are addicted to mobile phone games have beaten up their grandparents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-parent-teen-tensions-amplified-in-lockdown-say-psychologists/articleshow/84623581.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

Talking to TOI, Dr Dubey said that so far, 18 cases of malaria, 13 of dengue and three of chikungunya have been found in Bhopal district this season. A camp was organised at Pipliya Pende Khan on the outskirts of the city this week to create awareness among people not to allow breeding of mosquitoes and other measures for protection against dengue and malaria. A similar camp was held at Semra Kalan too. While the team of the malaria department surveyed the area to find out persons having fever, a team of Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) undertook a survey to destroy larva , said Dubey. A team of Family Health India is also assisting them, said Dubey. People should ensure that water doesn't remain stored for more than 7 days anywhere, and use mosquito nets while sleeping. It would be advisable if mustard oil or any edible oil could be used in the water they consume, said Dr Santosh Bhargava of Family Health India. During the camp at Semri Kalan, 112 persons were tested for malaria but none was found positive. At Pipaliya Pende Khan, 31 persons were tested for malaria, all of whom were found negative. A total of 769 containers were searched by the BMC team for larvae in 90 houses. Larvae were found in eight of them, which were destroyed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/vector-borne-diseases-spreading-wings-34-cases-found-in-bhopal/articleshow/84622950.cms||---

Punjab minister for social justice, empowerment and minorities Sadhu Singh Dharamsot said the government has extended the powers to sanction loans up to Rs 1 lakh to district managers of the corporation for expeditious disposal of debt cases. Similarly, district level screening committees have been revived and a new committee at state level has been constituted under the chairmanship of social justice, empowerment and minority officers to provide loans to the needy as soon as possible. Dharamsot said the main objective of the corporation is to provide low interest rate loans to scheduled castes and persons with disabilities for self-employment such as dairy farms, grocery shops, clothing shops, shuttering work, lumbering, higher education loans. This corporation has provided financial assistance of Rs 2,293 lakh to 2,116 beneficiaries even during the difficult times of Covid during the current financial year 2021-2022. The corporation had set a target of disbursing Rs 40 crore to 1,400 borrowers, under which loan-subsidy of Rs 624 lakh has been disbursed to 562 beneficiaries so far. Implement reservation policy, DGP told The Punjab state scheduled caste commission directed DGP Dinkar Gupta to implement reservation policy in promotions and new recruitments in the state police as per state government’s instructions. Commission chairperson Tejinder Kaur said Mukesh Kumar, a resident of Nanak Nagri village in Kapurthala district had submitted an application to the commission to direct the police department to implement reservation policy for promotions and recruitment, which is not being done. She said the complainant also said that the Punjab Police has extended reserve points in merit and seniority at the time of recruitment and promotions but this is absolutely contrary to the letter issued by the state government on September 25, 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/income-limit-on-loans-for-dalits-hiked-from-rs-1l-to-rs-3l/articleshow/84623605.cms||---
---||Nashik||Nashik Zilla Parishad to conduct RT-PCR tests at hotspots||NASHIK: The health department of the Nashik Zilla Parishad has decided to emphasize more on RT-PCR tests than on the antigen test considering that some positive cases are missed in the antigen tests. The RT-PCR tests would be conducted at taluka places and villages, which become Covid hotspots. Kailas Bhoye of the district health department of Nashik Zilla Parishad said they had started conducting antigen tests of people coming to the vaccination centres in the rural district. However, since some positive cases are missed in the antigen tests, the focus would now be on conducting RT-PCR tests in villages. “Our teams would also go in villages with more positive cases to conduct the RTPCR tests. There are certain villages in Sinnar, Nandgaon, Malegaon and Chandwad where cases have increased,” added Bhoye. He said that now even the government has stated taking figures of the positivity rate based on the RT-PCR report. Many times after the antigen tests give false negative report owing to which the person is under the impression that s/he has tested negative and the person goes about his normal course of life without medication or self-quarantine until falling sick, which only leads to the spread of infection. Senior health officials said that the situation was much better in the rural district compared to what it was a couple of months back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-zp-to-conduct-rt-pcr-tests-at-hotspots/articleshow/84620907.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Two of the robbery suspects were shot dead in an encounter by the police two hours after the crime. Inspector General of Police (IG) Naveen Arora said the suspect Prabhat Sharma surrendered at the Kamla Nagar police station and confessed to the crime. He told police that he was a friend of Nirdosh Singh, who was shot dead along with Manish Pandey during the encounter. During interrogation, Sharma told police that Manish Pandey and Narendra Lala had targeted Manappuram or Muthoot Finance gold loan branches, as they kept gold and cash and had minimal security. He revealed that they had done recce of Manappuram’s Sector 34, Noida branch but due to the crowds there they did not target it. Later, they did recce of the Bhagwan talkies and Kamla Nagar branch and found the latter to be an easier target. They committed the robbery after planning it for 25 days. On the day of the robbery, all the seven gathered at a park opposite to the branch. Sharma had done a recce of the area and later gave his nod to others to enter the branch. He revealed that five of them were armed with pistols. While Sharma stood outside the branch on guard, the others committed the crime within 20 minutes and fled. Sharma told police that Manish and Nirdosh went together, the others fled in another direction. When Sharma came to know about Nirdosh’s death in the encounter, he decided to surrender before the police. He also told police that they had decided to distribute looted cash and gold in Firozabad’s Tundla town but after the killing of Manish and Nirdosh, nothing happened as planned and he did not receive a single penny. He also confirmed to police that looted cash and jewellery was with Narendra. Arora said that Sharma had given strong clues about the whereabouts of other suspects — Narendra Lala, Avnish Mishra, Santosh Jatav and Dhruv Yadav — and they will be arrested soon. The suspects had looted 19 kg gold and Rs 6 lakh cash from the branch. ADG (Agra zone) Rajeev Krishna had announced Rs 1 lakh on the arrest of Narendra while SSP Muniraj G announced a reward of Rs 25,000 each on the arrest of others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/robbery-accused-surrenders-at-agra-police-station/articleshow/84621842.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The terminal at the IGI airport will initially cater to the IndiGo 2000 series and the entire GoAir — now GoFirst — fleet. Airport officials say the airlines have been sending reminders to passengers to avoid confusion, while there are signage alerting passengers if they reach Terminal-3 (T3) instead. Only T3 remained operational during the lockdowns in several states due to the second Covid-19 wave as the daily passenger footfall dropped from over 1 lakh at the start of the year to just 18,000 by mid-May. Since restrictions started easing, the footfall touched 62,000 passengers per day by the end of June and has been gradually growing, requiring more room for passengers, said an official. “T2 was required as the passenger footfall has increased at a rapid pace. This has also been done to avoid overcrowding at T3,” said the official. To cater to both airlines, 27 counters are functioning initially, with more to be made operational as per the demand. T2 is resuming opeartions with approximately 200 air traffic movements — 100 departures and 100 arrivals —per day and are expected to increase progressively up to 280 by the end of August, officials say. The terminal initially expects a daily passenger footfall of around 25,000, with 22 kiosks for e-boarding. Officials of Delhi International Airport Limited said the airlines were ready with 10 manned assistance counters at the departure forecourt to support passengers who would come without a web check-in. “Passengers have been asked to do a web check-in to avoid waiting time and leave contact to a minimum,” said an airport official. A boarding pass printout is also not required if passengers have a copy on their smartphone, the official added. DIAL has also said it has taken several safety measures. “We would like to assure passengers that they would be in a safe and healthy environment,” CEO Videh Kumar Jaipuriar had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/t2-back-in-business-with-early-morning-flight/articleshow/84623616.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

According to the data provided by the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), active cases during the last 10 days in the city has been between 620 and 650. Bapusaheb Nagargoje, NMC’s medical superintendent, said there has been no significant decline in the number of active cases in the city during the last 10 days, despite the daily cases hovering between 50 and 70. NMC officials said the health department is keeping a close tab on the Covid situation since there is a prediction of a third wave. NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav said the trend of active cases being stagnant was witnessed in June also when active cases hovered around 1.800 for a prolonged period. However, Jadhav added that it would not be possible for him to predict whether active cases will drop further or rise again at this juncture. He has ordered the health department to vigorously monitor the situation. According to Dr Hemant Sonanis, the president of the Indian Medical Association (Nashik), although the virus has become mild, it is still infecting people. There is a need to enhance the pace of vaccination and people must follow Covid appropriate behaviour to ensure Covid cases in Nashik city drops further. The city started registering a drop in the number of active patients from the beginning of May. Now, the city has 658 active patients, of them, 611 patients are undergoing treatment while 47 patients have been home isolated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-city-no-big-drop-in-active-cases-in-past-10-days/articleshow/84620910.cms||Tushar Pawar

Last week, the SSC results site had crashed, leaving students worried for several hours. The link http://cet.mh-ssc.ac.in had crashed when it first opened at 11.30am on Tuesday. By evening, few students were able to get themselves registered for the CET. On Wednesday, some managed to register till as late as 7.30pm. But by late evening, the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) stopped the link. MSBSHSE secretary Dr Ashok Bhosale said that the link will be made available to students after the technical glitches are fixed in a few days. The registration dates were from July 20 to 26, but it will be extended after the link is up again. The exam date of August 21 between from 11 am to 1pm, however, remains unchanged. A state official said rumours were floated that the Class XI exams based on SSC scores had begun. But the state education department clarified that Class XI admissions (online and offline) will not commence before the admissions through CET are complete. Students of the state board who registered for CET said that their confirmation came hours later. “Though I managed to get through the link, the confirmation came over three hours later,” said a student. Students of other boards, who have to pay the exam fees of Rs178 online, were left with no confirmation even though the payment was shown as successful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cet-website-pulled-down-to-fix-glitches-a-day-after-snag/articleshow/84623602.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Slums on slopes are captive vote banks’||Mumbai: The trend of heavy rainfall becoming more intense every year puts families living on slopes at heightened risk. Close to 10% of the city’s population is estimated to be living on hill slopes. There have been 50 rain-related deaths this year alone, mostly due to landslides and house collapses. The authorities say warnings are issued before heavy rainfall, to no heed. After Sunday’s incidents, the BMC said warnings were issued at Mahul and Vikhroli too. But activists say that the mechanism of warnings and subsequent action is far from perfect, as locals, who are mostly poor, are often at a loss to know where exactly can they shift from their homes. “There was a survey done in 2010. After this, no comprehensive survey of slum dwellers on hill slopes or below the slopes has been done. They are in a very vulnerable condition. Everytime there is a landslide and people die, the state government and the BMC evict residents but the others remain there. Every year it is the same old story. It is either landslides or retaining-wall collapses that kill them,” said RTI activist Anil Galgali, who has compiled data on hill slope slums. He said that as per the 2010 survey, 49 locations were dangerous in the island city and 278 in the suburbs. A total of 327 zones were identified as dangerous zones on hill slopes. The BMC has now sprung into action and on Tuesday moved residents from four homes near GTB Nagar's Mukundrao Ambedkar Road after a landslide was reported on a portion of the nearby Salamati Hill late on Monday night. But thousands continue to live in dangerous zones in other parts of the city. At several locations, the BMC is yet to reconstruct retaining walls that crashed in the past. Two years after a wall collapse in Malad’s Kurar Village killed 31 persons, the BMC is yet to begin work on constructing a new wall. Over 70 families are still living at the same point where the retaining wall had crashed, killing their neighbours amid falling rocks and torrents of mud and water during heavy rain. While officials say that 86 families were allowed flats at Project Affected Persons (PAP) buildings in Mahul, around 75 families are still living at risk two years on. “We are living in a death trap. Every time there is heavy rain, 40kg rocks roll down the slopes. Only residents of those homes that were completely crushed or of homes where people died were given new houses in Mahul. The BMC must provide accommodation to us,” said Tejpratap Tripathi who lives at the Azad Nagar slum in Kurar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-slums-on-slopes-are-captive-vote-banks/articleshow/84623620.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

A delegation of SAD MPs Balwinder Singh Bhundur, Prem Singh Chandumajra and Naresh Gujral visited the church site on Wednesday and expressed shock at the demoltion. The delegation, which met Little Flower Church priest Father Jose, also conveyed the sentiments of SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal to him and assured him the party would raise the issue in Parliament also. Father Jose informed the delegation that the Delhi government pasted a notice on the church premises on July 9, and went on to demolish it two days later on Monday. “We were deliberately not given any time to apply for relief in court,” Father Jose said, adding the notice pasted on the premises was pertaining to a temple and not the Little Flower Church. The SAD MPs said the demolition of a place of worship of a minority community had proven that Kejriwal was anti-minority. Gujral described Kejriwal as the “B team” of the BJP, terming the MC action “desecration”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rebuild-church-demolished-in-delhi-sad-tells-aap/articleshow/84623624.cms||---

The private hospitals have also been informed about the availability of the drug at the civil hospital and asked them to refer the patients to the hospital if the criteria matches. “The only criteria attached is the condition of the patient. There is no other restriction on who can be given the drug,” he said.  Pramod Gunjal, a physician at civil hospital, said the drug is called a ‘cocktail drug’ because it is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies — Casirivimab and Imdevimab — that cuts down the chance of hospitalisation of the high-risk Covid patients by more than 70%. “There are several conditions in which the patients with mild to moderate conditions of Covid can be given the medicine. Those, who are above 60 years of age, has cardiovascular disease including hypertension, asthma, chronic kidney, lung diseases can be described as high-risk categories.

Nath, now the Leader of Opposition in Madhya Pradesh assembly, demanded that the Centre launch an investigation into the Pegasus spyware case by a Supreme Court judge, who should be appointed with the consent of Opposition parties. “Just as France has started its probe, India should also call for an investigation headed by a Supreme Court judge. Israel sells Pegasus only to governments. Let an investigation be conducted by a Supreme Court judge, who will be appointed with the consent of opposition parties,” he said. Pegasus can “get inside a phone”, something that surveillance through other telephone companies cannot, he said. Your e-mails, passwords, chats, messages can be exposed. But Pegasus can be used only with the permission of the government of Israel,” he explained. “This is the biggest attack on democracy, Constitution and privacy in the history of India. Today, France has started an investigation into the Pegasus spying. In the coming days, more countries will do the same. But here, the Union government is only giving evasive answers,” Nath said, surprised that BJP is asking why the issue was being raised when Parliament is in session. “The Union government should stop beating about the bush. They should submit an affidavit in Supreme Court that the government did not purchase the software. And since the international media printed this story, the Union government should register a defamation suit against them if the facts are wrong. Why aren’t they doing it?” he asked. Asked if Pegasus was used to bring down the Congress government in the state, since it is being alleged that the spy ware was utilized to topple the JD(S) regime in Karnataka, Nath said, “It is possible that Pegasus was used because all the former Congress MLAs who were put up in Bangalore would call me from the phones of the hotel housekeepers and cooks. All of them said their phones were tapped. Whether Pegasus was used or not, it was straight deals of financial and other nature that brought down my government.” Nath fears that Pegasus may not be the only spying software to have been used,and there could be others, like Phantom. “Was Pegasus purchased for national security or security of Prime Minister Narendra Modi? Any criticism of Modi and activists, politicians, journalists would be under surveillance. Lakhs of phones have been put under surveillance with the help of our phone companies. If the government’s hands are clean in Pegasus, then they should submit an affidavit in Supreme Court. If the Union government has not snooped, it could be more dangerous. Maybe China has done it and an investigation must be started,” Nath reasoned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/nath-wants-pegasus-probe-by-sc-judge-appointed-with-oppn-consent/articleshow/84622990.cms||Suchandana Gupta

The inoculation drives at the 120 centres of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) have been irregular due to erratic supply, leading the chaos at the vaccine sites. The civic authorities have now appealed to the beneficiaries who can afford to pay for the vaccine, to get themselves inoculated at any of the nine private hospitals where the supply of the vaccine is relatively smoother. NMC’s medical superintendent Bapusaheb Nagarjoge said these nine hospitals are doing a fine job on the vaccination front and have inoculated over one lakh beneficiaries in the past one-and-a-half months. Meanwhile, not a single civic-run facility in Pune district conducted vaccination on Monday and Tuesday due to unavailability of vaccine doses. The sever shortage of vaccines is causing rush across the centres, leading to verbal clashes between the beneficiaries and the vaccination site health employees. Pune district has received 5.17 lakh Covishield doses in July so far, and more are in the pipeline. With over 10 lakh beneficiaries eligible for the second dose of Covishield in July, the district officials are worried about the smooth conduct of the vaccination drive. A Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) official said their plans to hold vaccination drives in slum areas and the old age homes has hit a hurdle due to the inconsistent supply. Due to the inadequate availability of vaccine, the local bodies in Kolhapur district are providing jabs only to those who are due for their second dose of Covishield. The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation is calling up such beneficiaries and asking them to come to the centres. Over the past two days, around 4,300 beneficiaries have received the jabs at the KMC's 11 centres. The crowd at the vaccination centres has thinned. The district had received around 80,000 doses last Friday, ahead of health minister Rajesh Tope's visit. The authorities claimed that the next lot of vaccine doses is expected to arrive by Wednesday. The municipal limits of Aurangabad on Tuesday witnessed only 345 administration of Covaxin doses and none of Covishield, taking the total number of vaccinations to 5.27 lakh so far. Many agitated beneficiaries expressed their anger at the government and elected representatives. “No public representative has taken a clear stand on vaccination so far. Vaccine shortage has become a norm in Aurangabad amid fears of the projected third wave of Covid-19,” said Nilesh Dharashivkar, a 47-year-old resident waiting for the first dose. Asha Beedkar, a senior citizen who will be due for the second dose soon, said the public representatives should join hands to ensure a smooth supply of vaccines. When contacted, Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel said he was planning to raise the issue of vaccine shortage in his constituency during the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament. “The monsoon session has been witnessing disrupted functioning and, therefore, the issue could not be raised in the past two days,” he said. Local Shiv Sena MLC Ambadas Danve said the issue of slackened pace of vaccination would be discussed with the state-level authorities shortly in order to ensure an adequate supply of vaccines to the vaccine sites. Local Shiv Sena MLA Pradeep Jaiswal said he would speak to the district and civic administration officials to understand the exact reasons behind the shortage of vaccines and ensure supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/vaccination-drive-hits-covishield-shortage-roadblock-across-cities/articleshow/84611567.cms||---

Ridge Management Board (RMB) had cleared the proposal of setting up of specialised teams for handling injured or stranded animals. The sightings of reptiles increase in Delhi during monsoon. A senior forest official said, “We have hired 11 wildlife guards and after they underwent training, we have deployed them in rapid response teams for rescue of animals. The rapid response teams are for four forest divisions—South, Central, North and West.” As the forest department was not having a specialised unit for handling animals, it was mostly dependent on two NGOs for rescue operations. In some cases, the rescue operations of animals like nilgai were delayed for days due to shortage of specialised staff. “Species like monkeys, raptor birds, etc, get injured through incidents like electrocution and others, when they get in touch with man-made structures in human settlements. Presently, the department takes help of NGOs in managing conflict situations, which leads to delays,” said the minutes of a meeting of RMB held in March this year. While three rapid rescue teams have three members each, one team comprises two members. The rapid response teams, along with forest staff, will conduct rescue operations of animals in distress. With the onset of monsoon, the cases of conflict are expected to rise as snakes come out of underground. “The ridge area is home to the major wildlife population of Delhi. The Northern, Central and Western ridges are characterised by the presence of small mammals like Common Mongoose, Small Indian Mongoose, Palm Squirrel, Rufous Tailed Hare, Rhesus Monkey, etc. The area also harbours a variety of reptiles like Common Skink, Monitor Lizard, Garden Lizard, Fan-throated Lizard, Yellow bellied House Gecko, Spectacled Cobra, Common Krait, Wolf Snake, Rat Snake, Common Sandboa, Saw-scaled Viper, etc,” RMB had observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rapid-teams-to-tackle-man-animal-conflicts/articleshow/84623626.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh professor jailed for ‘derogatory remarks’ against Smriti Irani||AGRA: A senior professor at a UP college, who had allegedly made derogatory remarks against Union minister Smriti Irani in a Facebook post, has been sent to jail after he surrendered in a court in Firozabad district. On a complaint filed by the BJP’s district vice-president and nominated municipal councillor Uday Pratap Singh, the Firozabad police had registered an FIR against Shaharyar Ali, head of the history department at SRK College, in March for an alleged "obscene" Facebook post against Irani. Professor Ali was booked under IPC’s section 505 (2) (promoting enmity/hatred) and section 67A of the Information Technology (Amendment) act, 2008. On Tuesday, Ali had surrendered in the court of additional sessions judge Anurag Sharma and had also filed an interim bail plea. The court, however, cancelled his bail plea and sent him to jail. Meanwhile, his college served him a suspension notice. Prior to this, the Supreme Court had also refused to grant protection from arrest to the professor earlier this month and the Allahabad high court had, in May, rejected his anticipatory bail application. Refusing to grant Ali protection from arrest, Justice JJ Munir of the Allahabad HC had said "there was no material on record to show that the professor's account was hacked". Firozabad district government counsel (DGC) Rajeev Priyadarshi said, “The Supreme Court had directed the accused to surrender in the district sessions court by July 30. The district judge had transferred the case for a fast track trial. The additional sessions judge cancelled the interim bail application of the accused and determined hearing for regular bail on July 26. The accused was sent to jail on court orders. In case he is found guilty by the court, the accused may have to stay in prison for up to seven years.” According to sources, the professor had posted a comment on Facebook denigrating Irani, which was later deleted. Investigation officer Anoop Tiwari said, “The original post and the ID from which it was posted were later deleted after an FIR was registered in the matter. We are also searching for that person. The case is being pursued by the cyber cell.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/up-prof-jailed-for-derogatory-remarks-against-smriti-irani/articleshow/84621922.cms||Deepak Lavania

It seems that India’s cases have plateaued in July and are declining at a very slow pace as compared to last month. The weekly average of cases shows that the average which was 42.5k in July’s first week decreased to 39.5k in the second and 38.3k in the third. Among states, Kerala and the northeast are still going through a surge while Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Odisha seem to have plateaued. Kerala reported 17,481 cases on Wednesday, which was the highest among states. Manipur reported 1,327 cases — the state’s highest so far. Maharashtra’s case count of 8,159 cases was the second-highest after Kerala. Meanwhile, more than 3,500 old deaths have been added to Maharashtra’s Covid toll in a single day, taking the overall pandemic deaths since March 2020 to 1.3 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/daily-cases-plateau-maharashtra-adds-3500-old-covid-deaths-to-toll/articleshow/84624744.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune Metropolitan Region feels the sting, dengue & chikungunya cases rise in July||PUNE: Mosquito-borne infections recorded a sharp rise in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) in July, with PMC sentinel centres detecting 86 confirmed cases of dengue and 50 cases of chikungunya this month so far as against none in the previous two months. Besides, data from an accredited private laboratory in the city has revealed detection of 1,201 dengue cases alone during the same period (in the last three months). “A suspected patient of dengue is presenting with fever, body ache and headache. Most of them are managed on an out-patient-department (OPD) basis. Only when their platelet counts drop below 50,000 or they complain of vomiting and anorexia that we admit them,” said consultant physician Rajesh Gadia, who has been closely following seasonal trends and clinical presentation in dengue disease in Pune for the last many years. “Those who are getting diagnosed with dengue this monsoon are primarily from Kondhwa, Hadapsar, Somwar Peth and BT Kawade Road in the PMC limits. I am also seeing patients coming in from Shirur, Daund, and Baramati,” Gadia said. Favourable climatic conditions, waterlogging, poor water storage practices, lack of public awareness about anti-mosquito measures, and inadequate mosquito management have aggravated the situation, experts said. At AG Diagnostics, one of the accredited private laboratories in the city, the numbers have been on the rise since June. “We had recorded 81 cases of dengue in May. The number went up to 159 in June and 212 in July so far. These are cases we detected using the dengue IgM antibody test, which is considered the gold standard for the detection,” said the laboratory’s medical director and pathologist Awanti Golwilkar-Mehendale. Using the rapid dengue test (NS1 antigen), the laboratory detected 133 dengue cases in May, 249 in June and 367 in July. “In short, we have so far detected 1,201 dengue cases in the last three months either using dengue antibody or antigen test,” she added. The experts said unlike dengue, for which a patient’s blood sample is tested for confirmation, chikungunya is mostly clinically diagnosed by doctors based on a patient’s symptoms as a fatal complication in chikungunya is considered a rarity. Health activists, however, said PMC should focus on controlling the dengue-causing mosquitoes by identifying and destroying their breeding sites. “People should also see that they are not breeding mosquitoes on their premises too,” activist Sanjay Dabhade said. PMC’s head of the insect control department Sanjeev Wavare said, “We have already started identifying and destroying the breeding sites on a war footing. Citizens should also do their bit by keeping their premises clean.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmr-feels-the-sting-dengue-chikungunya-cases-rise-in-july/articleshow/84623631.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Dr Ravindra Chaudhary, the additional district health officer of Nashik Zilla Parishad, said these 28 women were vaccinated after undergoing counselling at the centres in the presence of senior doctors and gynaecologists. Last week, about 20 pregnant women took the vaccine at different private hospitals in Nashik City. “After the state government’s directives to start with the vaccination programme for pregnant women, we started the campaign from Monday at very limited number of centres,” said Chaudhary. Speaking on the response from the pregnant women, he said it would be too early though the message to the beneficiaries has been sent through the Asha workers. The vaccination began on Monday at 16 vaccination centres. He said annually about 80,000 pregnant women in Nashik rural are given various vaccines as part of the government health programme. “Considering the same, we expect about 6,600 pregnant women to be vaccinated on monthly basis in the rural areas,” Dr Chaudhary said “The women, who were ready to take the vaccine, were first explained about the issues likely to be faced during the vaccination and were administered the same. After observation for over an hour, the women were allowed to leave the premises. The administration is keeping a close watch on the health of these women,” said Chaudhary. The doctor said the ones who had taken the vaccine are from the middle-income group, who have access to education. “In rural areas, especially in the tribal areas, people generally accept anything they see being consumed or used by others. Slowly. we will spread the message in the rural areas,” said another health officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/28-pregnant-women-take-covid-jabs-in-rural-nashik/articleshow/84621018.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Chandigarh||Experts say Punjab must review PPAs for bringing down power cost, improving supply||PATIALA: The issue of cancellation or review of power purchase agreements (PPA) with independent power producers (IPP) has taken centrestage in Punjab politics. Pointing out the availble recourses to do so, experts press the need to revisit these PPAs with IPPS. “Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has surrendered unutilised IPP power worth more than Rs 4,000 crore up to 2020 and the per-unit cost from these IPPs has been increasing almost on yearly basis. Moreover, these IPPs are finding loopholes in PPAs and have been indulging in litigation, resulting in higher cost of power to consumers in the state. The overall impact of such litigations would be around Rs 20,000 crore over 20 years of the remaining period,” said PSEB Engineers Association members. “Both parties (seller and procurer) can review PPAs anytime, which is provided in the agreement. Punjab government, as procurer, can review the PPA and make amendments. There is another way, as under clause 14.4.5, the PPA can be cancelled if one of the party defaults. Under this clause, if Punjab government fails to clear the dues of seller (IPP), then the seller is free to sell its power to a third party. However, the state government will have to pay fixed charges for three years to the seller (IPP) and these charges can be paid on monthly basis. For these three years, the seller can sell power to a third party but 50% profit would be shared with Punjab. After these three years, the IPP need not share profit with Punjab,” said a power expert. “The PPAs were drafted with the interests of IPPs protected and profits guaranteed at the cost of PSPCL. The power generation policy of Punjab was irrational and defective as it resulted in excess capacity addition and was self-contradictory as it directly caused the cost of generation of state thermal stations to shoot up,” said PSEB Engineers Association general secretary Ajaypal Singh Atwal. Experts point to the Gujarat policy (2009), which safeguards state discom against surplus capacity, causing payment of capacity charges without any energy. He explained that para 11 of the Gujarat policy gives the state discom the right to invoke the option/first right of refusal. “The state discom does not compulsorily have to purchase the full capacity of a new project but has been given the discretion to purchase only that quantum required by it. On first of April every year, the state discom has the freedom to give its power purchase quantum/ requirement for the financial year and it is to pay capacity charges only for that quantum,” he said. He claimed that Punjab removed the protective clause at the time of finalising the Punjab Power Policy in June 2010. “And thereby gave the IPP the legal basis to levy capacity charges on unwanted surplus power without getting any energy from it,” he said. Power experts suggest that the state government should include the principle of right of refusal on annual basis, as adopted in the Gujarat power policy of January 2009. They also suggested that IPPs be given the freedom to sell power from their surplus capacity to any purchaser anywhere in the country and PSPCL should not be loaded with the surplus or unwanted capacity of power stations. Also, the high cost PPAs with solar and other high cost non-conventional IPPs need to be re-opened, it was suggested. “Apart from paying fixed charges round the year, there is no provision for minimum capacity available during peak period, normal and off-peak seasons. There is a pressing need to revisit these IPPs to have an efficient strategy to bring down the cost and make it realistic in the current scenario,” said V K Gupta, spokesperson of All India Power Engineers' Federation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/experts-say-punjab-must-review-ppas-for-bringing-down-power-cost-improving-supply/articleshow/84623647.cms||Bharat Khanna
---||Mumbai||Infertility myths prompt many tribals to stay away from vaccination: Survey||MUMBAI: Around 45% of 335 unvaccinated villagers from rural Raigad who were respondents of a survey on Covid-19 vaccination have said they are not willing to take the jab. The survey, carried out by a non-profit group and which covered nearly 570 individuals, showed tribal families feared side effects. The findings were shared with the district collector and efforts were under way to get the tribal leaders on board. The survey, carried out by Swades Foundation, a rural empowerment NGO, covered people over 45 years of age living in 27 hamlets. Nearly half the respondents were senior citizens. The survey, carried out over four weeks, showed that 59% of the respondents, or 335 people, were not vaccinated at all. Almost every respondent had heard of the pandemic from either the television or friends. About 22% described Covid as a “normal cough and fever that will not occur if one has strong immunity”. “Vaccine hesitancy is highest among housewives, non-agricultural labourers, tribals and the non-working population. They place their faith in myths such as vaccination will leave them infertile,” said Raigad district collector Nidhi Choudhary. The survey showed 74% of those not willing to vaccinate were anxious about side effects, 53% felt the risk of infection was low as they had taken all precautions, while 36% had trust issues about the vaccine. Rural blocks of Tala and Sudhagad had the fewest vaccinations. The district administration has begun roping in ‘mhokaris’, or tribal leaders. “We are convincing them to take shots first and then ask others to follow suit,” said Choudhary. Teachers from rural ashramshalas are being roped in to deliver messages to children, who can influence their parents to get inoculated. Around 500 students live and study in ashramshalas in rural Raigad. The survey found that among those willing to get inoculated, inability to find slots was a concern. Long queues at primary health centres deter villagers as they lose out on work and income. The administration has started ‘vaccines on wheels’ service using mobile vans. “The survey’s aim was to understand community orientation on Covid as a whole and about vaccination. We will carry out a similar survey in four tribal blocks of Igatpuri. The findings not only helped us learn which communities need greater outreach but can help the administration plan its drives,” said Swades Foundation CEO Mangesh Wange.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/infertility-myths-prompt-many-tribals-to-stay-away-from-vaccination-in-mumbai-survey/articleshow/84624219.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Delhi||Bird flu: No symptoms yet in doctors, nurses who attended to boy||NEW DELHI: All close contacts of the 11-year-old boy, the first human victim of bird flu in India, have been put under surveillance to check for any symptoms. This includes his family members and the team of doctors and nurses who treated him. The Union health ministry on Wednesday, however, said none of the close contacts had any symptoms. “An active search for any symptomatic case has been carried out in the hospital and the area where the deceased boy resided. There are none at present,” said a ministry official, adding that IEC (Information, Education and Communication) activities had been carried out for the general public with advice to report any symptomatic case to the health authorities. TimesViewThe Delhi government has rightly taken note of the influenza virus that primarily infects birds. The challenge lies in keeping a close watch over potential hotspots without creating panic.“The animal husbandry department has not found any suspected cases of bird flu in the area (Chakkarpur in Gurgaon, Haryana) and has enhanced surveillance in a 10-km zone as a precautionary measure,” the ministry mentioned in a press statement. The death of the boy at AIIMS due to bird flu was reported by TOI on Tuesday. Officials said he was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a type of blood cancer, in June. He developed fever, cough and breathing difficulty during the treatment. The AML, along with febrile neutropenia with pneumonia and shock, progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome. He was admitted to AIIMS on July 2. He suffered from multiorgan dysfunction and died on July 16. The microbiology department of AIIMS received bronchoalveolar lavage for respiratory panel testing on July 7 and 11, said the health ministry, adding that it was negative for SARS-CoV2, virus that causes Covid-19. “Subtyping of influenza A remained inconclusive with available reagents for H1N1 and H3N2 at AIIMS. The samples were then sent to National Institute of Virology, Pune on July 13. At NIV, the samples tested positive for A/H5 (avian influenza) and type-B Victoria lineage. Whole genome sequencing and virus isolation is in process,” the ministry said. India has experienced multiple outbreaks of avian influenza in the last 15 years affecting birds, mainly poultry, who had to be culled to prevent the spread of the disease. However, there have been no documented cases of deaths in humans due to the disease. This is why this case is important. Avian influenza can spread to humans through droppings, saliva and secretion of the infected bird, so it is advisable to avoid contaminated surfaces. “The risk of spread of bird flu to humans is extremely rare, but we must take precautions. Those involved in the handling of poultry birds, for example chicken, should clean and disinfect any suspected infected areas and wear protective gear such as gloves,” said a doctor. Public health experts said people should be alert about birds dying in their localities. “One should not venture near bird carcasses and immediately report any death to the authorities,” added an expert. Bird flu illness in humans can range from mild to severe. Signs and symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body ache, fatigue, headache, eye redness (or conjunctivitis), and difficulty in breathing. As with seasonal flu, some people are at high risk of getting very sick from bird flu infections, including pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems and people older than 65 years. More than 700 human infections with highly pathogenic Asian avian influenza-A (H5N1) viruses have been reported to WHO from primarily 15 countries in Asia, Africa, the Pacific, Europe and the Near East since November 2003. Indonesia, Vietnam and Egypt have reported the highest number of human HPAI Asian H5N1 cases to date, according to the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bird-flu-no-symptoms-yet-in-docs-nurses-who-attended-to-boy/articleshow/84623650.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

A probe into the incident revealed that the person tested at a bus stand had shared the wrong information. “The Covid test was done at a bus stand and the individual concerned deliberately gave the wrong name and false personal details. He shared the mobile number of the deceased man’s son, who received the test report on his mobile,” Nanded municipal commissioner Sunil Lahane told TOI on Tuesday. Govind Mokale, whose name was shared by the individual, had died in 2004 at the age of 75. “It is evident that the individual who played mischief knew the Mokale family and had the mobile number of Mokale’s son. The health authorities, who collected his swab for Covid testing, did not cross-check his identity as there is no such norm,” Lahane said. The swab sample in question was sent to the Covid testing lab at the Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University, Nanded. The sample tested negative. While the report was shared with Mokale’s family on July 14, it caught public attention only on Tuesday when the death certificate and test report were revealed. Govind’s son Dilip Mokale said he was surprised to get the Covid test report for his late father. “We are also clueless about who the person could be. Learning from this incident, authorities should verify the identity of those getting tested to avoid similar confusion in the future,” he said. Taking serious note of the incident, the civic administration at Nanded has appealed to citizens not to give false personal information while undergoing random Covid-19 tests. “Covid testing at public places not only ensures personal safety of citizens, but also their families and the society at large,” Lahane said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/false-details-make-deceased-man-covid-ve/articleshow/84611584.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Survey exposed erosion’s risks on Vikhroli hill||MUMBAI: A geological survey conducted last year at the spot of Sunday’s Vikrohli landslide, in which ten people died, had exposed massive manmade-erosion of the hill slope. For years, people who were unable to afford dwellings anywhere else in the city, have been cutting terraces on hills and placing shanties on them, disturbing the natural stability of hill surfaces. Such activity not only leads to top soil erosion, but also a weakening of the slope due to the removal of trees. Dense vegetation on hills acts as a binding agent for topsoil, resisting erosion during events like rainfall. Building activity on hills profoundly disrupts this natural balance. The geological survey at the Vikhroli hill where Sunday’s landslide occurred showed that the slum in question, Surya Nagar, has rows of houses constructed in a north-south alignment. To place the houses, the hill has been cut in such a way that the slopes at the back of the houses are now at a much steeper incline than the natural slope had been. The report, by the Geological Survey of India (GSI), mentioned that considering the moderate-to-steep back slopes, there is a possibility of rocks falling in the event of heavy rain. The report was drafted last year by the GSI after a joint survey with the BMC of the entire 900-metre stretch of the hill. It pointed to signs of instability like the loosening of weathered rock mass, opening of joint planes, and tilted and uprooted trees. Because of population growth accompanied by rural–urban migration, and urbanization, the proportion of people potentially exposed to natural disasters has increased. The most vulnerable in the bargain are the urban poor. Sometime ago, an international report had pointed out that regarding landslides, the pressure of urban development and population growth on available land intensifies anthropogenic drivers of landslide risk. Such drivers are “activities such as altering slope geometry with earthworks, loading slopes with buildings and infrastructure, changing the vegetation, and consequential changes in slope surface water and groundwater regimes”, the report stated. On the Vikhroli hill, the GSI report says, describing local geology, that a few loose boulders in upslope areas and old slide debris behind settlement zones are seen at places. The survey also showed that there is not enough drainage arrangements for sewage water, which is allowed to flow directly from upslope to downslope. The report also mentioned how available open spaces behind settlement zones have been used as dumping grounds for garbage and other waste material. “Settlements in close proximity of the slope may be affected in case of any instability during the rainy season. At places there is hardly any space left between a slope and a settlement zone. The houses are single- and double-storied buildings made of brick and tin roofs,” states the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-survey-exposed-erosions-risks-on-vikhroli-hill/articleshow/84623641.cms||Richa Pinto

The CBI has also identified 25-30 survivors, both male and female, in the 12-21 age group, sources said. The children targeted by the paedophile hailed from Goa and Maharashtra, and investigations are still on to find out how he trapped and managed to abuse the children. The paedophile was also in touch with persons abroad to sell the videos. Sources in the bureau said they had received inputs from its internal Interpol unit about the paedophile network operated from Goa. CBI registered the case against him and other unknown persons on June 22 last year. The accused was arrested recently and, on completion of police custody, was produced on Tuesday before the POCSO court in Goa and has been remanded in judicial custody. “The man originally hails from Mumbai, and after completing a course in hotel management, he sought a job in Goa, where he worked as a chef, and he began abusing children,” said a source. As per the FIR, the accused was involved in sexual abuse of children in Goa and Maharashtra, and also recorded these acts by using his mobile phone, digital camera and other electronic devices. “It was further alleged that these photographs and video films containing child sexual abuse material were published/transmitted by the accused person(s) using the facility of internet and the accused used the dark web for sale, transmission and sharing/trading of such child sexual abusive material content with other individuals,” the CBI said in an official statement on Wednesday. The accused was also using social networking websites and platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp to connect with individuals abroad for trading and sharing this material in huge quantities, the CBI said. “It was also alleged that the accused was using email for connecting with other paedophiles outside the country; the internet to access cloud-based storage services for storing the illegal... content; accessing free photo-sharing websites based in other countries,” CBI said. During searches, a mobile phone, hard drive, pen drive and laptop, allegedly used by the accused to access the material, were recovered. Some of the children who had been abused are now adults, said the CBI source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cbi-arrests-paedophile-working-as-chef-in-goa/articleshow/84623635.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

The suspect did not stand in queue and directly walked into the cabin of the doctor to get the vaccine and started arguing. As per FIR registered, police head constable Vivek Salve along with another constable were on patrolling duty in Bhagur area when they were asked to go to a vaccination centre in Nanegaon. When the two constables reached the spot and tried to calm things down, the suspect got into an argument with them and manhandled Salve.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/man-booked-on-charge-of-assaulting-cop-at-vaccination-centre/articleshow/84611620.cms||---

The KMC started the vaccination drive for pregnant women on Monday. On the first day, only 35 of 5,236 shortlisted beneficiaries came to the vaccination centre in the city. The poor turnout has prompted the KMC authorities to plan vaccinations for pregnant women just on Mondays, and not on other days of the week. The next session will be held at the Panchaganga Hospital on Monday. Amol Mane, the KMC vaccination nodal officer, said, “We have decided to hold counselling sessions for the pregnant women through our nursing staff. The vaccine is safe for any pregnant woman and the unborn child. Many still have some doubts, which will be addressed at these sessions. Also, we will ask the vaccinated pregnant women to convince other pregnant women during their visit to the dispensaries.” “We will rope in local experts. The family members of the women too will be made aware of the need for vaccination. If there are sufficient numbers, we will organise camps near the residences of the pregnant women,” said Mane.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/poor-turnout-of-pregnant-women-for-jabs-in-kolhapur/articleshow/84611638.cms||---

However, no specific orders have been issued yet to poultry markets or the general public. The department said samples were collected throughout the year, but after the recent case teams had been asked to be more vigilant and ensure all precautions were taken in markets. It’s extremely rare for humans to contract the virus and human-to-human transmission has never been reported and there was no reason to panic. “As a standard exercise, poultry samples are collected throughout the year. This had not stopped even after the last outbreak in January,” said a senior animal husbandry official, adding that samples were collected randomly and sent to Bhopal for testing. The official said, “There is no need to panic yet. We are not recording positive cases and it’s extremely rare for bird flu to be transmitted to humans. If positive cases are detected again, then guidelines may be issued.” In January, a number of bird deaths were reported across the city within a short span of a week. This resulted in temporary closure of the Ghazipur murga mandi, among others poultry markets. They were later allowed to reopen after samples from birds were found negative. Delhi zoo, too, reported its first case of bird flu in the same month with the H5N8 strain of the virus found in a brown fish owl — a captive bird. Subsequently, seven other samples of birds were found positive in February. In March, two consecutive sets of samples of bird droppings tested negative for the virus, indicating that bird flu had disappeared. While bird flu mainly affects domestic poultry, it can spread from the infected birds to other winged creatures through nasal and respiratory secretions and contamination of feed and water. Samples are generally sent for testing to High Security Animal Disease Laboratory at Bhopal, from where the results are released within a week. In January, dead birds, largely crows, were found in parks across Delhi, including Hastsal, Mayur Vihar and Dwarka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-need-to-panic-yet-say-officials-as-they-up-vigil-intensify-testing/articleshow/84623664.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Also, an offshore trough at mean sea level from southern Gujarat to Karnataka will also influence the state’ weather in tandem with the low pressure area. It will trigger enhanced rainfall activity and India meteorological department (IMD) has forecast very heavy rain which may touch 110mm in 24 hour spells with isolated and scattered spatial distribution over both districts during next four days. Though the rainfall activity showed a slight decrease on Wednesday, a few centres received heavy rainfall. Sanguem recorded the highest of 88.3mm, Sakhali recorded 77.2mm, Old Goa 66.7mm, Quepem 57.6mm, Ponda 5mm, Pernem 41.8mm and other centres on a lesser scale. The seasonal total on Wednesday had touched 1,998.3mm, as compared to the normal of 1,612.7mm, and a huge surplus after 10 days of often very heavy rainfall. Fishermen have been warned not to venture out to sea even as winds are likely to be gusty, peaking from 40 to 50 km per hour to 60km per hour. While the monsoon had commenced on schedule on June 5, the rainfall activity had been consistent and there was a surplus of 6% at the end of the month. After a short phase of a weak monsoon, precipitation intensified since July 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/imd-goa-may-see-very-heavy-rain-next-4-days/articleshow/84623653.cms||---

Troubled with water woes, many residents were forced to arrange for private tankers and water jars even though Jayakwadi dam that supplies water to Aurangabad is having sufficient storage and monsoon has produced surplus rainfall so far. A major mechanical and electrical issue encountered by city’s water supply system on July 18 is being blamed for escalated water scarcity in Aurangabad. Many areas of Hudco and Cidco, among other localities that were supposed to get water on July 19 could not receive the supply till Wednesday. Affected citizens, though their local corporators, were told that the overhead tanks in their areas could not get filled in order to supply water. Gajanan Pawar, a resident of N-11, said he ordered two private tankers in the wake of extended gap in water supply. “Besides, I need to bring two water jars for drinking purpose taking my total expenses to Rs 550. This burden is despite me paying a hefty water tax of Rs 4,050 per year,” he said. In an official communication, the civic administration has already expressed regret over disrupted water supply and requested the citizens to cooperate. “Even if necessary troubleshooting and repair work associated with water supply system was carried out on war-footing, the glitch developed is bound to have cascading effect on water distribution for two days. Parts of the city are getting tap-water supply by extended gap of two days,” the civic administration has said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/extended-water-gap-leaves-many-city-areas-high-dry/articleshow/84621086.cms||---

While it had 176 active cases on July 9, by July 19, the number had dropped to 79, revealed the data shared by the state health department. During the same period, the number of active mucormycosis (also known as black fungus) cases in three other north Maharashtra — Ahmednagar, Dhule and Nandurbar — too dipped. Only Jalgaon district has reported an increase (by one case) during this period.“This is the biggest drop in active mucormycosis cases in Nashik district since the black fungus cases surfaced here nearly two months ago. About one-and-a-half months ago, there were 320 active mucormycosis cases in Nashik district. At present, we are getting very few fresh cases,” said Dr Ashok Thorat, the district civil surgeon and the head of the mucormycosis taskforce in Nashik. According to the health officials, the number of active black fungal cases in Nashik had started dipping from early July. “With a significant reduction in Covid cases, active cases will further drop,” said the officials.During this period, Nashik reported 89 new black fungal cases taking the total number of cases to 723. The death toll increased by 13 to reach 78. Meanwhile, Ahmednagar recorded three fresh mucormycosis cases during this period and the death toll increased by 2. In Jalgaon, new black fungus cases increased by 11 and the death toll by 5. In Nandurbar, one new case was registered during this period. Nandurbar is the only district in the region that did not have any mucormycosis-related death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-dist-has-only-79-active-black-fungus-cases/articleshow/84611648.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Pune||Adverse events reporting by states ‘not satisfactory’, says AEFI||PUNE: The national Adverse Effects Following Immunisation (AEFI) committee has urged states to ensure all side-effects after Covid-19 jabs are reported to the CoWIN portal. The committee said there has been a drastic drop in reporting levels by states. Head of the committee, Dr NK Arora, said states should tell vaccinators to report all events of concern occurring within 28 days of Covid-19 vaccination. He added that due to low AEFI reporting, the country may be missing some rare adverse events, which could be of relevance to Indian and foreign regulators as some vaccines in use in the country have also been deployed globally. The co-convenor of the All India Drug Action Network, Malini Aisola, said the current reporting system is extremely weak and unresponsive. She said, “Many people have faced difficulties while reporting AEFI, let alone securing medical support from the vaccination programme, even though there is a provision for medical management in the protocols.” She added that the quality of evidence while investigating AEFI at the local level is very poor with many events being brushed aside as unrelated to vaccination, even before the evidence has been collected. “It reveals poor awareness and training among district-level authorities and committees,” Aisola said, adding that the slow pace of reporting does not serve the purpose as only 91 AEFI investigations were completed till May 27. She said it’s also unlikely families of the affected have been informed. “So there is little being done to instil confidence in a system that's meant to protect patient safety,” she added. Recently, the AEFI committee approved a report of 60 serious adverse events, ruling that 55 of them (most of which needed hospitalisation), were associated with vaccination as per the causality assessment. The rest of the five cases, including the death of a 57-year-old male in February after a Covishield shot, were ruled as “coincidental”, not directly linked to Covid vaccination. The report of the 60 cases was submitted to the health ministry on July 8. The report said 36 of the 60 were anxiety-related reactions while 18 were vaccine product-related reactions. One adverse event was classified as both vaccine product-related and anxiety-related reaction. Five cases were found to have inconsistent causal association to vaccination (coincidental; not linked to vaccination) of which one was the death in February. The first report on causality assessment, which had 31 serious AEFI cases, was released in June. That report recorded India's first Covid vaccine-related death. Seven other post-vaccination deaths were declared as “indeterminate”, indicating there was no evidence to connect them to the vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/adverse-events-reporting-by-states-not-satisfactory/articleshow/84623666.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Hyderabad||‘I will be the voice of SCs, marginalised sections’||RS Praveen Kumar quit IPS recently to work for marginalised sections and to follow the path of social reformer BR Ambedkar and BSP founder Kanshi Ram. Known for his work in the transformation of social welfare residential schools in Telangana, Praveen Kumar tells U Sudhakar Reddy that he wants to be the voice of SC community. Excerpts from the interview n Telangana government immediately accepted your resignation letter. Are you joining any political party?  I will be able to do bigger things once I got out of IPS. Ambedkar, Jyotirao Phule and Kanshi Ram made significant contribution to social justice. I have decided to follow their path. Joining politics is not the only option. But, I will let everyone know about my decision on political foray soon. n What are the triggering factors for your exit? There are no immediate triggers. I had decided about it six months ago. Becoming a police chief in an organisation is not a big thing. My thinking goes beyond it. I have never aspired for a plum posting and have always looked forward to serving the marginalised. n What is your contribution to society as an IPS officer? What is Swaeroism? As an IPS officer, I have come out with out-of-box solutions wherever I worked. For example, in education sector, I could impact residential schools and colleges positively. My significant contribution would be the new ideology of Swaeroism. This has given a unique identity to the poor. Swaeroism helped them realise their potential. SW stands for social welfare, while ‘aeros’ refers to the sky, suggesting that the sky is the limit. The funda At Youth mentals of the Swaero movement is you have to liberate yourself. It is an inclusive ideology. n You have come under severe criticism for the Swaero movement. There are several complaints against you. There are many conspiracies to harm me. They went to the extent of complaining to the President of India and governor of Telangana. I have always tried to uphold the constitutional values of liberty, equality and justice. These elements who complained against me are unhappy over the way I was liberating the marginalised. Their intention is to ensure the poor do not break the glass ceiling. They set limits to us, saying you can study but cannot educate beyond a point. Swaeroism challenged this. But, conspiracies have made me stronger. n You are accused of pursuing religious lines. Who served notices to you? I have replied to the notices I got from NCPCR, Parliament secretariat and a couple of organisations. They were targeting me, alleging I am converting people. I answered all their notices. The crux of my reply was whatever I am doing is as per the Constitution. Ours is a transparent movement. We are not against any religion. I am a Hindu, but my meaning of Hinduism is peaceful co-existence... I believe in inter-faith co-existence. n Do you have support of other civil servants? A few are in touch. We are not thinking of any entity... We are looking at a larger social transformation. It is now or never. n Do you think the poor are ignored at national level and in Telangana? I don’t want to be a spectator when the poor are blatantly ignored. Ninety per cent of the poor are still dependant. Welfare schemes are a trap and they are not going to help the poor. n IAS and IPS officers who joined politics did not make much difference. How do you want to change that? It’s a work in progress. Bureaucrats join politics with good intentions. I am dissatisfied with government sector... I am against tokenism in politics. Still, we have discrimination. For instance, sweepers remain sweepers for generations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/i-will-be-the-voice-of-scs-marginalised-sections/articleshow/84623672.cms||---

Paramjit Singh, 35, worked at a dairy farm in Hastinapur. The arrest of an alleged gunrunner from Punjab, Gagandeep Singh, on July 6 set off a trail that led to Paramjit. Gagandeep had been booked in Punjab for allegedly supplying weapons to a man called Aarsh, believed to be close to the chief of the banned Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF) chief Hardeep Singh Nijjar. The weapons were said to have been used for extortion. The Union ministry of home affairs had in January identified KTF among outfits the NIA must investigate for “conspiracy to create an atmosphere of fear and lawlessness and cause disaffection in people and to incite them towards rising in rebellion towards the government of India”. Gagandeep pointed the NIA to Paramjit and another man, Asif Ali, who was arrested on July 10 with two 0.315 country-made firearms and 10 live rounds. A day later, Paramjit was called in for questioning. “During a search (at Paramjit’s house in Hastinapur’s Dudhali Khadar), cash amounting to Rs 9 lakh, mobile phones and incriminating documents were recovered,” a July 11 NIA statement said. “Paramjit was taken away by the NIA on July 11 and let off the following day. He was summoned again on July 14. Then, on Monday (July 19), he was asked to reach NIA’s Chandigarh office to record a statement. We got there and he was with them (NIA officials) for five hours,” Paramjit’s father Ajit Singh said. Later that evening, they left Chandigarh. “(When we were leaving,) NIA officers told me they had ‘explained everything’ to Paramjit. All through the journey home I did everything I could to make him talk about what happened. He wouldn’t speak.” On Tuesday night, he left for the dairy farm where he worked. Hours later, he was found lying unconscious, possibly by passersby. “He was alive when he was brought to the hospital. The doctors said he had consumed pesticide,” Hastinapur police station sub inspector AK Singh said. An hour later, his father Ajit received a call. Ajit said, “It was from the hospital, telling me my son had died.” His body has been sent for an autopsy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-man-questioned-by-nia-in-khalistan-gunrunning-case-kills-self/articleshow/84621990.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Aurangabad||Police naik convicted of police sub-inspector’s murder attempt gets 7-year rigorous imprisonment in Osmababad||AURANGABAD: The Osmababad district-based additional sessions court, while convicting a police naik of making an attempt on the life of a woman police sub-inspector (PSI), has sentenced him to seven years of rigorous imprisonment (RI). Additional sessions judge NH Makhare cited the “criminal tendency” of the police naik — who was deployed as a driver of the van attached to the Anandnagar police station in Psmanabad — while slapping him with the punishment. As per police records, the 2014-bath woman PSI and Ashish Dhakne (the 32-year old police naik) had become friends after she was posted in Osmanabad after 2016. She, however, got to know of his relationship with another woman and objected to it. The woman PSI even went to the house of the other woman. This caused friction between the two women. When he came to know of this, Dhakne went to the PSI’s flat in the early hours of May 31, 2019. He assaulted her before taking her to the terrace of the fourth floor of the apartment where she resided alone. After punching her, he pushed her from the terrace. The woman PSI suffered multiple fractures to her head, face and limbs apart from other injuries. The accused then took her to a private hospital and alerted her parents, claiming she had fallen from the terrace. On June 11, 2019, the PSI’s father lodged a complaint against four people, including an inspector, for alleging pushing her from the terrace. However, on June 29, the injured PSI regained consciousness and lodged a complaint accusing Dhakne for attempting to kill her. He was then booked and arrested immediately. An uproar against the incident prompted the transfer of the probe to a deputy superintendent of the police-rank officer. On directions from the DGP’s office, superintendent of police Raj Tilak Roushan supervised the probe. During the trial, the court examined 24 witnesses. While convicting the accused, the court said the accused narrated different stories to different people, and said: “Why in spite of being in police, he is reluctant to follow the rule of law? Thus, the subsequent conduct of the accused is relevant and it is proving mens rea. The accused intended to divert attention of the investigating agency.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/police-naik-convicted-of-psis-murder-attempt-gets-7-year-ri/articleshow/84611671.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The wife of the patient who is on life support system, had moved HC on Monday evening pleading that sperms of her husband be preserved so that she can conceive through IVF if her husband does not recover from Covid-19. The newly wed had to move court as the pending Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill stipulates that no man’s sperm can be obtained without his consent. The hospital management had insisted on a court order in the absence of consent. After hearing the plea, HC on Tuesday had directed Vadodara-based Sterling Hospital to preserve the sperms as sought by his wife. The hospital had initially declined her request because the patient is in no condition to give consent. He is unconscious and on life support after suffering multiple organ failures. “We received the court order at around 5.10 pm. As per the procedure, we counselled the wife and the parents. The testicular sperm extraction (TESE) was started at around 8 pm and the surgical procedure ended at around 8.30 pm. The sperms have been extracted and preserved in the lab,” said Anil Nambiar, zonal director of Sterling Hospitals. “We are happy that the procedure has been successful. Now, the family and doctor's priority is the survival of the patient. The extracted sperms can be preserved for long,” he said. The family through advocate Nilay Patel had sought directions to the medical expert concerned to collect and store the sperms according to medical advice. The lawyer requested the court to hear the case urgently and Justice Ashutosh Shastri had agreed. The patient was admitted on May 10 and the doctors have conveyed to the family that he may not survive. The court has, however, not granted permission to proceed with artificial insemination till further orders. The court is likely to hear the case again on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/sperms-of-man-dying-of-covid-19-collected-preserved/articleshow/84621946.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: 10 lakh need second Covishield jab, but only half the doses land||PUNE: Inconsistent supply of Covishield to civic sites in the district has sparked concern among those relying on free Covid vaccination. Private hospitals still have good reserves of the vaccine, but civic sites — where the jabs are free — are important for coverage in low-income neighbourhoods. At private hospitals, a single Covishield shot costs Rs 780. Also, nearly 10 lakh people are due for a second dose of Covishield. But the district in July so far (till July 21) has received 5.79 lakh doses of the vaccine. A batch of 62,000 Covishield doses landed on Wednesday, but the volume may not be enough. Kirti Tank, a resident of Sangvi, said she was turned away from three centres offering Covishield. “The government wants everyone to be vaccinated, but it doesn't seem to have enough doses,” she said. Sunita Ubhe, a resident of Sinhagad Road, said she has been trying to get a first dose for days. Ubhe said, “The vaccine is just not available. The staff at the centres told me they have no idea when the doses will be available next. I tried some centres near Parvati,, but they didn’t have doses either. And they said residents from that area would be given first preference when doses finally arrive.” Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said supply — of both Covishield and Covaxin — is expected to improve only by next month. “We have been getting a steady supply of doses from the Centre. But the number of second-dose beneficiaries is higher than the doses we got,” he said. On Wednesday, the district got 62,000 Covishield and 12,620 Covaxin doses. Pune rural got 27,000 Covishield doses and 5,620 Covaxin doses. The PMC was given 21,000 Covishield and 4,000 Covaxin doses. The PCMC was allocated 14,000 Covishield doses and 3,000 Covaxin doses. The PMC’s immunization officer, Suryakant Devkar, said the new stock will be enough for just a day's vaccination drive. “We have 196 sites for Thursday’s Covishield drive and six for Covaxin sessions,” Devkar said. The PCMC on Thursday will hold only Covaxin drives, out of four sites, officials from the civic body said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/10l-need-2nd-covishield-jab-but-only-half-the-doses-land/articleshow/84623674.cms||Piyush Bhusari

---||Delhi||Delhi: Micro tunneling at RRTS station to cut chaos on road at Anand Vihar||NEW DELHI: Anand Vihar— Delhi’s busiest transit hub due to the presence of two Delhi Metro corridors, a railway station and an interstate bus terminal— is also the site of the upcoming Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) corridor. To ensure minimum inconvenience to large number of passengers taking these modes of transport, a unique tunnelling technique is being used at the site. National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC), which is building the high-speed RRTS corridor, is doing “micro tunnelling” at the station site before actual tunnel construction for utility diversion work starts. A NCRTC spokesperson said the technique, which had been employed keeping public convenience in mind, would divert the existing interceptor sewer line of Delhi Jal Board at the station site. “This interceptor sewer line was infringing RRTS corridor at this location,” he said. “Micro tunnelling is a trenchless underground construction technique generally used for constructing smaller tunnels for utilities diversion, such as drainage pipelines, etc., to minimise public inconvenience caused during the construction,” he added. The spokesperson explained that micro tunnelling helps install RCC or concrete pipelines of various diameters below highways, railroads, runways, ports and environmentally sensitive areas without disturbing the surface activities and users. “It allows free public movement in the area, therefore, mostly adopted in places where footfall is high, and trenching not advisable as the extraction of debris causes blocking of passages — restricting movement of people. It is also helpful for preserving the existing infrastructure from any physical damage or alteration,” he added. Many basic utility infrastructures are also being constructed, upgraded or relocated by NCRTC, which are infringing the alignment of the RRTS corridor. Delhi Jal Board’s sewer interceptor line is one among them. “Residents of NCR will benefit from this improved infrastructure for a long period of time,” he said. The spokesperson added that the construction work at Anand Vihar was going in full swing with the work of launching the shaft of tunnel boring machine (TBM). Two TBMs will be lowered in the launching shaft to bore RRTS twin tunnels of 6.5 metre diameter from Anand Vihar towards Sarai Kale Khan to construct around 3km of tunnels, which will be the longest section between any two mass transit stations in the country||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/micro-tunneling-at-rrts-station-to-cut-chaos-on-road/articleshow/84623692.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Speculations were abuzz about the meeting about a consensus between Congress and BJP on major issues to be taken up in the House. However, after the meeting, Congress leaders demanded to extend the assembly session by a minimum of two weeks. Mishra also called on Speaker Girish Gautam later in the day to discuss issues related to the assembly session. Govind Singh said, "My meeting with minister Mishra was regarding the law and order situation in my constituency (Lahar in Bhind). The government has shifted the police staff from the area bordering Uttar Pradesh, which has resulted in a sudden surge in crimes. Despite raising several questions in the House, the situation has not improved. The law and order situation has collapsed.” Singh further said, “A police station was opened in Rawatpura despite not being required, while even a single outpost was not set up at places where it was required the most. We have raised the issue before the home minister again. He has assured us that he will collect the details and take necessary action.” The Congress leader also took a dig at chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan for conducting the shortest assembly session. "The chief minister is afraid of facing the Opposition and is trying to suppress our voice by not conducting a long session. If a gold medal is awarded across the country for running the assembly session for the shortest period, then Chouhan will surely get it," said Singh adding, "The assembly session should be of one month or 15 days at least." The senior Congress leader Govid Singh rejected speculation over his neglect in the party and a hidden agenda behind his meeting with the BJP minister. "Whether it is in Congress or Vidhan Sabha, I am not worried about any post. I will fulfil whatever responsibility is given to me. I do not believe in flattery,” he retorted, adding, “It was Narottam Mishra who wanted us to fight. He has many times said that I am being sidelined (in Congress). People call him my friend, but I say God save me from such a friend."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/congress-leaders-demand-extension-of-house-session/articleshow/84623052.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Police modernisation: Centre gave Rs 50 crore to Punjab, Rs 35 crore to Haryana in three years||CHANDIGARH: The central government disbursed Rs 50 crore to the Punjab government for modernisation of police in the last three years, Rs 35 crore to the Haryana government and Rs 10 crore to the Himachal Pradesh government. The information was revealed by Union minister of state for home affairs Nityanand Rai, in reply to a question during the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament, on Tuesday. He added though police and public order are state subjects under the seventh schedule of the Constitution, the central government supplemented efforts of the state governments by equipping and modernising police forces under a centrally sponsored scheme – assistance to states for modernisation of police. “During last two years, certain states like Uttarakhand, Punjab, Kerala, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram have requested for more allocation of funds for the modernisation of police. However, at present, most state governments have substantial unspent balances out of funds released during earlier years. There are capacity constraints at the end of some state police directorates in utilising funds,” said Rai. He, however, added for the states which utilise their funds timely, the scheme has a unique mechanism to provide more funds based on their efficiency in timely utilisation of funds, in the form of ‘better performance incentives’. These funds are released out of a pooled amount of funds unreleased due to non-furnishing of utilisation certificates by other states and incentives for police reforms in selected reform areas for which up to 20% of allocated funds are kept aside. Under this assistance scheme, the central government has provided assistance to state governments for acquisition of advanced weaponry such as INSAS and AK series rifles, all types of intelligence equipment including unmanned aerial vehicles or drones, night-vision devices, CCTV surveillance system, body-worn cameras, modern communication equipment and equipment for security, training, forensics, cybercrime and traffic policing. Also, under this scheme, purchase of operational vehicles are permitted in insurgency-affected north-eastern states and left extremism-affected districts, said Rai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/police-modernisation-centre-gave-rs-50cr-to-punjab-rs-35cr-to-haryana-in-3-years/articleshow/84623687.cms||Sanjeev Verma

The state government, on June 1, had revised the rates for the treatment of Covid patients at private hospitals. Office-bearers of the HOAN said it would be impossible for them to provide treatment to Covid patients at the government rates. They said the treatment charges in private hospitals in other states such as Rajasthan, MP, Delhi and Gujarat were much higher and feasible for the private hospital owners. Raj Nagarkar, vice-president of the association, said that treatment of a Covid patient in ICU with ventilator support is Rs 17,000 a day in MP and only Rs 6,700 in Maharashtra. He said the salaries of doctors, nurses and health workers on Covid duties have gone up and even the prices of medical oxygen, PPE kits, gloves, pulse oximeters, oxygen concentrators, monitors have increased two to three times.  The association claims that the hospitals would run into losses at the current rates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/pvt-hosps-want-covid-treatment-rates-hiked/articleshow/84611687.cms||Santosh Sonawane

This is exactly what happened in the city on Wednesday, when people celebrated Eid-ul-Adha, the first major festival celebrated without lockdown restrictions, ever since the Covid-19 pandemic began . The mood was upbeat, most of the people celebrated at home, to ensure the safety of their kith and kin as coronavirus still lurks ominously on the horizon. Any Indian festival without a table leaden with goodies, is like a wedding ceremony without a bride, said educationist Asma Qureshi. She said, “We organised a luncheon with just 15 close relatives and friends due to Covid protocol. I prepared chicken satay, Afghani naan, chicken korma, mutton biryani, chole and dahi bade, along with rabri and khoye ki jalebi. Everything was home-made but the enjoyment that we all shared, was worth the effort.” What made the festival of Eid really unique was the multi-cultural celebration wherein friends of all faiths were eagerly included in the festivities. A homemaker, Rekha Shrivastav, prepared mutton seekh-kebabs and gulab jamuns for her Muslim friends whom she visited, they were hungrily devoured by the hosts and the guest.  “For the last five years, it has become a ritual of sorts that I prepare a non-vegetarian dish and a sweet for my friend Nikhat Khan and her family on Eid, they are our neighbours and we celebrate all the major festivals together,” said Rekha with a smile.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/a-dose-of-delectable-delights-bonhomie-on-eid/articleshow/84623058.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi

Over the past two days, the team has sealed 13 marriage venues and five hotels. The teams found weddings being performed at the venue with more than the permitted number of guests. Other Covid-appropriate measures were also not being obeyed. Sachin Jadhav, the KMC chief estate officer, said, “We have not just fined the owners, we have also lodged police complaints against them and the wedding organisers. Similarly, we found five hotels hosting parties and dine-ins. Some had even arranged for private rituals in the hotels with a large number of guests. We have appealed to the citizens to give us information, if available, on such activities taking place clandestinely.” Several Covid cases are being reported after such interactions and contacts during social functions. It is mandatory for the wedding venue owners to get permission from the local authorities to hold any function. It is easy to nab such violators in the urban centres, buy in the rural areas, complaints are often not made because of the fear of boycott. Rekhawar has taken cognisance of the complaints and had decided to form rapid action teams for the rural areas. The police patil is usually authorised to take action in the rural area, but sometimes, they too have vested interests. Therefore, it has been decided that temporary squads, which are independent of the local administration, will be formed to take action at the behest of district collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/civic-teams-seal-wedding-halls-hotels-in-kolhapur/articleshow/84611696.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Kisan Sansad today, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha wants no repeat of Jan 26||BATHINDA/JIND: A day before the Kisan Sansad “parallel Parliament” of the farmers, the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Wednesday decided to send the first batch of 200 to Jantar Mantar at 9am from Singhu on Haryana-Delhi border. The protest starts at 11am. Five members from each farmer union, who carry identity cards, will commandeer the jatha. Four buses will carry 50 handpicked protesters each. Delhi Police has given the farmers a verbal permission for staying at Jantar Mantar till 5pm, but under watch. After what happened on January 26 during the tractor parade, ‘josh mein hosh’ (cool head in excitement) is the buzzword for this second storming of Delhi. Keen to maintain discipline, the SKM has instructed the famers to behave like the MPs while outside Parliament. “As our activities will be under watch, we must not do anything unparliamentary,” farmer unionist Balbir Singh Rajewal told them on Wednesday evening. The morcha claimed that the forces that had ruined the January 26 protest were active again. Rajewal said: “The farmers fight for their rights but they don’t believe in violence. Our people’s whip to the MPs is working well and many in Parliament looks to our protest. We’ll show the government that we want nothing more than the repeal those farm laws and a legal guarantee of MSP (minimum support price).” He said a shamiana will be pitched at the protest site and chairs put up for the protesters, and “this farmers’ parliament will adjourn in the evening if not stopped by the cops”. Haryana farmers to have decided to make it mandatory to submit Aadhaar card and a photo with committee concerned to go to Delhi from July 22. Farmers will also travel in a group of five persons to press their demands, and they will comply with the rules made by farmer leaders. Farmers said groups of five farmers from Haryana’s different toll plazas will take part in the agitation at Jantar Mantar and local committees will ensure their presence and identification. Azad Singh Palwan, Jind district BKU (Charuni) chief, said “We have asked every farmer to carry their identity card along with them while travelling for Delhi. Only 200 farmers will march and not thousands, and all will have identification.” Meanwhile, SKM said Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar’s reply in Parliament that the government has made various efforts to end the farm protests was a sheer lie. The Union and Haryana governments had only tried to end the farm protests by slapping false cases on farmers, putting them behind bars, cutting off supplies to protest sites and putting up barricades around the morchas, it said. The government has done its best to malign the farmers, it added. The government did not even articulate the demands of the farmers’ movement accurately on the floor of parliament despite having formal talks with the farmers about it, SKM representatives said. Although, farmers have said they seek a legal guarantee on minimum support price for all agricultural produce, declared with a C2+50% formula, the government chose to present this demand as an issue related to procurement of wheat and paddy. They said it is shameful and regrettable that the government is saying that it does not have any record of the number of agitating farmers who have died during the movement. Tomar, his colleagues and officials had stood up in silence to pay respects to those died, in one of the meetings in December 2020. and the farmers has been putting out such information through an open blog site. Tomar also stated that the government is always open to discussion with farmers’ unions. But SKM representatives denied this saying if this was the case, why no talks were held in the last six months .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kisan-sansad-today-skm-wants-no-repeat-of-jan-26/articleshow/84623700.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Thane||Dance bar sting: Four cops of excise department suspended in Thane||THANE: Two sub-inspectors and two constables of the state excise department have been suspended for reportedly allowing the dance bars to run in full swing in Thane, flouting all state norms for the pandemic. Those suspended include state excise sub-inspectors Bajrang Patil and Pradip Sarjine and constables Suresh Mhaske and Jyotiba Patil. The action comes on the backdrop of a sting operation carried out by a news channel which aired scenes from the dance bars flouting Covid norms. A state excise officer alleged that junior officials have been made scapegoat. “Time-to-time, sub-inspectors have reported to their seniors about the bars being operational and flouting norms. But it is the senior officials who have to take further action by sending reports to the collector for cancellation of license. Merely suspending the sub-inspectors and constables is an eye-wash.” Earlier this week, the Thane police commissioner had suspended two senior police inspectors — Anil Mangle of Naupada police station and Sanjay Gaikwad of Vartak Nagar police station. Two ACPs, Neeta Padvi of Naupada division and Pankaj Shirsath of Vartak Nagar division, have been transferred with immediate effect on the basis of preliminary inquiry.  Meanwhile, the Congress has demanded action against TMC officials for allowing the dance bars to run.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-dance-bar-sting-4-cops-of-excise-dept-suspended/articleshow/84623706.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

Reacting to criticism over the timing of Dalit Bandhu which is taken up as a pilot project in Huzurabad, the CM said: “TRS is a political party and not a mutt. We are hundred per cent a political party and when a scheme is launched, we expect political mileage out of it. When parties which do not have power to implement such schemes are trying to gain political advantage, why shouldn’t the TRS try it,” he wondered. Speaking at a meeting to induct former Congress leader from Huzurabad Padi Kaushik Reddy into the TRS at Telangana Bhavan on Wednesday, KCR described Dalit Bandhu as a ‘wonderful scheme’ designed for upliftment of dalits in the state.

The Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) has identified around 108 acre in Niphad taluka of Nashik district, but the acquisition for the same is yet to be finalized. Last year, the JNPT had engaged a private professional services firm to prepare the detailed project report (DPR) for the dry port, but the project got delayed due to the Covid pandemic. Bharati Pawar said she had a virtual meeting with the deputy chief minister and the JNPT officials. She said the deputy CM is positive and has assured her that he would look into the issue. She added that she will also make efforts to speed up the project, which is to be set up by the Centre. Earlier, in October 2020, the industries minister had directed the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) and the JNPT to conduct a joint survey to identify land for the proposed dry port in Nashik and submit the reports at the earliest. But that too was delayed due to the pandemic. The dry port is to be connected by rail. Containers from the dry port will directly move by rail to JNPT in Mumbai. There will be a customs clearance point, value-added services like packaging, grading, loading/unloading, cold storage facilities and other infrastructure required for export of agricultural and industrial goods.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dindori-mp-seeks-transfer-of-108-acre-for-niphad-dry-port/articleshow/84611705.cms||Tushar Pawar

Continuous strike by doctors will begin from July 20. Dr Gagandeep Shergill, member of JGDCC, said the strike was aimed at protecting the public health and veterinary system from being privatised. He said it was due to this policy of the government that the doctors of the state were being forced to go abroad through brain drain. He said all medical and veterinary doctors of the state have been given a slogan, “Let’s go to Chandigarh on the 23rd”.

Police have stumbled upon WhatsApp chats between Kundra and his associates discussing an alternative plan after Google Play took down ‘Hotshots,’ the OTT app. The crime branch has also recovered 70 videos shot by Kundra’s former PA Umesh Kamat with the help of different production houses. Police said Kundra was not revealing much during questioning. Police will send the server for forensic analysis to know if Kundra had used it to upload pornographic material to his UK-based shell company Kinrin. Police have also written to various banks to provide details of Kundra’s and his company’s bank accounts for the last two years. Police said Kundra has been running the porn business for the last two years. Kundra was arrested along with his company Viaan Industries’ IT head Ryan Thorpe (43) on Monday evening and on Tuesday, he was remanded to police custody till July 23. On Monday, police had carried out searches of his Viaan Industries office at Lotus Grandeur as well as JL Stream at Veera Desai Road in Andheri. They had recovered documents like agreements between him and his brother-in- law Pradeep Bakshi, who is proprietor of the UK-based company Kinrin. They also found exchange of emails, WhatsApp chats discussing payment received from subscription of porn clips uploaded on Kinrin apps and other porngraphic material. Police said the WhatsApp chats between Kundra and Bakshi indicate Kundra was aware he was violating the law as the ‘Hotshots’ app had been taken down by Google Play store in November 2020 and by Apple in June 2020 as the content went against their policies. In one chat, Bakshi said Play store had suspended ‘Hotshots’, to which Kundra replied, “That’s fine, plan B started, max in 2-3 weeks new app will be live on iOS and Android, it’s a blessing.” In another WhatsApp group chat, a digital marketing professional identified as Rob told Kundra, “Until then we can deactivate all the bold films and appeal again on the play store.” In a WhatsApp chat with another arrested accused, ex-PA Umesh Kamat, Kundra shared the link of a TOI report that said cyber police were likely to summon heads of OTT platforms over airing of porn content. Kamat told Kundra, “Thank god you planned BF (Bollyfame)” and Kundra responded, “Till BF is up, let’s find out a way to sustain HS (HOTSHOTS). Let’s remove extreme bold for the time being.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-find-server-at-raj-kundras-house-and-70-porn-videos-shot-by-his-ex-pa/articleshow/84623733.cms||Ahmed Ali

While one accident took place on the Nashik-Dindori Road claiming three lives, the other fatal accident killed three people on the Mumbai-Agra highway near Wadivarhe. In the first case, PI Anant Targe of the Dindori police station said the accident took place at 5 pm near the Valkhed Phata on the Nashik-Kalwan Road. There were 8 people traveling onboard a multi-utility vehicle (MUV). The three teachers in the back seat of the MUV suffered serious injuries when a tree fell on the moving vehicle. Targe said the other five people in the car, including the driver, escaped with minor bruises. On receiving the information, the police rushed to the incident spot and shifted the victims to the Dindori rural hospital, where they were declared “brought dead”. The deceased have been identified as Dattatray Bacchav, Ramji Bhoye, and Nitin Tayade, all from different parts of the city. The teachers worked at the private-aided Shahid Bhagatsingh Secondary school at Alangun in Surana taluka. They traveled daily to the school from Nashik.

---||Nashik||Industries told to speed up setting up of O₂ plants||Nashik: Municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav has instructed the industries to speed up the process of setting up the three pressure swing adsorption (PSA) medical oxygen plants for the proposed dedicated Covid health centre (DCHC) at the MIDC’s Ambad industrial estate. The facility would have 500 oxygen-support beds. Jadhav’s instructions came during the recent meeting with industries and office-bearers of the Ambad Industries and Manufacturers’ Association (AIMA).Three large industries are setting up three PSA medical oxygen generation plants under their corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes. Earlier, these large industries had agreed to set up three PSA oxygen plants — each with a refilling capacity of 100 jumbo cylinders per day. The NMC had then wanted two more industries to set up two plants with a refilling capacity of 100 cylinders per day each, so that all the 500 beds can get oxygen support. But these two industries did not come forward to set up the PSA plants. Finally, two of the three industries that had agreed to set up the plants, decided to increase their individual capacities — one of them decided to have capacity for 200 jumbo cylinders per day, the other plans to pitch in with 140. Nikhil Panchal, the AIMA vice-president, said a new DCHC is being set up in the industrial area in preparation for the third wave. The municipal commissioner has also appealed to industries to fill all their oxygen tanks, so that they can be used for medical purposes if needed during the third wave, said Panchal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/industries-told-to-speed-up-setting-up-of-o-plants/articleshow/84611718.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Pune||Right time to reopen? Experts say vax cover, infra key||Pune: The state task force and health experts have said that steps can be taken towards easing of Covid curbs as long as there are enough people fully vaccinated and districts are ready with infrastructure to deal with a possible third wave. The public health department is currently considering proposals that allow fully vaccinated people to return to work across malls, restaurants, public transport networks and factories. Experts said such attempts will need a good mix of vaccine cover and shored up medical infrastructure. Head of the state task force, Dr Sanjay Oak, said full vaccination will help decision-making by local administration and slowly boost important sectors. He said, “While state officials are working on preparedness and have guided district administrations as well as the regional task force on the importance of testing, tracking and close monitoring of home-isolated people, the state health department has reinforced full vaccination as an important component for de-escalation, which should be graded.” Another task force member, Dr Rahul Pandit, said even as the state machinery readies health systems, to deal with future surges, fully vaccinated individuals should be allowed to operate in "bio-bubbles", with staggered timings, to give the economy the necessary momentum. Health experts said there's now evidence, including data from the latest national serosurvey, that suggests this could be the right time to take strong steps towards normalcy, while keeping a good grip on preparedness. Epidemiologist Dr Sanjay Rai, a professor of community medicine at the All India Institute Of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, said evidence from around the world has demonstrated that natural Covid infection provides better and longer protection. Dr Rai said, "Besides, the reinfection rate is very low if we analyse breakthrough cases after vaccination. Therefore, we can safely consider that two-thirds of the population is protected as of now. So it’s the right time to move towards normalcy, with close monitoring of the situation.” Pune-based clinical epidemiologist Dr Amitav Banerjee said, "The latest national serosurvey has revealed that 67% of our population has acquired IgG antibodies. The actual population immunity level is likely to be higher by 10-15% as IgG levels wane after some time. But immunity due to priming of memory and T cells last much longer. Given this level of population immunity, restrictions can be lifted to enable resumption of economic activity, without fear of a surge in infections.” Dr Banerjee said targeted vaccination is also important. "To be on the safer side, the elderly and people with comorbidities, who do not have IgG antibodies, can be vaccinated on priority without going for mass vaccination, which would only be a duplication of nature’s efforts at natural immunity. It will save time, resources, and efforts," he said. State officials said steps are being taken towards a safe reopening. Relief and rehabilitation secretary Aseem Gupta said they have forwarded proposals for various economic sectors to the health department for a final decision on rules. "We are now awaiting their decision," he said. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary of state public health department, issued a letter on Tuesday instructing all local administrations to ready enough medical infrastructure to deal with an estimated 60 lakh cases Maharashtra is projected to record during a third Covid wave. “The Centre has asked us to prepare for a third-wave peak that could be 1.25 times higher than the second wave's. Medicine demand and readiness should be 1.5 times the second-wave peak," the letter stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/right-time-to-reopen-experts-say-vax-cover-infra-key/articleshow/84623717.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The members of the community carried out all rituals at their homes. “This is the second time that we are celebrating the Eid-al-Adha at home. Last year, we celebrated Ramzan Eid also at home. We miss the social gathering, the practice of offering ‘Namaz’ at one time along with all our community members and relatives,” said Mohsin Shaikh, a businessman from Nashik. The religious leaders had appealed to the people to exercise restrain. “These times too will pass. We urged the people to stay at home and stick to Covid norms. We prayed for betterment of mankind,” Nashik city Shahar-e-Khatib, Hafiz Hisamuddin Ashrafi, said. The police also carried out route march in Malegaon as well as the parts of Nashik city to ensure peaceful celebrations. People too were mindful of the Covid rules and made all arrangements about the offerings at their homes. “As instructed by our community leaders and the police, we limited the celebration to our homes. These are very difficult times and we need to cooperate with each other for better of the community,” said Kamal Hashim, a banker from Malegaon. In Kolhapur too, the celebrations were low key and limited to the homes. The district administration had earlier shared guidelines regarding the celebrations and accordingly, only five Muslim members representing the entire community offered their prayers at the Muslim boarding ground in Dasara chowk in Kolhapur. The heavy rainfall in the city also kept many people indoors. Muslim Boarding chairman, Gani Ajrekar said, “Bakri Eid, which represents the symbol of sacrifice, was celebrated at homes only. Only five people offered the holy ‘Namaz’ at the Muslim boarding ground in Dasara chowk. Moulana Mobin recited the namaz and prayed for a Covid-free world and health of everyone.” Akhtar Shikalgar, resident at Bagal chowk said, “Since last year, Eid is being celebrated at our homes only. We distributed sheerkurma and other delicacies among our friends and relatives. Hopefully, we will be able to offer namaz in public next time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/covid-pandemic-effect-families-move-eid-al-adha-prayers-festivities-indoors/articleshow/84621149.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: 100 tourists, locals held under 'Op Maryada'||DEHRADUN: Days after a video of tourists smoking hookah on the ghats of Ganga in Haridwar went viral on social media, Uttarakhand police has arrested 100 people for allegedly drinking and using contraband in religious places and tourist spots. As many as 631 people were also challaned for smoking in public spaces and littering. The arrests came after police launched ‘Operation Maryada’ on July 15 to crack down on errant tourists and residents. Banners were put up in Haridwar, warning strict action against those involved in hooliganism in religious places. Ashok Kumar, director general of police (Uttarakhand) told TOI that the operation was launched after “videos disturbing the sanctity of religious places” surfaced on social media. “We welcome tourists in the state but indecent activities at religious places and littering at tourist spots will not be tolerated. We have arrested both tourists and locals for flouting rules,” he said. The maximum number of people were arrested in Dehradun (38) followed by Champawat (26) and Haridwar (21). On July 20 alone, 10 people were arrested for hooliganism at Har Ki Pauri in Haridwar, while action was taken against 14 people for littering on ghats of Ganga. Those held are being booked under various Acts – such as the Excise Act and the Gambling Act – and under provisions of the Indian Penal Code. Nine people were also booked under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. Those smoking in public spaces were challaned under the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act. Those challaned under Uttarakhand Anti-littering and Anti-spitting Act had to pay fines up to Rs 500. Police said that Rs 12 lakh has been collected in fines since the launch of the operation. The campaign has met with support from local residents who said “religious locations should not be converted into places of recreation.” Dehradun resident Vikas Sharma said, “We must promote responsible tourism. CCTV cameras should also be installed in such places to act as a deterrent for those who create nuisance."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhands-op-maryada-sees-100-tourists-locals-arrested-for-drinking-using-drugs-in-religious-tourist-spots/articleshow/84622082.cms||Gaurav Talwar

Bala became the first Indian woman to earn a professional football contract abroad when she joined Rangers FC in February last year. Since then, she has stayed put in Scotland but is now forced to return home after expiry of her visa. The All India Football Federation’s Footballer of the Year has also picked up a knee injury and is expected to use her time in India for the rehab. “I couldn’t extend the visa by staying in UK. I had to exit. I don’t know when I’ll go back. I have to do rehab (for the injury), so it might be better for me to spend time at home for now,” said Bala, who will be in Manipur on Saturday. Significantly, Bala’s Rangers contract has been extended by six months. The Scottish club will continue to monitor her rehab. “I’ve learnt so much in the last 18 months that I feel like a completely different player,” said Bala. “My fitness has improved tremendously. Mentally, I am stronger. When my teammates train well, I am motivated to do even better. The experience has been really good. “Initially, it was a bit difficult to adjust. It seemed like a different world. In India, the league goes on for a month and then everyone takes a break. Here, there’s football to be played round the year.” Bala has been playing for the country since she was 15 and scoring plenty of goals. At last count, she had scored 52 goals in 58 appearances for India. In domestic football, she has scored more than 100 goals. In Scotland, though, the 31-year-old forward did not have such an easy run. She scored twice. Her first was against Motherwell FC in December and the second came recently as a substitute against Spartans FC. “It’s not easy scoring in Europe,” said Bala. “I have not always played as a forward and the essence is on an allround game. I could have scored earlier, but missed. You don’t get too many chances. Performance-wise I did fine.” Bala said she had a chance to move to Europe in 2014 but didn’t have enough backing. “I had an offer from Spain but had no money, no support and no agent. Since then, I’ve been trying. When it finally happened last year, it was such a big relief,” she said. Her move to Scotland made everyone sit up and take note. She hopes she has done enough to motivate the next generation of players, although the India striker warns it won’t be easy. “In India, even the IWL (Indian Women’s League) is played for a month. Once the league is over, players disperse. Some of them give up playing. When the next edition is announced, players assemble again. This doesn’t help anyone. We need more matches, more competitions. Whenever an opportunity knocks, players should be ready,” said Bala. Wonder who’s next.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bala-devi-returns-home-for-rehab/articleshow/84658382.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

However, they couldn’t confirm if they intruded on the Indian side. “This is the latest case of Chinese activity near Barahoti. They came in horses four to five days ago and left some belongings as evidence of their visit,” a senior government official told TOI on Wednesday. “They usually visit after the monsoon. They came early this time,” he said. Another government official, who also did not wish to be named, said that the activity of the Chinese army had increased along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) near Barahoti. In 2018, the Indian Army and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) reported to the Centre multiple aerial intrusions in the Barahoti plains by the PLA. On the Indian side, a multi-departmental team also goes on routine recces near the area (usually three times a year) to keep an eye on it. “A team from the district administration visited Barahoti a fortnight ago,” said a senior district police official. Barahoti, located along Uttarakhand’s border with China, is merely 397 km from state capital Dehradun. The scenic grassland in Chamoli district is connected by roads to Joshimath. A 3-km steep trek leads to the Barahoti ridge, from where Tibet is visible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/chinese-soldiers-spotted-along-lac-in-uttarakhands-barahoti/articleshow/84622066.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Chandigarh||Haryana: Farmers block Sirsa highway over sedition case||SIRSA: On Wednesday, farmers jammed highway at three places in Sirsa — Bhavdin toll plaza, Khuiyan toll plaza and Panjuana village — for two hours. They called for Sirsa Bandh on July 23 and an indefinite gherao of Haryana deputy speaker Gangwa resident in Hisar on July 24 for the release of five farmers arrested in a sedition case and withdrawal of the “secret FIR” registered against 100 farmers who stormed the July 11 meeting of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) district executive body. Meanwhile, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leader Baldev Singh Sirsa’s fast unto death entered the fourth day. On Tuesday, farmers leaders had gone to the mini secretariat for their second day meeting with the district administration but as it remained inconclusive, they called for two-hour highway jam. Haryana Kisan Manch state president Prahlad Singh Bharukhera, one of those accused of sedition, said: “If the administration did not release our comrades, we would gherao the deputy speaker’s house on July 24 and will continue till they were released.” He alleged that the government is registering false cases of sedition against farmers to divert attention from their efforts to get the three agricultural laws repealed. He said the farmers in Sirsa were peacefully staging a dharna for nine months and there was no violence. On July 11, workers of the BJP broke the glass of the deputy speaker’s car and at the behest of the government, the police registered a case of sedition against the farmers. The government has arrested those farmers from the village who showed black flags so that the villagers get scared and farmers do not join the movement, he alleged. Lakhwinder Singh Aulakh, state president of Bharatiya Kisan Ekta said if the government does not release the farmers, an even bigger call will be made by the Kisan Morcha. The indefinite protest at the mini-secretariat had started on Saturday after Rakesh Tikait’s SKM mahapanchayat. On Sunday morning, farmers put up tents on one side of the Barnala road and Baldev Singh Sirsa sat on a fast. ‘Motorcycle riders threw stones’ Harcharan, an 80-year-old farmer, one of those accused of sedition, said, he has been running a langar sewa (community kitchen) in Panjuana village for seven months. He alleged during the interaction with the media on Wednesday that he was on the spot on the day of the incident and was behind the police. When Haryana deputy speaker Ranbir Gangwa’s car came to the spot, the window of the car was already broken and later six persons who came on a motorcycle threw stones at it. After this, the police lathi-charged the farmers in which 20 to 25 farmers were injured, but not a single farmer was involved in stone pelting, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-block-sirsa-highway-over-sedition-case/articleshow/84623735.cms||---
---||Nashik||Bandobast, token system at Nashik markets yet to start||Nashik: The city police’s plan to start the one-hour coupon system for people visiting market areas along with proper bandobast — to prevent overcrowding — is yet to take off due to the financial limitations of the civic body. Last month, police commissioner Deepak Pandey had issued prohibitory orders stating that all major marketplaces must be sealed with only one entry/exit point. Customers would be issued free coupons at the entry point that would entitle them to spend an hour inside the market. People who failed to complete their shopping and leave within an hour would be fined Rs 1,000 each. The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) was supposed to print the coupons and collect the fine amount. The police commissioner had stated that waterproof tents should also be provided by the civic body for the police personnel on bandobast duty at the market areas. The police chief said since the monsoon has started, there is a need for waterproof tents for the cops manning the entry/exit points of the markets. The process of starting the one-hour coupon system got delayed as the NMC is not in a position to buy the tents as it has been incurring major expenses on the Covid front. He added: “We have decided to buy the tents and install them ourselves. By the end of this week, the police and the NMC would start regulating the flow of people in the markets.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bandobast-token-system-at-nashik-markets-yet-to-start/articleshow/84611752.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The Maharashtra Engineering Research Institute (MERI), Nashik, had informed them of the same. The tremors were also felt in some villages in the adjoining Surgana and Dindori talukas. Bhosale said such tremors were common in Peth, Surgana and the adjoining talukas. Since the quakes are very mild, they often go unnoticed by the village residents. Peth, Surgana, Dindori are among the tribal talukas of Nashik district.

Khattar directed this during a public interaction at Haryana Niwas here. Issues related to food and civil supplies, transport, town and country planing and Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradikaran were taken up in the meeting. A delegation of Narnaund Anaj Mandi Association, Hisar, placed its demand before the CM, urging the officials to compensate for the loss of 50% wheat. The CM took cognizance of the matter and ordered Rastogi to make recovery against nine officials with immediate effect. He said half of the loss incurred by the government should be compensated by erring officials.

---||Mumbai||No death in Maharashtra due to shortage of oxygen: Rajesh Tope||MUMBAI: Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said there is no record of a single death that occurred due to the lack of medical oxygen in Maharashtra. The state never made any statement about deaths due to a shortage, he told newspersons. The statement came on a day Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said in Delhi people who lost their relatives due to a lack of oxygen during the second wave of Covid should file a case against the Union government. On Tuesday, the central government had told the Rajya Sabha that no deaths due to lack of oxygen were specifically reported by states and UTs during the second Covid-19 wave. This statement had set off a wave of criticism by the opposition and activists. In the peak of the second wave, families of many Covid patients had to run around to arrange for oxygen and many hospitals had to transfer patients to bigger ones with oxygen plants. When asked by a TV channel about the Centre’s statement, Tope said: “We never said people died due to oxygen shortage in the state. Many of them had issues like co-morbidities and other illnesses. No death has taken place due to the shortage of oxygen.” Tope said the state government had filed an affidavit in the court, saying no death occurred due to shortage of medical oxygen. “All deaths that occurred in the second wave were due to Covid, but not due to lack of medical oxygen,’’ he said. This April, 22 patients had died after oxygen supply was disrupted at a Nashik hospital due to leakage in the storage plant, officials had said. At that time, Tope had said a probe would find out if negligence had led to the leakage. Tope said the state had converted all produced oxygen into liquid medical oxygen and by proper management, made it available for patients. The state had stopped the usage of oxygen for industrial purposes. “There was a shortage of oxygen, however, by the grace of God and proper planning by the doctors and dedicated efforts, no death occurred due to non-availability of oxygen. Even when the state had reported 66,000 daily cases, we had made available over 1,700 MT oxygen, around 1,300-1,400 MT on our own and 300-400 MT was made available from neighbouring states through central intervention,” added Tope.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-death-in-state-due-to-shortage-of-oxygen-says-tope/articleshow/84623754.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Chandigarh||Haryana chief secretary's order: No public dealing, field posts for tainted officers||CHANDIGARH: Haryana government has decided to keep tainted officers off posts which involve public dealing or fieldwork in all departments. A circular related to this was released from the office of chief secretary Vijai Vardhan on Tuesday. According to orders, all officers of all-India and state services are covered under this order. According to orders, officers against whom the CBI or vigilance bureau prosecution has been given or are facing the probe, officers facing departmental probe with high probability of major punishment, officers who have been chargesheeted by the court or those against whom strictures have been passed too are to be avoided from public dealings or field posting. The order categorically said officers who faced charges or allegations of mortal turpitude or are facing such trials too are to be taken out from direct public dealing or field posts. Courts too from time to time had been passing such orders. In the most recent incident, Vardhan had opposed the appointment of T C Gupta to the post of chief commissioner of Right To Service Commission, while referring to the cases against him. This was overruled by chief minister office (CMO). Khattar had even defended Gupta, saying his work had been satisfactory during his tenure in this government. Taking a stronger stance against corruption now, the government has also sought details of all the IAS, IPS, IFS (Indian Forest Service), HCS, HPS, and HFS officers who have departmental proceedings and cases pending against them. In the Tuesday order, a copy of which is with TOI, also went out to the additional chief secretary (home), ACS (forest), directorn general of police, and the principal chief conservator of forests. Chief secretary Vijai Vardhan also asked the top bureaucrats to submit the cases of tainted officers to the chief minister’s office for their postings and transfers at the headquarters or non-public dealing posts. These departmental inquiries under the All-India Services Rules 1969 or Rule 7 of the Haryana Civil Services Rules, 2016, or any other set of rules, may result in award of one of the major penalties, which is withholding of increments with cumulative effect, reduction to lower post, compulsory retirement, and removal or dismissal from service. These officers shall not be posted in fields involving public dealing if even a sanction for prosecution under the Prevention of Corruption Act has been granted by the competent authority against them. Similarly, if even any inquiry against any of these officers has been initiated by the CBI or the state vigilance bureau, or any court has framed charges in a criminal case that involves moral turpitude, they will not be posted in a field office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-chief-secys-order-no-public-dealing-field-posts-for-tainted-officers/articleshow/84623746.cms||---
---||Delhi||Breaking bad: Two cousins held for making heroin||NEW DELHI: Cracking down on a busy supply chain of heroin, Crime Branch has arrested two cousins who used to prepare the contraband all by themselves in makeshift labs along the Ganga in Uttar Pradesh. One kg heroin worth Rs 2 crore has been seized. According to DCP (crime) Chinmoy Biswal, the two men were experts in preparing heroin from crude raw material like poppy head extracts and chemicals sourced from Bareilly. “The suspects have been identified as Sajid Khan and Wajid Khan, residents of Faridpur in Bareilly,” Biswal said. With the arrests, the narcotics cell of the branch claimed to have busted one of the busier supply chains of the contraband active in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. The cell was developing drug cartel-related information in east Delhi when it got a tip-off about the two suspects, both in their mid-20s. Surveillance was mounted and intelligence developed, revealing that they would come to the cremation ground at Ghazipur to supply heroin to their contact. A team led by ACP Mayank Bansal, inspector Rakesh Duhan, sub-inspector Lekhraj and others laid a trap. Identified by the informer, the two were flagged down. They tried to flee but were arrested with two parcels of 500gm each after a chase. An FIR has been registered. The duo allegedly said they had been involved in drug trafficking for the past six years. In 2016, both were arrested while peddling heroin but managed to get bail in less than a month. They then started manufacturing heroin and soon became one of the top suppliers in the area. They used LPG cylinders and special utensils along with various chemicals to process heroin. They would travel across the river ghats and camp in isolated areas on the banks to prepare heroin. They changed the location for every batch to dodge police, officials said. Utensils and cylinders used by them have been seized. The cops are digging further to identify other members of the network and the buyers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/breaking-bad-2-cousins-held-for-making-heroin/articleshow/84623749.cms||---

The meeting comes a few days after chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami announced a one-year age relaxation for recruitment in state government jobs due to the Covid-19 pandemic that delayed several examinations. Bobby Panwar, UBS president, told TOI, “The second wave of the pandemic led to further delays in recruitment examinations. Thus, the government should increase the maximum age limit by at least two years. Also, the process for recruitment on various government posts should be swiftly set in motion before the model code of conduct is put in place in the wake of the upcoming assembly elections in the state.” He pointed out that the association has nearly 7.8 lakh unemployed members across the state. “The recruitment process should be made more transparent to avoid backdoor entries,” added Panwar. The members of the association also asked the officials to reduce the height restrictions for recruitment to security forces. Citing studies by anthropologists, Ashutosh Chamoli, another representative of the association, said, “Given the average heights of people here in the mountains, we demand that the minimum height limit required to appear for recruitment exams to security forces be 160-163 cm.” According to the data compiled by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Private Limited, a think-tank, unemployment in the hill state rose from 5.8% in November 2019 to 8.0% in May 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhands-association-of-unemployed-youths-demand-age-limit-relaxation-for-recruitment-in-govt-jobs/articleshow/84622096.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Reclaiming Sabarmati Gandhi Ashram’s halcyon days||AHMEDABAD: A proposal has been finalized to reclaim Sabarmati Gandhi Ashram’s visual wholesomeness, tranquility, and uncluttered environs of 1949. The Rs 1,200 crore proposal that will soon be made public envisages the muting of traffic’s screams around the ashram and the removal of structures which oppose the simple nobility of Bapu’s abode. Of the 177 buildings that dot the 54 acre project area today, only 65 designated as heritage structures will remain. The Sabarmati Ashram was the cradle in which Bapu nurtured India’s freedom movement. Also, it was the setting in which he began writing his autobiography, ‘The Story of My Experiments with Truth’, in the 1920s.  As for the revamp proposal, it moots a few significant additions to the Gandhi Ashram Memorial and Precinct Development Project. For instance, the Mahatma Gandhi statue near the Income Tax junction, created by Kantibhai Patel in the 1960s, will be installed at the ashram. There will be a new museum opposite the ashram, about 100 metres from the main road. A special visitors’ centre and museum shops will be set up. Khadi workshops will be held to give visitors an experience of the days of freedom struggle. The Jay Jagat amphitheatre will be refurbished. A large parking bay to accommodate 200 cars has been planned. A special area has been earmarked to rehabilitate 200 families of the original ashram inmates. "These families live in small clusters around the ashram," said a government official.The governing council of the project, headed by the chief minister, has asked the six Gandhi trusts to submit details of land ownership, tax records and ashram occupants’ details. The project has been conceived by an Ahmedabad firm, HCP Design, Planning and Management Pvt Ltd, headed by Bimal Patel. He is also involved in the Central Vista project in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/reclaiming-gandhi-ashrams-halcyon-days/articleshow/84623784.cms||Kapil Dave

On the complaint lodged by the victim, the Adgaon police have registered an offence of robbery against two unidentified persons. Adgaon police said, Ajay Suresh Aher, an 18-year-old resident of the Ambad-Pathardi area, and his friend Nitin Chothe were taking photographs near the Janardhan Swami Muth along the road that leads towards the Tapovan nursery. At 8 pm, a person riding a scooter approached Aher and Chothe and said that he wanted to do a photo shoot with his own friend. He then called up this friend. Within a few minutes, the “friend” came to the spot. He was also carrying a sharp-edged weapon. The two men then started abusing the youths and threatened them with dire consequences. The men then snatched the camera bag and fled the scene on the two-wheeler. The Adgaon police have registered an offence of robbery against the two unidentified men and have launched an investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/teen-robbed-of-camera-in-tapovan-road-area-of-nashik/articleshow/84611805.cms||---

A brainchild of ZP CEO Mangesh Gondavale, the state-level drive aims at boosting the morale of existing students and facilitating interaction between alumni and students. “In today’s era, the brand of school has gained unnecessary importance over quality of teachers and overall teaching. The schools run by local self-governing bodies from different parts of Maharashtra have produced scores of students who have carved niches for themselves in different chosen fields. Our drive aims to establish connect with those who can be a source of inspiration to our existing students,” he said. Titled as Ignite Your Minds, the initiative is being propagated among target alumni through customised Google forms. Through this online tool, Aurangabad ZP has been reaching out to alumni of government run schools by also seeking their willingness on how they would like to contribute for their alma mater. “The alumni can give a virtual or in-person talk to students. They can also mentor students who have inclination towards any field besides sharing words of wisdom. Such an interaction could bring a paradigm shift in lives and career of students,” Gondavale said. Within no time of its launch, the Ignite Your Minds initiative has reached out to around 25 alumni of government-run schools who are serving as IAS or IPS with more ex-students from the field of arts, business, engineering, public health, politics, sports, social work and education expected to join. “The list of such distinguished alumni is bound to be very long. Once we reach out to the maximum number of alumni, the next stage of the initiative, facilitating interaction, would be rolled out,” Gondavale said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/zp-contacting-distinguished-alumni-to-boost-students-morale/articleshow/84621167.cms||Prasad Joshi

He added that immediately after zeroing in on such a place, the officials must prepare a DPR (detailed project report) and submit it to the state government, so that the site can be made ready for tourists at the earliest possible. The new tourist spots will be developed under the state’s ambitious ‘13 Districts-13 Destinations’ scheme. Under this, the state aims to develop a new tourist spot in each of the 13 districts. When asked on the current pace of works under the scheme, Jawalkar told TOI, “A few of the small projects are already completed. Meanwhile, we are starting work on proposals as soon as we receive the state government nod. For instance, we are developing a Tulip Garden in Pithoragarh, an Astro Village in Karnaprayag (Chamoli), an adventure tourism spot in Udham Singh Nagar, and other such projects with tourism potential.” The senior official added, “The state government is in talks with ZICA — a Japanese international development agency — for a Rs 1,400 crore-worth project in Tehri. If we receive the funds, five tourist clusters will be developed around the Tehri Lake.” Elaborating on the vision behind the scheme, Jawalkar said, “Our existing tourist spots have become oversaturated but our state has several other less-frequented areas with massive tourism potential. These new projects will boost the economy of our state.”  By Abhilasha Negi||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/identify-places-with-tourism-potential-start-working-on-dpr-tourism-secy-directs-officials/articleshow/84622120.cms||---
---||Delhi||Why scholarship may not be enough to study at European Union Univs||NEW DELHI: Indian students who have bagged scholarships to study at several European Union (EU) countries are facing an uncertain time in the wake of the Covid-19 travel restrictions still in force in many of these countries like Spain, Italy, France and Czech Republic. The universities there are gearing up for physical classes, but students say their visa application is yet to be processed. They have now started a petition urging Council of European Union to consider their situation. So far, 2,000 students have signed it. Most of these students can’t defer their journey as they are going to study on scholarship. Divya Sinha is one such student who has received the Erasmus Mundus Mobility Programme scholarship to study in Spain. “The scholarship cannot be deferred. It is either I go or I don’t go at all. This uncertainty is adding to my stress. I am going for a masters programme in vaccinology and physical classes are necessary for it,” said Sinha, a graduate from Jamia Hamdard. Some other EU countries, including Belgium, Germany and Austria, have exempted students from India and Nepal, Sinha added. Sanjay, who has received a scholarship to do a masters degree in Mediterranean forestry and natural resource management at University of Padua in Italy, has been waiting to apply for his visa. “My classes begin from September 15 and I have to reach one week before it. The third party for visa has stopped accepting applications and are waiting for a confirmation from the embassy,” said Sanjay. For Shubham, the deadline to join a French university is even earlier. His course starts on August 30. As he has been vaccinated with Covaxin, he will require another 10 days to remain under quarantine. He will do a masters in photonics at Jean Monnet University in France with a Erasmus Mundus scholarship. “I have managed to submit my visa application but the issuing process has not begun. As my course is related to applied physics, I will suffer if I miss lab sessions,” said Shubham, who is from Rajasthan. Anshuman, who is to go to a university in Germany’s Munich, has another problem. His visa application, submitted in July, was rejected. “I have applied again, but don’t know how long it is going to take,” said the astrophysics PhD student. In the petition, the students have requested the council to “urge embassies and consulates to prioritise visa processing for study purposes and allow vaccinated students to enter the European countries”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-scholarship-may-not-be-enough-to-study-at-eu-univs/articleshow/84623769.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Pune||India’s rainfall deficiency for July drops to 17.6% from 46% in June||Pune: The recent rain revival in parts of the country has reduced India’s rainfall deficiency to 17.6% from 46% around June 10, data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has revealed. The IMD’s region-wise statistics showed that the rainfall deficiencies for July were still 28% in central India, 32% in east and northeast India and 22% in northwest India. South peninsular India has, however, received 39% excess July rain. IMD director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra told TOI, “The rainfall revival continues even now. Another low pressure area is expected to form over the Bay of Bengal during the next 48 hours, which would help in wiping out some of the existing rain deficiency for July. We have seen a monsoon paradox this season, with June receiving good rain and July being deficient so far. July is usually the rainiest core monsoon month with normal rainfall of 285.3 mm.” Pulak Guhathakurta, head of the climate research division in IMD, Pune, told TOI, “Seasonal rainfall from June to July 21 is now almost normal at 5% deficiency as against the 8% it showed a few days ago. Till the second week of July, many parts of India had reported almost dry conditions. The scenario changed in the past few days with rain almost flooding parts of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and some parts of Maharashtra.” A Central Water Commission (CWC) report on Wednesday stated that 15 river sites in India were in a severe flood situation, while 19 were flowing in above-normal flood situation due to the ongoing rainfall. A CWC official said, “Most of these sites are in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Assam and Tamil Nadu. The West flowing rivers in Konkan, like in Raigad and Ratnagiri, are getting continued rainfall and are in a severe situation. The highest impact is being felt in west Maharashtra as compared to the state’s central or eastern parts. The West flowing rivers and their levels are directly proportional to the rain. As soon as the rainfall intensity increases, these rivers start rising, unlike bigger rivers whose levels take some time to rise during heavy rain.” Though the intensity of the rainfall over northwest India is likely to reduce, it may increase again from July 25. Extreme heavy rain has been forecast in parts of Maharashtra during the next few days. Skymet Weather Services president G P Sharma told TOI, “Sub-divisions Vidarbha, Marathwada and Madhya Maharashtra are likely to get heavy to very heavy rain over the next two days. The rain could become moderate by July 23. Weather activity will go very mild over the subsequent 48 hours. Extreme heavy rain at a few places will possibly cause localized flooding and inundation.” GFX ON THE CARDS Light to moderate rainfall at scattered places very likely over Delhi during the next 24 hours Widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy falls very likely to continue over west coast and its adjoining interior areas and Gujarat region during the next 4-5 days Isolated extreme heavy falls very likely over Konkan and Goa and the adjoining ghat areas of Madhya Maharashtra on July 21-22 Fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy falls likely over east and adjoining central India during July 21 -24 Isolated extremely heavy falls also likely over coastal Andhra Pradesh and Telangana on July 21-22 and over Chhattisgarh, Vidarbha and east Madhya Pradesh on July 22 Strong surface wind (20-30 kmph to 40 kmph) likely over coastal Andhra Pradesh during the next 2 days THE PARADOX This season has witnessed a monsoon paradox June received good rain, but July is turning out to be deficient July is usually the rainiest core monsoon month with a normal rainfall of 285.3 mm Seasonal rainfall from June to July 21 is now almost normal at -5% Till a few days ago, the deficiency was at -8% deficiency Till the second week of July, many parts of India had reported almost dry conditions||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/indias-rainfall-deficiency-for-july-drops-to-17-6-from-46-in-june/articleshow/84623764.cms||Neha Madaan

Osmanabad MP Omraje Nimbalkar, in a memorandum submitted to Danve, sought rail connectivity to Mumbai for his constituency. “There is no train connecting Osmanabad, Latur Road, Parli, Parbhani, Aurangabad, Manmad, Nashik and Mumbai at present. The new train would cover different pilgrim and tourists spots in Marathwada and other places,” he said, adding that the train connectivity between Osmanabad and Mumbai would also help the agricultural sector and increase employment opportunities. The Tuljabhavani temple in Osmanabad’s Tuljapur, the Jyotirlinga sites at Parli, Aundha Nagnath, Ghrushneshwar and Trimbakeshwar as well as the Ajanta-Ellora caves and the famous Shirdi temple are along this desired route. Railway activist Gautam Nahata, meanwhile, has raised the demand for a dedicated rail corporation for the Marathwada region. “The region has a huge backlog in terms of improving rail connectivity and infrastructure. A dedicated official body to look into this backlog can alter the face of Marathwada, which is becoming an industrial hotspot due to the passage of the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor and the dry-port project,” he said. Nahata has also sought the extension of the new DEMU train, which started between Nanded and Rotegaon, up toManmad with a change in arrival timing at Aurangabad to 7 pm. Danve could not be reached for his comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/new-railway-mos-flooded-with-demands/articleshow/84611791.cms||---
---||Mumbai||A white elephant? BMC plans Rs 20 crore skywalk in Kurla||MUMBAI: Even as it is dismantling several dilapidated skywalks across the city, the cash-strapped municipal corporation plans to construct an elevated walkway for Rs 20 crore in Kurla (W). On Wednesday, the BMC administration tabled before the civic standing committee the proposal to build a 300m-long, 4.3-m wide skywalk from Taximen’s Colony to Shrikrishna Chowk. TimesViewSeveral skywalks in Mumbai have been declared dilapidated and have been dismantled. Many of those that are still standing are hardly used by pedestrians. Must the BMC spend such huge sums of money on constructing skywalks which have been known to turn into white elephants?According to civic officials, local elected representatives had demanded that for pedestrian safety and convenience, a skywalk is required in the area that is plagued by traffic congestion. “The proposed skywalk at Kurla, which will be built using reinforced cement concrete and steel, will have two escalators so that people do not have to climb stairs,” said a civic official. “We will spend around Rs 50 lakh to remove the underground utilities for erecting the skywalk, which is expected to be ready within 15 months.” The BMC has already paid a consultant Rs 28 lakh to design the skywalk and suggest technical details, the official added. Between 2008 and 2012, the MMRDA built 23 skywalks in Mumbai for an estimated Rs 700 crore and spent around Rs 2.5 crore on their upkeep. The skywalks were later handed over to the BMC for maintenance. Later, the civic body erected a few more elevated walkways in the city. According to experts, skywalks should last for more than 50 years, but several of the existing structures have become dilapidated and a few had to even be closed for pedestrians. Many of those still standing are considered white elephants; while they are sparsely used, encroachments and unauthorised parking have come up below these structures. The BMC had recently put on hold the reconstruction of one arm of Mumbai’s first skywalk in Bandra (E) citing financial constraints. The 1.3km skywalk was declared unsafe for pedestrians and closed in 2019. The BMC then roped in VJTI experts to conduct structural audits of all skywalks in Mumbai. The Dahisar (W) skywalk was also shut down because it was found to be unsafe for use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-a-white-elephant-bmc-plans-rs-20cr-skywalk-in-kurla/articleshow/84624253.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Delhi||Delhi: Sadar Bazar to be model for revamp of markets||NEW DELHI: Agencies in old Delhi are working on a project to develop a model market in Sadar Bazar area wherein all shops will have signboard of symmetrical size, shutters of same colour and placement of dustbins at equal distance. The market will also be made plastic free. The project will start from the iron and hardware market in Teliwara (Sadar Bazar). Area councillor and former North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash said that the project would involve multiple agencies apart from the local traders’ association. “We had a meeting with the traders’ association in this regard on Tuesday and after that, I called a meeting with the area ACP and SHOs. While the traders’ association agreed to install signage of symmetrical size and shutters of same colour, I discussed with the police officers the installation of a police picket. For improving the drains and sewer, we may involve DJB,” said Jai Prakash. He added that a board at the entrance specifying the contact details of officials concerned from various departments will be placed by the north corporation. “Efforts will also be made to sweep the market twice a day. Work on the project may start in the next 15 days,” the ex-mayor said. A senior Delhi government official confirmed that there is a project to develop a model market with the involvement of multiple agencies. “But the details are yet to be discussed and the project is still in its initial stage,” said the official. Members of iron and hardware merchants’ association said that they met the officials of the north district administration last week and discussed the project to making the market plastic free. “The district magistrate was also present and officials suggested that work for collecting plastic can be given to an NGO and in return, they will give cloth bags to traders. We agreed to the idea and later spoke to NGO representatives on this issue. Unlike the rest of the wholesale market, plastic is generated in decent quantities here after unpacking of machines and equipment,” said Rajendra Sharma, president of Iron and Hardware Mercantile Association. “As far as the signboards of symmetrical size are concerned, there are already municipal norms to erect them of uniform size and we will convey this to traders to avoid action. We do have a public announcement system and CCTVs. We will get things rectified if needed. Security guards are deployed in the market during night hours,” said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sadar-bazar-to-be-model-for-revamp-of-markets/articleshow/84623757.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad school fee row: Bombay high court offers solution subject to Fee Regulatory Committee approval||AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court, while deciding a fee-related dispute involving one of the leading city-based CBSE schools, has proposed an arrangement that the court said would be subject to the final decision to be taken by the Fee Regulatory Committee (FRC). The court earlier had disposed a writ petition filed by aggrieved parents with observations that they already have a remedy available under the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011, that mandates formation of the FRC. The petitioners, however, filed a fresh plea as the panel concerned was constituted but “not functioning” for the Aurangabad division. While the court agreed to hear the fresh petition, the school submitted before the court that students from Classes I to VIII can pay Rs 38,000 and students from Class IX to Class X shall pay Rs 42,000 to resume the online education. On the other hand, citing the pandemic situation, petitioners submitted before the court that only Rs 10,000 could be paid by the parents of the students immediately. After hearing learned counsel for both the parties, the court said students up to Class VIII shall pay Rs 35,000, out of which Rs 15,000 must be paid instantly and the remaining amount within a period of six weeks. For students of Class IX to Class XI, the amount to be paid shall be Rs 38,000 with instant instalment of Rs 18,000 and payment of remaining dues in next six weeks. The school has been asked to provide links for online education to students after the first payment. “The aforesaid arrangement is without prejudice to the rights and contentions of either of the parties and the same would be subject to the final decision that would be taken by the committee (FRC) constituted under the Act of 2011,” a two-member bench of justice S V Gangapurvala and justice R N Laddha said. As reported by TOI, the chairman for FRC for Aurangabad division was yet to take charge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/school-fee-row-high-court-offers-solution-subject-to-frc-approval/articleshow/84611820.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Delhi||SDMC to start survey of hawkers at Lajpat Nagar market||NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) will conduct a survey of hawkers/vendors in Lajpat Nagar market through vendors nominated by the Delhi government. “A meeting will be called on Thursday with all the stakeholders to decide the future course of action. We will give the task to two vendors authorised by Delhi government to conduct the drive as they have all the required technical knowledge, manpower and are trained properly,” said a south corporation official. The step has been taken on the direction of Delhi high court, which has given two weeks time to the civic body to complete the exercise. Civic officials claim that the market has been declared a ‘no hawking zone,’ but vendors can still be found sitting here. A government notification for not removing them till the survey of the town vending committee is completed, had triggered confusion. “We have been conducting an anti-encroachment drive every week in these markets. We needed clarity on whether to conduct a survey of vendors in ‘no vending zone’ in Lajpat Nagar. Now that clarity has been obtained from the court, we will conduct the survey and submit the details in the court as well as with the town vending committee.” Traders of Lajpat Nagar had earlier moved the court against the town vending committee survey. “The market had been declared as no-hawking/no-squatting zone by the Supreme Court. In the given circumstances, the market should not fall under the purview of the town vending committee for conducting surveys. That’s why, our traders’ federation had filed a contempt plea to stay the survey,” said Ashwani Marwah, general secretary of Traders’ Association Lajpat Nagar. The government in 2019 had asked the civic bodies of Delhi to conduct a survey of vendors through their respective town vending committees. “After conducting the survey across the city, inviting public objections, verifying the identity of these vendors and completing other work, the town vending committees will take a decision on the number of vendors to be allowed at any location,” said an official. “We have held meetings with vending committees. The survey across the city is likely to be over by September.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-to-start-survey-of-hawkers-at-lajpat/articleshow/84623778.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Dehradun||One of India’s oldest hockey tournaments, breeding ground for Olympians, fighting off closure in Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN: About a century ago, a group of local traders in Nainital decided they had to do something to draw people and business to the quiet hill town. An annual hockey tournament, they finally decided, would be their legacy. And that’s how the All India Trades Cup Hockey Championship, one of India’s oldest hockey tournaments, was flagged off. For decades, it was known for nurturing Olympians and medallists. But time changed everything. Funds dried up and as players started favouring astroturf, the gravel-lined field of Nainital lies abandoned. For two years now, the tournament has not been held — the first such break in its history. And organisers don’t know if it will be again. “The tournament is unique. Games are played on 0.2-0.5-mm cover of gravel,” said Anil Garia, general secretary of the Nainital Gymkhana and District Sports Association (DSA), which has taken over the responsibility of holding the tournament. The Gymkhana is an autonomous body established in the 1880s which merged with the DSA in the 1930s. “But it’s difficult to maintain the standards of the tournament now. Funding is way too low. Punjab-based tournaments offer cash prizes of Rs 1 crore. Despite our history, we are finding it difficult to carry on.” The tournament has been the breeding ground of many greats — Pargat Singh, who led the Indian hockey team in the 1992 Barcelona and 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Zafar Iqbal, who was captain of the team in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, Syed Ali, who participated in the controversial 1976 Olympics at Montreal, and Mervyn Fernandes, part of the gold-winning team at the 1980 Moscow Olympics. “Several Olympians, especially from Punjab, would come here till the late ‘80s. Top departments like Air India, Bharat Petroleum Limited, Punjab Police used to send their best players even until the ‘90s. SBI Lucknow won the highest number of times,” said Rajendra Singh Rawat, goalkeeper of the Indian hockey squad at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. “In the early 2000s, a team from Pakistan participated, as did an England-based under-19 team. Now, everybody prefers astroturf. Top teams don’t come.” The ground where the tournament is held is a multipurpose one and because there isn’t a lot of free flat land in the hills, having an astroturf is not possible. “It needs money and maintenance. Some of the departments send their second-rung teams now,” Rawat said. Garia added, “Money was not a problem till the time we got a majority of the revenue from parking on one side of the ground. But our share rapidly decreased. When we organise the tournament, we bear the accommodation costs of all teams. We can’t afford that now. We are struggling for funds and survival.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/one-of-indias-oldest-hockey-tournaments-breeding-ground-for-olympians-fighting-off-closure/articleshow/84622133.cms||Mohammad Anab

---||India||US patent for Mum doc’s weight-loss kit||MUMBAI: Can a device control blood flow in such a way that one loses weight? The head of one of the country’s most prestigious medical schools, KEM Hospital in Parel, recently earned a patent for such a concept from the US Patent Office. Dean Hemant Deshmukh, an interventional radiologist, thought of the device while fixing the narrowed blood vessels around the small intestine. Cardiologists fix narrowed vessels around the heart and interventional radiologists are trained to similarly fix vessels in other body parts such as the brain, lungs, legs and the abdomen, among others, to prevent strokes and gangrene. “The self-expanding, blood-flow resisting device we have devised is about an idea taking shape,” said Deshmukh. “As interventional radiologists, we treat arteries and veins by opening up or closing them as the situation demands,” he said. What is not well known is that plaque buildup not only affects the heart vessels but even the vessels in the abdomen. When the superior mesenteric artery that supplies blood to the small intestine develops blockages, the patient starts suffering from “abdominal angina”. “The patient develops this angina whenever he or she eats. As a result, they develop fear of food and avoid it, leading to 10 to 20kg weight loss,” he said. It is this connection between the blocked mesenteric artery, cibophobia and weight loss that he, along with Dr Krantikumar Rathod, worked on. “We felt we can narrow the mesenteric artery in morbidly obese people by introducing a stent-like device would trigger weight loss,” he said. The narrowed artery induces cibophobia, which, in turn, leads to weight loss. The doctors applied for the patent in April 2016 and got it earlier this month. The device they designed in 8mm in diameter, shaped like an hour glass, and is 15mm to 20mm long. “We now have to devise the delivery system, make prototypes and plan animal studies,” he said. These steps need to be followed before human trials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/us-patent-for-mum-docs-weight-loss-kit/articleshow/84624825.cms||Malathy Iyer

The drive was cancelled on Wednesday and Thursday due to unavailability of vaccines from the state. “Vaccine stocks are scheduled to arrive in Mumbai late on Wednesday night, and distribution to vaccination centres will take place throughout Thursday,” said a civic official. The BMC will receive 61,200 doses—50,000 of Covishield and 11,200 of Covaxin. “The drive will begin on Friday as a result,” said the official. The private sector managed to vaccinate roughly 18,000 people on Wednesday. Across the state, little over a lakh people got vaccinated as against the three to four lakh daily when vaccines are available. A senior state official said that Maharashtra has been promised a total of 1.1 crore vaccine for July. State health minister Rajesh Tope said Maharashtra has a capacity to vaccinate its entire population in a month or two if the Centre would provide adequate vaccine doses. “The state can vaccinate a minimum of 10 lakh and a maximum of 15 lakh people in a day. Hence, the Centre should provide at least this much doses,” he said. On the prediction of the third wave, the minister said: “The third wave could stop if people follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and take vaccination.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-civic-body-to-resume-vax-drive-in-city-tomorrow/articleshow/84623790.cms||---

The IMD’s region-wise statistics showed that the rainfall deficiencies for July were still 28% in central India, 32% in east and northeast India and 22% in northwest India. South peninsular India has, however, received 39% excess July rain. IMD director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra told TOI, “The rainfall revival continues even now. Another low pressure area is expected to form over the Bay of Bengal during the next 48 hours, which would help in wiping out some of the existing rain deficiency for July. We have seen a monsoon paradox this season, with June receiving good rain and July being deficient so far. July is usually the rainiest core monsoon month with normal rainfall of 285.3 mm.” Pulak Guhathakurta, head of the climate research division in IMD, Pune, told TOI, “Seasonal rainfall from June to July 21 is now almost normal at 5% deficiency as against the 8% it showed a few days ago. Till the second week of July, many parts of India had reported almost dry conditions. The scenario changed in the past few days with rain almost flooding parts of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and some parts of Maharashtra.” A Central Water Commission (CWC) report on Wednesday stated that 15 river sites in India were in a severe flood situation, while 19 were flowing in above-normal flood situation due to the ongoing rainfall. A CWC official said, “Most of these sites are in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Assam and Tamil Nadu. The West flowing rivers in Konkan, like in Raigad and Ratnagiri, are getting continued rainfall and are in a severe situation. The highest impact is being felt in west Maharashtra as compared to the state’s central or eastern parts. The West flowing rivers and their levels are directly proportional to the rain. As soon as the rainfall intensity increases, these rivers start rising, unlike bigger rivers whose levels take some time to rise during heavy rain.” Though the intensity of the rainfall over northwest India is likely to reduce, it may increase again from July 25. Extreme heavy rain has been forecast in parts of Maharashtra during the next few days. Skymet Weather Services president G P Sharma told TOI, “Sub-divisions Vidarbha, Marathwada and Madhya Maharashtra are likely to get heavy to very heavy rain over the next two days. The rain could become moderate by July 23. Weather activity will go very mild over the subsequent 48 hours. Extreme heavy rain at a few places will possibly cause localized flooding and inundation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/indias-rainfall-deficiency-for-july-drops-to-17-6-from-46-in-june/articleshow/84623786.cms||Neha Madaan

In just one week the application — useful for booking online tickets, knowing the routes, nearby bus stops, exact location of the buses, among others — has been downloaded over 10,000 times. An official from Nashik Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd (NMPML) said, “On an average over 1,000 people are downloading the app every per day. Also, an average of around 400 people are buying tickets using the app per day. Currently, the buses are plying on nine routes only and the number of passengers booking tickets online will increase as we open more routes,” an NMPML official said. “We have just added another 22 buses and four more routes — two routes towards Ambad via Cidco and Kamatwade, while other two routes are Pathardi and Ashok Nagar. Earlier, around 4,000 passengers would travel through buses and daily collection was over 1.5 lakh. With the rolling out of another 22 buses, the footfall of daily passengers has doubled and the ticket collection has also increased,” the official said. The NMC has plans to deploy a total of 250 buses on 65 different routes in the city with over 1,390 bus stops. Two private firms have been deployed on procure, operate, maintain and manage basis. Both the firms have jointly procured a total of 250 buses, 200 CNG and 50 diesel. The NMC will be paying the private firms on per km basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/mobile-app-for-nashik-city-bus-service-becomes-a-hit/articleshow/84611824.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Delhi||Women from Darjeeling harassed in south Delhi, police register case||NEW DELHI: A group of women from Darjeeling were allegedly harassed by a few men, who passed lewd comments at them on the intervening night of July 18-19 in south Delhi’s Safdarjung Enclave. The victims had gone to a restaurant in the evening and were waiting outside for a cab when the suspects allegedly made the objectionable remarks. Police have filed an FIR under Section 509 of IPC, which deals with outraging a woman’s modesty. “Annoyed at the lewd remarks, the complainant shouted at the suspects and started making a video. The women then took a cab and went to Defence Colony market for dinner. While the complainant did not make any call to the PCR that day, she gave a complaint to the Safdarjung Enclave police station SHO today,” said a senior officer. Police said investigation had started and the video recording of the incident had been obtained from the mobile phone of the complainant. Efforts were being made to identify the accused through CCTV footage, inquiry of the restaurant owner and local informers. Meanwhile, Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) said it had taken suo motu cognisance of media reports of an alleged incident of racial discrimination and sexual harassment against a group of girls from the Northeast in Hauz Khas Village. DCW stated, “It has been reported that a few men stopped the girls and tried to sexually harass them by asking their “hourly rate for sexual activities”. The girls recorded the incident and shared the video on social media platforms. It has also been reported that no FIR has been registered in the matter so far. This is a very serious matter and needs to be dealt with strictly.” In a letter to police, the commission said, “Please provide the copy of the FIR along with details of the accused identified and arrested, steps taken to identify and arrest the accused in case of non-arrest, and a detailed action taken report in the matter by July 25.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/women-from-darjeeling-harassed-in-south-delhi-police-register-case/articleshow/84623823.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand CM announces decision to form a high-power committee to review Char Dham Devasthanam Board Act||DEHRADUN: For the past 18 months, the BJP government and the priests of Char Dham have locked horns over the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Act. Following repeated protests by the priest community, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami in a major statement on Wednesday announced the decision to form a high-power committee to review “the situation rising after the formation of the Board and its legal aspects.” The CM categorically said, “We are in favour of positive amendments and a decision will be taken on the recommendation of the high-power committee.” The priests and the locals of Char Dham shrines have been opposing the Act since its inception because they feel it challenges the centuries-old administrative and power structure of the shrines. Amid strong opposition from the Congress, the Trivendra Singh Rawat government had tabled the Bill and passed it in the state assembly in December 2019. The Board came into existence after the official gazette notification on June 15, 2020. Now with the hi-power committee, CM Dhami wants to reach a consensus between the local stakeholders and the government. Elaborating further on the decision to form a high-power committee, the CM said, “According to the norms of the Act, the rights of the priests, locals and other stakeholders were kept safe and not infringed upon. However, they thought that the government wanted to take over the reins of the yatra. It is not so. The aim of the government is to facilitate the yatra by providing clear water, proper electricity, nice accommodation, infrastructure, cleanliness and roads, without interfering with the rights of the priests, locals and other stakeholders.” He highlighted that the Char Dham yatra was very important for the financial health of the state and it has a direct impact on the lives of the people associated with it. Dhami added, “I believe that to give a new dimension to economic activity, a new system has to come up to ensure that the rights of the stakeholders, locals and priests are not adversely impacted. After discussing with all the concerned stakeholders, our government is in favour of a positive change amendment. We are forming a high-power committee to evaluate the impact on the stakeholders and issues faced by them after the formation of the Board. The high-power committee will carry out the legal assessment of bringing about these changes.” He further said that on the basis of the recommendations made by the high-power committee, a decision would be taken about the management of the Devasthanam Board. Few days back, the priests of Char Dham had announced a major protest from July 23, in favour of their demand to dissolve the Board. Soon after taking charge as CM in March this year, Tirath Singh Rawat had announced that the 51 small temples would be removed from the ambit of the Board. Rawat had also said that the government would review the Board. However, in June the tourism minister Satpal Maharaj stirred up the hornet’s nest when he said that there was no plan to review the Board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cm-announces-decision-to-form-a-high-power-committee-to-review-char-dham-devasthanam-board-act/articleshow/84622156.cms||Kautilya Singh

Residents said that work on two Union government-funded projects was to be completed by December 2020 but was still incomplete. As part of the projects, roads were dug up to lay underground cables and natural gas pipelines. Aniruddh Bhati, a BJP municipal councillor, told TOI that about 70 km of inner roads were dug up for underground cabling, laying of natural gas pipeline, sewer line and water pipeline in the run-up to the Kumbh. The Central government awarded the two projects to the holy city keeping in view its religious significance, particularly the fact that it hosts the Kumbh fair. "Work on one of them, integrated power development system underground cabling (IPDS), a project worth Rs 304 crore, started in October 2019 and was completed in January 2021,” project manager Sanjiv Sharma told TOI. Crores of rupees were paid to departments concerned as road restoration charges, he added. Haridwar natural gas private limited (HNG) officials also said that most of their work has already been done and no further damage to roads due to it is likely.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/dug-up-roads-add-to-monsoon-woes-in-haridwar/articleshow/84622179.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal

The gram panchayat of Nandwal village and police had shut entry to the village and many devotees were turnd away from the entrance. The village is famous as Prati-Pandharpur. Devotees also sought blessings from outside the Vitthal mandir at Mirajkar Tikti. Avinash Kumte, one of the devotees at Nandwal, said, “I have been coming to Prati-Pandharpur temple at Nandwal from Kolhapur for the past 35 years without fail on the day of Aashadi-Ekadashi. I came here on Tuesday on my bicycle to see the ‘Shikhar’ of the Vitthal temple.” The palanquin of ‘Sri Dnyaneshwar Mauli Palkhi Sohla’ to the Nandwal temple was taken from Vitthal temple at Mirajkar Tikti in a decorated KMT bus on Tuesday morning. Traffic police inspector Sneha Giri and police inspector Pramod Jadhav from Rajawada police station carried the palanquin for some time. Manjiri Kashid, a home maker from Mangalwar Peth area, said they celebrated the day at home . “We had kept a fast and offered prayers to the ‘Vitthal-Rukmini’ idol in our home,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/temple-closure-rain-no-dampener-as-aashadi-festivities-move-to-homes/articleshow/84611840.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Nagpur||Strident campaign running against inter-religion marriages in Nagpur||NAGPUR: Around 100 persons gather in a room of the Rajkumar Kewalramani School at Jaripatka, listening to speakers making fervent appeals to ‘rise to the occasion’. The speakers, from different Sangh Parivar bodies, mince no words in putting across the message to fight ‘love jihad’ to an audience comprising both young and old. They appeal to the audience to start a ‘dharmyudha’ against love jihad, ‘putting aside’ secularism and pluralism as Hindutva is at stake. Their refrain is Muslim groups are systematically targeting Hindu girls, and luring them into marriage, only to exploit them. Instilling core Hindutva values can only save them, they say. TOI attended one such meeting on Tuesday at Jaripatka, with more held every week since last two months. The trigger, they say, were the recent marriages of three girls to Muslim men. The group claimed that two of them could be brought back to the fold, but parents of the third had accepted the marriage. The names of the girls were not disclosed, citing confidentiality. Leaflets are distributed in households that speak about love jihad, warning parents to keep an eye on their daughters, and also instil religious values in them. The girls falling into the trap may even end up being trafficked, reads a pamphlet. “Pamphlets running into thousands have been distributed in Jaripatka. The efforts have yielded results and the number of Muslims frequenting the locality has reduced substantially. Some who had small shops are also not to be seen these days,” said one of the speakers, appealing for the drive to continue. Jaripatka has a large population of Sindhis. The Sindhi community is especially vulnerable to conversion attempts these days, though this has spread to Sadar division too, said speakers. “Some Sindhis have also converted to Christianity. It’s time to act. How long can we remain pacifist, even Lord Krishna preaches about taking up arms for Dharma,” said one of the speakers. Quickly adding a disclaimer that taking up arms means countering love jihad thorough strict but peaceful means. “The drive is to awaken Hindutva among residents here, so they stick to their religion,” said one of the speakers citing examples of Hindu girls getting married to boys of other religions. “We have been able to save a number of girls from being converted after marriage. Once, a hardcore Hindu girl was baited by love jihadis for being vocal against them. A doctor’s daughter was also a victim, and they also made her a drug addict,” said a speaker. They target girls from homes where there are problems, and exploit them emotionally, said the speaker. Calls were made to create pressure on the family where a girl is getting married out of the religion. “A family had converted to Christianity, and when a member died the last rites were done according to that religion. The neighbours should have insisted the body should be cremated according to Hindu customs, only then should they help them in the last rites,” another speaker said. “We need to act against some places of worship of other religions. The household nearby can also play loud devotional music, said one of them”. The meet was coordinated by Purushottam Ranglani, Gaurav Sharma, and Rajkumar Sharma, belonging to various outfits working against love jihad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/strident-campaign-running-against-inter-religion-marriages/articleshow/84623191.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Time right for easing curbs, but keep eye on Covid, says doctors||MUMBAI/PUNE: Heath minister Rajesh Tope, speaking to a TV channel in Mumbai, said there are increasing demands for allowing the fully vaccinated on local trains and the government is considering it. “There should be some relaxation and I hope that the CM and the Covid task force will take a proper decision,” the minister said, pointing out there are issues like whether the railways have adequate manpower to cross-check whether passengers are vaccinated. He pointed out that air travellers to the state with both doses of vaccine are now exempted from presenting a negative RT-PCR report. Last week, deputy CM Ajit Pawar had said during a review meeting that he would recommend the state government to allow malls to open with “fully vaccinated staff” for “fully vaccinated customers”. The public health department is considering proposals that allow fully vaccinated people to return to work across malls, restaurants, public transport networks and factories. Head of the state task force, Dr Sanjay Oak, said full vaccination will help decision-making by local administration and slowly boost important sectors. Dr Rahul Pandit, another task force member, said even as the state readies health systems, fully vaccinated individuals should be allowed to operate in “bio-bubbles”, with staggered timings, to give the economy the necessary momentum. But the pace of vaccination is faltering. Pawar said the state was told that supply would be streamlined from July, but the situation hasn’t improved much. “We are in constant touch with the Union government for supply of more doses,” he said. Health experts said there’s now evidence, including data from the latest national sero survey, that suggests this could be the right time to take strong steps towards normalcy, while keeping a grip on preparedness. Epidemiologist Dr Sanjay Rai, a professor of community medicine at AIIMS, New Delhi, said evidence from around the world has demonstrated that natural Covid infection provides better and longer protection. “Besides, the reinfection rate is very low if we analyse breakthrough cases after vaccination. Therefore, we can safely consider that two-thirds of the population is protected as of now. So it’s the right time to move towards normalcy, with close monitoring of the situation.” State officials said steps are being taken towards a safe reopening. Relief and rehabilitation secretary Aseem Gupta said they have forwarded proposals for various economic sectors to the health department.

The animal dragged the child towards the forest while his 13-year-old sister managed to run some distance and shout for help, alerting village residents. By the time the residents reached the spot, the big cat was nowhere to be seen. The boy’s partially eaten body was recovered from the forest in Pali village in Gangolihaat on Tuesday. This is the third such attack in the state this week. Earlier, two women were killed within days of each other in Tehri district. Three shooters who had put down the maneater in Tehri on Tuesday are now being deployed to Pithoragarh to search for the leopard responsible for the attack. On Wednesday, village residents protested against lack of swift action by the forest department. “We’ll try to trap the animal, if we are unable to do so, it will be shot dead,” said J S Suhag, chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand forest department. Camera traps have been installed in the area to monitor the movement of the animal. Vinay Bhargav, divisional forest officer of Pithoragarh, said this was the fifth death in leopard attack in Pithoragarh forest division this year. “Two maneaters have been put down. This would be the third,” he told TOI. Bhargav said initial ex-gratia had been provided to the victim’s family and the remaining amount would be released after autopsy. The forest division has a high rate of man-leopard conflict as a majority of its 1,342 villages are in the vicinity of dense forests. “Last year, we lost 10 lives to leopard attacks. There is a need to survey abandoned villages in the region which have become safe haven for leopards,” said Bhargav, adding that a leopard population estimation across each forest division was also required to better tackle man-leopard conflict. Despite measures to tackle man-leopard conflict in Uttarakhand hills, such as increased patrolling and use of radio collars to track the animals, big cat attacks account for more than half of the deaths in man-wildlife conflict incidents in the state. The first half of this year has already recorded 30 deaths in man-wildlife conflict incidents, with 17 people dying and 23 suffering injuries in leopard attacks, data from the forest department has shown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/leopard-kills-boy-13-yr-old-sister-escapes-3rd-such-death-this-wk/articleshow/84622181.cms||Shivani Azad

The cantonment police station has registered a case of cheating and forgery against three suspects, including the driver of the vehicle, and has initiated a probe. This is the first bus to be caught for the violation since the launch of a dedicated drive against the use of forged vehicle number plates. In January this year, the Aurangabad city police had registered dozens of cases against two-wheeler riders for using forged number plates. In most of the cases, it was found that the bike-owners had forged the number plates as they had defaulted on bank loans and feared that their vehicles would be seized. In some cases, bike thieves were using the forged plates to avoid getting caught. In the latest case, the police are verifying as to what prompted the bus driver or the owner to forge the number plate. Inspector Manoj Pagare told TOI: “The private vehicle was found parked along the road for two-three days. Our constable checked the vehicle’s credentials and found something amiss.” Further probe revealed that though the vehicle’s original registration number is MH-46-J-7772, it had a plate bearing MH-17-AG-0111. Police kept a watch on the bus for two days, before finally rounding up the driver, who came to get the bus repaired. Police said the 30-seater bus used to ply on the Aurangabad-Pune road. “We are going to check the number of days (or months) this bus has been plying with the forged number plate,” said police naik Vitthal Sure, the complainant in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/pvt-bus-found-operating-with-forged-number-plate/articleshow/84611860.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Cops said that he committed suicide as he was anxious over not getting bail and he wanted to go out from the prison. The deceased was identified as Jaimin Patel, a resident of South Bopal, who was imprisoned since January 2021 after he was arrested by crime branch in a gang rape case, in which a Rajkot woman accused him and three others of drugging and raping her. “When a jail officer went to Patel’s cell in Barrack No. 3, he found him hanging with a bedsheet which was tied with a pipe of bathroom tap and a grill of window,” said a police officer. The officer said that jail authorities called a doctor who checked and declared him dead. Later, his body was taken to Civil Hospital in Asarwa for postmortem and a case of accidental death was registered with Ranip police. Inspector J B Khambhla of Ranip police said that they did not get any suicide note from the deceased. “But inmates including thee co-accused in the gang rape case told cops that he was tense as he was not getting bail,” he said. “He did not get bail a single time after he was arrested by the crime branch in January 2021. This was the cause of frustration for him due to which he ended life,” said Khambhla. Patel along with Pragnesh Patel of Sola, Jitendra Goswami of Vasna and Maldev Bharwad of Isanpur were held after a 26-year-old woman from Rajkot alleged that she was gang-raped by them when she went to them seeking a job. She had alleged in her complaint with women’s police station (west) that she was taken to Udaipur, Abu, Mandvi, and Gandhidham where she was gang-raped by the accused. She also alleged that the accused raped her in a moving SUV. After drugging her, they allegedly took her photographs and videos in compromising position to blackmail her.

The patient is on life support. His wife had moved the Gujarat high court on Monday evening, pleading that his sperm be preserved so that she can conceive through IVF if he does not make it. The woman had to move the court as the pending Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill stipulates that no man’s sperm can be obtained without his consent. The hospital management had insisted on a court order in the absence of the consent. After hearing the plea, the HC on Tuesday had directed the Vadodara-based Sterling Hospital to preserve the sperm as sought by his wife. The hospital had initially declined her request because the patient is in no condition to give consent. He has been hit by multiple organ failure. “We received the court order at about 5.10pm. In line with the procedure, we counselled the wife and the parents,” said Anil Nambiar, zonal director of Sterling Hospitals. “The testicular sperm extraction (TESE) was started at about 8pm and the surgical procedure ended at about 8.30pm. The sperm has been extracted and preserved in the lab.” Nambiar added: “We are happy that the procedure was successful. Now, the family’s and doctors’ priority is the survival of the patient.” The extracted sperm can be preserved for long, he said. The family had rushed to the court through advocate Nilay Patel. The family had sought directions to the medical expert concerned to collect and store the sperm according to medical advice. The lawyer had requested the court to hear the case urgently and Justice Ashutosh Shastri had agreed. It was submitted that the patient has been admitted since May 10 and the doctors have conveyed to the family that he may not survive for long. The court said that if the case was not dealt with urgently, it would create an irreversible situation. The court granted permission to collect the patient’s sperm and ordered the hospital to preserve it. The court has, however, not granted permission to proceed with artificial insemination till further orders. The court is likely to hear the case again on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/wifes-love-wins-sperm-of-man-facing-covid-death-frozen/articleshow/84623210.cms||---

Moreover, 15 barrages in the district have been submerged. Water from several swollen rivers disrupted traffic movement. Even the Kalamba lake near Kolhapur city, which is a popular tourist destination, has started overflowing due to the continuous showers. By 8 pm on Tuesday, the Panchaganga river water level reached the 27 feet-mark at Rajaram barrage in Kasba Bawda. The water level had increased by almost seven feet over the past two days. The warning level of the river here is 39 feet, while the danger level is 43 feet. As per the district disaster management officials, the Kolhapur district received 13.2mm rainfall in the 24-hour period ending at 6.30 pm on Tuesday. Gaganbawda received the highest rainfall (51.8mm) followed by Bhudargad (28.9mm) and Ajara (21.2mm). Shirol and Hatkanangle meanwhile received the lowest rainfall with 2.7mm and 3.6mm, respectively, during the same 24-hour period. The Kalamba lake started overflowing with the water level going above the weir. Sandip Patil, a resident of the Kalamba area, said, “The 64-hectare lake, which was built by Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj almost 140 years ago to ensure safe and clean drinking water for the city has filled up and has started overflowing. Given the Covid situation, the administration will have to make efforts to stop people from crowding around the scenic area.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/panchaganga-water-level-rises-to-27-feet/articleshow/84611873.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Govt to hold open inquiry in Jalyukta scheme cases||Mumbai: The MVA government has decided to hold an open inquiry in cases of alleged irregularities in Jalyukta Shivar Abhiyaan scheme based on the recommendation of a committee led by retired additional chief secretary Bijay Kumar, sources said. The committee’s report has been submitted to the state government. The committee was set up in December 2020 after the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) found irregularities in the water conservation scheme. Sources say the committee has recommended which cases mentioned in the CAG report need to be probed further through an open inquiry. It has also suggested cases that need a departmental probe. The CAG report, which was tabled in September 2020, had said despite spending Rs9,634 crore, the Jalyukta Shivar scheme had little impact in water neutrality or in raising the groundwater level. The CAG report had examined 1,128 works from 120 villages which had recorded the highest spending. The scheme was stayed by the MVA government after it came to power. “It is being said works were awarded without tenders being invited. For works undertaken by the government, tenders were invited. However, for works undertaken from CSR funds by companies, there was no need to issue tenders. The companies gave the work to the NGO of their choice,” BJP leader Ashish Shelar said. On allegations that bills were submitted to the government without works being completed, Shelar said, “The Fadnavis government had started an inquiry into 650 cases when it was in power. But there is no need to malign the entire project which involves over 6.5 lakh works. Clearances for works were given by district collectors.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-govt-to-hold-open-inquiry-in-jalyukta-scheme-cases/articleshow/84624273.cms||---

In July 1989, the city recorded the highest amount of rainfall to the tune of 422.1 mm. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad, the city recorded a mean total rainfall of 179.2 mm in the month of July, 197.2 mm in July 2013, and 195.2 mm in July 2016. However, this year, as the monsoon is only starting to peak, the city has already recorded rainfall of 294.8 mm and is poised to surpass it. “This time, the city has witnessed active monsoon conditions very early. Every third day, Hyderabad is experiencing intense spell of rainfall following a brief lull. Continuous formation of systems over Bay of Bengal have triggered wide spread rainfall over Telangana,” said A Shravani, meteorologist, IMD, Hyderabad. In mid-July, the city woke up to a deluge after many areas suffered wrath of vigorous monsoon following rainfall of over 200 mm in a single day. It was after seven years that the city witnessed this kind of rain in 24 hours. Figures by the Telangana State Development Planning Society from June 1 to July 21 indicates that while areas such as Uppal, Kapra, Musheerabad, Saroornagar and Marredpally have recorded 100%-150% excess rainfall, areas such as Bandlaguda, Bahadurpura, Quthbullapur, Alwal have recorded 20%-30% excess rainfall, which is relatively lesser than the others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyderabad-sees-wettest-july-in-last-10-monsoons/articleshow/84623831.cms||Preeti Biswas

On June 22, the Rachakonda commissioner had suspended Addagudur SI V Maheshwar, constables MA Rashed Patel and P Janaiah for dereliction of duties in relation to the custodial death of the woman, Mariamma. After Mariamma’s death at Bhongir area hospital on June 18, as per procedure, a post-mortem was conducted and a custodial death case was registered under Section 176 of the CrPC against SI Maheshwar and the two constables. Subsequently, in July second week, police submitted a memo in court mentioning of the addition of Section 330 (Voluntarily causing hurt) of the IPC and the SC & ST Act in the FIR against the three cops after the medical examination of the woman’s son, Uday, who was picked up in a theft case, indicated custodial torture. On Wednesday, the Rachakonda commissioner issued a statement about the dismissal of the three cops from service. “In Addagudur PS custodial death case of dalit woman, Mariamma, police persons responsible, SI V Maheshwar, Constables M A Rasheed Patel and P Janaiah , who have been under suspension, are dismissed from service under Article 311 (2) (b) of Constitution and 25 (2) of conduct rules on July 20 by CP Rachakonda,” the statement said.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana gets HC stick over statues on roads||HYDERABAD: Expressing displeasure over statues still being placed in the middle of roads despite an 8-year-old Supreme Court order prohibiting it, the Telangana high court on Wednesday told the state government to furnish details of all such statues erected since the 2013 SC order. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy, which was hearing a 2010 PIL filed by advocate MAK Mukheed seeking removal of such statues, said that successive state governments have failed to implement the SC order. “Governments have become helpless,” the bench said, expressing its despair over the state of affairs. When state counsel A Sanjeev Kumar told the court about GO MS No. 18 dated February 18, 2013, issued by the composite AP state prohibiting installation of statues on roads, a fuming bench asked: “You have with you an order from the apex court and an order from the state government. What did you do in the last eight years? “The statues of street leaders were also put up in the middle of roads and on road sides in Hyderabad and all over the state. What is the use of the orders of the court and GOs when you do not intend to implement them?” the HC asked The bench said that since the petitioner too was not showing any interest in pursuing the matter, it would close this petition. “But we will direct the registry to register a suo motu petition on the same subject. From now onwards we will pursue the matter,” the bench said. The bench gave notices to the secretaries of municipal administration, R&B and the GHMC commissioner to file affidavits explaining their efforts in the matter within four weeks. “Statues are coming up all over the state and your affidavits should depict the picture of the entire state,” the bench said. The judges also sought to know from the state whether it had framed any guidelines in the matter after the SC judgment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-gets-hc-stick-over-statues-on-roads/articleshow/84624270.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

---||Delhi||NDMC won’t give ration to those who didn’t attend online classes: AAP||NEW DELHI: AAP functionary Durgesh Pathak on Wednesday claimed that the BJP-led North Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided not to give ration to students who didn’t attend online classes. According to a government report, 40-45% of students are unable to take online classes because of the lack of infrastructure, he said. “It is shameful that the BJP will not give mid-day meal ration to poor children who failed to attend online classes because their parents can’t afford android phones,” Pathak said in a press conference. The AAP functionary urged Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta and the civic body’s mayor to scrap this unjust rule and distribute the mid-day meal ration to all the children. “It is important to understand that the children attending the municipal schools come from the poorest strata of the society. In an order, the municipal corporation has stated that ration will not be provided to the students who are not attending the online classes,” claimed Pathak. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor, however, said that the north corporation had brought out no such notice denying mid-day meal ration to students. He added that AAP was trying to malign the corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpn-wont-give-ration-to-those-who-didnt-attend-online-classes/articleshow/84623841.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Bank’s loss from Wainganga sugar plant’s sale increases to Rs 22.23 crore||NAGPUR: The financial loss of Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSCB) from the controversial sale of Wainganga Cooperative Sugar Plant, Bhandara, has increased to Rs22.23 crore after it deposited Rs13.9 crore as dues of former plant workers. TOI had reported in 2013 about the controversial sale of the plant and financial loss of MSBC in the case. The plant is in the news again after state BJP president Chandrakant Patil wrote a letter to home minister Amit Shah and demanded a probe through Enforcement Directorate (ED) into sale or auction of 30 cooperative sugar factories, including this plant. Vidarbha Realties Private Limited, which was later rechristened Wainganga Sugar and Power Limited, and a part of Manas Agro Industries and Infrastructure Limited (MAIIL), which was earlier known as Purti Group, had procured the plant on March 8, 2010, when city MP and Union minister Nitin Gadkari was chairman of the company. Later, in a statement to media, Patil went on to say Gadkari claimed he procured two sugar plants at a cost more than the value decided by the bank. He added Gadkari also claimed that he did not take any loan. An MSBC official said, “Bank had to deposit Rs13.9 crore with industrial court, Bhandara, in February this year as dues of former workers.” One of the former employees said, “Salaries and other dues of around 700 workers were pending when the bank auctioned the plant. We won a case in industrial court, which was challenged by the bank in high court and later in Supreme Court, which did not change the judgement. When bank did not pay in stipulated time period, the collector initiated action, following which the bank deposited Rs13.9 crore in industrial court. We are yet to get the dues as bank filed review petition in SC.” The dues were Rs8.57 crore till 2013, and had increased to Rs13.9 crore with interest. In December 2013, the office of Mohadi tehsil had issued notice to MSCB directing to pay Rs2.97 crore as unearned income against auction of sprawling 66.53 hectare land of the plant. The land was owned by the state government and allotted on lease. MSCB reportedly auctioned the land without seeking permission from the collector. In reply, MSCB told officials that it had incurred a loss of Rs5.36 crore from auction of the plant. Thus, the loss of the bank increased to Rs19.26 crore, including Rs5.36 crore loss in auction and payment of Rs13.9 crore dues of workers. Bhandara district administration confirmed to TOI the bank is yet to pay dues of Rs2.97 crore, which will rise with interest. Thus, total loss of the bank will rise to Rs22.23 crore and even more from the sale of the plant. MSCB officials said, “We have paid Rs13.9 crore to industrial court. Now, we have nothing to do with the case.” As per TOI’s reports of 2013, MSCB sold the plant at Rs14.1 crore on March 8, 2010, under provisions of Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (SARFAESI) Act. The valuation of Rs14.1 crore was decided in December 8, 2006, and not revised in 2010. MSCB sold the plant through private treaty system, which does not involve a tendering or auction process. The property is sold at a price agreed upon by the buyer and the seller in private treaty system. The sale took place when Gadkari was chairman of Purti. He stepped down on August 27, 2011. TOI had in 2013 also reported Wainganga Sugar and Power Limited had obtained loan of Rs34.50 crore (later extended to Rs55 crore) from a nationalized bank by mortgaging the same plant’s property along with other within 15 months of the sale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/banks-loss-from-wainganga-sugar-plants-sale-increases-to-rs22-23cr/articleshow/84623218.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

On Tuesday, CEPT University signed an MoU to with ATMA to jointly work towards revitalizing the ATMA building. The two institutions plan to create an annual calendar of events appropriate to the space and the mandates of both institutions. Officials said the facility will be available for architecture, design, literary, academic, cultural and industry events. “Those agencies interested in holding corporate events, meetings or discussions at the venue need to apply first to the ATMA administration. A team of experts will analyse the application to see whether it fits the objective of the project,” said a senior ATMA official. The space will be used to curate events, exhibitions and displays. What makes the space distinct from other places is Le Corbusier’s “promenade architecture”. The graceful ramp conducts a visitor into the building. “The curving walls , the use of bold colours, the direction of movement, seats, staircases, windows and doors reveal the touch of the master architect in this building. It gives a whole new definition to the use of space,” added the ATMA official. The original design has provisions for a cafeteria which will be made functional, said officials. Tridip Suhrud, provost of CEPT University, said the university is privileged to be able to revitalise one of modern architecture’s masterpieces by Le Corbusier. “We will together strive to create a cultural space that Ahmedabad and her visitors will cherish,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cept-atma-to-revitalize-le-corbusiers-space/articleshow/84623211.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Covid survey leads to educating for 30,000 illiterate people in Dehradun||DEHRADUN: In July last year, when the pandemic was yet to reach its peak in Uttarakhand, anganwadi workers fanned out across Dehradun district to identify people with comorbidities who could be most at risk of Covid-19. As they went door-to-door, a standard question asked during the survey was whether the household residents were literate. When data was collated, some startling figures emerged. At least, 30,000 residents aged between 30 and 70, many of them women, had declared themselves illiterate. “We had all this information that we could put to good use. So we decided to launch a ‘Padho Doon Badho Doon’ initiative to encourage people to read and write,” said Nitika Khandelwal, chief development officer of Dehradun, who spearheaded the campaign. The effort had borne fruit. A year on, all of them can read and write. But when the authorities contacted the prospective “students”, they found that most of them were shy about learning alongside children in schools. “We hit a roadblock, but then we decided that if people weren’t coming to school, we’ll take the school to them,” said Khandelwal. So primary school teachers were roped in to take special classes in common spaces in all gram panchayats, sometimes even at people's homes, and develop a new syllabus that would cater to the pupils. Soon, the curriculum and the faculty were ready, but it still took some convincing for students to come to class. Puneet Sharma, a teacher who participated in the project, told TOI that the main struggle was not to help people learn but to convince them it was necessary to do so. “In the batch of 22 people that I taught, 13 were aged above 50. At first, many of them said they didn’t need to be literate, but when we explained to them the benefits of basic education, they came around. In fact, many were quite excited when we told them they would be able to use a smartphone once they could read,” said Sharma, adding that he had full attendance even in classes that ran late into the evening. Another challenge the teachers had to navigate was to keep students motivated. To bypass boredom, lots of activity-based learning was introduced. “We used everyday objects to teach. For instance, people were taught to read and write the names of spices they use daily in the kitchen and those of the dishes they cook,” said Bhaskar Rawat, district resource person who was part of the team that prepared the syllabus. By January this year, all 30,000 students were able to read and write to some degree. An independent survey conducted by NGO Room to Read and DIET (District Institute of Education and Training), an autonomous body under the state government, confirmed that all students were literate. “They can write their own names and rattle off numbers,” said Khandelwal. Some hard-working students, like 53-year-old Balo Devi, can even read entire stories to her grandchildren. “I read a bedtime story to them every night. Sometimes, they help me when I struggle with a word,” she said. Balo Devi, who lives in Loharna village of Kalsi block, can also use a smartphone to call her son, a soldier in the Army, as well as calculate the amount when buying groceries from the local ration shop. For Tara Devi, a 74-year-old in Sahaspur block, this is just the beginning. “I got married at an early age. Back then, girls didn’t even dare dream of an education. I’m fortunate to get a second chance and I will continue to learn.” Fortunately for Tara Devi, the Dehradun administration is now planning to start another advanced course for the students, this time with secondary school teachers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/covid-survey-ends-up-identifying-teaching-30k-illiterate-people-many-above-50-yrs/articleshow/84622218.cms||Ishita Mishra

Also, colleges offering postgraduate courses have been asked to fill a minimum of sanctioned posts of teachers, failing which de-recognition could be possible. “In light of directives from the University Grants Commission and other regulations, the university has framed guidelines for colleges acting as PhD research centres. These guidelines are sacrosanct and should be complied with within a period of next two years,” IR Manza, Bamu deputy registrar (academic section) said. The new norms are applicable to both existing and upcoming research centres coming under Bamu. As regards to colleges offering postgraduate courses, Bamu has mandated full-time appointments of at least two faculties. “The colleges have to take necessary steps and ensure vacant posts get filled during the current academic year only. Any non-compliance will lead to colleges getting listed under ‘no-admission’ category in the future,” Manza said. As per revised guidelines for such colleges, Bamu has also asked for no excess admission against the sanctioned intake capacity of institutes. “Colleges will be solely responsible if students admitted in excess fail to register for university examinations due to technical issues,” authorities said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/bamu-frames-new-norms-for-research-centres-colleges/articleshow/84611890.cms||---

Police are probing the negligence that led to the deaths. The two have been identified as Rajesh Rastogi (46) and Amit Malhotra (47). According to the police, a call was received on Wednesday morning informing that two men fell from a building in B-31 East Krishna Nagar. A police team that was sent to the spot identified the two injured men, who were then taken to a hospital, where the doctors declared them dead. During inquiry, police found that the guard deployed at the building had seen the two men visiting it and Rastogi was allegedly interested in buying a flat. “The guard said that both of them first went to the terrace and then to the fourth floor, from where they fell from the balcony that was open and did not have a boundary wall or railing,” said a senior police officer.

---||Mumbai||Adverse events reporting by states ‘not satisfactory’||PUNE: The national Adverse Effects Following Immunisation (AEFI) committee has urged states to ensure all side-effects after Covid jabs are reported on the CoWIN portal. The committee said there has been a drastic drop in reporting levels by states. Dr NK Arora, who heads the committee, said states should tell vaccinators to report all events of concern occurring within 28 days of vaccination. The reports should be uploaded on the CoWIN platform, he said. Dr Arora added that due to low reporting, the country may be missing rare adverse events, which could be of relevance to the community, Indian regulators and other countries as some vaccines here are also deployed globally. The co-convenor of the All India Drug Action Network, Malini Aisola, termed the current reporting system weak and unresponsive. “Many people have faced difficulties while reporting AEFI, let alone securing medical support, though there is a provision for medical management in the protocols,” she said. She added the quality of evidence while investigating AEFI at the local level is very poor with many events being brushed aside as unrelated to vaccination, even before the evidence has been collected. “It reveals poor awareness and training among district-level authorities and committees,” Aisola said. The pace of reporting poses another problem with only 91 AEFI investigations completed till May 27. She said it’s also unlikely families of those affected were informed. “So there is little being done to instill confidence in a system that’s meant to protect patient safety,” she added. Recently, the AEFI committee approved a report of 60 serious adverse events, ruling that 55 of them (most of which needed hospitalisation), were associated with vaccination. The rest of the five cases, including that of a 57-year-old male who died in February after a Covishield jab, were ruled as “coincidental”, not directly linked to vaccination. The report said 36 of the 60 were anxiety-related reactions, while 18 were vaccine product-related reactions. One was classified as both vaccine product-related and anxiety-related reaction. The first national report on causality assessment, which had 31 serious AEFI cases, was released in June. That report recorded India’s first Covid vaccine-related death since the start of the vaccination drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-adverse-events-reporting-by-states-not-satisfactory/articleshow/84623853.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Coimbatore||Will reboot IT sector, says minister||Coimbatore: Tamil Nadu lost several crores of rupees worth information technology investments to other states in the last 10 years, state IT minister T Mano Thangaraj said here on Wednesday. The AIADMK government failed to pay due attention to information technology, which was capitalised by neighbouring states that took efforts to expand the sector and attract investments, the minister told reporters. “Despite the potential to attract huge investments and generate hundreds of jobs, the sector was not paid attention at all for a decade. But the DMK government is taking steps to attract investments in IT sector.” Accompanied by principal secretary Neeraj Mittal and Elcot managing director Ajay Yadav, Thangaraj inspected the upcoming IT park building at Vilankurichi and later held a meeting with representatives of the IT sector. “The need of the hour is to generate employment across Tamil Nadu. Every year, 4.5 lakh youngsters graduate from engineering colleges in the state, out of which only 1.5 lakh manage to get jobs in the information technology sector. The rest are forced to go to other states or abroad. But we have potential to provide jobs to all in Tamil Nadu by giving a fresh thrust to the IT sector. Steps are being taken in that direction,” he said. Noting that the second phase of the IT park in Coimbatore, built at a cost of Rs 114 crore, would be completed soon, the minister said more IT parks would be built in other districts. “Every year, hundreds of youngsters, particularly from the southern districts, are forced to migrate to other districts in search of jobs. Establishments of more IT parks would help them find jobs,” the minister said. Even as the government is taking steps to attract more investments, efforts are also being taken to improve IT infrastructure. In a bid to gather inputs from the industry, the IT department is holding consultative meetings with IT companies and other stakeholders across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/will-reboot-it-sector-says-minister/articleshow/84623216.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Coimbatore||Workers protest delay in reopening of mills||Coimbatore: Mill workers and trade union members on Wednesday staged a protest near the south taluk office, demanding reopening of all mills run by the National Textile Corporation in Coimbatore. The protestors, led by the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (Citu) district president Padamanaban and Labour Progressive Front district secretary Parthasarathy, demanded that mill workers be paid full salary. According to the protestors, there are seven mills, including Pankaja Mill and Murugan Mill in Coimbatore, that are run by the corporation. They were closed several months ago due to the pandemic situation. The closure has hit hundreds of workers depending on the mills. Though the lockdown has been relaxed and other industrial units have resumed functioning, the mills are not open. The government should take steps to reopen the mills, not just in Coimbatore but across the state, the protestors demanded. Until then, the workers have to be paid full salary, they urged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/workers-protest-delay-in-reopening-of-mills/articleshow/84623223.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Cops write to govt offices on misuse of beacons on vehicles||Kolkata: The raids against the beacons continued on Wednesday, despite most government offices being closed due to Eid. Traffic police removed another 32 beacons from vehicles, including those used by IAS officers, police officers, judicial officers, forest department officials and other bureaucrats. Lalbazar has also served notices on 12 government officials, who work with both state and central governments, for using beacons, to which they are not entitled. All these officials have told traffic sergeants that they were entitled to the beacons and had argued that they should not be stopped on the road for such checks. “We had noted down the registration numbers of these cars in the past five days ever since the special beacon drive began. These government officials have been asked to be present with either the notification or the order ascertaining that they indeed are allowed to use beacons,” said a highly placed official at the Kolkata traffic police. More such notices are likely to be issued on Thursday, after which “necessary action as per law” will be taken, depending on the reply, stated police sources. Since Saturday, cops have so far removed 314 such beacons across the city. Cops at the Jorabagan guard alone have removed 34 of these beacons while the Jadavpur and Headquarter traffic guards removed another 20 beacons each. DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha said that the drive of bringing down beacons and sending notices will continue simultaneously. According to police sources in southeast Jorabagan and headquarter traffic guards, most of the offenders were found to have taken cars on rent for government offices. “In some cases, we found that flashers were being used even though that government official is not entitled to it. In Kolkata, only eight senior officials are allowed blue beacons with flashers. In all, merely 45 sets of officials are allowed to use beacons in Bengal,” said an officer. On Monday, the maximum number of such illegal use of beacons were reported near Dhakuria Bridge, MG Road-CR Avenue and Rabindra Sarani-MG Road. Cops revealed recently that earlier, total 44 vehicles had been issued challans since 2016 for using illegal beacons. Of them, 16 were issued challans in 2017 and 15 in 2018. It is just three last year and one this year. “There were four cases in 2016 and five in 2019. Challans are issued here under sections 226 (3) of West Bengal Motor Vehicle regulations along with 177of MV Act. The other section pertains to section 108 (III) CMVR and 177 Of MV Act. The first one saw 33 challans while the second saw 11 challans,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-write-to-govt-offices-on-misuse-of-beacons-on-vehicles/articleshow/84623221.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Students, univs wary of 2020 admission season rerun||KOLKATA: On the eve of the publication of Higher Secondary results, university heads and college principals braced for a rerun of the 2020 undergraduate admissions when a deluge of marks, mostly among students from the HS board, had forced meritorious students from other boards to opt for lesser-known colleges. Expressing shock that 60% Madhyamik candidates have scored above 90%, a Jadavpur University teacher has predicted a similar scorecard in the state board Class XII exams, when results are declared on Thursday. “Screening and evaluation were missing while preparing Madhyamik results. So, a majority of students were awarded huge marks. Now, we are faced with a situation in which there are many more pass-outs than Class XI seats,” he said. Teachers feared the crisis might get worse on Thursday. “We fear a similar marking pattern will be followed even in HS, leading to an overload of students seeking UG seats, particularly in Kolkata and surroundings. This will force even those applicants who may have secured above 90% to get admission in districts. Premier institutes, like JU, will lose out on bright students due to this marking pattern,” he added. Teachers at CISCE and CBSE schools acknowledged their students would be under huge pressure from Thursday once HS results were out. “If the marks are like that of Madhyamik, the situation will be no different than last year, when meritorious students had to be refused admission as others from the state board scored more,” said the principal of a school. Several ISC candidate said they and their friends had decided to seek admission in other states as it might be difficult to compete if HS results were similar to Madhyamik. “Though families do not want their children to go out in the pandemic, they may have to send them to Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru or Pune where they might get a fair chance. Instead of studying in an average college, I would rather study a subject of my choice at a premier institute away from home,” said a Class XII CBSE candidate. Partha Pratim Biswas, teacher of construction engineering at JU, called marks inflation a disease. “Covid may have forced the government to scrap exams, the system will be unable to cap the explosion in marks in future. The competition among boards is leading to a major crisis. When the success data will reduce eventually, it will lead to questions and even depression among students. If corrective measures are taken later, the system will expose the extent of inflated marks awarded during Covid. Candidates from these academic years might face difficulty in finding employment,” Biswas said. A senior Rabindra Bharati University official said without entrance tests, universities and colleges would be unable to do justice. “Many taking admission based on high marks, may not have the aptitude for the subject and may drop out, leading to vacancy. There may be a seat crunch initially,” he said. Calcutta University authorities are waiting for the results on Thursday and plan to keep the admission process glitch-free. “Despite our attempts, seat rationalization could not take place,” rued an official. In a letter to education minister Bratya Basu on Tuesday, Jadavpur University Teachers Association (JUTA) had said “the process adopted for the award of HS marks was not sufficiently scientific, and enabled no assessment of a student’s performance, aptitude... for taking up a specialised field...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/students-univs-wary-of-2020-admission-season-rerun/articleshow/84623256.cms||Somdatta Basu
---||Kolkata||Robbed, stabbed at North Kolkata home, alleges woman||KOLKATA: Cops have recorded a case of alleged robbery at a century-old residential building on Chhidam Mudi Lane in Hatibagan between 3pm and 3.30pm on Tuesday. The complainant, a 29-year-old homemaker, alleged that the accused was standing near the almirah of her bedroom when she spotted him for the first time. By the time she raised an alarm, the accused allegedly stabbed her on her hand and fled with ornaments and cash worth around Rs 2.3 lakh. Cops have not ruled out the possibility that the woman might have been molested. The police said that the victim lives in the building along with her husband, a senior employee of a private hospital in the Jadavpur area, her son and her mother-in-law. “According to the victim, she had gone to the washroom and when she came out, she found that the almirah in her bedroom was open and a man was trying to steal valuables. She was stabbed by the accused before he fled through the main door,” said a police officer. “We have already examined the CCTV footage and spoken to her neighbours. The victim is still in a state of shock on Wednesday when our team met her. There are some missing links that are crucial for the investigation,” said Bidisha Kalita, DC (EB), who is now holding the charge of north division. The officers of the detective department have also visited the spot and carried out a detailed investigation on Wednesday. The incident that took place in the middle of a congested north Kolkata locality during daytime has left the neighbours worried over security issues. However, there are several unanswered questions and cops believe that there is something more in the case than what has surfaced so far. “Why should somebody use the main door, the only entry and exit route? No one else in the house could see or hear anything suspicious. We have registered a case and all local criminals are being rounded up,” said an officer. While talking to TOI, the victim’s husband refused to divulge much other than the fact on how the incident took place. “At present, I do not want to speak much about the incident except that my wife was injured and is still traumatized. I will speak after my duty hours,” he said before disconnecting the phone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/robbed-stabbed-at-n-kol-home-alleges-woman/articleshow/84623230.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Cops suspect that the man, whose condition was stated to be critical, might have been hit with a heavy object, like a stone or a brick. Sharma ran a roadside eatery along with his father. He used to sleep at night on a bench near the eatery. “At night, he was hit on the head when others, including his father, who was nearby, were in deep sleep,” said a police officer, adding that the CCTV footage of the area has been checked. Some people claimed that the man was groaning in pain that woke up his father, others said that some passers-by alerted them. The man was rushed to RG Kar Hospital, from where he was later shifted to Medical College and Hospital after his condition worsened. Locals claimed that it was a stoneman style attack on the man as 12 people had died on city streets in a span of six months in 1989.

---||Hyderabad||Crop insurance scheme in Telangana teeters with Rs 470 crore dues||HYDERABAD: When it comes to crop insurance scheme, Telangana along with Gujarat and Jharkhand has highest premiums due under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) in the country. The crop insurance scheme is implemented by state governments with the support of shared funds from the Centre, which has clearly said it won’t pay the total premium as several states failed in their commitment. Data placed in the Lok Sabha following a query shows that Gujarat has a total of Rs 870 crore due as premium for 2018- 19 and 2019- 20 financial years, followed by Telangana at Rs 470 crore and Jharkhand with Rs 366 crore for the same years. Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Thomar said that major onus of the implementation of the scheme lies with the states. “The scheme introduced by the Narendra Modi government has taken off the burden from the farmers. But sharing of premiums has become a cause of concern,” admitted one official. According to the scheme, farmers have to contribute their premium depending on the type of crop. It will be five per cent per acre of the scale of finance decided by banks for commercial crops, and two per cent for food crops. The amount of premium for the crops and other monetary guidelines are fixed by the private and government insurance players depending on the local conditions and the entire process is undertaken by bidding. Banks in Telangana have directly deducted the premium amount from the loans taken by farmers (this was till the state government stopped paying premium). The banks used to pay this premium to private and government insurance companies. However, for the past two years, the Centre told the states that it will contribute only 30 per cent as its share. “This has triggered a financial burden and implementation of the scheme became questionable in the state,” a top source in the government said. “Most farmers also did not want the premium to be deducted from their loan amount,” the source added. In addition to the PMFBY, there was a separate insurance scheme for crops including chilli, cotton and tomato. The National Crop Insurance Scheme was in place and the government-owned Agricultural Insurance Company was the implementing agency. However, in that scheme, farmers had to pay 50 per cent of the insurance premium. “Small and marginal farmers should have a guarantee for their crop. In fact, governments can float their own insurance company,” Ravi Kanneganti, state coordinator, Rythu Swarajya Vedika, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/crop-insurance-scheme-in-t-teeters-with-rs-470-crore-dues/articleshow/84624274.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Both were booked on the charges of seeking bribe from the brother of an accused. Following an internal high-level probe, a case for seeking bribe was registered against ACB inspector Rajkumar Padvi and his writer Pradeep Veer. They were booked on June 14 at a Beed police station. The two suspects had then gone underground and remained untraceable. They were eventually suspended. When their attempt to get anticipatory bail from the lower court proved futile, the moved the high court. Representing the accused, senior counsel Rajendra Deshmukh said that a talathi named Dadasaheb Andhale, who was arrested by Padvi, held a grudge against him. Andhale got him (Padvi) framed through another accused’s brother by providing him a voice recorder. While granting relief, Justice Sandeep Shinde said: “Except demand, there is nothing more to be verified and, therefore, custodial interrogation of the applicants is not required.” As per the ACB, Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran’s sectional engineer Shaikh Samad had landed in the ACB trap and was arrested while accepting bribe of Rs 1,000 on April 5. Padvi, the investigation officer in the said case, contacted Samad’s brother to inform him about the arrest and asked him to come to the ACB office. When Samad’s brother came to the office, Padvi allegedly asked him to speak to Veer, who demanded a sum of Rs 2 lakh for “cooperating” in the probe. The following day, Samad’s brother carried an audio call recorder and recorded the negotiation for the bribe. The deal was finalised at Rs 50,000. On April 12, Samad’s brother lodged a written complaint with director general of police (ACB) Rajnish Seth. The Pune unit of the ACB then carried out the probe and Padvi and Veer were booked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-grants-anticipatory-bail-to-acb-officer-writer-in-graft-case/articleshow/84611926.cms||Mohammed Akhef

However, they couldn’t confirm if they intruded on the Indian side. “This is the latest case of Chinese activity near Barahoti. They came in horses four to five days ago and left some belongings as evidence of their visit,” a senior government official told TOI on Wednesday. “They usually visit after the monsoon. They came early this time,” he said. Another government official, who also did not wish to be named, said that the activity of the Chinese army had increased along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) near Barahoti. In 2018, the Indian Army and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) reported to the Centre multiple aerial intrusions in the Barahoti plains by the PLA. On the Indian side, a multidepartmental team also goes on routine recces near the area (usually three times a year) to keep an eye on it. “A team from the district administration visited Barahoti a fortnight ago,” said a senior district police official. Barahoti, which is located along Uttarakhand’s border with China, is merely 397km from the state’s capital, Dehradun. The scenic grassland in Chamoli district is connected by roads to Joshimath.

---||Hyderabad||Now, Telangana eyes LRS for funds; likely to fetch up to Rs 3,000 crore||HYDERABAD: After enhancing land values and registration charges for property registrations, the government has shifted its focus on to another money-spinner — Layout Regularisation Scheme (LRS). The drive, in which open plots in illegal layouts across the state will be regularised, is likely to fetch between Rs 2,000 and Rs 3,000 crore, subject to final outcome in a case in Supreme Court. The state has already received Rs 250 crore towards application fee. The government had announced LRS on September 1, 2020, and accepted applications till October 31, 2020. There was a overwhelming response for the scheme with 25 lakh applying for regularising their plots as government had stopped registration of open plots in unapproved layouts. Individual plot owners were asked to pay Rs 1,000 as initial fee, while layout developers were asked to pay Rs 10,000 along with the applications. After receiving the applications, the government could not go ahead with regularisation due to a case in high court. Now, the matter is before the Supreme Court. Nine months after receiving the applications, municipal administration department principal secretary Arvind Kumar issued a memo on Tuesday directing officials of municipal administration and panchayat raj departments to process the applications in a time-bound manner by issuing certain guidelines. “Government will compile the information and submit it to court,” municipal administration department principal secretary Arvind Kumar told TOI. For the purpose, preliminary processing would have two stages. “In stage I, all LRS applications received by gram panchayats and civic bodies should be grouped into different clusters i.e., village, survey number wise, locality and colony wise and kept ready for site inspections. In the Stage II, each cluster should be inspected by a team constituted by the district collector with officials of revenue, irrigation, panchayat and local town planning staff and upload their remarks online,” the municipal administration department memo stated. The entire exercise should be completed within 15 days, the principal secretary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/now-state-eyes-lrs-for-funds-likely-to-fetch-up-to-rs-3k-crore/articleshow/84623760.cms||Koride Mahesh

The pilot project was launched on Friday in south Kolkata. The move was taken after multiple cases of fraud across ATMs, social networking and e-commerce sites over the past two pandemic hit years, According to DCP (south) Akash Magharia, they have concentrated on nine important con jobs. First no one should rely on customer care numbers from any search engine. They should instead visit the official websites or contact banks directly. Two, don’t click on links received through SMS from unknown numbers or emails. Three, don’t receive VoIP calls or video calls from unknown numbers and social media like Whatsapp. Four, avoid financial transactions on websites. Five, always opt for payment on delivery from any new or verified website. Six, be aware of calls related to SIM card or ATM blocks or KYC updates. In most cases these are fakes. Seven, be very alert on the use of crypto currency and bitcoins where there has been a surge in the number of frauds in the past few months. Eight, never share your personal OTP with anyone and nine, don’t fall for advertisements that are too good to be true. "There are around 10 complaints daily about attempts to dupe the victim of his money on our Twitter and Facebook accounts. This is irrespective of the FIRs that are filed each day," said a detective department official. “This is a welcome initiative by Kolkata Police. We will urge them to hold the camp on a Saturday or Sunday so that maximum people can participate,” said Bharat Shah, a senior resident of Sindhu Apartment on Sarat Bose Road. The residents’ welfare association of Rameswaram Apartment in Bhowanipur, home to several prominent city businessmen and politicians also welcomed the move. “My teenage granddaughter recently lost Rs. 8000 to an online scam. Many elderly residents have also been victims of such internet frauds in the last one year. We will ensure maximum participation,” said Hansmukh Kundalia, a senior RWA member.

For the last two weeks, the number of daily cases are hovering around 700 to 800 on an average. The numbers have been stable even with 1.1 to 1.3 lakh tests being conducted each day, indicating that the wave has reached a plateau. “The second wave probably reached plateau phase in Telangana, which is a good sign but for it to continue we need to maintain Covid appropriate behaviour. Complete vaccination of 70 per cent of eligible population is important to prevent future waves,” said Dr Kiran Madala, in-charge head of department of critical care at Nizamabad Medical College. With more people behaving carelessly, the highly transmissible delta variant of the virus is only likely to become more active. Currently villages and mandals in eight districts in the state are seeing outbreaks, confirmed health authorities. “If the situation persists, we might see a spike in cases in the next 2-3 weeks.

The official also came down heavily on political parties for holding rallies and padayatras without taking adequate measures which can trigger a spike in infections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-19-norms-flouted-health-dept-warns-of-another-peak-in-infections/articleshow/84623697.cms||Amrita Didyala

The company said interim results of its Phase-3 clinical trials showed the drug was effective in reducing viral load in patients. The company is also all geared up to begin manufacturing Molnupiravir once it gets the EUA nod from the drug regulator, Optimus Pharma chairman & managing director Dr D Srinivasa Reddy said on Wednesday. On the Phase-3 trials, Reddy said interim results of 353 patients showed the drug was successful in reducing viral load effectively with RT-PCR negativity achieved in 78.3% patients in the test arm as compared to 48.4% in standard of care (SOC) arm on Day 5 of administering the drug. “Day 10 and 14 of the treatment duration has also given excellent results wherein remaining patients have successfully achieved RT-PCR negativity. The trial also reveals clinical improvement in health in a significantly high proportion of patients. The safety of the drug has also been established with no observed side effects, co-morbidity or morbidity observed during and after the treatment duration,” Reddy explained. The clinical trial has been conducted on 1218 patients suffering from mild Covid-19 with patients being randomised 1:1 ratio of Molnupiravir with SOC and patients only on SOC. The treatment duration was five days and the total study duration was 28 days from randomisation. The company has already developed in-house the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and formulation for Molnupiravir before obtaining the regulator’s approval for the Phase-3 trials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/optimus-pharma-seeks-nod-for-molnupiravir-eua/articleshow/84623723.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Goa||Goa: Thrust on inmates’ legal status in new prison rules||PANAJI: The newly framed prison rules stress on diversification of institutional resources to cater to the differential requirements of prisoners in terms of custody and correction. Age, sex, the legal status of the prisoner, nature of the crime, length of the sentence, security requirements, state of health and correctional methods need to be considered while segmenting prisoners in a correctional home as per the new rules. They also specify the type of separate institutional facilities for different categories of prisoners. For instance, they stipulate that undertrials and detainees be lodged in separate enclosures, away from convicted prisoners. A senior official at the Colvale Central Jail said they do keep prisoners in separate wards or annexes. Male and female inmates and those undergoing sentences for offences under the Narcotic Drug and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act are kept apart. “Any prisoner who is a trouble-maker is also isolated. However, the new prison rules are more specific,” the official said. Under the new rules, high-risk prisoners or habitual offenders have to be kept in a separate yard or an annexe. The government has also been tasked with the introduction of open prisons, semi-open prisons, and open colonies and camps. Prisoners who are substance abusers and those suffering from infectious diseases are also to be kept in different yards. The state government will further have to establish a mechanism for the classification of prisoners to be housed in various types of institutions and lay down the procedure to be followed. This should include facilities for education, vocational training and skill development programmes and cultural activities, sports activities, library, and recreation, both indoor and outdoor. Apart from the several classifications of prisons for different categories of prisoners, the new rules stipulate that there should may be three kinds of prisons: A central prison, district prisons and temporary or special prisons to deal with emergent situations. The government may, from time to time, in its discretion, declare any prison to be a central prison, district prison, or a special/temporary prison at any place. There is also a provision to install CCTV cameras within the jail’s premises, footage of which must be stored for a month. While Colvale Central Jail is yet to have this facility, the official said they are in the process of installing the cameras and work is expected to wrap up shortly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/thrust-on-inmates-legal-status-in-new-prison-rules/articleshow/84623258.cms||Bindiya Chari

Santrampur police inspector P Bhoi who is conducting investigations said that Kali had studied at a private institute 20 years ago. He added that the course was a six-month course. But despite the questions regarding her qualifications, Sangada is said to be a good nurse with a long experience. Bhoi said that Sangada was shown the video in the presence of witnesses and admitted that it was her in the video. She has been maintaining that she did not abort a foetus but cleated the womb after it was aborted somewhere else. Mahisagar district collector, meanwhile, issued a notification stating that hospitals in the district should use only qualified staff. The responsibility of the verification of their qualifications will be of the hospital administration. Strict action will be taken against the hospitals if they do not stick to the norms. Husband blames hospital Vadodara: The husband of Kali Sangada blamed the hospital where his wife worked. The police, however, said that the allegations could not be verified. Kali’s husband Vinu claimed that his wife had told him that a doctor at the hospital where she worked had asked her to perform the abortion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/abortion-video-nurses-qualifications-under-scanner/articleshow/84621770.cms||---

The cyber cell decoding the ‘IK’ has led to arrest of an illegally staying Nigerian Anthony Ivoke, who masqueraded as a cloth merchant. Ivoke is learnt to be part of a drug cartel, operating from Mumbai’s suburbs of Nalasopara and Mira-Bhayandar, having it’s tentacles spread across different cities in Maharashtra and Gujarat. City police, led by CP Amitesh Kumar, has so far seized MD drugs worth Rs50 lakh this year from 23 persons in 10 cases. “The involvement of Nigerians definitely indicates a bigger racket having supply chains in different cities,” said the CP. Earlier into online cheating called ‘Nigerian frauds’, it has come to fore now that substantial numbers of African nationals, staying illegally in India, are behind a robust drug supply rackets spread across cities like Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Nagpur, Ahmednagar and Surat, having well-oiled distribution network. The arrest of one Ankit Gupta and two others by the crime branch’s anti-narcotic cell and seizure of over 82gm of MD worth around Rs9 lakh on July 5 is learnt to have led to the arrest of a peddler Mehendi Hashmi from Kandivali in Mumbai on July 8. The action came two days after anti-narcotic cell in-charge Inspector Vishal Kale, assistant PI Suraj Suroshe, constables Nitin Mishra, Naik constables Rajesh Deshmukh and others had nabbed the culprits. During analysis of Hashmi’s cellphone, the cops had stumbled upon a coded name ‘IK’ as the supplier, who had delivered the MD consignment to him, which he later handed over to Gupta. Nagpur police’s cyber expert sub-inspector Balram Jhadokar had extracted IK’s details from the Internet. This helped the anti-narcotic cell in-charge to zero down upon him with the help of Nalasopara police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-cops-crack-ik-code-unearth-nigerian-interstate-md-racket/articleshow/84623262.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Hyderabad||Unfinished projects turning Hyderabad roads into accident-prone zones||HYDERABAD: Driving through roads that have government projects underway, has become a risky affair for Hyderabad’s commuters. When TOI drove around the city on Wednesday — a day after the Telangana high court took GHMC to task over maintaining roads only around VIP areas while leaving the rest in deplorable condition — it found that almost all roads that have government infrastructure projects underway, are ridden with potholes and uneven surfaces, putting lives of commuters in danger. In one such case, commuters were found seen trying to navigate their way out of a narrow road in Kondapur that had multiple potholes brimming with rainwater. The busy road abuts a flyover currently under construction. “This became an accident-prone zone within few weeks of the flyover work taking off. We have seen some two-wheeler riders lose their balance and fall on this road. The rains are only making it worse,” said M Suresh, a security guard stationed outside a supermarket in the area. The Radial Road 30 extension, leading from Gopanpally to Kollur, is another example. Residents and commuters said that the inordinate delay in completing the flyover work has compounded the problem. “Commuting through this road is back breaking, especially for two-wheeler riders. People living in the neighbourhood that houses 30 gated communities have to take this road to go anywhere...,” said Sunita Raghav, a resident of Gopanpally. Incidentally, during the course of the hearing on Tuesday, the court had also asked GHMC why it was taking so long to repair roads even as people were losing lives because of potholes “GHMC should identify areas which are prone to water-logging and repair them much ahead of the monsoon,” the court said. While agreeing to some damages caused due to infrastructure works, M Devanand, chief engineer (maintenance), GHMC said, “There could be some lapses here and there, but we are taking up repairs whenever we get complaints on MyGHMC app. Apart from that our Monsoon Emergency teams are constantly working to identify damaged roads and repair them. Similarly, the notified CRMP roads are being maintained by the concerned agencies who are entrusted with the job.” He added: “While we submitted one draft to court on repairs, another on waterlogging and other issues will be submitted to the Chief Justice in two weeks time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/unfinished-projects-turning-city-roads-into-accident-prone-zones/articleshow/84623822.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Coimbatore||Dist sees threefold increase in Covid cases in second wave||Coimbatore: The second Covid-19 wave, which was deadlier than the first wave and saw desperate cries for oxygen, would hopefully be behind us soon. While the district continues to log more than 200 fresh cases a day, it seems to be only a matter of time before the number hits double and single digit. Compared to the first wave, as per the data available with us, the district has already reported thrice the number of cases and twice the number of deaths in the brutal second wave. What doctors and epidemiologists fear is further mutations of the virus which may become more transmissible and attack hosts who are yet to be inoculated during the anticipated third wave. While the district recorded hardly 60,000 positive cases and 694 fatalities over a span of a year in the first wave, it had logged 1.68 lakh positive cases and 1,440 deaths in less than four months in the second wave, which began on April 1. It is to be noted that the second wave is not over yet and the district continues to report a few hundred fresh cases and four to five fatalities daily. Virologists and epidemiologists attribute the spike in caseload to the increased transmissibility of the mutated versions of the virus. Dr K Kolandasamy, member of an expert advisory panel on Covid-19, says, “It is already an accepted and proven fact that the new infectious variants of Covid-19 emerged during the second wave, leading to large family clusters and pushing the number of cases up.” Dr Varun Sundaramoorthy, infectious diseases expert, Kovai Medical Center and Hospital, said the new variants were affecting people’s lungs faster, causing more severe infections among youngsters. Doctors fear that the third wave might be more intense and brutal. “It’s natural for a virus to constantly mutate. If it is present, it will keep finding new hosts to attack,” says Dr K Rajendran, secretary, Indian Academy of Pediatricians, Tamil Nadu. “So, while we suspect it may start attacking children, who are not vaccinated against the virus, it may mutate to attack even non-vaccinated adults, who are considerable in number in the country.” Dr T Mariappan, epidemiologist and retired ICMR scientist, says vaccination or advance protection from any form of Covid-19 variants must be taken by the people ahead of the third wave. “This can help prevent or minimize the virus transmission by adults who are moving around, while protecting them and children from more mutated versions of the virus.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dist-sees-threefold-increase-in-covid-cases-in-second-wave/articleshow/84623264.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Taliban link suspected to drug mules caught in Hyderabad, other airports||HYDERABAD: A Taliban link to drug smuggling to the West via Hyderabad and other Indian cities has emerged in the probe by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI). Heroin consignments are frequently being caught at airports in the past few weeks, with three cases in Hyderabad alone. It is suspected that heroin is sourced from Afghanistan and destined to Australia and other western countries via Mozambique, Johannesburg, Doha, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and New Delhi. In all the three cases booked in Hyderabad, mules from African countries travelled from Johannesburg. “High-quality heroin, a trademark of Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, is being smuggled to Mozambique. From there, it goes to Johannesburg, Doha and then to Indian cities, and is further destined to Australia and other countries. They (smugglers) are avoiding South Africans and using other African nationals to avoid agencies in Johannesburg. While the Taliban is the source, the operation is done by African drug cartels. What is caught at the airports could be the tip of the iceberg. Seaports are the real concern,” a senior DRI official told TOI. The official further added: “Drug traffickers are using circuitous routes to reach Australia, the US and Europe from Afghanistan. Drug consignment reaches Pakistan’s southwest coast from Afghanistan and is taken on small boats to the Mozambique coast. It is not possible to detect the movement of these boats using satellite imagery either. From Mozambique it finally reaches Johannesburg by road.” In the latest case in Hyderabad, on July 19, a Zambian was arrested at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) with 3.2 kg of heroin worth Rs 21 crore. On June 21, DRI seized 3 kg of heroin worth Rs 19.5 crore from a Tanzanian male passenger arriving from Johannesburg via Doha. On June 6, 12 kg of heroin worth Rs 78 crore was seized at the airport from two woman passengers from Uganda and Zambia, who were also travelling from Johannesburg via Doha. “As the consignment moves on, adulteration happens with talc and lactose being mixed. It is very difficult to find it in scanning as they are wrapped in black covers. Only thing is profiling. African passengers travelling from Johannesburg by Qatar Airways are suspected as potential mules. From Hyderabad, they are again sent through air route to the West,” said a customs official at RGIA airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/taliban-link-to-drug-mules-from-africa-caught-in-hyd/articleshow/84624294.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Mumbai||CET, academic year uncertainty trigger rush to non-state boards for Class XI||Mumbai: The city’s high schools affiliated to national and international boards have seen robust admissions to Class XI this academic year. Blame it on the state government’s plan to conduct the post-Class X Common Entrance Test (CET) and to give preference to students who take it for admissions to junior colleges or the expected delay in starting the academic year, enrolment in other non-Maharashtra board institutes has increased, say educationists. Classes for Grade XI in ISC, CBSE, the IBDP programme and Cambridge AS levels in most schools have already begun or start in early August. “In most schools, we are seeing students have continued in the same system. There is no certainty over CET and when the results will be out and admissions will begin,” said Kavita Aggarwal, chairman, Members of International Schools’ Association. At Podar School, CBSE Class XI has seen an around 12% increase in enrolment compared with the previous year, but admissions are still on, said principal Suman Samarth. Several ICSE schools that do not offer the advanced ISC schooling saw students opt for other schools where seats were unfilled. “A lot of our students have genuinely come back to me. We have filled 100% of our seats and have not been able to offer admission to many outsiders,” said Sulochanadevi Singhania School head Revathi Srinivasan. Similarly, Kavita Sanghvi, principal of Chhatrabhuj Narsee Memorial School, said, “This year we have begun our second division for ISC commerce as there has been a great demand for admission. Where we had 30 students per class, we now have nearly double.” Little wonder then that students from schools such as NES National Public School that do not have ISC (Class XI and XII) have seen a “sizable” share of students apply to other ISC schools or decide on CET. “The CET is not going to be a fair testing ground as ICSE students may have dropped some subjects, and social studies of the two boards are very different,” said Balasubramanian V, director, National Education Society. “We have had better enrolment levels, slightly more than last year. We have more enrolment from outside. I feel that is so because students want to pursue the DP programme at D Y Patil International School. A handful are preparing for CET. But it would help if the government took different exams for every board,” said D Y Patil International School head Kinnari Shah. With CET preparations on, several quick reference guides have hit the market. “Coaching classes also offer packages. If students join a tutorial for two years, XI and XII, crash courses for CET are free,” said Jinesh Shah of Maharashtra Coaching Classes Owners’ Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cet-academic-year-uncertainty-trigger-rush-to-non-state-boards-for-class-xi/articleshow/84621195.cms||---

There are also complaints of people developing rashes on their ears for wearing the mask incorrectly. “We are still seeing patients wearing the mask at the neck or chin level. Worse, patients’ attendants are turning up without a mask while accompanying Covid-19 patients,” said Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Reseach superintendent, Dr Ehsan Ahmed Khan. State health authorities admit that compliance to mask protocol has dropped from close to 100% to 60% now. “Even among the remaining lot, many have been wearing it incorrectly so that brings down the numbers even further,” said Telangana director of public health Dr G Srinivasa Rao.The confidence, post-vaccination, is also turning into a hurdle while convincing people to adhere to the norm, said a resident doctor at Gandhi Hospital. “We have been handing out masks whenever we see an attendant walk in without one.... Still, they are reluctant to wear it, especially if they are vaccinated,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wear-masks-even-if-vaccinated-docs/articleshow/84623707.cms||Amrita Didyala

The accused was caught along with his girlfriend by the detection of crime branch (DCB) sleuths who also recovered the looted vehicle near Boriyach toll plaza of Navsari. Police arrested Kashyap Bhesaniya, a resident of Puna area, while his girlfriend was allowed to go as she was not part of the loot plan. Police recovered Rs 2.26 lakh in cash from the car. Bhesaniya told the police that he was planning to settle down in Kanpur with his girlfriend and so, he looted the car. Complainant in the case, Manoj Jain had gone to buy medicines at Aagam Arcade in Vesu. He had parked the car on the road, while his 77-year-old father, Kapurchand Jain, was sitting inside the car. Suddenly, Bhesaniya opened the door of the car and sat in the driver’s seat. He told Kapurchand to get down. However, when the elderly man refused and put the vehicle in gear to prevent loot, Bhesaniya started driving the car. Fearing that he will be kidnapped, Kapurchand got out from the moving car and in the process suffered injuries. Later, the accused picked up his girlfriend from a distance and the duo went towards Navsari on national highway 48. Police had kept a watch on the highways and the car was stopped at Boriyach toll plaza. “Bhesaniya wanted to get married with his classmate, but their families were not agreeing looking at their young age. They are from the same caste and family members told them to complete studies before settling down,” said a crime branch officer. The duo had developed friendship a few months ago. Bhesaniya, son of a diamond artisan, invested in stocks, said cops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/it-engg-held-for-looting-car-to-elope-lover-goes-free/articleshow/84622051.cms||---
---||Mumbai||To avert roadkill, no fruit-bearing trees along the Nagpur e-way||MUMBAI: Maharashtra’s upcoming Rs 55,000-crore prosperity corridor, India’s much-touted longest and fastest super communication highway between Mumbai and Nagpur named after Balasaheb Thackeray, will have thick plantation on either side but minus 13 fruit-bearing plant varieties. The first 520km stretch may be commissioned in a few months. A communique by the office of MSRDC minister Eknath Shinde stated that they will not plant fruit-bearing trees such mango, orange, dates, cashew and jamun along the 700km super expressway. This, sources said, was mainly to avoid attracting animals such as monkeys, and birds that may get crushed under the wheels, and thus disturb their habitat. Wildlife Institute of India is helping the administration create a highway ecosystem. The planting of 13 types of fruit trees that attract wildlife has been prohibited. On both sides, 11.3 lakh trees will be planted. Water will be supplied through drip irrigation and other internal sources powered by solar pumps in areas with little rainfall. Tree-planting will help alleviate effects of global warming and climate change. After plantation, they will be looked after for five years, the release said. The highway is being designed to avoid disturbing animal activity in surrounding areas. There are 96 wildlife structures, which include seven overpass bridges, 89 underpasses, box culverts, and a few bridges, being created to facilitate passage of wildlife around Samruddhi Mahamarg. The cost of safeguarding wildlife is projected to be over Rs 326 crore. The highway will traverse through 10 districts, six talukas, and 392 villages, covering the distance between Nagpur-Mumbai in eight hours, allowing vehicles to travel at a speed of 150kph. The distance is now covered in 16 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-to-avert-roadkill-no-fruit-bearing-trees-along-the-nagpur-e-way/articleshow/84624293.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

The optional exams were cancelled twice this year due to the second wave of the pandemic. Considering third wave fears, though, parents are reluctant to make their children appear for the two papers of 90 minutes each. “Though the two papers will be held in gaps, children will be in exam centres for a couple of hours. I would rather give the physical exam a miss than risk it,” said a parent of a Class V student. Another parent said only after the state comes out with a preparedness plan for exam centres will she take a call on whether to send her son to write the Class VIII tests. The exams were first scheduled in April. Then they were pushed to May 23. Teachers had threatened to boycott the exams, which were cancelled. On Tuesday, the state issued a fresh order. A total 6.3 lakh students from 47,662 schools have registered for the exams. Of these, 3.9 lakh are in Class V and 2.4 lakh in Class VIII. The state gives scholarship to 100 students each from Class V and VIII in every district. A Class V student gets Rs 1,000 annually till Class VII. Likewise, a Class VIII student gets Rs 1,000 each year till Class X. The amount is deposited in the student’s bank account. Though the exams conducted by Maharashtra State Council of Examination aim to encourage students from impoverished backgrounds, they have many takers among private schools too. “Getting a state scholarship is a moment of pride for students as well as schools. It adds to the academic excellence of students,” said a Worli school principal. Civic, zilla parishad and government schools, too, prepare students for the exams. “The scholarship amount should be increased to encourage more students to attempt these,” said a civic education inspector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-1st-offline-exam-this-year-state-scholarship-tests-for-v-viii/articleshow/84621330.cms||Sandhya Nair

This is the parking fee that was being collected in single screen theatres, which will resume now. Accepting one of the many demands of the film industry, the government has issued orders allowing theatres to charge parking fee. A GO (dated July 20), however, made it clear that parking fee cannot be collected in multiplexes and theatres located in commercial complexes. The government said single screen theatres were being allowed to collect the parking fee for the safety of vehicles of filmgoers. It was also pointed out that those who were not coming to the theatres were parking their vehicles in theatres and maintaining the parking premises and ensuring the safety of vehicles had become an issue for theatre owners. “It has been a long-pending demand and theatres can get some income from it,” secretary of Telangana Film Chamber of Commerce M Vijendar Reddy said. Though the state government had lifted the lockdown on June 20, film theatre owners did not open the screens as they wanted the government to issue GOs on some of the demands, including parking fee, it had agreed upon. On July 23, some of the film theatres in the city are expected to reopen.

This has resulted in a sharp surge in the positive cases, causing concern among farm experts and officials. As many as 29 farm labourers have tested positive for Covid-19 in Jagtial district alone. With many of them travelling together in autos or other means of transport and not maintaining social distance, Covid-19 cases have seen a jump in recent times. Sarpanch Mallavva of Muddutla village in Malyala mandal organised a testing camp in the village after some farm labourers had shown Covid-19 symptoms. As many as 10 of them who had travelled in packed autos tested positive. Of 130 people tested in the village, 29 tested positive. The village is now in a ‘self-imposed’ lockdown till July-end. It is during the beginning of the kharif season that farm labourers are most sought after. This is also the time when they earn good wages. “Since they are in demand, they will prefer to go where they are likely to get more wages. They travel in groups in order to save money,” Ponnam Satyanarayana, a native of Jagtial, said. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research has advised that farmers take necessary precautions and safety measures to prevent the spread of the virus. It said social distancing norms should be followed and farm workers should maintain personal hygiene, wear face masks and also clean implements and machinery. It was also advised that farm workers should maintain a distance of three to four feet among themselves while partaking meals or engaged in work. “There is no negligence on the part of the farm workers. We have seen that they do take care. However, there could be some compulsions arising out of the economic crisis that force them to travel together,” GV Ramanjaneyulu of Centre for Sustainable Agriculture said. “Farm workers need protection against Covid-19 and authorities must see to it that they are inoculated,” he said. Senior officials of the agriculture department said the farm workers must follow all Covid-19 precautions and norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/monsoon-sees-spurt-in-covid-cases-among-farm-labourers/articleshow/84623736.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The council also directed the colleges to display the fee payment schedule on the notice board and also communicate the same through email. “AICTE is in continuous receipt of grievances from students regarding insistence by institutes for paying the full year in one go. Upon considering the current state of the country during an ongoing national emergency due to the second wave of Covid-19 outbreak, guidelines are being reissued by the AICTE for strict compliance by all colleges/institutions,” read a release from AICTE. The council also directed the colleges not to terminate any faculty without enough disciplinary ground and due process of redressal. “Salary and other dues to the faculty/staff members should be released monthly on time. The terminations made during the lockdown, if any, should be withdrawn,” the circular added. The faculty working in technical colleges, meanwhile, said AICTE should ensure that guidelines are strictly followed by the colleges. “The council has been issuing circulars, but the same is not strictly implemented. During the pandemic, scores of them have been terminated and colleges are not paying salaries. Not many colleges are providing an option to pay fees in multiple instalments,” said A Santosh Kumar, president, Telangana School’s Technical Colleges’ Employees Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/aicte-directs-colleges-not-to-insist-on-payment-of-full-fees/articleshow/84623882.cms||---

When their mother approached the Abhayam 181 helpline on Wednesday to seek help in getting the girls back from her parents’ home, the girls refused to go with her. “It was an unusual case for us where the children don’t want to unite with their parents — as we are used to children yearning to go with them if they are separated by circumstance,” said a counsellor. “The girls alleged that due to their births, their mother faced ill-treatment from their father. They would thus run away to their maternal grandparents’ home.” The girls were also reportedly subjected to beatings if they didn’t help with domestic chores. They were also labelled unlucky (manhoos) which was too much for them, and prompted them to flee from their home often. “We counselled the parents and also warned them of legal action if they treat the children in this manner. We have also counselled the girls to give their parents a chance,” said a counsellor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/parents-consider-us-girls-to-be-unlucky/articleshow/84623275.cms||---

The CM said that over the next six months, the department of information technology will identify the e-governance requirements of various departments and allot projects to empanelled IT firms. Sawant also said that all pending benefits for IT companies and startups under the Goa IT Policy, 2018, and the Goa Startup Policy, 2017, will be released in August and September respectively. “We have started empanelling software companies to develop solutions for the government,” said Sawant in an online interaction with Goa Technology Association (GTA). “Till now, we used to outsource all the e-governance solutions to GEL, but now we will give the companies enlisted with the Info Tech Corporation of Goa.” Former GTA president Mangirish Salelkar said that the IT sector continues to struggle with reliable internet and power supply. Sawant said that the issues were being looked into. Salelkar also pointed out that the 14 IT companies that sought benefits under the Goa IT Policy, 2018, have yet to see any incentives being disbursed. He also said that several startups are waiting for incentives to be disbursed. “We have processed the 14 applications and the applications have been sent to the high powered committee,” said Sawant. “By next month, they will be sanctioned. I have given instructions that the pending disbursements under the startup policy be cleared by September.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-to-outsource-e-gov-projects-to-local-it-cos-cm/articleshow/84623268.cms||---

The patient is on life support. His wife had moved the Gujarat HC on Monday, pleading that his sperm be preserved so that she can conceive through IVF if he does not make it. She had to move the court as the pending Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill stipulates that no man’s sperm can be obtained without his consent. The hospital management had insisted on a court order in the absence of consent. After hearing the plea, the HC on Tuesday directed the Sterling Hospital to preserve the sperm. It had initially declined her request because the patient is in no condition to give consent. He has been hit by multiple organ failure. “In line with procedure, we counselled the wife,” said Anil Nambiar, zonal director of Sterling Hospitals. “The testicular sperm extraction was started at about 8pm and the surgical procedure ended at about 8.30pm. The sperm has been extracted and preserved in the lab, he said, adding that the sperm can be preserved for long. The court has, however, not granted permission to proceed with artificial insemination till further orders. It is likely to hear the case on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/man-on-deathbed-wife-gets-sperm-preserved/articleshow/84624878.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Wife ailing, man recovers Rs 33 lakh lost in con||MUMBAI: A Borivli resident, Mahesh Gupta (47), who had been duped of Rs 32.69 lakh, got it back on Wednesday after the cyber police solved the case and expedited the recovery of funds. Gupta needed the money urgently for the medical treatment of his wife who has a kidney ailment, and is bed-ridden. Gupta had been duped allegedly by aspiring actor Apurva Ashwin Dowda (47), who had promised to get his daughter a role in a film. Gupta said he had paid the money after selling his flat in Mira Road and his car. Dowda, who is currently in jail, has allegedly duped at least 80 people from whom he has siphoned off Rs 2 crore in the last four years, the police said. His bank account has been frozen and the money of the people duped has been locked in since his arrest. Cyber police officials, on learning that Gupta’s wife is ailing, sped up formalities with the court and completed procedures within a month which helped Gupta get his money. A police case had been registered in January after Gupta realised that he has been duped. Gupta had made an online transfer to Dowda, who holds an MBA degree from the US and has acted in many advertising films. The police said that he took to crime to fund a lavish lifestyle. “The matter was sped up and court procedures completed after we learnt that Gupta had been facing a financial crisis. His wife is ailing and he needs the money for treatment,” said deputy commissioner of police (Cyber) Rashmi Karandikar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-wife-ailing-man-recovers-rs-33l-lost-in-con/articleshow/84623889.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

The district has the highest number of active cases in the state. While the district had tested 2,27,467 people positive for the virus till date, 2,22,801 of them have recovered. The recovery rate now stands at 97.9%. The Covid-19 toll has gone up to 2,141 with one more patient succumbing to the virus in the district. The test positivity rate, meanwhile, fell to 2.3% with only 204 of the 9,004 samples testing positive for the virus. The number of containment zones in the district has also come down to 45 from 94 last week. While 20 of them are in city corporation limits Karamadai alone accounts for eight containment zones. The remaining zones are scattered around Thudiyalur, Sulur and SS Kulam. While the recovery rate is improving, the survival rate of mucormycosis (black fungus) continues to be low.

On Tuesday evening, a former tehsildar of Uthukuli taluk lost her life to the dreaded fungal infection in a private hospital in Tirupur. Health department officials said 53-year-old K Kalavathi had tested positive for Covid-19 in the last week of May and was admitted to the Government Erode Medical College and Hospital at Perundurai. “She was referred to a private hospital on Perumanallur Road in Tirupur after she developed symptoms of mucormycosis. She died after a fortnight of medical treatment,” an official said. She is the first one to die of mucormycosis in Tirupur since the pandemic hit. While Tirupur had recorded 14 cases of black fungus, 13 have reportedly recovered. Kalavathi had served Uthukuli taluk as tehsildar from March to May this year.

Close on the heels of at least six human kills in Chandrapur district this month, one more person was mauled by a tiger in the Goregaon forest range under the Gondia forest division. The victim has been identified as Punaji Mohan Meshram (61), a resident of Bhadanga. He had gone to collect fodder for cattle heads when he was attacked. The sub-adult tiger has separated from its mother T-14 and is moving in search of new territory. Earlier, the sub-adult tiger had injured one person from Janatola. According to forest sources, the victim was warned not to venture into the forest following the presence of a tiger but Meshram did not pay heed and was attacked after walking over 300 metres inside the forest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/man-killed-in-tiger-attack-in-goregaon/articleshow/84623283.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Scores rush to non-state boards for Class XI||MUMBAI: The city’s high schools affiliated to national and international boards have seen robust admissions to Class XI this academic year. Blame it on the state government’s plan to conduct the post-Class X Common Entrance Test (CET) and to give preference to students who take it for admissions to junior colleges or the expected delay in starting the academic year, enrolment in other non-Maharashtra board institutes has increased, say educationists. Classes for Grade XI in ISC, CBSE, the IBDP programme and Cambridge AS levels in most schools have already begun or start in early August. “In most schools, we are seeing students have continued in the same system. There is no certainty over CET and when the results will be out and admissions will begin,” said Kavita Aggarwal, chairman, Members of International Schools’ Association. At Podar School, CBSE Class XI has seen an around 12% increase in enrolment compared with the previous year, but admissions are still on, said principal Suman Samarth. Several ICSE schools that do not offer the advanced ISC schooling saw students opt for other schools where seats were unfilled. “A lot of our students have genuinely come back to me. We have filled 100% of our seats and have not been able to offer admission to many outsiders,” said Sulochanadevi Singhania School head Revathi Srinivasan. Similarly, Kavita Sanghvi, principal of Chhatrabhuj Narsee Memorial School, said, “This year we have begun our second division for ISC commerce as there has been a great demand for admission. Where we had 30 students per class, we now have nearly double.” Little wonder then that students from schools such as NES National Public School that do not have ISC (Class XI and XII) have seen a “sizable” share of students apply to other ISC schools or decide on CET. “The CET is not going to be a fair testing ground as ICSE students may have dropped some subjects, and social studies of the two boards are very different,” said Balasubramanian V, director, National Education Society. “We have had better enrolment levels, slightly more than last year. We have more enrolment from outside. I feel that is so because students want to pursue the DP programme at D Y Patil International School. A handful are preparing for CET. But it would help if the government took different exams for every board,” said D Y Patil International School head Kinnari Shah. With CET preparations on, several quick reference guides have hit the market. “Coaching classes also offer packages. If students join a tutorial for two years, XI and XII, crash courses for CET are free,” said Jinesh Shah of Maharashtra Coaching Classes Owners’ Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-scores-rush-to-non-state-boards-for-class-xi/articleshow/84624308.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Cop faces domestic violence case, son Section 377||AHMEDABAD: A police inspector faces a case of domestic violence in connection with the disappearance of his daughter-in-law a week ago. Krishnanagar police registered the case of domestic violence against the in-laws of Sonal Gadhvi late on Tuesday. Her husband faces the additional charge of unnatural sex (IPC Section 377). Girishdan Gadhvi, Sonal’s father, in his seven-page FIR said that his daughter had left a suicide note in which she described the mental and physical torture meted out by her husband and in-laws. Police registered the case based on the suicide note and an audio message that Sonal had sent to her family. In his complaint, Gadhvi said that his daughter was tortured for giving birth to a girl. He said she was treated as a domestic maid and made to toil. Gadhvi said that he had given a substantial dowry, including a refrigerator and household items, after his daughter gave birth to a boy. He stated that his son-in-law, Dharmendra Gadhvi, had quit his job and had started a business. Girishdan Gadhvi told police that he was made to pay the electricity bills of his son-in-law’s business establishment. He further said that he was told to get a house for his daughter. He did so and the couple started living in it. Gadhvi stated his daughter used to endure the torture to sustain the marriage. “Her father-in-law, police inspector Pratapdan Gadhvi, was caught in an ACB trap,” he said. “Her in-laws said my daughter had brought bad luck.” Gadhvi said that his son-in-law used to watch porn and forced Sonal to play out the actions seen in the clips. The inspector of Krishnanagar police station, A J Chauhan, confirmed that the case was filed based on the suicide note and the audio clip. Meanwhile, the fate of Sonal is still unknown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cop-faces-dv-case-son-section-377/articleshow/84623280.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi HC orders CBI probe into Tihar inmate’s murder, needle of suspicion on jail staff||New Delhi: An undertrial prisoner killed just before he was to walk out of Tihar Jail on bail, a call by another inmate to a PCR van informing about the attack, and the needle of suspicion on jail officials — these facts have prompted Delhi high court to order a CBI investigation into the matter. Justice Mukta Gupta on Tuesday transferred the probe into the death of Shreekant to the CBI after the jail authorities admitted there was no CCTV footage of the incident. The court also found that Shreekant had allegedly called his sister just a day before the incident in May and claimed he feared he would be murdered by jail officers. “Further, at the time of incident itself, a PCR call was received from the jail, which was not from the officers of the jail,” the court noted, while hearing the plea of the victim’s mother. The caller, it added, claimed that Shreekant had got murdered by a deputy superintendent, who assaulted both him and the deceased with sticks a day before the incident. The court then noted the caller as saying that “My brother has been moved to DDU Hospital, name Shreekant Rama Swami; my brother has been murdered.” Appearing for her, senior advocate Ramesh Gupta questioned the claim of the jail authorities that Shreekant had died due to injuries from a brawl with other inmates in his barrack and cited the photos and videos of the body with deep cuts on his thighs and hands. Gupta argued that these could not be caused by a cricket bat as claimed by the jail administration and could have been inflicted only by a sharp object. When the court sought CCTV details, the director general, prisons said CCTVs were being upgraded and the project had been going slow due to Covid-19. The court wondered why no proper investigation could be carried out despite the fact that a PCR call was made from the jail. “As per the status report filed by the jail superintendent, there was no apparent injury on the deceased; however, the case of the petitioner is that there were deep injury marks on the deceased and an in-depth investigation is required to find out the circumstances under which the deceased made a phone call to his sister... and his subsequent death in the judicial custody,” the court said while transferring the case. It said there was “no investigation” on why the victim had called her sister apprehending his murder, “nor has the mobile of the sister been taken nor have the call records been analysed which would have revealed something nor has any investigation been carried out from the call records of the mobile number from which the PCR call was made”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-orders-cbi-probe-into-tihar-inmates-murder-needle-of-suspicion-on-jail-staff/articleshow/84623342.cms||Abhinav Garg

---||Goa||Goa: For Guirim locals hit by floods, worse lies ahead||PANAJI: The family of Vishnu Arjun Kaskar in Guirim was clueless about the hardships to come when the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Panaji, sounded an orange alert for Goa last week. With the rain pounding ceaselessly, water began gushing into his house. The road, fields, low-lying areas of Guirim had suddenly turned into a vast water body. Many locals found themselves stranded inside their homes, with few using canoes as transportation out of Guirim. But some like Kaskar were rendered a double blow. Not only did his house flood, the paddy he sowed has also been mostly likely destroyed, something that will be confirmed only once the water subsides. With the IMD expecting heavy rainfall up to July 23, it appears Guirim residents have a long struggle ahead of them. “I lost a part of my house at first to highway expansion work and now water flows into my home during the monsoon. Never had we witnessed this before in our lifetime. This flooding has started only after the highway expansion work has begun. Our crops too, are completely submerged. How is a poor man like me to survive,” Vishnu said. He said the pipes installed during the highway expansion work to drain water are clogged with bottles and other litter, which has caused the flooding. Last week, during an inspection, chief minister Pramod Sawant himself admitted that the flooding was a ‘man-made disaster’ and had directed WRD to desilt the nullahs. But the PWD, under which the highway expansion work is being carried out, are not be let off lightly either, Guirim residents said. “When the highway expansion work began in 2017, Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte as well as Saligao MLA Jayesh Salgaonkar were ministers and I had written to them urging them to inspect the highway work. The culverts were being buried. In their place, narrow pipes have been installed which are not sufficient for the water to flow out. Today, even these pipes are clogged, as a result of which we are facing flooding like never before,” panch member of Sangolda panchayat, Premanand Kotrekar said. The Government High School, Namoshi, Guirim, was also flooded. The school structure also sustained damage due to the heavy rainfall. “We have been asked to raise the level of the highway by five to six inches,” a PWD official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/for-guirim-locals-hit-by-floods-worse-lies-ahead/articleshow/84623289.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

The incident created ripples as the dream project worth crores was showcased as one of the biggest such facilities in Asia. Senior officials visited or reviewed the condition at the galleries, said sources. Thousands of Amdavadis have been lining up daily to view the gallery since its inauguration last week. An official statement from Marinescape, operators of the gallery, termed the reports incorrect. ‘We wish to reiterate that there are over 11,000 fish in the Aquatics Gallery and many of the images that are being circulated are not of dead fish but of nocturnal fish or those that may be asleep. In the event of any failure of life support system in a particular tank, all the fishes would have been affected, but that did not take place in any of the tanks. Also, the images of the dead species shown in one of the locations is that of the fish food storage room where usually the fish feed is stored in a frozen form,’ read the statement. Sources said that there could well be some mortality, but lack of oxygen or change of habitat are not the reasons. Some fish have shorter life spans, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/images-of-dead-fish-go-viral-aquarium-operators-nix-claims/articleshow/84623294.cms||---

---||Kolkata||CISCE, CBSE will not scrap formula to match state marks||Kolkata: The cent percent success rate in Madhyamik and the record high scores may be repeated in the results of Higher Secondary, the Class XII state board. But that is unlikely to prompt either the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) or Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) to scrap their formula and come up with high scores for their Class X and XII board results. Last year, HS students had an advantage in college admission as their scores were way above that of CBSE and ISC students as the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education gave full marks in papers that were cancelled due to the pandemic. While they recognized the need for parity in marks across all boards, CBSE and CISCE school heads maintained their boards would stick to the formula of taking the schools’ past performances and setting a benchmark to stop inflation of marks. School principals pointed out this year’s system could not be compared with that of last year as in 2020, most papers were over before the pandemic struck. The average of best written performance was considered only in a handful of subjects that had to be cancelled. This year, the entire exam was cancelled, and hence, the results now depends on the formula adopted by the boards. Unless there was parity, it would again lead to skewed results and difficulty for CBSE and CISCE students to enter the higher education portals, school heads said. . “The CBSE system automatically checks unbridled marking. The moment some schools started giving 96% and above, the board asked them to re-check. The result will have to tally with the past performance records of the school and that will again be balanced with the concept of the reference year. You can’t suddenly have an excellent batch,” said Lakshmipat Singhania Academy director Meena Kak. A circular from CBSE on Wednesday extended the deadline for submitting moderated marks of Class XII board examinees from July 22 to July 25. CBSE is unlikely to declare a 100% pass percentage as it had indicated that for those scoring below 33%, a separate evaluation through an exam might be organised. CISCE, too, is factoring in schools’ past performances and the details of the best years are being compared with current marks. “This will help draw up an objective tally. I am against giving 100% marks to students. In the Senior Cambridge system, there were points, later grades options also came in. A percentile approach is the best way to deal to the problem. Exam reforms were required for long and the pandemic has induced it,” said Modern High School director Devi Kar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cisce-cbse-will-not-scrap-formula-to-match-state-marks/articleshow/84623295.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Her sister registered a complaint against the victim’s underage boyfriend, following which he was held on charges of rape and suicide abetment. He was produced before a court for juveniles and sent to Dongri observation home on Tuesday. Police said the class XII student lived with relatives in Central Mumbai. Her father passed away and her mother lived separately with her partner. The older sister is the only earning member in the family. On July 19, the girl left home under the pretext of work but headed to the tracks. Around 9am, she jumped on the tracks between Nahur and Mulund stations. She suffered head injuries from stones on the tracks. Passersby alerted GRP, who took her to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. An autopsy revealed she was five months’ pregnant. Police did not find a suicide note but found her phone and contacted her family. The family said they were not aware of her pregnancy. Charges under POCSO were applied on her boyfriend, besides IPC sections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-girl-upset-over-her-pregnancy-dies-by-suicide-on-rly-tracks/articleshow/84623894.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Nearly two-third of Nagpur roads dotted with potholes, craters||NAGPUR: It is a cause of concern that nearly two-thirds of the road length in the city is in a bad shape. About 64.45% of Nagpur’s cumulative 1,491.19km tar roads have either developed potholes or their surface is completely worn off due to non-maintenance. The eight zones of Nagpur city traffic police (Lakadganj, Sakkardara, Ajni, Sonegaon, Sitabuldi, Sadar and Indora) have also endorsed this. Cops from these zones admit that the condition of tar roads across the corporation limits is bad, with either potholes or nothing left of the surface of roads. Data obtained from NMC revealed that the total length of city roads is around 2,313.65km, of which around 700km of road length has been cemented, while around 150km of roads are kuccha. TOI drove around the city, and found merit in the traffic cops’ claim and experienced a bumpy rides due to pothole-ridden roads across many areas. As rains arrived in the city, small potholes turned bigger, and the bigger ones turned into craters on many major and internal roads, posing a threat to motorists. So much so that two in every three tar roads in the city is in a bad shape, said traffic cops. Tar roads even in Civil Lines are in a bad condition. The condition is so severe that the surface layer between Variety Square and Ravi Nagar Square is visible only in some parts. Corporators alleged that the ruling BJP has no control over NMC. Citing an example, they said recently mayor Dayashankar Tiwari had directed the hotmix department to ensure city roads are pothole free. “Despite this, tar roads in most of the city are in bad shape,” said Congress corporator Bhawna Lonare. Senior corporator Abha Pande claimed NMC never undertakes any survey to identify potholes. “We cannot expect the civic body to carry out patchwork of potholed roads,” she claimed. Citing an example, Pande said the Mahdibagh flyover patch too has potholes. “Just imagine if a major road is in such a condition, we cannot expect internal roads to be in good shape,” she said. Congress corporator Darshani Dhawad claimed that from early this year she had been following up with the NMC hotmix department regarding bad patches of tar roads in west Nagpur. “But so far no action has been initiated to address the bad patches of roads in my prabhag,” a miffed Dhawad said. TOI had recently highlighted how a local NGO – Janhit – collected donations to repair potholed roads in Surendragadh after the civic body did not act upon citizens’ complaints regarding potholed roads. Janhit founder Abhijit Jha blamed the civic administration and elected representatives for the poor condition of tar roads. “Nagpur city is witnessing many major infrastructure works like Metro Rail, construction of flyovers and is considered one of the fastest developing cities. But the condition of the city’s roads is often not in sync with these tags. From crater-like potholes to carelessly strewn gravel, Nagpur has many such roads that pose a threat to motorists,” said Paramjeet Singh Kalsi, a resident of east Nagpur. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari was not available for comment. Superintending engineer Ajay Pohekar claimed that NMC is repairing potholes as and when it receives complaints. He, however, pointed out that city roads are owned by different agencies, but everyone blames NMC for potholed roads. However, Pohekar admitted that major portion of the city roads are owned by the civic body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nearly-2/3rd-of-city-roads-dotted-with-potholes-craters/articleshow/84623306.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The cop was suspended five days ago after an internal inquiry following a complaint by the woman but it came to light after she attempted suicide at Parade Grounds on Tuesday. The woman, who cut her wrists with a blade, was taken to hospital by cops and is now out of danger. According to Begumpet police, the 35-year-old woman, a divorcee, had accused SI Madhu of marrying her by concealing that he was already married and exploiting her financially. The relationship had begun while the SI was posted at Chilakalguda. A cheating case was registered by Begumpet police.

---||Nagpur||Wildlife nod must to upgrade railway line through Amravati's Melghat: Piyush Goyal||NAGPUR: Even as Amravati MP Navneet Rana is pitching for up-gradation of meter-gauge railway line through Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR) in Amravati district, railway minister Piyush Goyal has made it clear that the stalled work in the section through the reserve cannot be taken up without obtaining wildlife clearances. The fact was made clear on July 5, 2021, by Goyal himself in a letter written to Rana, who had raised the issue in Lok Sabha on September 22, 2020, demanding early completion of Akola-Khandwa gauge conversion project and operation of Shakuntala railway line. Goyal has said, of the 173.59km Akola-Khandwa gauge conversion project, work on Akola-Akot (44km) section has been completed. Work in Amalakhurd-Khandwa (53km) section has been taken up on land available, while work in Akot-Amalakhurd (77km) section has been held up for wildlife clearance. Talking to TOI, Rana confirmed the communication from Goyal and said she will continue to push for the up-gradation of the railway line through the tiger reserve as it benefits many tribal villages. “I’m really surprised when earlier committees and even forest department approved the project, why a U-turn was taken? I will follow up on the issue,” she said. Amid confusion whether the railways need clearances as it is upgrading the line in its right of way (ROW), this is the first time that railway minister has come on record that wildlife clearance is mandatory for taking up stalled work in tiger reserve section. As reported on July 14, 2020, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has already rejected the proposal, asking the BJP government at the Centre to work out alternative alignment while upgrading the railway line through MTR. Thackeray had made it clear to Goyal that “considering the long-term irreversible impacts of gauge conversion on endangered species like tiger and its habitat, it would be appropriate to focus on alternative alignment.” Thackeray further pointed out, “We as a nation have been showcasing the achievements of ‘Project Tiger’ to the world and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has himself said that ‘conservation of tigers is not a choice but an imperative. Hence, alternate alignment of the railway line from outside the tiger reserve should be supported.” Even three-time Shiv Sena MP from Buldhana Prataprao Jadhav, who played a key role in pushing the railway line out, opined that if an alternative route is worked out, at least 4 lakh people will directly benefit. The new alignment will also be parallel to Samruddhi Mahamarg and boost regional development. Jadhav, who was instrumental in pursuing Thackeray to say ‘no’ to the project, feels if the line is upgraded through MTR, 82 villages will benefit (47 in Maharashtra and 35 in MP). “If new alignment is worked out, 212 villages will get the benefit (145 in Maharashtra and 67 in MP),” he said. Shakuntala fate hangs in balance The fate of Shakuntala’s closed narrow gauge (NG) section between Yavatmal-Murtizapur-Achalpur and Arvi-Pulgaon (225km) hangs in balance. A part of these NG sections is still owned by Canadian Pacific Railway, known as CP Railway. The proposal for gauge conversion of these sections was included in Capital Investment Programme in 2017-18 in anticipation that the state government will take up the project on joint venture mode. However, the proposed railway is still not owned by the ministry of railways and the proposal of determination of railway agreement with CP Railway is still not final. Till then the fate of the Shakuntala railway line cannot be decided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wildlife-nod-must-to-upgrade-rly-line-through-melghat-goyal/articleshow/84623329.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Goa||Heritage lovers knock Unesco’s doors regarding ‘illegal’ structure within Old Goa protected site||Panaji: Even as unplanned development continues to encroach into the world heritage site at Old Goa, an illegal construction near a monument has triggered protests from citizens. Now, heritage lovers have approached Unesco seeking protection of the site from illegalities. The Goa Heritage Action Group (GHAG) has written to the world heritage centre, Unesco, expressing distress at recent developments at the protected site in Old Goa. A ground-plus-two-storeyed concrete structure is being built illegally after an existing hut was demolished at the site. “Under the guise of repairs and reconstruction, and fraudulently showing a bungalow in Parcem, Pernem, miles away from this site, the project proponents have obtained permission from authorities,” the GHAG letter states. The town and country planning department and Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority have issued the approvals for repair and reconstruction, but the existing structure was used as a storage place, sources said. Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) officials, after being informed about the fraudulent means adopted by the proponent, inspected the bungalow at Pernem on March 11, 2020, and confirmed that it matched with the photographs attached with the application for permission. In the report prepared by Amarnath Ramakrishna, superintending archaeologist, ASI Goa circle and others, the dimensions of the bungalow at Parcem, names of owners, cost of its construction and other details have been provided. The project proponent, meanwhile, has said that they have all requisite permissions. “We are not against anybody seeking permission under the legal framework, but it is up to the authorities to explain the rules to the applicants. A lot of heritage sites are under threat and authorities should be more sensitive under the circumstances,” said GHAG chairperson Heta Pandit. ASI had issued a stop work notice to the project proponent in April 2021, stating that the construction of a residential house within the protected area is punishable with imprisonment which may extend up to two years or with fine which may extend to Rs 1 lakh, or both. While appreciating that ASI carried out an inspection of the Pernem bungalow and issued a stop work notice, GHAG alleged that the work continues till date, and urged the world heritage organisation to examine the matter to protect the historic site. GHAG has also written to the international council on monuments and sites (Icomos) with a request to look into the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/heritage-lovers-knock-unescos-doors-regarding-illegal-structure-within-old-goa-protected-site/articleshow/84623315.cms||---
---||Delhi||Jam session: Movement of farmers causes traffic snarls||New Delhi: Traffic in the city was affected after farmers moved from Singhu border to Jantar Mantar to hold a demonstration against the agri laws at a time when the monsoon session is on in Parliament. The snarls were a result of excessive barricading done by police as a preventive measure to avoid a repeat of what occurred in parts of the city and in front of Red Fort on January 26 during the farmers’ tractor rally. A group of 200 farmers travelled to Jantar Mantar from Singhu border in buses with a police escort. The entire stretch they travelled on was manned by traffic and local cops. A senior officer said various diversions were in place to avoid traffic jams. However, parts of Dwarka, Noida border, Mayur Vihar and Ashram saw traffic heavier than usual. Delhi Traffic police tweeted: “Traffic movement is affected due to local police picket at AIIMS towards Aurobindo Chowk, Noida towards Delhi at Kalindi Kunj, Noida towards Akshardham at Chilla Border, Noida towards Ashram at DND and Ghaziabad towards Delhi at Pandav Nagar.” Earlier, the security arrangement was tightened and an advisory issued by police for Thursday’s protest. This is the first time since January 26 that the authorities have granted permission to farmers’ unions to hold a protest in the city. Traffic police officials said they had made heavy arrangements this time around as they did not want a repeat of the last time’s fiasco. They said if such protest calls were made again, they would make similar arrangements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jam-session-movement-of-farmers-causes-traffic-snarls/articleshow/84659119.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: RT-PCR negative must before operation? Vaccinated, recovered at a loss||NAGPUR: Retired teacher Vijay Bansod’s surgery to remove kidney stone was scheduled in a private hospital this Tuesday. However, the operation had to be postponed for 48 hours after the surgeon asked him for RT-PCR negative report. Bansod has taken both the doses of Covid vaccine at least three weeks ago and has no symptoms of Covid-19 at all. He was surprised, but went for a test eventually. On the same lines, many patients who have fully recovered from Covid-19 are also being asked to submit RT-PCR negative report before the elective surgical process. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde triggered a debate on this subject by tweeting — “Why do some surgeons and anaesthesiologists are asking negative RT-PCR before surgery even in Covid-recovered and fully vaccinated people?”. TOI spoke to leading surgeons in Nagpur to know why RT-PCR is a must before any surgical procedure. “RT-PCR test before surgery is our protocol and we follow it irrespective of the Covid recovery or vaccination status of the patient,” said Dr Raj Gajbhiye, professor and head of the department of surgery at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH). “We have been operating many patients who have recovered from Covid-19, but still suffer post Covid problems needing surgical corrections. As part of precaution, we ask for RT-PCR test of these patients before surgery,” said Dr Gajbhiye. Veteran surgeon Dr YS Deshpande said RT-PCR is done to be doubly sure. “It’s a part of protocol and we consider it essential. This ensures safety of doctors, staff, as well as the patient. In case the patient tests positive, we can still perform surgery with additional precautions and using disposables,” he said. In some cases, surgeons go for rapid antigen test instead of RT-PCR, Dr Deshpande added. According to leading transplant surgeon Dr Sanjay Kolte, individual prerogative prevails while asking for RT-PCR negative report. “There are no definite guidelines about it. Moreover, there are diverse spectrums of the disease and surgeons are free to take decisions,” he said. Plastic surgeon Dr Pranam Sadavarte said anaesthesia needs good lungs. “Patient might be Covid vaccinated or recovered, but there are chances of having vulnerable lung condition. Without strong lungs, it will be difficult for the patient to come out of anaesthesia. Hence, to ensure good lungs, we recommend RT-PCR before surgery,” he said. Intravascular surgeon Dr Vaibhav Lende said fully vaccinated or Covid-recovered patients can get recurrent infection, if exposed. “Such patients may be asymptomatic, but could be carrier of the virus. Medical staff and their family members might get infected,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rt-pcr-ve-must-before-op-vaxed-recovered-at-a-loss/articleshow/84623320.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

In a memorandum to the Goa government, NFF president Narendra Patil and general secretary, Olencio Simoes condemned the bill as it is sought to be pushed during the pandemic without consulting the fishing community.

Yediyurappa cancels party meet||BENGALURU: Fuelling the will he-won’t-he speculation, Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa called off on Wednesday the BJP Legislature Party (BJPLP) meeting scheduled for July 26 — the day that marks two years in office for him – and postponed the lunch and dinner planned for his secretariat staff and MLAs on its eve. Ever since he returned from Delhi after a two-day visit to meet party politicians last week, speculation is rife that Yediyurappa might step down as CM by this month-end. This gained more traction with the surfacing of an audio clip three days ago allegedly featuring party state president Nalin Kumar Kateel that hinted at an imminent change of guard. MLA V Sunil Kumar, the party whip in the assembly, attributed the cancellation of events to “unforeseen developments” and added that he had been asked to inform legislators that the July 25 dinner has been postponed. The CM has not given any fresh date yet, he said. The decision has led to speculation that the BJP brass might have come under pressure to delay the changeof-guard process after seeing Lingayat seers and community leaders rallying behind the CM in the past two days. The CM’s office said Yediyurappa is planning to make his second anniversary in office “a gala” event. “Hence, it would be difficult for him to focus on multiple events and the meeting was postponed,” it said. Sources said Yediyurappa was planning to hold a video conference with BJP legislators from 120 assembly segments on July 26 to celebrate two years in office. The CM has convened a cabinet meeting, which is expected to recommend to the Centre that the Veerashaiva-Lingayat community be included in the central OBC list. A similar attempt by Yediyurappa last year was spiked by the party. State home minister Basavaraj Bommai said there is an effort to create political instability in the state by speculating about the CM’s time in office. “Yediyurappa will continue as CM as it has been reiterated by party national general secretary Arun Singh,” he added. Former Union minister DV Sadananda Gowda ruled out any “chance” of a change as the party leadership was pleased with development works and handling of Covid-19 under his watch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/twist-in-tale-yediyurappa-cancels-party-meet/articleshow/84624889.cms||---
---||Goa||AAP irrelevant in Goa, Congress ceding space to them, says GFP||PANAJI: Congress’ failure to fill the vacuum in the opposition has prompted Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) to project itself as the alternative against BJP in Goa, said Goa Forward Party on Wednesday. GFP president Vijai Sardesai said that AAP, which is not a relevant force in Goa, is attempting to gain traction using the poll promise of free electricity. Sardesai also said that he has yet to hear from the Congress leadership about his offer for a pre-poll alliance. “There is very clear attempt to create an opposition out of a party that is not relevant and this is the failure of Congress to miss out of the central narrative,” said Sardesai. “The AAP is challenging the government and Congress is watching as if it is a time pass.” The Fatorda MLA said that power supply is not a predominant issue for the state as the citizens are worried about coal transportation. “In Goa, electricity is not the issue, coal is the issue. Why didn’t they come saying No to Coal? What is the point of the debate?” said Sardesai. When asked about the alliance talks with Congress, Sardesai said that the Congress style of functioning is slow. “The Congress has not responded to us about the alliance. The Congress is an old party and their tendency is to take long to get their processes going. They need to focus on Goa. There is no point waking up after they lose Goa,” said Sardesai. Sardesai also hit out at BJP for the setback in the mining case, describing it as the second time that the Supreme Court has slapped the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-irrelevant-in-goa-cong-ceding-space-to-them-gfp/articleshow/84623331.cms||---

On Wednesday, Adilabad and Wanaparthy logged Rs 99 a litre. The price of diesel in the city is Rs 97 a litre. Along with petrol, diesel prices are also increasing. Price of diesel in Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata is oscillating between Rs 92 and Rs 96. Diesel crossed the Rs 100 mark in some places in Madhya Pradesh. Sources claim that consistent increase in fuel prices is due to an uptick in the international oil markets, where both product and crude prices have been going up for the past few months on increasing demand. Also, high taxes by the Centre and states were burning holes in the pockets of citizens. “I had bought a diesel car two years ago thinking that I could save some money, but that looks impossible now with increasing prices,” VK Sameer, a private employee said. The prices of vegetables and other essentials have skyrocketed for the past few months due to Covid-induced lockdown. “Life is becoming a struggle for people,” said Mani Jyothy, a housewife.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/diesel-inching-close-to-rs-100/litre/articleshow/84623932.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: CPM in wait-and-watch mode over charges against forest minister A K Saseendran||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Even as the opposition call for the resignation of forest minister and NCP leader A K Saseendran grew shriller, CPM has adopted a wait-and-watch policy towards the charges that the minister had tried to hush up a sexual harassment complaint against a local NCP leader at Kundara in Kollam. The NCP leadership, meanwhile, threw its weight behind Saseendran and ruled out his resignation from the cabinet. Within hours of Saseendran calling on chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan at his official residence on Wednesday morning and apprising the CM his version of the controversy, CPM’s acting state secretary A Vijayaraghavan told reporters that the party did not discuss the Saseendran episode in detail. “We have scant details about the allegations. We would discuss the matter if we come across more and relevant details with regard to the allegations against the minister. You people need not expect me to answer whether the minister should resign or not,” he said. According to him, it’s for NCP to discuss such matters. Earlier, Saseendran told reporters outside the Cliff House that he briefed the chief minister about his version of the controversy to which the CM gave a patient hearing. “There is no question of (me) resigning from the cabinet. I came to meet the CM on my own. I’m not summoned by him. I sought an audience with him earlier to discuss some demands of the forest department. I briefed him about my version with regard to the allegations. I don’t know whether he is satisfied or not. I didn’t ask him that,” Saseendran told reporters. The CPM leadership and the chief minister, say sources, are not convinced of the genuineness of the charges against Saseendran. CPM by not addressing the allegation against Saseendran publicly, wants to buy more time to form a clear opinion on the issue. It expects the NCP leadership to ensure that the allegations don’t flare up and put the government on the defensive. Meanwhile, the NCP national leadership too has shared the party state president P C Chacko’s opinion that Saseendran need not resign from the cabinet on account of the allegations. Chacko held talks with NCP supremo Sharad Pawar on the Saseendran issue and concluded that the party may ignore it. “All the problems started in connection with the appointment of NCP block president at Kundara. Nowhere in the audio tape, Saseendran mentioned the word ‘case’. The opposition is making the resignation call without understanding the issue. They don’t know what Saseendran said or what is the dispute in NCP that warranted Saseendran’s intervention,” Chacko said. Congress and BJP reiterated the demand for Saseeendran’s resignation from the government. Opposition leader V D Satheesan said the CM should ask for his resignation, if Saseendran was not ready to step down on his own. “Saseendran’s claims are illogical and weak. It’s clear that the minister intervened in the case with full understanding about the nature of the case,” Satheesan said. BJP state president K Surendran said the CM was harbouring a person accused of trying to sabotage a sexual a harassment case. “The CPM stand that let NCP inquire into the allegations is an open challenge against the rule of law. CPM had settled many such cases through party inquiries,” Surendran said. Meanwhile, the survivor, who allegedly underwent the sexual harassment, told reporters that the CM’s approach towards the minister was unacceptable and she would explore legal recourse to hold the minister answerable for his error.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cpm-in-wait-and-watch-mode-over-charges-against-saseendran/articleshow/84623341.cms||---

AICC has summoned Chodankar along with the five remaining Congress MLAs and South Goa MP Francisco Sardinha to Delhi for a meeting on Thursday. State Congress coordination committee chairman Ramakant Khalap has also been asked to come to Delhi for the meeting. Sources suggest that Rahul Gandhi and AICC interim president Sonia Gandhi will meet with the Congress leaders to discuss the leadership vacuum in Goa. Goa desk-in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao submitted his report regarding the state’s preparations for the 2022 assembly elections and requests from the party cadre for Chodankar to be replaced. The demand has been growing to appoint a new party president in place of Chodankar, who has submitted his resignation twice in the past. Sardinha, Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco and many others have openly called for Chodankar to go. Party insiders expect the Congress high command to bring in a leadership change in the coming weeks, with a senior party member expected to take over the reins. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat, Sardinha and former power minister Aleixo Sequeira’s names have also been doing the rounds||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-members-to-meet-gandhis/articleshow/84623335.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Pegasus attack worse than Emergency: Shiv Sena||MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena on Wednesday blamed the Narendra Modi-led NDA government directly for the ‘Pegasus’ spyware controversy, saying that it was a case of spying on journalists, politicians, the judiciary and bureaucracy, who are the four pillars of democracy. The Sena, in its mouthpiece Saamna, alleged that spying with the use of the Pegasus spyware was “a cyber attack on select Indians,” was “an anti-national act” and “could not have been done without the Centre’s consent.” The Sena also urged the Supreme Court to take suo motu notice of the issue and appoint an independent committee to probe it in the interest of the nation. Saamna stated that “a few people every year observe the anniversary of imposition of the Emergency by PM Indira Gandhi in 1975 as a Black Day, but the cyber attack (carried out with Pegasus) is more terrible than the Emergency.” Saamna stated, “Such an attack cannot be made without the Centre’s consent, and the real fathers of Pegasus are in our country. They should be found.” The Sena demanded that the Centre should probe the matter by forming a joint parliamentary committee and if it did not, the SC should take suo motu cognizance of the matter. The editorial stated that snooping was a direct attack on an individual’s right to freedom. “Home minister Amit Shah claimed that spying with the help of Pegasus was an international conspiracy to defame the country and its democracy. It’s a surprising statement. Could the home minister be able to tell exactly who is defaming the country? If it’s your government and the country and democracy are yours, then who has dared to defame the country?” asked the Sena mouthpiece.  Saamna also asked what type of patriotism it was “to use taxpayers’ money for spying on them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pegasus-attack-worse-than-emergency-in-mumbai-sena/articleshow/84624334.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Kochi||Boost to climate reforms even as fiscal space a concern: World Bank's Kerala report||KOCHI: The latest World Bank-funded project in Kerala — the $125 million ‘Resilient Kerala Programme’ — gets an overall ‘substantial’ risk rating from the global financing agency. It has given a substantial risk rating in six categories which include: political and governance, macroeconomic, fiduciary, environmental and social, stakeholders and others. The World Bank’s document reveals the weak points of Kerala, across various angles. For example, regarding fiscal stature, the World Bank observes that Kerala has “highly stressed state finances with no systems in place and limited fiscal space to respond to large-scale exogenous shocks”. “The World Bank’s support to build multidimensional resilience in Kerala commenced right after the 2018 floods and landslides. The foundation of the engagement was set by the World Bank-supported First Resilient Kerala Development Policy Operation (DPO, $250 million), approved in June 2019. It supported the Rebuild Kerala Development Programme (RKDP) — the government of Kerala’s strategic and integrated roadmap for recovery, rebuilding, and resilience. DPO set the course for centering resilience-related policies and institutional reforms in key cross-cutting areas and sectors of the economy. Kerala’s limited fiscal space and high levels of debt have severely constrained its ability to deal with major exogenous shocks,” the report noted. “Initial steps were undertaken in DPO to improve fiscal sustainability including through mobilizing private finances. DPO and the engagement so far have also triggered policy and institutional reforms to enhance resilience to enable holistic river basin management, sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture, risk-informed land-use planning and multi-year capital planning, disaster management plans at all levels, and the creation of a dedicated institutional modality, the Rebuild Kerala Initiative (RKI), to manage the rollout of the RKDP and DPO. These efforts have improved Kerala’s capacity to respond to disasters and other extreme events, evidenced by reduced loss of lives, assets, and livelihoods by the 2019 and 2020 floods and landslides,” the document further added. On the disaster management preparedness of Kerala, the bank is of the view that the state has “weak state-level systems and absence of local-level preparedness to mitigate and respond to disasters and disease outbreaks”. Describing the weakness of the health sector, the report says that Kerala has, “high vulnerability to zoonotic diseases, and while the state managed Nipah outbreak well, it needs integrated disease surveillance and response systems”. Road networks, especially CRN (core road network), in the state are poorly constructed and maintained, making them highly vulnerable to climate change and disasters and rendering them inoperable during emergencies, the report said. The World Bank-funded project is trying to address the various issues in areas like fiscal, disaster risk management, urban, health, water resource management, agriculture, roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/boost-to-climate-reforms-even-as-fiscal-space-a-concern-wb/articleshow/84623351.cms||Shenoy Karun

Earlier on July 19, a travel bus operator Bholugiri Goswami (40) was arrested for securing bank loans on travel buses which never existed. Goswami, a resident of Narayan Nagar, owns Khodiyar Travels in Rajkot city. Police said that Pathan was produced before a local court in Rajkot on Wednesday which remanded him till July 28. “During questioning, Pathan said that he had sold 200 fake vehicle registration documents in different cities like Bhavnagar, Vadodara, Surat and Rajkot. He used to get these forged papers from one Bhumesh Shah of Surat at Rs 1.50 lakh per document,” police said. According to case details, the mastermind of the scam, Goswami had availed bank loans worth Rs 4.6 crore from different banks by producing forged Registration Certificate (RC) books of 28 luxury buses.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Sitting SC judge should probe phone taps, says Nana Patole||MUMBAI: Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole on Wednesday demanded by a judicial probe by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court into phone-tapping of leading politicians, bureaucrats and members of the judiciary with the use of the spyware Pegasus. “We are meeting Governor B S Koshyari today to press for our demand. In our opinion, it (tapping) is a direct attack on democracy and abuse of power by the Narendra Modi-led NDA government. My phone too was under observation during 2017-18,” Patole told TOI. Patole had raised the issue of phone-tapping during the recent monsoon session of the state legislature. He had then pointed out that his phone was under surveillance. Congress leader Randeep Surjewala said use of Pegasus was not limited to Karnataka and that the same method may have been used in trying to topple the Congress government in Maharashtra. NCP spokesperson and minister Nawab Malik said phone-tapping is a serious matter and must be probed. “Since Parliament session is in session, Narendra Modi must explain the situation to the nation. Generally phones of anti-social elements and terrorists are kept under observation, but now phones of journalists, leaders of opposition and high-ranking bureaucrats too are under surveillance,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sitting-sc-judge-should-probe-phone-taps-says-patole/articleshow/84624341.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||India||Not women’s will, but govts’ failure behind large families||If adequate and accessible family planning services were provided to all women who need them, the country might have achieved a fertility rate lower than replacement level as far back as 2005-06. According to the National Family Health survey (NFHS) report of 2015-16, the total wanted fertility rate or an estimate of what the fertility rate would be if all unwanted births were avoided, was 1.9 in the 2005-06 survey and 1.8 in 2015-16. This raises the question of whether it makes sense to penalise women or the people for the failure of governments to provide basic health services. In the latest NFHS survey of 2019-20, the wanted fertility rate did not touch 2 in any of the larger states for which data has been released, barring Bihar, where it was 2.3 compared to a total fertility rate of 3. The reports of several states including Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab have not been released yet. India’s total wanted fertility rate declined from 2.6 in 1993 to 1.8 in 2016. The replacement level fertility rate is 2.1 children per woman, a level at which a population exactly replaces itself from one generation to the next. India’s fertility rate in 2015-16 was 2.2 and the partial data available for 2019-20 suggests it is likely to have dipped below replacement level. When the total fertility rate of a country falls below 2.1, its population starts shrinking after a few years. This would have started happening in 2005-06 if the government could improve services in health and education. According to the 2015-16 survey, there wasn’t a single religious community or caste for which the total wanted fertility was above 2 children. Total wanted fertility rate was 2.3 only for the poorest and those who had no schooling. It was also estimated that 13% of married women had an unmet need for family planning and there hasn’t been a significant decline in this unmet demand over a decade. This was as high as 22% among married women in the 15-24 age group. The unmet need for family planning refers to women of child-bearing age who wished to postpone the next birth (spacing) or stop childbearing but couldn’t. Among larger states, unmet need for family planning was the highest in Bihar (21%) followed by Jharkhand and UP, where it was 18%. Family planning resources aside, if India ensured at least five years of schooling or primary education for its girls, its fertility rate could be well below replacement level. According to the 2015-16 survey, the total wanted fertility rate for women with no schooling was 2.3, which dropped to 1.9 among those with five years of schooling and 1.5 for women with over 12 years of schooling. Similarly, if India managed to lift the poorest 20% out of poverty, the fertility rate would be about 1.9. The NFHS-4 survey showed that the total wanted fertility rate of the poorest 20% of the population was 2.3 compared to 1.9 for the next wealth quintile and 1.4 for the wealthiest 20%. It is also no coincidence that the states with the highest wanted fertility rate are also the ones with the worst under-five mortality or the probability of dying by age five per 1,000 live births. It is well established that couples tend to have more children when the survival of their children is uncertain. Bihar, where the total wanted fertility rate was 2.3, had the highest under-five mortality rate of 56.4, which means nearly 6% of children born live die before five years of age. And that’s the average for the state. For the poorest, the rate would be much higher. Similarly in UP, where the total wanted fertility rate in 2015-16 was 2.1, under-five mortality was 78.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/not-womens-will-but-govts-failure-behind-large-families/articleshow/84624920.cms||Rema Nagarajan

---||Rajkot||Fearing arrest, suspect dies after drinking acid in Rajkot||RAJKOT: A man, accused of keeping a part of the cash stolen by an angadia firm employee, ended his life by consuming acid after seeing cops approaching to arrest him on Tuesday evening. The deceased was identified as , owner of an imitation jewellery furnace in Navagam village on the outskirts of Rajkot city. According to police, an angadia firm employee Sanjay Bhimani (32), a resident of Balasura palace, Ring Road, was given a self-cheque for Rs 30 lakh by angadia firm owner Nilesh Bhalodi. Sanjay was asked to withdraw the amount and hand it over to the owner’s elder brother Bhavesh. “Few hours after withdrawing Rs 30 lakh on Tuesday, Sanjay informed his employer that two unidentified persons robbed the cash along with his mobile phone and bike’s key. Nilesh along with Sanjay came to Rajkot taluka police station to lodge an FIR. Sanjay wasn’t able to satisfactorily explain the loot details when cops took him to the crime spot. Also, police found no clues in the CCTV camera footage of nearby shops. When grilled, Sanjay confessed that he had cooked up the story of loot to pocket the Rs 30 lakh cash,” police said. Sanjay told police that he gave the bag, containing the cash, to Ketan Sadadiya and asked him to deliver it to his cousins Bipin Bhimani and Vimal Bhimani. After cops recovered Rs 25 lakh from the two it came to light that Sadadiya had kept Rs 5 lakh of the stolen amount. Later, police in order to question Sadadiya went to his factory in Navagam. “As soon as he saw the police approaching him, fearing arrest, Sadadiya consumed acid. He was rushed to the Civil Hospital for treatment where he died on Wednesday morning." “We have recovered full amount and booked Ketan Sadadiya, Sanjay Bhimani, Bipin and Vimal Bhimani under various sections of IPC including 381 and 406,” a police official said. Police have arrested Sanjay and detained Bipin and Vimal for questioning. Police are probing whether Bipin and Vimal were also involved in the conspiracy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/fearing-arrest-suspect-dies-after-drinking-acid/articleshow/84622430.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||Kozhikode: Baby Imran battling SMA dies||KOZHIKODE: Six month-old Imran Mohammed from Perinthalmanna, who was battling spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and for whose treatment Rs 16.5 crore was collected through crowd funding died at Kozhikode medical college late on Tuesday night. The son of Arif and Ramisa Tasni was on ventilator support at the Institute of Maternal and Child Care. He had been under treatment for SMA when he was just a month old. Parents and well-wishers were hoping that Imran would recover from the rare, genetic disease that weakens the muscles if he could be given the gene therapy drug Zolgensma which costs around Rs 18 crore and intense efforts were underway to raise funds. A committee comprising people’s representatives, residents and well-wishers were spearheading the drive over the last three weeks and thousands had pooled money from across the world for the cause. His death came when the fund collection drive was nearing its target. Arif had also approached the high court seeking a court directive to the government to import the drug and provide necessary treatment to his son. Acting on the petition, the court had directed forming a five-member medical panel to examine the child and file a report. Mankada MLA Manjalamkuzhi Ali, who was heading the committee formed to collect funds, said that it was unfortunate that despite the huge outpouring of help, Imran could not be saved. “The passing away of Imran was totally unexpected. We were able to collect around Rs 16.5 crore. I had contacted his father and he told me that he has met the expenses incurred for treatment as it was his responsibility and that the committee need not bear it. We will hold a meeting to decide what to do with the collected amount,” he said. He added that Imran’s case has once again brought the plight of children suffering from SMA in state. The government should take a proactive approach to provide treatment to children suffering from SMA as crowdfunding cannot be considered as a viable option always, he added. Earlier this month, a village in Kannur had campaigned and raised the Rs 18 crore required for the treatment of 18-months-old Mohammed, who was also diagnosed with SMA, within six days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/baby-imran-battling-sma-dies/articleshow/84623368.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Vajubhai Vala plans to unite Rajput sub-castes with Mata temple||Rajkot: Former Karnataka governor and BJP veteran Vajubhai Vala, who is recuperating after a cataract surgery in Rajkot is reviving his old plans to build a temple of Bhavani Maa in Surendranagar district. In Saurashtra region, temples play a huge role in uniting the community. Vala’s temple exercise is also aimed at uniting all sub-castes of Rajputs, much in the lines of Patidars and Kolis. Patidar’s Khodaldham and Umita temple remain at the focal point for all political parties. The two communities had recently flexed their muscles in an attempt to negotiate with political parties for the 2022 Gujarat assembly election. Vala, who hails from the Karadiya Rajput community had floated the the temple idea in 2013. Bhavani Maa is the reigning deity of all the Rajput families. However, nothing moved on the ground while Vala kept his propaganda alive in every election. Kodinar, Talala and Somnath are three assembly constituencies where Karadiyas are in majority. Karadiya Rajputs are a significant vote bank in Botad, Talaja, Sihor, Limdi, Sayla, Dhandhuka and Sanand too. A few leaders of the Karadiya community held a meeting with Vala last week at the latter’s residence in Rajkot. “Nearly six leaders of Surendrangar and Dhandhuka went to meet Vajubhai at his residence. The main agenda was to build a temple. Vajubhai asked us to clean the space and said he will hold a meeting with the leaders of all sub- castes to concretize a plan for the temple,” said Kanbha Rajoda, a community leader. BJP leader Jasha Barad, a leader of the Rajput community too, said, “We are planning to meet Vajubhai on Saturday for the temple. The objective of the temple is to unite all our people so that we can have our say in politics.” The Karadiya community is considering to place candidates by both the parties on all the three seats of Kodinar, Talala and Somnath that have gone to the Congress in the 2017 elections. Earlier, the temple was planned to be constructed near Chotila, but now they have identified a place between Sayla and Limdi in Surendranagar district. Raibha Rathod, who is actively involved in the project said, “We have nearly 25 acres parcel which was recently converted into non agricultural land. We are also in talks to buy another 10 acres. All sub-castes of Rajput of Gujarat are collectively building this temple.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/vala-plans-to-unite-rajput-sub-castes-with-mata-temple/articleshow/84622464.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The defence ministry said once deployed, the Akash-NG weapon system would prove to be a force multiplier for the air defence capability of the Indian Air Force. The missile system has been developed by Defence Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL), Hyderabad, in collaboration with other DRDO laboratories. The flight trial was conducted at 12.45 pm from a land-based platform with all weapon system elements such as multi-function radar, command, control and communication System and launcher participating in deployment configuration. The launch was witnessed by representatives of the IAF. In order to capture flight data, the ITR deployed a number of range stations like electro optical tracking system, radar and telemetry. “The flawless performance of the entire weapon system has been confirmed by complete flight data captured by these systems. During the test, the missile demonstrated high manoeuvrability required for neutralising fast and agile aerial threats,” the ministry of defence said. Production agencies Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) also participated in the trials. In what has been described as a major boost towards Atma Nirbhar Bharat and strengthening of Indian Army, the DRDO also successfully flight-tested indigenously-developed low weight, fire and forget ‘man portable anti-tank guided missile’ (MPATGM) on Wednesday. The missile was launched from a man portable launcher integrated with a thermal site and the target was mimicking a tank. The missile hit the target in a direct attack mode and destroyed it with precision. The test has validated the minimum range successfully. “All the mission objectives were met,” the MoD said. The missile has already been successfully flight-tested for the maximum range.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/new-gen-akash-tested-successfully/articleshow/84624002.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Pandey said there would be no shortage of medical oxygen at any health centre by the end of August. As many as 122 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generating plants in different hospitals would be installed soon. One such plant has already been installed at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) and the installation work at other hospitals was in progress. All the hospitals, right from health sub-centres to medical college hospitals, are getting the necessary medical equipment as per their needs. It is expected that all the health centres would be getting equipment like oxygen concentrators, B and C-type oxygen cylinders and BiPAP (bilevel positive air pressure) machines for children by the end of July. Besides, all the essential medicines were being supplied to the health centres, the minister said. Pandey said the infrastructure facilities of paediatric intensive care units (PICU), neonatal intensive care units (NICU) and special newborn care units (SNCUs) of all the health centres were being improved on a war footing. Special mother child hospitals (MCH) are being set up in 20 districts of the state. He further pointed out that as many as 1,215 health sub-centres in the state have been earmarked for their repair and renovation. Tenders for their reconstruction work have already been floated. And, 130 primary healthcare centres (PHCs) are being upgraded as community health centres (CHCs), he said. As far as the scarcity of doctors and paramedical staff in hospitals and health centres is concerned, Pandey said necessary steps have already been initiated to appoint them in sufficient numbers both on regular and contract basis. Altogether 30,000 doctors, nurses and other paramedical staff are being appointed. Posts of about 9,800 doctors, including 2,632 general doctors, 3,883 specialists and 3,270 Ayush doctors have been advertised for regular appointment. As many as 3,350 medical officers have already been appointed. Besides, 8,000 ANMs are being appointed for different health centres. Hospitals have been authorised to appoint sufficient numbers of ANMs and GNMs as per their requirements on contract. All the newly appointed doctors and paramedical staff are being trained at AIIMS Patna, he said. The minister said the government is trying its best to get the maximum number of people vaccinated against Covid-19 in both rural and urban areas. He said the target of vaccinating six crore people in six months (by December-end) would be achieved at all costs. Sufficient doses of all types of vaccines are being made available in different parts of the state and rural folks are also being motivated to get inoculated at the earliest for ensuring their safety from Covid-19 virus, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/health-centres-in-state-to-get-key-infra-by-month-end-min/articleshow/84622497.cms||B K Mishra

A citizen who happens to be a Muslim won’t be a loser because of CAA,” Bhagwat said. “In post-Independence history, during the Nehru-Liaquat pact, there was an assurance that minorities would be taken care of. We are still taking care of the minorities, but Pakistan is not.”  He argued that every government across the world documents their respective country’s population profile through “NRC-like” exercises. “NRC is about information on citizens living in the country as residents. We should know the movement of those who have arrived with visas as guests and those who sneaked out without permission.” He said though the NRC exercise was not against the interest of any Indian, it was being analysed through the prism of politics. Bhagwat accused a section of people of “spinning a narrative along communal lines” around NRC and CAA. “They have made the NRC-CAA a Hindu-Muslim issue.” He harked back to Partition to trace the roots of the refugee problem that he said still haunts the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/caa-and-nrc-not-anti-muslim-says-rss-chief-in-assam/articleshow/84624952.cms||Kangkan Kalita

The investigation team asked Sankar about the finances of the party’s election campaign. Praseeda alleged that Surendran had told her over phone that he made arrangements for handing over the money, and the next day, Prashanth handed over the money at a homestay in Bathery where Janu was staying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/cb-questions-bjp-district-prez-sankar/articleshow/84623382.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||First-dose recipients make a beeline for private hospitals||KOLKATA: Several private hospitals received a deluge of first-dose recipients on Wednesday with most state-run Covid vaccination centres (CVC) — faced with a shortage in supply — restricting themselves to just the second dose. The number of doses saw a spurt at Peerless Hospital, Medica, CMRI and RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) even as Belle Vue and Woodlands stuck to the numbers they have been doing since late last week. Fortis Hospital remained the only exception with zero doses since the hospital is yet to receive its quote of vaccines. Peerless Hospital, which had been forced to restrict its daily doses to less than 200 last week, raised it to above 500 on Wednesday. “Since we received fresh supply late last week, our daily target has been above 400. We have now scaled it up to 500-plus since the queue has lengthened ever since government-run CVCs ran into a shortage this week. A large share of our recipients is lining up for their first dose. These are the ones who had been waiting to get inoculated at government centres that have now shut their doors on them,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. More than 300 of Peerless’ 519 recipients on Wednesday got their first jab. At RTIICS, 70% of the 1,000 doses administered on Wednesday was first dose. At Medica Superspecialty Hospital, 75% of 460 recipients at their on-site CVCs got their first dose on Wednesday. AMRI Hospitals – that administered around 1,400 doses across its three centres on Wednesday – has seen an increase in the number of second doses. “These are the ones who had been planning to go to government CVCs but were turned away due to shortage. Now, they are ready to pay for vaccines at private CVCs,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. The number of first-dose recipients has shot up also because several sectors have made vaccination mandatory for employees to return to work, said Mitra. “The hospitality industry and the travel and tourism sector, in particular, have made it compulsory for those who had been deferring vaccination. Then, there are students and professionals who need to travel abroad,” said Mitra. Another section is the one who had been weighing their options before deciding on a vaccine, pointed out Barua. “This is the discerning population that had been following a wait-and-watch policy so far. They are now rushing to get the first jab,” said Barua. Woodlands Hospital has seen an 8% increase in second-dose recipients. “Our target for Wednesday was 2,250, which included 1,550 at the hospital,” said Woodlands managing director Rupali Basu. CMRI has scaled up its daily doses from below 100 last week to 250 on Wednesday. It is ready for a further hike. “We now have enough in stock to last 20 days more, so we are ready to go full steam,” said Simmardeep Gill, COO, CK Birla Hospitals. The hospital, however, has so far received a mixed bag of first and second dose recipients. Belle Vue Clinic has scaled up its daily doses to 650 at its on-site CVCs. At off-sites, the hospital is doing around 1,500 daily. “This takes our daily number to around 2,500 and we hope to be able to carry on like this for the next one month at least,” said CEO P Tondon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/1st-dose-recipients-make-a-beeline-for-pvt-hosps/articleshow/84622517.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Only after looking into the original records, the court found to its shock that the register had been manipulated.The judge observed that this manipulation in the original register was also noticed both by the tahsildar and the revenue divisional officer (RDO) due to which patta was directed to be issued in favour of the petitioner in 2007.The judge observed, “It is a settled law that insofar as vacant land is concerned, the possession follows title. Without a title, the corporation can never claim to be in possession of the property. Whereas, the petitioner is able to trace the title from the year 1935 onwards and therefore, the possession has to necessarily follow the title.”The court was hearing the petition filed by S Kanaga. The land owned by the petitioner’s grandmother since 1935 was bequeathed to the petitioner by the will executed by her mother Valliyammal in 2002. After her mother’s demise, the petitioner submitted an application seeking transfer of patta in her name.The RDO, who had conducted an inquiry passed an order in 2007 directing the Palayamkottai tahsildar to change the patta in Kanaga’s name. Accordingly, patta was issued in her name.However, claiming ownership of the land, the corporation filed a revision petition before the district revenue officer (DRO) who in 2010 passed an order allowing the revision petition. When the petitioner moved the HC, the court in 2011 set aside the DRO’s order and remitted back the matter to the authorities to conduct an inquiry and pass order.The DRO passed an order in 2012 directing the parties to approach the civil court and establish their rights. Challenging the same, the petitioner had filed the present petition.The judge quashed the order passed by DRO and directed to transfer patta in the name of the petitioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/court-expresses-shock-at-tirunelveli-corpns-claim-to-land-by-forging-records/articleshow/84622515.cms||Kaushik Kannan

On Wednesday morning, when there was no discharge, the river water level had increased from 7 feet to 9 feet. The danger mark at Sangli city is 40 feet. Though the irrigation officials had not started discharge from the Koyna dam located upstream of the Krishna river, they plan to start discharge from the powerhouse spillway at 11 am on Thursday at the rate of 2,100 cusec. An alert has been issued for the downstream villages. On Wednesday, the Koyna dam’s catchment area received 37mm rainfall between 8am to 5pm. A day earlier, the catchment area had received 109mm rainfall. The rainfall intensity increased during the night. By Wednesday evening, the dam — with 105 TMC capacity — had 53 TMC live storage. The dam had inflows of 33,914 cusec due to the incessant rainfall. The discharge of water from Sangli district’s Warna dam across the Warna river, which eventually meets Krishna, was carried out at the rate of 1,115 cusec. The catchment area here had received 44 mm rainfall. Mahabaleshwar in Satara district received 98 mm rainfall, the highest in the region, on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/almatti-discharge-keeps-krishna-level-stable-at-sangli-koyna-to-start-release/articleshow/84620446.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Vax drive to gather pace at govt CVCs||Kolkata: The supply of vaccines across government CVCs is set to improve with the state receiving 9.3 lakh doses of Covishield on Wednesday. With this, the state on Wednesday has a total of around 16 lakh doses in its kitty. The next shipment of about 6 lakh Covishield is expected in about a week. While the state will get Covaxin vials in between, but the number of doses has not been confirmed yet. “We have got 50 lakh doses in July so far in instalments and another 21-22 lakh doses for the month is due,” said state family welfare officer Ashim Dasmalakar. The state was given an estimate by the Centre that it would get about 70 lakh doses for July. Health officials said that due to the scanty supply, it was not possible scale up the drive beyond 3 lakh doses a day. At many centres, only second dose is being administered to clear the backlog. “Last Friday, we got only 80 doses whereas more than 300 people had queued up at our centre. We are having to scale down our operations due to scanty supply,” said a source at ID Hospital. Hospitals like SSKM, however, said it was getting doses enough to inoculate about 1,500 people on a daily average. “The supply of Covaxin, however, is limited at present,” said a source at SSKM Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-drive-to-gather-pace-at-govt-cvcs/articleshow/84622519.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Pune||MCCIA lauds electric vehicles’ policy, points to improvements needed||Pune: The Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture (MCCIA) has commended the new electric vehicles (EVs) policy announced by the state government in a new comparative paper with similar policies of other states, but has also pointed out improvements needed, especially with regard to development of EVs. The MCCIA paper compared the state EV policy with those announced by other states such as Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Delhi, among others, with policy proposals for both supply and demand side economics, such as direct subvention for buyers of EVs as well as subsidies for manufacturers of EVs and allied ancillaries and players in the battery and charging market. The paper specifically praised Maharashtra for proposing to implement both supply and demand verticals, as well as capping the number of vehicles that can be incentivised, which can “nudge” competition among both manufacturers and buyers. The policy also includes incentives for setting up charging facilities, with additional incentives to set them up in rural and underdeveloped areas of the state. “A policy like this is required when there is a market failure, and in the case of EVs, the market failed because of the costs involved, and so the state government had to step in and create this policy. As a policy, it is really good and progressive, which will boost the market for EVs. The policy of capping the number of vehicles in each class, which will be eligible to receive subventions, will also help in generating competition among manufacturers so that they can get their product out into the market,” said Prashant Girbane, director-general, MCCIA. Girbane also pointed out potential improvements that can be added with final implementation, especially with regard to research and development. “Some states provide for specific areas and parks for research and development of electric vehicles. Maharashtra can also provide new facilities, or by boosting existing ones such as the auto cluster in Pune to help in research and development of EVs,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mccia-lauds-electric-vehicles-policy-points-to-improvements-needed/articleshow/84623401.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

With a further red alert on Thursday and an orange alert for Friday, the river water is expected to touch the warning level of 39 feet soon. The river water level is rapidly increasing due to continuous rain in the region. The current water level of the Panchaganga river at the Rajaram barrage at Kasba Bawda in Kolhapur is 32 feet 5 inch. The warning level here is 39 feet and danger level is 43 feet. Currently, 39 barrages in the district are submerged under the waters of Panchaganga, Bhogawati, Kumbhi, Kasari, Tulsi, Vedganga, Dudhganga, Kadwi, Dhamni and Warna rivers. On Wednesday, Kolhapur district received heavy rainfall throughout the day in the city area as well as in the dam catchment areas. With the rise in water level, riverside residents have been asked to stay alert and be prepared to move if the river reaches the danger mark. As per the district disaster management officials, Kolhapur district received 38.2 mm rainfall in the 24 hours between Tuesday evening and Wednesday evening. Incessant rainfall was recorded in the dam catchment areas. Gaganbawda received the highest rainfall of 103.8 mm, followed by Radhanagari (77.9 mm), while Shirol received the least rainfall of 6.3 mm. Due to frequent landslides and poor condition of the road in the Bhui Bawda ghat section near Gaganbawda, the road connecting Kolhapur to Khare Patan in Konkan has been kept shut for heavy vehicles by the Vaibhavwadi tehsil authorities. With Karul ghat already closed, Bhui-Bawda ghat was an alternative route and now with both the ghats being closed, the heavy vehicles plying between Konkan and Kolhapur will have to take a longer route via Anuskura ghat, Amba ghat or the Phonda ghat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/panchaganga-breaches-its-banks-nears-warning-level/articleshow/84620496.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Activists cite netas, cops on green transport, urge cycling ban lift||KOLKATA: Over the last few days, environmentalists and bicycle enthusiasts found non-motorised-transport champions in Trinamool MPs who rode bicycles to Parliament, in the police commissioner who bicycled around Maidan to check out the law-and-order situation and in CM Mamata Banerjee, who rode pillion on an e-scooter to reach the secretariat. They have now written to commissioner Soumen Mitra to amend the ban on bicycling on city roads that was imposed at the fag end of the Left regime. According to them, cities around the world are increasingly shifting to non-motorized modes of travel. “Many cities around the world, like London, Berlin, Milan, Paris, and closer to home Bengaluru, Chennai, and Pune, have started giving tremendous importance to cycling as not just a sustainable shift in mobility planning but also as a way of life,” said Vinay Jaju of Bengal CAN (Clean Air Network), who feels his city is choking with noxious fumes from motorized vehicles. “We have written to the CP with an appeal to lift the ban and help implementing a cycle-safe infrastructure. We have addressed the issues inhibiting them from having a cycle track in and around the city. This is why we consulted a wide range of mobility experts who were in favour of keeping cycling at the centre of the mobility plan for Kolkata. Each city in India and across the world with limited road space has found solutions and is setting up cycle lanes, sensitising cyclists and getting more people to ride cycle, thereby helping decongest and depollute the city,” said Gargi Maitra, a cycle enthusiast and environment activist. Earlier, Kolkata Police had raised the issue and concluded that cycling on Kolkata roads was unsafe for cyclists. Cyclists often interfere with safe vehicular movement. They also found KMDA’s plan of a 120km cycle lane in and around Kolkata ‘impractical’ as it would create problems with parking lots and bus stops. In the absence of alternative spaces to relocate these parking lots, police were apprehensive that blocking a lane for cycles would be a major challenge in the city. Mobility experts like AV Venugopal of Urban Works Institute, ITDP; Parisar programme director Ranjit Gadgil; IIT-Delhi’s Nishant Singh, Sonal Kulkarni, director (strategic partnerships, marketing), BYCS India and Vinuta Gopal, CEO, ASAR Social Impact, clearly said how bicycles can decarbonise and decongest Kolkata roads. Already, a massive number of professionals like doctors, technocrats, teachers amd scientists have adopted cycling for commuting to their workplaces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/activists-cite-netas-cops-on-green-transport-urge-cycling-ban-lift/articleshow/84622533.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The court directed the collector to pass final orders on the application after affording an opportunity to hear the objections raised by the petitioners.The court passed the order while disposing of a batch of petitions filed by land owners who sought to forbear the TANTRANSCO authorities from erecting towers in their land at Silvarpatty village in Dindigul district. The petitioners claimed that there was a deviation from the original route of the project due to which their land parcels were affected.However, TANTRANSCO stated that as per the original plan prepared with the assistance of experts from Anna University, the line passes through the Thovar reserve forest area. Since there was already a transmission line passing through the forest area, a final route was suggested and the same was also accepted by the experts.It is further stated that the proposed project will improve the operational efficiency, quality of power, reliability of the system and reduced losses leading to better voltage profile in Tamil Nadu.Justice N Anand Venkatesh observed that it is apparent that specialists are involved in the process of drawing the plan on this important project and unless this court finds any illegality on the face of it, this court cannot venture into giving its views on the findings of the expert bodies. The judge observed that there is no requirement for the authorities to get the consent of the owners of the property or issue notice, as per provisions of the Electricity Act, however, whenever any objection or protest is made by the land owner, the authorities will have to necessarily approach the collector under provisions of the Telegraph Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-directs-collector-to-pass-orders-on-application-for-permit/articleshow/84622523.cms||---
---||Kochi||Ernakulam: Anannyah’s friends and family allege medical negligence||KOCHI: Friends and family of transgender activist Anannyah Kumari Alex (28), who was found dead in her apartment on Tuesday evening, staged a protest outside the hospital where she underwent sex reassignment surgery (SRS), alleging medical negligence. Police termed it a case of suspected suicide. Anannyah, the first transgender person to contest assembly elections in state, had publicly voiced the severe, physical discomfort and complications she faced after SRS. On Wednesday, protesters alleged that complications following SRS led to her suicide and they sought action against the hospital and her doctors. Renai Medicity, where she underwent SRS a year ago, issued a statement that a medical board had looked into her complaint and found that there was no medical negligence. It added that she was not facing a major health issues then. But, her father S Alexander expects the government to ensure justice. “Anannyah was my blood and I lost her. She had told me that hospital authorities were behaving in a hostile manner. I called her three weeks ago and she told me that she was facing hardships, including physical issues. It seems SRS and complications led her to take this extreme step,” he said. Meanwhile, activists and her friends demanded a probe as they felt that the circumstances that led to her death were mysterious. An autopsy, which was to be conducted on Wednesday, was postponed following the request of Alexander and other activists that a panel of experts should conduct the autopsy. The procedure will take place on Thursday at Kalamassery medical college. Sruthy Sithara, a transwoman and her friend, said, “Medical negligence definitely contributed to her death. She was a strong woman, whether such a person would opt for this extreme step is another question.” Activists filed a petition at Palarivattom station to stop SRS surgeries at the hospital. Police told them that they were not equipped to issue such directives. The hospital, in its statement, claimed that there was no negligence on the part of its team of doctors led by Dr Arjun Asokan. The hospital said the patient developed an intestinal obstruction, a known SRS complication, shortly after surgery and a procedure was done to resolve it. It said that at the time of discharge she was satisfied and raised a complaint 6-7 months later about the surgically-developed sex organ and complications while urinating. After an examination, she was informed that a minor corrective surgery was required and she was suggested a treatment for improving the aesthetic appeal, said the press note. “She was aware of the follow-up treatments that might be needed after SRS. But, she complained of medical negligence and sought a huge compensation,” said the note. It said that the hospital management had promised her medical documents to help her seek legal recourse. The statement said the management was willing to help with follow-up treatment considering her financial situation but declined certain demands that they were not legally bound to undertake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/anannyahs-friends-and-family-allege-medical-negligence/articleshow/84623410.cms||---

Madurai MP Su Venkatesan has demanded the corporation to explain on what basis this circular was issued.The circular dated July 10 stated that the RSS chief would be participating in various functions in Madurai from July 22 to 26 and the employees were directed to keep all the facilities including the roads and streetlights in good condition. The circular also stated that Bhagawat would be participating in events in Sathya Sai Nagar in the fourth zone of the Madurai Corporation and everything should be kept in good condition. Workers of the fourth zone of the corporation said that they had received instructions to keep the roads clean for the leader’s visit. CPM district secretary R Vijayarajan said this was condemnable, as it was something that had not been in practice till now. Corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan said this circular was a routine one issued whenever a high security VIP visited any area. It should be ensured that no road works are underway and that it is free of potholes and has proper lighting. “There is nothing extraordinary about the circular, but for some reason it has become viral,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/circular-on-rss-chiefs-visit-to-madurai-city-causes-uproar/articleshow/84622559.cms||---

The chamber, on the first floor of the building, caught fire around 5.30am. According to police, short circuit that originated from an electric wiring inside the chamber led to the fire. At least six cops from the DRO office were stuck for around one-and-a-half hours when the fire broke out. However, it did not spread beyond the first floor. At least five fire tenders responded to the call and the fire was brought under control around 7am when the fire department personnel brought down the cops trapped in the building. It was around 7.50am that the fire department finally called off their operation. “The losses are being estimated. The entire chamber, complete with furniture, television and other items, have been reduced to ashes. There were some files and we are ascertaining the specific documents lost in the fire. Since it was early morning, not many officers were at the office,” said an officer from ESD division. A forensic team later visited the spot to collect evidence and ascertain the exact cause of fire. DC (ESD) Priyabrata Roy stated that the forensic team, prima facie, has pointed to a short circuit in an electrical light connection as the cause of fire. Lalbazar sources said they had not yet decided where to shift the DCP office. “We will try to operate from the present office. In case it is not possible, we might choose a temporary office at either Beliaghata or Phoolbagan police station,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-stuck-in-morning-blaze-at-dcp-office/articleshow/84622581.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||India||Sidhu’s show of strength brings relief for Cong brass||NEW DELHI: Navjot Singh Sidhu’s mega Amritsar show has pleased the Congress leadership which believes that its decision to appoint the cricketer-turned politician as Punjab party chief has been accepted by the cadre, crucially by MLAs who turned up in good numbers. It is learnt that Sidhu will attend the PCC office on Friday with leaders invited in large numbers. But the force with which Sidhu has gone ahead after his appointment contrasts with the vehement opposition from CM Amarinder Singh who is insistent that his critic apologise for his derogatory tweets. The demand has till now been met with stone-cold silence. The vertical split between the CM and the state unit chief, complicated by the stand of 10 MPs against Sidhu, has created a piquant situation and the parallel tracks from the two state Congress heads have to meet somewhere for the party to move ahead with preparation for the 2022 election campaign. Pressure is rising on the CM to relent on his insistence on apology and accept Sidhu. Many believe that unless a meeting point is found, one of them will have to “either give in or step away”. This has been behind the repeated speculation about the CM’s resignation, which has been denied. Given that Congress leadership has not signalled any move to replace Singh as CM, party functionaries are at a loss to figure out how the situation would be resolved. It is said the leadership may call Singh and Sidhu to the capital for a joint meeting, a move that again will revolve around the CM's insistence that the new PCC chief tender an apology. As Sidhu moved ahead with rallying support with a clever move to invite partymen to pay obeisance at the Golden Temple on Wednesday, which is seen as above partisan politics, the turnout of MLAs actually turned into a bitter duel of competing claims. While the Sidhu camp said 62 MLAs joined him in Amritsar, the CM loyalists were insistent that the number was only 40, including three ministers. “How is the turnout of MLAs any issue when nobody asked them not to go. It should not be read as a vote for Sidhu or against Singh,“ an angry Congress functionary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sidhus-show-of-strength-brings-relief-for-cong-brass/articleshow/84624968.cms||---

Health minister Veena George, on Wednesday, directed the health department director to launch an immediate probe in this case. The organization working for the protection of transgenders’ rights has also petitioned the minister. “An expert committee would be formed to study the issues associated with SRS,” said the office of the minister.

The meeting of transgender justice board will be held on July 23 to explore options to mitigate the problems faced by transgenders in general,” said a statement from the minister’s office. Bindu said a protocol would soon be prepared to ensure that SRS is conducted scientifically, without flaws. “Government will explore the possibility of setting up trans-clinics to address the mental and physical problems faced by the community and steps would be taken to end the exploitation of transgenders by some institutions,” she said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/transgenders-death-social-welfare-health-depts-order-probe/articleshow/84623428.cms||---

The rescue operation lasted more than 90 minutes, during which, the reptile too sustained a minor injury,” Jadhav said. The rescued reptile is being treated and is scheduled for release in its natural habitat after being kept under observation. Listed under Schedule I (endangered species that need rigorous protection) of Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972, monitor lizards are known for long tail and forked tongue among other distinguished body features. Honorary wildlife warden for Aurangabad Kishor Pathak said the population of monitor lizards is on the decline due to diminishing habitats and poaching, among other reasons. “These reptiles have important role in the biodiversity due to huge range of food habits. The creature usually stays away from humans and therefore does not pose any threat unless provoked,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/monitor-lizard-rescued-from-industrial-unit-in-shendra/articleshow/84620603.cms||---

On the first day of the CET application website which was opened on July 20, students faced snags and the website crashed several times. Some students were able to fill up the forms while many faced issues logging in. A statement issued by the board stated that the website: http://cet.mh-ssc.ac.in will remain shut till further notice. The announcement regarding revival of the website for filling the forms would be announced soon, the statement said. Several students from the 15 lakh who recently passed Std X have taken to social media platforms to complain about the problems they faced while filling up the application form for the optional Common Entrance Test (CET) for admission to the First Year of Junior College (FYJC). The problems range from the server to the website closing down abruptly while the student is still filling up the form. Many students have also requested an option to edit their already submitted forms because of errors. An official from one of the nine divisional boards whose numbers have been given as helpline numbers said, “There have been many calls from students. The complaints are even more in urban areas where the centralised admission process is followed for FYJC admissions. Most students have said they were either unable to log in, probably due to poor network or load on the server or that the session stopped abruptly. If lakhs of students log in to the website at the same time, some technical errors are bound to happen as even the board is doing this for the first time.” Some students have said that while filling up the form they selected the wrong taluka, while others said that the form was submitted but they were unable to download it and take a printout.  The state board had said earlier that the exam centres will be allotted to students based on the taluka/city division selected by them while applying for the entrance exam, hence selecting the taluka or selecting the medium of examination correctly is of paramount importance. Mukund Andhalkar, coordinator of Maharashtra State Junior College Teachers’ Organisation said that the organisation will be speaking to the board officials about the problems faced by the students. “Students should be given at least an option to edit their forms in case they have made mistakes while filling the form and also to take a printout if that could not be done earlier. Otherwise, an unnecessary technical glitch will cause a lot of problems later,” said Andhalkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/website-for-fyjc-entrance-shut-down-over-glitches/articleshow/84623422.cms||Ardhra Nair

Images of the duo at work went viral on social media and drew appreciation from netizens. Constables Sanjay Wagh and Sahebrao Chavan from Mulund traffic chowky were on duty near Maharana Pratap Chowk on Tuesday amid the downpour. They noticed a snaking queue of vehicles and decided to investigate it. The cops soon found two large craters in the middle of LBS Road that were causing the snarl-up. They informed the BMC control room but when the civic employees did not turn up, they decided to do the job themselves. “Construction work was going on nearby but no worker was around. The two cops went over to the site, loaded debris onto a wheelbarrow and picked up a spade,” said a traffic police officer. They wheeled the debris to the pockmarked stretch and filled up the potholes. The congestion cleared soon after. “Motorists were inconvenienced and our colleagues often face the brunt as we are posted on the streets through the day,” said the officer. “We never appreciate and thank enough @MumbaiPolice for always being there for people.. @nitin_gadkari @mybmc people are paying toll for using this so called LBS marg.. there’s not even a stretch of kilometers without potholes,” tweeted a netizen, Pratham. Ramesh Mulchandani tweeted, “Work of corporation is done by Traffic police, Great job! Police should file cases on officials for such bad condition of roads.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-do-the-spadework-on-potholes-at-mulund/articleshow/84624041.cms||---

Dr Vagish Katariya, a paediatrician, said he agrees with ICMR’s statement and feels primary kids must be encouraged to return to classrooms. “The receptors in our body on which the Covid-19 virus latches on are not present in high numbers in kids and that’s why transmissibility is very low. Also, in my clinic, I have seen that the majority of kids have antibodies even though there is currently no vaccine for them. So, there is a very strong case for reopening of primary schools and functioning as per the standard operating procedures (SOPs) laid down by the government for schools,” said Dr Katariya. Dr Nitin Shinde, infectious disease specialist, said, “It’s important to understand two things here. One is that students below 11 years won’t spread the virus, so it’s the adults around them who need to be vaccinated. Second is that schools can be reopened with environmental mitigation in place like keeping windows open and restricting the number of students in a classroom,” said Dr Shinde. Ritu Sharma, principal of Delhi Public School (Kamptee Road), said that primary section students are ready for the ‘new normal’. “It’s been over a year and these kids have become used to living with Covid-appropriate behaviour. They are aware of precautions to take and with mentoring at school level, it will definitely be safe. Schools are taking a lot of precautions and follow all the SOPs issued by the government,” said Sharma. However, some experts said precautions need to be taken despite all these things. Dr Sanjay Marathe, an expert on vaccinology, said the school environment’s safety is important. “The smaller kids are not independent, so that puts a lot of onus on the caretakers to take a lot of precaution. It’s obvious that schools have to be reopened ultimately, but the safest mode is to have 70% of the local population vaccinated. School staff have to be definitely vaccinated,” said Dr Marathe. Mrunalini Dasture, principal of South Public School, said it’s better to err on the side of caution. “ICMR data about anti-bodies being present in majority of people needs to be looked at in a localized manner as the situation may differ from city to city. Apart from that, it will be a bit difficult to manage primary kids who may not always follow rules due to their age,” said Dasture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/medicos-academics-want-primary-kids-back-in-school/articleshow/84622645.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Periyasamy, who was elected as MLA from the Athoor constituency, inspected sites for setting up the CTP in Chinnalapatti on Tuesday to fulfil his poll promise to people in his constituency. Secretary of the Sungudi sari manufacturers’ association in Chinnalapatti, N Gunasekharan, said that their life had come to a standstill seven years ago when their power connections to the dyeing and printing units were disconnected due to lack of a treatment facility for the effluents. While inspecting the site, the minister said that the weavers not only in Chinnalapatti but also other parts of Tamil Nadu could use a similar CTP for their dyeing units. “There were over 5,000 families, which were flourishing through the making of these saris, which are tied and dyed, and to this day, we make pure cotton saris,” Gunasekharan said. It is a trade that employs more than 40% women, who can work from their homes at their convenience and earn Rs 200 for tying 20 saris with the sungudis. M Sugumar, another weaver said that the minister kept his promise to them that they would get relief as soon as the DMK government came to power in the state. It was not just the weaving units, but tea shops, eateries all thrived in the region and people had a good income, but the closure of the shops led to the livelihood of all these people being affected, he said. R A Krishnan, a weaver from Chinnalapatti said that the setting up of the plant would definitely help the entire region and bring back many people, who had migrated to other places and were finding it difficult to make ends meet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/minister-fulfils-poll-promise-announces-ctp-for-weavers/articleshow/84622639.cms||---

With potholes cropping up at many places and muddy patches here and there, passengers travelling with heavy luggage face immense difficulties while entering and exiting the station daily. “These pathways have not been relayed for a long time. Many a times, cabs and auto rickshaws drop passengers outside the station building, forcing them to walk to the station with their luggage. It has become impossible for them to walk considering the condition of the road. It is strange that the rail authorities have not paid attention to the difficulties faced by passengers,” a passenger said. Manoj Jhawar, public relations officer, Pune rail division, said that a letter has been sent to the Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Limited (IRSDC) to repair the pathways. A railway official said on Wednesday that the IRSDC has started patch work on the broken pathways. The pathways towards the second entry used by passengers to enter platform number 6 is also in poor condition. “On the one hand, there is the state-of-the-art station like Gandhinagar and on the other, there is the Pune station, which, despite being a heritage building, has such basic problems. Last month, my sister-in-law twisted her ankle as she was hurrying towards the station to catch a train,” Aloke Hingle, who lives in Raviwar Peth, said. The facility management of the Pune station was handed over to the IRSDC in 2019. The IRSDC appointed a private company, Bharat Vikas Group (BVG), for the job. Autorickshaw drivers waiting for customers at the station said that passengers were facing many issues. “We have seen wheels of suitcases breaking on these pathways. There are many passengers who take PMPML buses and walking to the station building on broken pathways is a problem,” an autorickshaw driver said. An IRSDC official said that the pathways were a concern. “We had several plans, but things have taken a backseat due to the pandemic,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pathways-on-pune-station-premises-broken-passengers-inconvenienced/articleshow/84623432.cms||Joy Sengupta

Additional session judge P M Gupta ordered the release of Jafar Ahmed Shaikh on bail on furnishing of personal bond of Rs 50,000 and imposed other conditions. On May 2, the complainant visited Shaikh’s Thane office to enquire about a shop when the alleged incident happened. She also accused him of threatening to harm her and her ch-ild if she disclosed the incident to anyone. She alleged that he tried to rape her again on May 16. On May 19, she lodged a co-mplaint and he was arrested. Shaikh’s lawyer Sunil Pandey argued that she reported the incident after 17 days and alleged that she and her friend framed the builder to extract money from him. Opposing the bail plea, police said there is enough material to show that he has committed the offence. The court said the woman had paid 10% of the cost by cheque though her bank account was inactive since March. Also she wore the same dress on her second visit though the FIR said it was torn when she was allegedly raped on May 2, and while the FIR said she was div-orced, in her chats with the builder she said her husband died of cancer. “On the occurrence of such a serious incident, the natural conduct of a woman will be to cut all relations with the accused, instead she was in contact with him...”the court said, adding that the chargesheet has been filed and there is less possibility that he may abscond if released on bail.

That too will be a reality soon for the 49-year-old who has travelled to 130 countries and has documented his experiences for Malayalis across the world. He is set to become India’s first space tourist, having booked his seat back in 2007 in one of the proposed paid commercial space flights to be launched by Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic. The globetrotter is really pumped up about his journey following the space trips made by Branson earlier this month and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos on Tuesday. “Branson’s trip indicates that the stage is set for the launch of commercial flights for tourists like me,” says Santhosh who figures that space is the next big thing for humans. “People don’t know whether earth will be a safe place to reside in another 100 years. The climatic changes and pandemics are just indications of things to come. So, colonization will start in other planets soon,” he says, adding that companies will be racing against each other in space exploration, and that he is hoping to hop on a space flight by the year-end or next year-beginning.  Santhosh with Richard BransonSanthosh had booked his seat for $2.5 lakh at a time when people knew little about the project. “Commercial space flights were just a distant hope at that time. But I have been waiting since then,” he says. Santhosh has visited Virgin Galactic’s spaceports at Mojave desert in the US and in New Mexico for flight training: Zero gravity, G-tolerance, etc. The expenses for the trainings were additional. Santhosh has been receiving updates about the project on a weekly basis. When asked whether he will catch the first commercial flight, he said he is not sure about it. “Only four people can travel in one flight. Each batch will be decided based on various criteria. As of now, I know that I will be in one of the early flights to the space and the first Indian to do so,” he said. Santhosh had begun his solo journeys across the globe with a video camera in 1997. The informative documentaries he made about his foreign trips have made him immensely popular and a familiar TV face. He plans to carry a camera along with him to space as well. “I never travel without a camera. More than me seeing things, I want viewers to see, learn and experience from my trips,” he says. He said he will beam across his preparations for the voyage for viewers to see. “None of the Indians or Keralites have gone through such an experience. Showing it to them is what thrills me,” he says. “Though there are around six cameras inside the spacecraft I will have a video camera with me to capture the moments which the inbuilt cameras may miss. I had sought permission for it at the time of booking my ticket. For them it was interesting as I was becoming a space tourist representing around 130 crores of people. They knew my camera will be opening the outer space before a huge population,” he says. Santhosh owns a publishing house named Labour India and an exploration channel Safari TV based out of his native town Marangattupally in Kottayam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/indias-first-space-tourist-is-launch-ready/articleshow/84623467.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

Precautions were taken on the premises and hand sanitisers were installed.”Ajmer Dargah didn’t allow anyone to read namaz on its premises. Syed Wahid Hussain, secretary, Anjuman committee, said, “Although the Dargah is open for visitors, we didn’t allow any one for namaz as it would have increased the number of people. For special occasions, we have decided not to open the Dargah. Safety is important that will not hamper the enjoyment of celebration.”This year, due to economic crisis, people have avoided qurbani and the rate of meat has also plummeted. Jaipur Meat Association president, Pappu Qureshi said, “So many people faced economic crisis which impacted the festival as well. People instead sacrificed animals in groups to share the expenses. The rate of meat as well as of animals was low in the market due to less demand. This will continue until the end of pandemic,” Qureshi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/eid-al-adha-celebrated-across-state-amid-covid/articleshow/84623430.cms||---

The transport department has issued a public notice asking tourist taxi operators whose vehicle registration numbers end with 0 or 1, to ensure fitment by July 24, failing which their vehicle permits would be cancelled. NGTTOA president Vasudev Arlekar said that the association members are of the firm view that they will continue to oppose the fitment of meters till the government revokes permission for GoaMiles. He said that taxi owners are having a problem with the payment for the fitment of digital meters as they have to pay more than Rs 11,000 as they had no business during the pandemic. NGTTA vice-president Ravindra Vengurlekar has denied that he made any statement urging tourist taxi owners to fit digital taxi meters. AGBOA president Sudeep Tamhankar said that a notice has been issued to the department of transport with an ultimatum to immediately withdraw its decision on the mandatory fitment of digital meters. Tamhankar said no taxi which has national permit, as per rules, has to use fare meter. “Does any taxi getting tourists from other states into use meter system?” he asked.

Police have stepped up action following a noticeable increase in the number of usury complaints received over the last few days.Superintendent of police (SP) of Tuticorin district S Jayakumar on Wednesday issued a warning that usurers would be detained under the Goondas Act in addition to other stringent legal action taken against them. “Many have lost their jobs due to the pandemic and have been economically impacted. This has made it difficult for them to repay the loans they obtained for exorbitant interest rates,” he said.Recently, the Tuticorin Central police and the Alwarthirunagari police arrested two usurers based on complaints of threat. Search was for a few more people, the SP added.Dindigul district SP Ravali Priya has formed seven special teams, each led by an officer in the rank of deputy superintendent of police (DSP) at one each in all the seven sub divisions in the district. The teams were formed following an increase in complaints of harassment by usurers in the district.Police sources said that only two cases were registered in the district under the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Charging Exorbitant Interest Act, 2003, in 2020. But seven such cases have been registered under the Act in the first six months of this year.

Their importance and utility have been validated during the Covid pandemic, with citizens being forced to do most of their work online. When citizens have been told not to visit civic offices for work because of the pandemic, the least the municipal departments can do is to ensure that people get all updated information online. Utilities like the Maharashtra state electricity distribution company have shown how IT can be an effective tool in enhancing the ease of doing business. ==== Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has asked all its departments to appoint two nodal IT officers to regularly update information related to their initiatives, projects and schemes on various social media platforms. The civic activists, who have been complaining about lack of citizen-centric updates in the public domain, said that the PMC’s latest decision to appoint IT nodal officers should not remain on paper and it should be executed well to keep the citizens updated. The PMC established a social media cell in 2015. However, regular visitors to these platforms and the website said that the information is not updated on a regular basis. Some of the updates are so old that information related to particular projects has not been changed even after their completion. Civic activists said that information related to departments like solid waste management, road development, water supply and anti-encroachment should be updated frequently. As per the new plan, IT nodal officers will regularly provide information on social media platforms and the officers of the departments concerned are expected to address the concerns raised by citizens. The circular was issued recently by additional municipal commissioner Kunal Khemnar. According to the circular, over 60 departments and offices of PMC have not provided details of IT nodal officers and not uploaded information in the prescribed format with the IT department till last week. The departments have been told to complete the process within the next few days so that the latest information can reach the IT department to be uploaded on social media platforms. The PMC has activated official accounts on social media platforms, but activists have claimed that the information available on these platforms is either inadequate or old. Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch said, “It is the responsibility of every department head to provide latest information to keep citizens aware about its works. Sadly, it is not happening at the administrative level as the website and other platforms are full of old information. This is forcing citizens to visit the offices to get the latest information.” Amey Waghmare, a resident of Shivajinagar, said, “The civic body should provide basic information like contacts of sanitary inspectors and anti-encroachment officers from every ward office on social media platforms for the benefit of citizens who find it difficult to locate the officials concerned. On many occasions, officers are not available on landline numbers.” Another activist, Abhijit More, said that the PMC’s complaint redressal mechanism is not always effective as on many occasions the registered complaints are closed without being resolved. “Hence, while updating the latest information, the authorities should also look into the redressal mechanism,” he said.

Aware, who is serving at a zilla parishad-run school at Sawarkheda-khurd village in Sillod taluka, spent more than three-and-a-half years making the award-winning painting. “The Ajanta Caves have always fascinated me as an artist. While different ancient paintings at this heritage site had caste a spell on me since childhood, I decided to recreate some of them on my own. I started working on my first painting, which has won the accolades, in October 2017 and completed it by June 2020,” he said. Made using oil paints, the painting became a reality on a canvas of 148 x 51 inch, figuring Gautam Buddha and Padmapani among other characters portrayed at Ajanta Caves. “One of my friends saw my painting and told me to send it as an entry for Torso India. My work first got shortlisted in top 100 and later top 12, before being declared the top entry with a score of 17 out of 20,” Aware said. The 40-year-old primary school teacher said he was hopeful of fetching an attractive price for his art-work in the international market. “With my maiden painting completed, I am planning to start another painting. My dream is to recreate all the Ajanta paintings on canvas one by one,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/zp-teachers-painting-of-ajanta-caves-wins-prestigious-torso-india-award/articleshow/84620698.cms||---

Vice-Chancellor Dev Swarup said that in a press release by the Bar Council of India on June 16, strict instructions were issued that before giving affiliation to any new law college, see why and what is the need of it. “The Bar council had completely banned the approval of new law colleges in view of the increasing number of institutions and the declining quality. We have ample number of law colleges in the state and it would be better for us to focus on the quality of education given to students,” said Dev Swarup. In 20-21, 72 law colleges were given affiliation by Ambedkar Law University in which 11,902 students took admission in 14,717 approved seats of LLB. However, 2,815 seats are still vacant which can be seen as a cause of concern. Similarly, 1,145 students took admission in 1,640 seats of LLM and PG diploma and 495 seats remained vacant i.e. in session 20-21, more than 3,000 seats remained vacant in these colleges. In many law colleges of Rajasthan, there are not even enough students. In such a situation, Swarup said that what is the justification for giving affiliation to any new law college? “Rather, even among the working colleges, the college which does not fulfill the prescribed criteria will not be given affiliation.” He said that the university is committed to improve the quality of legal education in the state and will focus on the already existing colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-new-law-college-to-come-up-in-raj-this-session/articleshow/84623435.cms||---

The association in a letter to the registrar expressed displeasure over the stoic silence from the officials as the steps towards the formation of search committee should have started early this month. The letter was signed by office bearers of the MUFA including president M Buvaneswaran, general secretary K Sadasivam and treasurer J Balasubramaniam. The committee will have three members. While a member will be nominated by the government and chancellor of universities, the syndicate and senate will elect a member each through an election process. Office-bearers of MUFA said at least 14 days have to be given for filing nominations to contest in the election and additional seven days need to be given for withdrawal. The statues of the MKU Act, 1965 states that process of nominating the members of the search committee by the chancellor, the senate and the syndicate should begin six months before the probable date of occurrence of vacancy in the VC office. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/form-mku-vc-search-panel-urges-mufa/articleshow/84622646.cms||---
---||India||Judges must put selves in shoes of Parliament: SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has said that a judge, while interpreting a law, should try to understand the intent of legislative bodies and quashed the Madras HC verdict which had held that the court’s powers to “set aside” an arbitral award under the arbitration law would also include the power to modify. “Quite obviously if one were to include the power to modify an award in section 34 (Arbitration Act), one would be crossing the Lakshman Rekha... In interpreting a statutory provision, a judge must put himself in the shoes of the Parliament and then ask whether Parliament intended this result. Parliament very clearly intended that no power of modification of an award exists in section 34 of the Arbitration Act,” a bench of Justices R F Nariman and B R Gavai said. The bench said it is only for the Parliament to amend the provision in the light of the experience of courts in the working of the Arbitration Act, 1996, and bring it in line with other legislations the world over.  The court passed the order on an appeal filed by the Centre against the HC order. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the Arbitration Act, 1996, being based on the UN Commission on International Trade Law’s Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, 1985, has specifically restricted the grounds of challenge and the consequent remedy, which is only to set aside or remit in limited circumstances. The case pertains to the litigation on land acquisition for national highways 45 and 220. The bench, however, dismissed the appeal on facts. “Given that in several similar cases, NHAI has allowed similarly situated persons to receive compensation at a higher rate than awarded, and given the law laid down in Nagpur Improvement Trust, we decline to exercise our jurisdiction under Article 136 in favour of appellants on the facts of these cases,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/judges-must-put-selves-in-shoes-of-parliament-sc/articleshow/84624990.cms||---

After an event in Pimpri on Wednesday, he told reporters that the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) had urged its supporters not to put up any hoardings on his birthday on July 22. “If the supporters put up hoardings with birthday wishes, is that my fault?” he asked, adding that the police should take appropriate action. “If these hoardings are illegal, then the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), ruled by the BJP, should take action. I did not ask any party workers to put up illegal hoardings. I am a man who abides by the rules,” Ajit Pawar said. The commissioner, mayor, or the ones looking after Pimpri Chinchwad should act against such hoardings, he said. Former chief minister Devendra Fadanvis, who shares his birthday with Ajit Pawar, had also appealed to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) supporters not to put up any hoardings with birthday wishes. But scores of such hoardings have been put up across Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. On Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut’s statement that the next mayor of Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation would be from Shiv Sena, Ajit Pawar said every political leader makes such statements to inspire supporters. The civic body elections of the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations are scheduled next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/take-action-against-illegal-hoardings-with-birthday-wishes-ajit-pawar/articleshow/84623457.cms||---
---||Madurai||Residents can register for jab on new Madurai corpn link||Madurai: Residents of Madurai will have to register for vaccination in order to avoid crowds at the vaccination centres starting from Friday. This will also reduce the waiting time and avoid a situation where people are forced to return home without taking a shot due to unavailability of stock.A health official from Madurai Corporation said there will be a link available for registration on the corporation website from Friday. However, people in the priority groups like pregnant women and their husbands, parents having children less than one-year-old, differently-abled and their guardians do not need to register themselves. Officials said those, who do not have internet facilities and do not possess the know-how, can register themselves by walking into the nearest vaccination centres. Those who registered for the vaccine will receive the information such as time slot and the vaccination centre allotted to them the night before the vaccination day. “Office-goers will be relieved a lot as they can make themselves available at the particular time slot. It would be sufficient if they get permission for an hour,” said a corporation official.Vaccination is being done through urban primary health centres and special camps. Around 4,000 vaccines are being administered in a day on an average, given the availability of vaccine stock. Often, they run out of stocks due to lack of supply. There is a demand for Covaxin in particular, as people are finding it difficult to get it for a second shot, a health official from the corporation said adding that those who have got the first shot can take the second shot even if the time stipulated by the government has elapsed. Residents have welcomed the registration system offered by the civic body. “It is a welcome step as it would help people get exact slot timings and bring down waiting time. However, instead of registration through a website, easier methods could have been introduced. There are many ways available at present to raise requests through sms or IVRS, which can be done without a smart phone,” V P Manikandan, a social activist said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/residents-can-register-for-jab-on-new-madurai-corpn-link/articleshow/84622673.cms||V Devanathan

---||Mumbai||Mucormycosis crisis receding but 169 still in public hospitals in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Mucormycosis, the fungal infection that swept through the country in the May-June period, saw 825 post-Covid patients needing admission to various city hospitals and specialised injections costing over Rs 18 crore. Around 20% of these patients died due to complications, and about two-thirds of them hailed from outside Mumbai. While the “mucor crisis” is ebbing with barely one or two new admissions on some days, 169 patients are still admitted in various civic and state government hospitals for the injections that are given free. Each patients needs six vials of the injection for 25 days. “Since May 25, KEM Hospital, as the nodal centre in the city, recieved and distributed 31,248 vials of amphotericin B to the patients registered in the city,” said KEM Hospital dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh. Data available for 806 patients till last week showed 237 were from Mumbai while 569 were from outside the city. “Roughly 30% of the patients were from Mumbai,” said Dr Deshmukh. Studies done on mucormycosis patients in the past three months showed that most of them had diabetes and had received steroids as part of their Covid treatment. “We have found that each patient needed one to three surgeries but some with residual infection are still getting admitted to public hospitals,” said Dr Deshmukh. As private hospitals charge over Rs 20 lakh for the entire treatment, including surgeries, some patients sought admissions to public hospitals such as KEM after undergoing partial treatment in the private sector. Several public hospitals also used the conventional amphotericin B, which costs a fraction of the newer one, for younger patients. “If we found that someone had higher creatinine (an indicator of kidney function) levels, then we would change them to the liposomal amphotericin B,” said the doctor. Meanwhile, the central government released data on Tuesday showing that since May 11 it has distributed 8,14,323 vials of amphotericin (liposomal) to various states. Of these, Maharashtra got 1,52,770 injections. The government also distributed 38,652 conventional amphotericin medicine; of these, 9,190 were given to Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mucor-crisis-receding-but-169-still-in-public-hosps/articleshow/84622730.cms||---

---||Mumbai||MVA set to raise Maratha quota in House, with PM Modi||MUMBAI: The MVA government is cranking up its efforts to secure a Maratha reservation, with attempts to raise the issue in both Houses of Parliament during the ongoing monsoon session and seeking to follow it up with PM Narendra Modi. Shiv Sena MP Vinayak Raut (party leader in the LS) has moved an adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha to hold a debate on the Maratha quota issue. His colleague Sanjay Raut said in Delhi they are seeking an appointment with Modi next week after speaking on phone with Thackeray, who suggested meeting the PM to discuss the issues pertaining to the state a month after he had raised them with him. “We will seek an appointment with PM Modi next week to follow up on Maratha quota and other issues raised by CM Thackeray in a memorandum handed over to him,” said Raut. Ashok Chavan, state PWD minister and chairperson of the state cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservation, met Mallikarjun Kharge, Congress’ leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha, requesting him to raise the Maratha issue in parliament. On junior minister Raosaheb Danve’s comment that the Sena leader should study the Maratha issue in detail, Raut said: “If the issue could be sorted out with his coaching, I am ready to take it as he stays nearby. But we don’t need to take coaching from him. They should dare to give quota in government jobs and in education for Marathas first before trying to teach us.” He pointed out that Ashok Chavan, a former CM, discussed some legal aspects related to the reservation issue with him in the morning. A delegation of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government led by CM Thackeray had met the PM on June 8 to push for demands, including a constitutional amendment to expand reservations beyond the 50% ceiling to accommodate the Maratha quota.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mva-set-to-raise-maratha-quota-in-house-with-pm/articleshow/84624071.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Pune||Pune: Duo trigger blast at ATM kiosk near Chakan, flee with Rs 29 lakh||PUNE: Two persons triggered a blast using an improvised explosive device (IED) at a cash dispensing machine of a non-banking entity and fled with Rs 29 lakh in the early hours of Wednesday at Bhamboli Phata on Chakan-Shive Road, about 40km from the city. “There was Rs 40 lakh in the automated teller machine (ATM). We have found Rs 10.93 lakh in another cash tray,” Manchak Ipper, the deputy commissioner of police of Pimpri Chinchwad, told TOI. Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash told TOI, “We shall be filing a case against the agency managing that particular ATM, as they did not take proper security measures. According to the Reserve Bank of India’s guidelines, the banks and the agencies must take appropriate precautions at the ATMs not located in highly secured areas like airports.” Krishna Prakash said, “We have obtained the CCTV footage of the suspects and have fanned team to trace them. Prima facie, they used trinitroglycerin to trigger the blast to steal cash. There is no terrorism or Maoists angle behind it.” Ipper said the police saw two men on a motorcycle in CCTV footage. “Teams of the Pimpri Chinchwad police, ATS, Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad, and Institute of IED Management of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) are probing the case of the industrial belt. Some industries use explosives like gelatine for their work. We are checking if the explosives were procured from any of these industries,” Ipper said. Ipper said, “Stealing cash from an ATM by conducting blast is a new trend. Two days ago, similar modus was used at an ATM kiosk in Ranjangaon MIDC. But the suspects could not steal the cash.” Krishna Prakash said, “Such modus was used in Madhya Pradesh also.” A senior member of the team of experts from the Institute of IED Management of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) said, “Prima facie we found that the suspects had used high intensity explosives to carry out the blast. We have collected samples to identify the explosives.” He said the suspects entered the kiosk by breaking the locks of the shutter. They then planted the explosives at the cash dispensing machine, came out and downed the shutters. “Within five minutes, the explosion may have happened. They then took out the cash from the mangled machine and drove away. They could not see the other tray containing the cash,” he said. Somnath Pinjan, the owner of the space where the machine was installed at Bhamboli Phata, rushed out hearing the blast. But he had to run back after one of suspects threatened to shoot him. Somnath had rented out the space on the ground floor of his single-storied under-construction house about six months ago for installing the ATM. “All ATMs in our area stop operating after 8pm. On Tuesday night, this kiosk’s shutters were also pulled down,” Machhindra Pinjan, a relative of Somnath, said. Machhindra said he had heard a loud noise outside around 2.30am. “It was raining then, and the wind was strong. Thinking some accident may have happened, I ignored it. Around 4am, Somnath called me on my cellphone. He told me about the blast and how he was threatened,” Machhindra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/duo-trigger-blast-at-atm-kiosk-near-chakan-flee-with-rs29-lakh/articleshow/84623471.cms||Mihir Tanksale

He told reporters on Wednesday, “The central leadership is seized of the issue and a decision will be taken at the earliest.” He added that, “We had indepth discussion with the central leadership to strengthen the party in the state. We are also in touch with them. The Congress tradition is that of ascertaining different views and arriving at a final decision by the party which will be acceptable to all,” he said. He said our suggestion is to strengthen the party. “We gave our suggestion with the objective of the Congress returning to power with more seats,” he said. Pilot said those leaders who fought to bring the party to power did not get any position. The Congressmen deserves dignity and honour. “Those who gave whatever they had for the party, braved sticks and worked day and night, even if those people don’t get a post, they should be respected. This is what our current president also says,” he said Replying to a question on the depleting strength of the Congress to take on the BJP, he claimed that that Congress is the only opposition party which has its footprint all over the country and could take on the BJP nationally. He added that the Congress would prove its mettle in the upcoming assembly polls. “We had won some states and lost in some other places, but it is the Congress which has the ability to take on the BJP,” he said. He said the people suffering under price rise, unemployment and now with the snooping controversy would vote out the BJP in the coming elections. He demanded an independent probe into the snooping row. He said it not only involves privacy, but national security as even the Union ministers’ phones were under surveillance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pilot-optimistic-over-early-resolution-of-differences-in-state-cong/articleshow/84623464.cms||---

---||Delhi||Farmers' protest in Delhi: Intel agencies issue alert, US asks citizens to be cautious||NEW DELHI: While farmers’ organisations have been permitted to move 200 of their members protesting at Delhi’s borders to Jantar Mantar from Thursday till August 9, intelligence agencies have issued alerts about the Khalistani organisation, Sikhs For Justice, provoking people to reach Delhi with the kesri flag and kirpans and “capture” Parliament and about more protesters arriving in the capital by trains. The farmers, protesting against three agrarian laws since November last year, plan to hold a Kisan Sansad at Jantar Mantar coinciding with the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament, complete with a ‘speaker’ and ‘deputy speaker’ every day to oversee discussions on agricultural issues. TimesViewAt a time when public gatherings are being disallowed to prevent spread of the virus, it is unfortunate that a separate yardstick seems to apply to the farmers. Delhi Police should have refused permission. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that politics has determined its stance. We hope that the city will not witness the kind of unruly scenes it did on an earlier occasion.Intelligence agencies pointed out that in a video, designated terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun asks his followers and the agitating farmers to “break the country”. Pannun also asks them not to hold up the Indian flag during the protests this time. The new video had security agencies on high alert because of the reach and influence Pannun exerts on his followers. The agencies said they were taking all steps to prevent a situation of the sort that took place on January 26, when violence broke out after the protesters were allowed a tractor rally into the city. On that occasion too, Pannun had made a similar appeal which was heard playing out at Red Fort, leading Delhi Police’s Special Cell to file an FIR. Sikhs for Justice and Pannun's appeal are also mentioned in the chargesheet filed by Delhi Police in the Red Fort rioting case. Meanwhile, the United States issued a security alert for its citizens in India on Wednesday. While asking them to take steps for their own safety in view of the farmers' protest, it also advised them to avoid sensitive areas like Parliament House, crowds, demonstrations and to monitor local media for news updates. In a statement, the US embassy said, “We are aware of media reports of possible demonstrations in and around New Delhi on July 21 and 22 by farmers and counter-protesters. Previous such protests have sometimes led to violence." Noting that the likelihood and location of actual protests were unknown, the embassy said that the farmers' unions had requested permission for 200 protesters to walk to Parliament to protest the new farm laws.

---||Pune||Soon, facial recognition for online learners licence test in Maharashtra||PUNE: The state transport department plans to introduce an artificial intelligence-based facial recognition system from next week to stop proxy candidates appearing for the online learners’ licence test. “The online examination started last month and has become popular. But there is information about people using proxy candidates to get the learners’ licences that are valid for six months. Keeping this in mind, the transport department has been looking for an artificial intelligence (AI)-based system that can stop such malpractices,” an official in the transport department said. The Aadhaar card is linked with the application of a candidate. “Once a candidate applies for the online test, she or he gets a one time password (OTP) to unlock the examination. A system is being developed wherein the applicant’s photograph will be first authenticated by comparing it with the photograph on the Aadhaar card before the candidate starts writing the answers. The test will only start for a candidate if her or his photograph matches at least 90% with the one on the Aadhaar card. We hope to roll out the system by next week,” another official said. The official said several systems, including verification of IP addresses to ascertain whether many people were appearing for the test through a single system (computer), were tested. “But the facial recognition system was found to be most effective,” the official said. State transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne had last month said AI-based systems were being tested by the National Informatics Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/facial-recognition-for-online-learners-licence-tests-likely-from-next-week/articleshow/84623483.cms||Joy Sengupta

Dotasra said, the examination for selection to RAS is conducted in a transparent manner and only capable candidates succeed in it.Dotasra's statement has come amid the ongoing discussion on social media and opposition over the selection. Deputy leader of Opposition in the state assembly and BJP MLA Rajendra Rathore also took to Twitter, sharing photos of marksheets."Whether this is a coincidence or an experiment, only God knows. Anything can happen anytime," Rathore said.Opposition leader Gulab Chand Kataria in a statement said, “The ruling Congress state president and state education minister Govind Singh Dotasara, who boasts of being very capable, fair and honest, but these results and the marks obtained by his relatives have put many question marks on his ability and honesty, whose answer is to be given to the Chief Minister.” All his family members got 80 percent marks in the interview, is surprising. He said there is all reason to suspect that the interview was manipulated. He said some candidates who secured 100% in written exams were given 25 marks in the interview. In the recently released results, both relatives of the state Congress chief had scored 80 marks in the interview. Dotasra said, "It should not be an issue who got how many numbers as interview is for only for 100 marks but before an interview, one has to pass the preliminary and main examination after which interviews are held."He said there is no basis for this controversy. People who are not selected, they run such propaganda, he said.Dotasra said if he had any influence, then he would have made several people of his Assembly constituency and the rest of family members as RAS officers.Dotasra' son Avinash had also passed the RAS examination in 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-wrongdoing-in-selection-of-kin-in-ras-dotasra/articleshow/84623474.cms||---

Ramganj SHO Banwari Lal Meena said the accused was a drug addict and could not even recall how many thefts he had committed. The accused demanded drugs soon after his arrest. “He told the lockup guard that he would smack his head. The guard informed me, so we immediately deployed two more guards. There is already CCTV camera to keep tabs on him,” he said.Police said the accused snatched mobiles and purses to pay for smack. “The accused committed several thefts across multiple police station areas including Lal Kothi, Bhatta Basti, and Vidhyadhar Nagar,” Meena said.Police said it took them several hours to calm down the accused who was agitating due to the after-effects of the drugs. “He is a skilled tailor, but ventured into the world of crime to pay for his smack addiction. He stole everything he could find to buy more drugs,” Meena said.Ramganj police also arrested three others who stole coolers and sold them to pay to buy drugs. The three were identified as Nizamuddin (18), Sirajuddin, and (20) Mohsin. Police said all three would steal any cooler that they could find and carry it on a motorcycle and sell it to a scrap dealer.“It is very difficult to control the accused who are addicts because they can easily hurt themselves. But we have made special arrangements to ensure their safety,” Meena said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/accused-in-lockup-demands-drugs-from-cops-threatens-to-hurt-self/articleshow/84623468.cms||---
---||Pune||Fraudsters in Pune dupe woman of Rs 18 lakh with gift bait||PUNE: A man, who claimed to be based in the United Kingdom, cheated a 43-year-old foreign language teacher from Wanowrie to the tune of Rs 18 lakh after promising to send an expensive gift to her, the police said. The crime took place in December 2020 and January, this year. The woman lodged an FIR with the Wanowrie police station on Tuesday. Inspector SP Salgaonkar of Wanowrie police station said, “The woman runs foreign language coaching facilities in Wanowrie and Kondhwa.” According to the FIR, the woman accepted the man’s friend request on her social networking profile in December 2020. The man claimed he was a medical practitioner based in UK. A police officer said, “The woman and the man started chatting with each other via online messenger service. While chatting, they also exchanged phone numbers. They chatted with each other for about 15 days and the man promised to send her an expensive gift from UK,” the officer said. “The complainant liked the gift idea and shared her address with him,” inspector Salgaonkar said. “In January, this year, the man called to inform her that he had dispatched the gift to her. A few days later, he called again and told her that the gift had reached an airport in India, but it had been impounded by customs officials,” Salgaonkar said. “He informed her that customs officials would release the gift only if the fee and some other charges are paid. The man told her that the officials could also act against her, if she did not pay up,” an officer said. “The man then shared bank account details of a woman with the victim. He claimed that the woman is a customs official. Following this, the woman transferred the money to an e-banking facility. The complainant used all her savings and fixed deposits (FD) to transfer the money to the suspicious account,” he said. The police have registered a case of criminal breach of trust, cheating, and invoked provisions of the Information Technology Act against the man as well as the operator of the suspicious bank account. Some months ago, an IT professional lost Rs 26 lakh to a similar online scam in which she was promised a valuable gift. The ‘free gift’ ploy is a popular phishing bait, wherein scammers target vulnerable individuals by offering to send them some form of tangible goods but before the transaction is completed the criminals seek funds from the victim. The lure of the gift is such that the victims give away large sums of money before realising that they have been tricked. In such matters, a crime is usually registered with the police many days after the funds are siphoned off.

The water level in Idukki reservoir on Wednesday was 2,364.24ft which is 32ft higher compared to same day last year. The water-level in the reservoir in the same day last year was 2,332.74 ft. The powerhouse generated 14.816 mu of electricity on Tuesday. For the shutters of the dam to be opened the water-level has to rise 16ft more, said officials. “Presently, the water level in the reservoir is over 10 feet below the ‘rule level’. The ‘rule level’ till August 1 has been fixed at 2,380.58 ft. KSEB called a review meeting and decided to increase the power generation in Idukki and Edamalayar dams,” said Supriya S, KSEB chief engineer (dam safety and DRIP). “The ‘rule curve’ was fixed after considering the monsoon pattern. But the unexpected rains have led the water-levels in the reservoirs to rise. Every 10 days KSEB, district disaster management authority, district collector and water resource department review the situation in the dams. When water levels rise to the ‘rule level’, we will immediately release the water to provide ‘flood cushion’ in the dams,” said the official. A KSEB official said that the storage levels in hydel dams are higher due to lower power generation. Due to the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown power consumption has largely reduced in the state resulting in an increase in water levels in the hydel dams. The rule curve is applicable for Idukki, Banasura Sagar, Edamalayar and Kakki dams, officials said. “The monsoon pattern has changed in the state. Some areas witness extreme rainfalls in short spells. This unexpected heavy rainfalls are leading to a rise in water levels in the hydel dams,” said climatologist Gopakumar Cholayil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kseb-ups-output-at-dams-in-idukki/articleshow/84623495.cms||Sandeep Thomas

This facility can be availed by selecting the ‘tax clearance certificate’ service option on ‘Parivahan’ portal and while it is applicable for every vehicle owner, officials claimed it would be particularly beneficial for commercial vehicle owners who have to pay tax every year. Transport commissioner Mahendra Soni said, “Most of the vehicle owners are techno-friendly. With this, they can now get TPC by applying online from home, office or any other place. Online will save time and time in commuting to offices. This facility can also be availed by personally attending transport offices. This will bring more transparency in the work of the department.” For availing the online service, the applicant has to go the transport department portal and apply for the certificate as well as select the RTO along with DTO. Following this the registration, chassis and engine number of the vehicle will have to be filled. On submission of the details, all information related to the vehicle will be visible. History of TPC will also be visible, in which if there is any kind of dues, a message will be sent to the owner’s mobile number to deposit it. In case of non-payment of dues, TPC will be approved by the transport officer through e-sign. After that the applicant can take a printout. TPC is important because in case of non-payment of tax, a fine of Rs 500 and the outstanding tax amount is levied.

---||Pune||Pune: Bakri Eid celebrations help bring inoculated family members together||PUNE: The pandemic has been a dampener for all festive celebrations since last year. But now, with everyone encouraged to get vaccinated, some sense of normalcy has returned to Eid-Al-Adha or Bakri Eid. “Every year, my parents and I spend the festival with my grandparents in Solapur. Last year, we could not travel because of the lockdown. Now, since everyone in the household has been vaccinated, we could get together and celebrate,” said Atif Saad, a resident of Pimpri. With the pandemic still on, some circumstances call for people to be more cautious. “With mosques closed, we offered prayers from home. The difference was that our family members, all of whom have been fully-vaccinated, could gather at my house and pray together,” said Wasim Khan, a Camp resident. Sameer Shaikh, who lives in Khadki, said, “We were blessed with a baby girl last month and she has kept us on our toes. We could not visit our family or have them come over because we must stay wary of infections. Even so, we received a lot of food and love from friends and family throughout the day.” Food was the highlight of the celebration, while some prepared traditional family recipes, others preferred to enjoy the day off and order in. “My mother usually prepares the feast for the family on this day, but I decided to give her a break this year and do it all by myself. She was proud that I managed to follow her recipe for the biryani to the tee,” said Shaista Khan, a resident of Mohammedwadi. Vimannagar resident Farzana Ahmed said, “Some of our friends came over for lunch and we had a good time catching up face-to-face over a of spread of biryani and kebabs that we ordered in. There were good offers on food on delivery apps today. My in-laws did the sacrifice in our hometown, but my husband and I did not go because we don’t know if there will be a lockdown again and we might get stuck.” Talking about how a major part of the festival involves charity, Kondhwa resident Mohammed Nadeem said, “People have donated more this year, considering the devastation that the pandemic has caused. So many people have lost their jobs. They are unable to run their homes or pay for their children’s education. My friends and I got together to build a fund and help such people so that even they can have some reason to celebrate.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bakri-eid-celebrations-help-bring-inoculated-family-members-together/articleshow/84623484.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Delhi||Half the festive spirit: Eid prayers at home, hugs missing as Covid weighs||New Delhi: Jama Masjid was a strange place on Wednesday, strange because on an occasion like Eid-ul-Adha its expansive court would be filled with thousands of people, all warmly hugging each other. On Bakr Id, as the festival is also known, on Wednesday, there were just 20 people praying at one of the largest mosques in the country, there was no friendly back-slapping or the customary embraces with Eid Mubarak echoing everywhere. Covid-19 put paid to any public observance of the festival.  Most people visited local mosques or offered Eid namaz at home. Returning home after prayers at a mosque in the neighbourhood, Mohammad Tausif said social distancing was in focus when offering namaz. He added, “Though some business owners have opened their shops since early morning for Eid shoppers, I will not go out. I will celebrate Eid at home while taking proper precautions. It doesn’t matter that the celebrations are low-key due to the pandemic.”  Shahzad Khan, a businessman, said, “I have been coming to Jama Masjid on Eid for 40 years. There would be no place even to stand, but the mosque was empty this year. However, we have no complaints because we know that it is important to follow the Covid guidelines for our own safety.”  Mohammad Ansar-ul Haque, assistant public relations officer, Jama Masjid, said that only 15-20 people, most of them mosque staff, were permitted to meet and pray together. Some people did, however, visited the masjid later and then went to the adjoining markets to get a feel of the festival. Outside the mosque, Shamshad Alam Ansari said, “I and family offered namaz at home. I was missing the customary visit to the masjid on Eid day and so came here.”  This was the second year in a row that Eid-ul-Adha was observed in the shadow of the pandemic. Many of those who visited the old City avoided the customary embraces and greeted others without the usual physical demonstration of affection. “We should take all precautions in this era of Covid. This year's Eid has been observed without handshakes, hugs or get-togethers.” cautioned Zia-ul Haq at Urdu Bazar Road, while Haider Abbas, a resident of Old Delhi, said instead of visiting his friends, he had decided to greet them over the phone this time.  Businessman Salim Khan said he would distribute the sacrificial meat, as is customary, but among the poor and those who could not offer the animal sacrifices required on the festival. Mohammad Shaan, who owns a sweet shop opposite Jama Masjid, reiterated that many people did not have the money to spend on festival indulgences this year because their incomes had been hit by the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/half-the-festive-spirit-eid-prayers-at-home-hugs-missing-as-covid-weighs/articleshow/84623506.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The university officials said once the results of various exams are announced, the remaining seats would get filled up too. The demand for science faculty in courses such as biotechnology, microbiology, computer science has been steady this year too and are among the most trending courses. Admissions in-charge at SPPU, Uttam Chavan, said, “Many results are pending so students are still taking time to make their decisions.

So, we are hoping that the vacant seats will also fill up eventually.” The SPPU had limited applications till July 15 for admissions to undergraduate and postgraduate courses. The SPPU has received 29,500 applications this year which was at least 1,500 more than last year, he added. The courses for which the applications are less than the total number of seats would be conducted offline. However, there will be an entrance test which will be online for all courses that have more applications than the vacancies. Chavan said, “This year, we introduced a diploma course on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and it has already become so popular that we have received too many applications and the admissions will be based on the entrance test and a merit list will be announced based on the marks scored.” Member of Parliament Amol Kolhe, who has also portrayed the roles of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj and also Shivaji Maharaj in television series, met vice-chancellor of SPPU Nitin Karmalkar and expressed his interest in taking admission for this particular course.

Deep Trivedi, 30, who works with a software development firm, said in his FIR with Naranpura police that his father Arvind Trivedi received messages from his bank for new cheque book. After a while, he received a call from a person who introduced himself as a bank officer and assured Arvind that he could help him in getting his cheque book at his doorstep. He said another bank officer would call him. Another man then called up and sent a weblink to Arvind’s cellphone. Following his instructions, he downloaded an app, “AnyDesk,” through which the fake bank officer took control over Arvind’s device. In a few seconds, the ‘bank officer’ withdrew Rs 63,000 from Arvind’s bank account in four transactions. When Arvind called up, the man who said that there was some mistake and he would get the money back. The man asked Arvind if he had another single-person account to give refund.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Get life-saving drugs and injections through health department portal||JAIPUR: To help relatives of Covid patients seeking life-saving drugs and injections, the state health department is coming up with a portal where information on injections such as tocilizumab, remdesivir and dexamethasone will be available. The relatives will have to upload hospital prescriptions and the portal will provide the payment gateway to them and information from where they get the injections and life-saving drugs. Rajasthan Medical Services Corporation Limited (RMSCL) has already started ordering these injections and drugs in case the third wave strikes. “The attendant of a Covid patient will have to go to the portal, upload the doctor’s prescription and he would be directed to the payment gateway. After payment, he would be given a specified address to collect the medicines and injections like remdesivir. Last time, we had complains of people of not getting these things timely. Thus this would be taken care of,” RMSCL managing director Alok Ranjan said. As health minister had already urged private hospitals to set up oxygen plants, RMSCL is working on modalities to get the medicines and injections by the first week of August. “Though the Centre on July 16 had ordered the state governments to start procuring medicines and other life-saving injections, we have already started the process. Hopefully, by the first week of August, we will start getting our injections and medicines and we will stock them properly to get ready for the third wave,” said Ranjan. Ranjan added that since there are indications that third wave might affect the children, various medicines in syrup form for pediatric use have also been ordered. “We have ordered for the syrups of paracetamol, zinc, vitamin-C and azithromycin among others,” Ranjan added. Amidst theories that remdesivir is no longer life-saving in case of critical Covid patients, RMSCL has already ordered for nearly 1.42 lakh injections. “For every critical Covid patient for his initial nine days, he needs anti-viral medication. Remdesivir has been an effective anti-viral injection and it has shown good results in critical patients in Rajasthan during the first and second waves,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College, who also heads the core team of Covid care and management in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/get-life-saving-drugs-and-injections-through-health-department-portal/articleshow/84623497.cms||Ashish Mehta

The airport’s crucial projects, including the night landing facility and runway extension, have also been affected because of the scarcity of workforce, as a large number of workers left for their hometowns after the second wave of the pandemic hit. “The runway extension and the night landing are almost complete. The markings on the runway have been made, but trained work force is needed. The contractor is struggling to get the workers as many have left for their homes. Before commissioning the runway extension and night landing, permission from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is needed. It is difficult to say when they will visit, conduct checks and give permission,” Deepak Shastri, the airport director, said, adding that very limited work was on at present. The Shirdi airport is managed by the Maharashtra Airport Development Company Limited (MADC). The runway extension plan involved increasing the length to 3,200 metre from the present 2,500 metre. “It has been over two months that flight movement has been stopped. We had started transport of domestic cargo and that too has stopped because of absence of flights,” Shastri said. Another official, requesting anonymity, said the state government had decided to hold back Rs100 crore, which was to be provided to the airport over a period of two years for its development. “The amount was approved in 2020. Now the government has put it on hold because of the pandemic. Quite a few important projects, including the construction of a new terminal building, administration building, roads have been delayed. It is difficult to say when these will come on track again,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/projects-at-shirdi-airporthit-due-to-pandemic/articleshow/84623498.cms||Joy Sengupta

For the record, the state was supposed to vaccinate 75 lakh beneficiairies with the second dose in July itself.

And when the new identity received a stamp of recognition from the government, it was truly icing on the cake for the oriental therapist, who recently spent around Rs 8 lakh to become a woman. Alisha Patel become the first trans woman from the state to get a certificate issued by government as per the new rules. “It is like rebirth. I can now confidently claim my identity and do things as a woman that I could not do earlier,” Patel said. She confided that she knew that she was a woman from inside since she was 12 years of age. “Instead of wearing boys shorts, I liked the long skirts in school uniform but I could not express myself,” said Patel, who the youngest among six sisters. “My body language, interest and way of talking conveyed that I would grow up to be a woman to my family,” she said. Patel faced discrimination in school, also in college and at her workplace too. “Amid the inner struggle, the support of my family and counselling by psychiatrist helped me realise that I have gender dysphoria,” said Patel, who dropped out of diploma engineering to learn the art of oriental therapy — a subject of her interest. “Earlier, to get an identity of transgender or trans woman was a lengthy process.

---||Ranchi||Realtors urge Jharkhand CM to slash circle rates like Bengal, Delhi||RANCHI: The real estate sector in the state, reeling under a host of problems, including liquidity and sale of properties because of the ongoing pandemic, has appealed to the Jharkhand government to consider slashing the circle rates this year like in Delhi and West Bengal to provide a cushion to both developers and prospective buyers. Circle rate is the minimum price fixed by the state government at which a property needs to be registered after its purchase or upon transfer. Registration of property either happens on the actual value of the property or the circle rate fixed by the government, whichever is higher, after paying the stamp duty and registration charges. The Jharkhand chapter of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Association of India (CREDAI) has also written a letter to Chief Minister Hemant Soren in this regard amid reports of expected 10 per cent hike in circle rates from August 1. They said the hike will hit realty transactions as it will lead to a rise in the cost of both residential and commercial properties. While the state government is yet to officially announce the revised rate, sources in the land and revenue registration department hinted that the new slabs are expected to be in force from August 1. Accordig to the regulations brought in by the state government in 2018, land rates are to be revised every two years against the earlier practice of doing so annually. The last revision was in 2019, said those in the know. The real estate sector, however, is now lobbying for either a slash in certain rates or halt in the rate revision process due for this year. Vijay Agarwal, president of CREDAI, Jharkhand said, “Since the outbreak of Covid-19, the real estate sector has been hit hard. Though this sector was slowly trying to revive, the second wave dealt another blow leading to a crisis of financial liquidity among developers. Many prospective buyers have either dropped the idea or are finding it difficult to manage funds due to slash in salaries, job losses, medical expenses and the like. Increase in circle rates at this juncture would further pose problems in the real estate business.” Members of this sector are hoping to get an audience with the chief minister soon. “We have written to the CM with our concern. Hope his government takes note of it. States like West Bengal, Delhi have either slashed their rates or postponed the hike. For example, Bengal has, in fact, reduced stamp duty by 2 per cent and circle rates by 10 per cent. We expected a similar move here too,” he said. Another prominent developer, unwilling to be named, said, “The real estate sector is one of the big employers and lakhs of people are dependent on it for livelihood. This is the time to help it revive rather than impose new rates because sale of property has been negligible in Ranchi since the past year. Many builders are finding it difficult to get buyers for their finished projects while others are unable to complete their pending projects for lack of funds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/realtors-urge-soren-to-slash-circle-rates-like-bengal-delhi/articleshow/84623132.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Earlier this month, IG Railway Board (HQ) Sumati Shandilya wrote to the general managers of all railway zones and intimated about a new adoption programme under code name “Reach Out, Secure and Rehabilitate”. The programme is aimed at preventing the orphaned and vulnerable children from being drawn into the cauldron of human trafficking, Shandilya wrote. Accordingly, the RPF officials at Ranchi railway division of the South Eastern Railways are gearing up for the programme. Under the programme, each officer or serving personnel will be assigned to look after one child and oversee their upkeep, academics and other requirements. Speaking to TOI, RPF’s commandant of Ranchi railway division Prashant Yadav said: “We will be on the lookout for such children. As and when they are found, they will be brought and given shelter in local shelter homes through local NGOs. They will be lodged by the NGOs and their studies and other expenses will be taken care of by the Indian Railways.” One officer or serving RPF personnel will be assigned to a child. The personnel will be in constant touch with the child, pay a weekly visit and even offer mental support and provide counselling. Special training module is being drafted for the RPF personnel. Yadav said railways aims to raise money for the upkeep of the children through corporate social responsibility funds and are approaching business establishments for this purpose. The railways might also use funds from its Railways Suraksha Kalyan Nidhi for the programme. In June this year, the state government had announced that it will look after the children who have lost their parents due to Covid-19. The department of women and social welfare claimed that it had identified more than 300 such children for the state-sponsored adoption programme. However, the programme is yet to be launched.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rpf-to-adopt-kids-who-lost-parents-to-covid-19/articleshow/84623026.cms||---

Earlier, singers-cum-composers Kanshilal Nayak and Jagarnath Ram had come out with a song dedicated to the players participating in the women’s hockey tournament in Simdega in March. “At that time, we had composed the song in Nagpuri and that inspired us to come out with a song ahead of the Olympics for promoting hockey as the game runs in the veins of Simdega residents. We decided to write the song in Hindi so that players from other states can understand it,” Kanshilal said. The president of Hockey Simdega, Manoj Konbegi, laude their efforts and said, “The entire country is backing our players who are representing the nation in the Olympics. For Simdega and, for Jharkhand, it is more important as our own players are representing the country. The music video is just an attempt to keep them motivated.” This time, two players from Jharkhand -- Nikki Pradhan (Khunti) and Salima Tete (Simdega) -- are part of the women’s national team. Both the men and women team will take on New Zealand and the Netherlands, respectively, on July 24.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/simdega-duo-pen-song-to-motivate-hockey-players/articleshow/84622992.cms||K A Gupta

The participants gave some money as gift to the cleric.” As incomes have dipped, the number of sacrifices offered was also fewer. The sacrificial animals, consisting mainly of goats, were priced at over Rs 25,000 this year. Meanwhile, the administration remained alert to prevent any untoward incident during the festival. A senior official stated, “All the circle officers of the city were asked to keep vigil at public places.” The police had also held meetings of peace committees to ensure social harmony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/a-quiet-eid-at-home-with-namaz-social-distancing/articleshow/84623059.cms||Sanjay Sahay

The Supreme Court made stern remarks against the Centre’s poor oxygen supply management in New Delhi. And yet, the Centre lied in Parliament and falsely put the onus on the state governments,” JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said. Bhattacharya said that during the second wave of the pandemic, the Centre exercised absolute control over the distribution of liquid medical oxygen consignments, ventilators, oxygen concentrators and drugs which were being used to treat hospitalized Covid-19 patients. “The Centre only issued advisories to the state governments and did not bother to take up consultations,” Bhattacharya said. JMM also blamed the BJP for the surge in Covid-19 cases and the fatalities. “Such was the political ambition of the BJP that the Prime Minister and Union home minister were addressing poll rallies in West Bengal and Assam while the deadly virus was raging across the nation,” Bhattacharya added. The JMM also kept its attack on the BJP over snooping row. “We are learning that in 2017, there was a meeting between senior leaders of the BJP’s national election management committee and representatives of an Israeli company in Dubai’s Burj Khalifa. In the meeting, ways to hack the EVM machines were discussed. We will release more information on it as and when we get it,” Bhattacharya said. Bhattacharya added that the country’s national security may have been compromised. “There is a possibility that the phones of defence minister, the chief of defence staff, the generals of the Indian Army may have been spied on. Who will look into this?” he said. Notably, the state unit of the Congress will stage a Raj Bhawan march on Thursday to protest the snooping through Israeli spyware Pegasus. The march will be led by state Congress chief Rameshwar Oraon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/centre-lied-in-parliament-that-none-died-due-to-oxygen-shortage-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/84623001.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Taranjit Singh, also known as Sammy, ran a restaurant in Manila in the Philippines. He was 28. On July 11, he was shot by two men at his eatery. According to eyewitnesses, Taranjit was chased and later shot in the chest. He died on the way to a hospital in Manila. His relatives wanted to bring the body home so that his elderly parents, residents of Mango, could see their son for the last time but that too was not possible as direct flights between the two countries were discontinued after the outbreak of the pandemic. After the special prayers at Sakchi Gurdwara in Taranjit's memory, the Sikh community, wearing black badges, demanded in one voice that the Centre should ensure justice for the city-born businessman, who was killed in cold blood in Manila. Taranjit’s mother, Jasbir Kaur, who was present at the prayer ceremony, appealed to both the central and state governments to take adequate steps so that the guilty are punished and the family gets justice. The Sikh community, which has a 40,000-strong population in Jamshedpur alone, rallied around the mother who lost her son abroad. Leaders of the Congress and BJP took part in the prayer meet and condoled the death of the young businessman, who started his career here and then shifted to Manila in search of better prospects. The Sikh community on Thursday will hand over a letter addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi through deputy commissioner Suraj Kumar demanding immediate action. The community will also approach Union minister Arjun Munda, who hails from Jamshedpur, seeking justice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/sikhs-demand-justice-for-kin-of-bizman-killed-in-philippines/articleshow/84623046.cms||---

Around 100m-long two span aqueduct-cum-footbridge which rests on the canal was constructed more than three decades ago after the construction of Selaulim dam. The canal starts from main gate of Selaulim dam and ends near Cuncolim police station. Sonarbhatt resident Andy Fernandes said that the canal is leaking into the river at at least three places. Though the footbridge is only meant for canal maintenance, people from Sirvoi and other nearby areas use the bridge as a shortcut route to reach Quepem town. Trucks with laterite stones cross the bridge at regular intervals and that is the reason the bridge has become weak and started leaking few days ago, Fernandes alleged. “Since people from both sides of the river cross the footbridge walking or by two-wheelers, their life is at risk as the bridge may collapse at any time due to overload vehicles plying on it, the concerned department must act fast and carry out necessary test before any untoward incident occurs” Fernandes said. WRD assistant engineer Somnath Dessai told TOI that their department had erected speed breakers with concrete poles on both the ends of the bridge to avoid entry of four-wheelers, but some miscreants removed the poles to pave way for free movement of vehicles. “We once caught a rickshaw that was dumping garbage in the canal. The driver was handed over to Quepem police for necessary action” Dessai said. The WRD official said they are in the process of floating a tender to carry out grouting on the aqueduct canal to repair the leaking portions, but the work will be carried out only after drying the entire canal in the next season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/locals-worried-as-canal-to-quepem-leaking-at-3-spots/articleshow/84623545.cms||---
---||Business||Government may restrict benefits for employees of Air India||NEW DELHI: The government is likely to limit employee benefits only up to the time it is an owner of cash-guzzler national carrier Air India, setting the template for the privatisation of other public sector companies as part of its ambitious strategic sale programme. The move will mean that the new owner of the airline —which is a top priority company for disinvestment this year — will have new terms for employees and can tweak the compensation packages in a way that it benefits sections where it wants to make them more attractive, sources familiar with the privatisation programme told TOI. Air India employees are entitled to several benefits that go beyond the usual health and provident fund scheme to also include free tickets for several segments. Although the number of free tickets that can be issued in a year is fixed, it was given beyond the immediate family which typically comprises the employee, spouse and dependent children. Last year, the Air India Employees Union had petitioned the civil aviation ministry that the medical scheme for service and retired employees, provident fund and leave encashment should be continued in their current form even after privatisation, arguing that it is critical for their well-being. Given that a few benefits go beyond normal industry practice, some of the bidders have concerns over offering liberal packages to the entire workforce, prompting the government to deliberate internally. A government officer said that it is only fair that the Centre honour its share of the commitment, which can only be restricted up to the time it is the owner. Workers and employees, however, believe that they joined the company keeping the benefits in mind and worked on the assumption that the contract terms will remain unchanged. In fact, employee benefit is one of the factors which has delayed the entire process beyond the target date for privatisation with some of the other aspects still being decided. Covid-19 has also delayed the process. A senior officer, however, said that the company, which will see a fresh Rs 1,900 crore from the government once the supplementary demand for grants is approved, is on course to be privatised during the current financial year as the Centre too is keen to check the bleeding. The Centre aims to call for financial bids in September and all efforts are being made to ensure that the sale is wrapped up in the current fiscal year. “It may be taking a little longer but some of the issues that are decided here will also be used in case of other companies that will be privatised in the coming months,” said the senior officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-may-restrict-benefits-for-employees-of-air-india/articleshow/84625056.cms||Sidhartha
---||Goa||‘Anti-trafficking bill fails to address online exploitation’||Panaji: The proposed Trafficking in Persons (Prevention, Care and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2021, which is likely to be tabled in the monsoon session of Parliament, has been disappointing from Goa’s point of view as it fails to address online sex-trafficking, said Goa-based voluntary organisation, ARZ, which works towards the prevention of human trafficking. Online sex-trafficking is an emerging trend and the main form of commercial sexual exploitation in the tourist state, ARZ submitted to the Union ministry of women and child development. There is a need to include online commercial sexual exploitation, in the definition of “offences with cross-border implications”, especially in cases where the domain is registered outside India and the website is involved in soliciting girls in India for commercial sexual activities. Goa has seen cases of women from Bangladesh and Nepal brought to the state for prostitution. A few have been repatriated after their rescue in the past few years. The draft bill has proposed that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) shall act as the national investigating and coordinating agency. It will be responsible for the prevention and combating of trafficking in persons and other offences under the act. ARZ pointed out that the NIA functions as the central counter-terrorism law enforcement agency in India. It said that since the agency’s primary objective is counter-terrorism, there are high chances it will not able to give the necessary attention to cases of trafficking. The organisation has suggested that a special investigating agency be established under the ministry of home affairs (MHA) to combat human trafficking. While the provisions for special police officers, a special court and special prosecutors exists under the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, they are not implemented in most states. It therefore suggested that a provision be made for having an investigating agency at the state and district level. In case a victim is major in age, the case be disposed of by the district magistrate or the sub-divisional magistrate, with the assistance of a panel of experts as provided under section 17 of ITPA, 1956, ARZ suggested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/anti-trafficking-bill-fails-to-address-online-exploitation/articleshow/84424249.cms||---
---||Business||Government departments: E-commerce rules to hit investor sentiment||NEW DELHI: Several government departments have expressed concerns over the proposed consumer protection norms for e-commerce companies, arguing that it will impact ease of doing business and the overall investment sentiment. While some of the agencies have shared their feedback with the consumer affairs department, which is piloting the initiative, officials said the proposal creates multiple challenges for e-commerce players, beginning with Licence Raj. “The moment you ask someone to register, which is what has been suggested, you ask them to queue up and start a bureaucratic process,” a senior government official told TOI. Under the proposed rules issued for discussion, each ecommerce player needs to register with the department for promotion of industry and internal trade. The view within several departments is that there is need for investments to help the economy recover from the bruising impact of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Some government officials said nothing should be done to derail the investment atmosphere and every effort should be made to build on the raft of reform measures that the government has unveiled to attract investment. The draft rules, released for public comment, have already triggered a backlash from industry, especially from overseas investors, who are wary of government regulations, and are complaining of periodic rule changes. Some are seeing the rules as a fallout of intense lobbying by the powerful traders’ lobby as well as some of the homegrown companies that have forayed into e-commerce. Government officials also said that the consumer affairs ministry’s proposals also intrude into the Competition Commission of India’s turf and something that is best avoided, given that an independent agency was set up under a statute to deal with measures to check monopoly behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-depts-e-comm-rules-to-hit-investor-sentiment/articleshow/84625071.cms||Surojit Gupta

According to TTF, university officials had conducted interviews for temporary teachers as per total workload but when appointment orders were to be issued workload of first year and masters students was deducted. The decision was taken during a meeting that was chaired by the vice-chancellor on the grounds that admission of the first year and masters’ students are yet to happen. “Even as the academic year has started only 35% out of a total 115 temporary teachers have been given orders. In some departments, no order regarding temporary teachers has been issued,” said TTF general secretary Dr Arvind Mohite. TTF has also demanded that the appointment orders should be issued as per new salaries. “The university has taken a decision to pay Rs 300 per lecture to those who have not received appointment orders. This is exploitation of the temporary teachers,” said Mohite, adding that engineers who hold masters and PhD degrees will end up getting just Rs 100 a day which is too low. “As senate member I demand to immediately issue appointment orders of all temporary teachers from the beginning of the academic year along with the new salary sanctioned by the syndicate. The proposal of Rs 300 is out rightly rejected and must not be implemented at all,” said Dr Nikul Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/tech-teachers-forum-demands-release-of-appointment-orders-for-temporary-teachers/articleshow/84621967.cms||---

ADP had revenue of $9.9 billion in 2020, and Teleperfomance and Accenture posted $6.6 billion and $6.5 billion respectively. Genpact and TCS were in the top ten, the former with revenue estimated at about $3.1 billion, and the latter with revenue of $2.7 billion-$2.8 billion for 2020. Infosys BPM, with revenue between $1 billion and $1.2 billion, was the seventh fastest growing firm. The company grew between 16-18%, says the Everest report. Canada's Telus and Paris-based Sopra Steria were the fastest growing, followed by Willis Towers Watson (UK), Webhelp Group (France), and TTEC (US). A Nasscom report showed that the Indian BPM industry grew 2.3% to $38 billion in the 2020-21 financial year. The BPM industry is seeing a shift from pure services to platform solutions and new revenue streams. The growth drivers include automation-led services, increased adoption of RPA, and analytics. The BPM industry is valued at over $200 billion, Everest says. The ranking is based on 2020 revenues and year-on-year growth. Revenues comprise 75% of the composite score used for ranking. Growth comprises 25% and has two sub-parameters: absolute growth and percentage growth. In the report, North America-headquartered service providers continue to dominate with a 54% share; however, in 2020, the region’s overall share declined slightly from 2019, while the share for Europe rose to 26% and Apac's to 20%. Rajesh Ranjan, partner at Everest Group, said: “First, the divide between risers and decliners continues to widen, increasing to 38% this year, up from 35% last year. Secondly, the overall volatility in the rankings in 2020 was subdued compared to the previous year. Going forward, as BPS 4.0 takes shape in this industry, we expect providers taking a proactive approach to align their operating model to this new paradigm will grow much faster than others." Everest estimates there are more than 250 service providers with more than $50 million in revenues offering BPS around the globe. Some are pure-play BPS providers, while others offer business services as part of a broader portfolio (including IT services, consulting, technology products, etc). Many of the global BPM providers have a large number of employees in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/genpact-tcs-among-top-10-bpm-providers/articleshow/84625081.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

Any violation here “will lead to legal action”, Naveen told TOI, making it clear that “only my family has the right to use the Hero brand for green vehicles”, even though there is no non-compete/prohibition on other clan members who can enter the category but with a different branding. Naveen, son of Pawan’s cousin Vijay Munjal, runs the Hero Electric two-wheeler business since 2007, and said his family received “global rights over the Hero brand name in perpetuity for electrics”, be it for personal-consumer use, or the commercial market. This was done as part of a larger settlement between various members of the Munjal clan, which runs several businesses under the ubiquitous ‘Hero’ brand name (two-wheelers, cycles, insurance, realty, electric vehicles, components, education), and has players such as Sunil Munjal and Pankaj Munjal, besides Pawan Munjal and Vijay Munjal. “We have the ownership of the Hero brand name for electrics and no one else can use it. There is no ambiguity here. We can use it for any type of vehicle running on land — two-wheelers, three-wheelers, cars, or commercial vehicles,” Naveen said, adding that, “If our rights are encroached upon, we will take legal recourse.” A spokesperson for Pawan’s Hero MotoCorp said, “Hero MotoCorp remains fully committed to driving sustainability and clean mobility, including through electric vehicles, in India and in our markets around the world. There is a family understanding in place, which everyone in the Munjal family is well aware of, and everything is being done within the parameters of the understanding and the agreement. The brand names used on the vehicles even as on date speak for themselves. The family agreement is crystal clear. Hero MotoCorp is well aware of its rights, and has always acted, and will continue to act based on the best legal advice.” However, Hero MotoCorp skirted the question on whether it can use the ‘Hero’ brand name for its upcoming EVs. At a time when it braces for stiff competition from newcomers such as Ola Electric, Hero MotoCorp has announced aggressive investments in the EV business (it also has a financial exposure in startup Ather) and plans to launch its first green vehicle this year. However, what branding will be used by the company is still not clear. Open to partnership with Hero MotoNaveen Munjal said he remains “open to anything”, including partnerships within the family, as he expands his business under Hero Electric. “We are open to partnerships within the family. We are not closed to the idea,” Naveen said when asked whether he is ready to collaborate with uncle Pawan Munjal’s Hero Moto. “We have cordial family relations, and there is no animosity. It’s just that we’ve got to protect our business interests."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pawan-munjal-cant-use-hero-tag-for-evs/articleshow/84625091.cms||Pankaj Doval

While suggesting that its 160-odd members work together to ensure unhindered flow of the crucial material to combat the deadly virus, the global agency for free and fair trade has suggested a set of possible trade-facilitation measures to ease restrictions. In fact, it is not just the poor countries that have been hit by some of the restrictions in Europe and the US, home to Big Pharma, even India has complained of the curbs hitting its fight against coronavirus. Some of the restrictions were eased after the issue was taken up by PM Narendra Modi with US President Joe Biden when the case count in India was at record levels. WTO has said that there should be global harmonisation of guidelines for medicines to allow faster development of pharmaceuticals and to move more quickly between countries by overcoming conflicting or varying pharmacopeia requirements. Similarly, for manufacturing vaccines and their inputs, the multilateral body has proposed transparent and predictable investment regimes, along with bilateral and regional agreements to ease import and export restrictions. A predictable tariff classification is seen to be important as well. Given the unpredictability of the regulatory regime for vaccines, WTO has suggested ahost of measures for clearances, including for clinical trials and emergency use. Further, there are general measures, including mutual recognition agreements related to inspection of facilities and sharing of workflow and information between countries and their agencies to accelerate access to essential medical goods. WTO suggested that the timelines for evaluation and approval of medical products and clinical trials could be reduced and the requirements can be aligned globally. There is a huge debate at the WTO on allowing access to vaccines, medicines and diagnostic aids in the poorer countries with India and South Africa suggesting flexibility in the patent regime to enhance supplies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ease-barriers-for-vax-medicines-says-wto/articleshow/84625104.cms||---

The acquisition will bolster Byju’s strategy to grow its footprint in the US. The development is part of the Bengaluru-based edtech player’s plan to invest $1 billion in North America. Byju’s has made multiple big acquisitions in the past year, including those of WhiteHat Jr for $300 million, and Aakash Educational Services for nearly $1 billion. It acquired US-based Osmo, a maker of educational games, for $120 million two years ago. Recently, Byju’s and Walt Disney launched a co-branded learning app targeted at kindergarten to class 3 students. “Byju’s is redefining the way kids are learning to use tech as a strong enabler, both to create interactive formats that are engaging and, more importantly, to personalise books that are recommended to kids based on their reading proficiency,”Byju Raveendran, founder and CEO of Byju’s, said. Byju’s has to date raised some $2.7 billion from investors, much of that in the past year, and the company was valued at $16.5 billion in the last round of funding. Epic, Raveendran said, is the largest B2C edtech platform for this age group in the US. “Reading is a powerful format of learning. By creating a love of reading, you’re creating a love for learning,” he said. Epic’s global user base includes more than two million teachers and 50 million kids, a number that has doubled over the past year. The company works on a subscription model. Epic co-founder & CEO Suren Markosian said that the platform is designed to personalise reading for kids, putting the right book in front of the right child. “Epic adjusts to their interest levels and the platform learns and grows with the child,” he said. The company has 150-odd employees. Markosian and co-founder Kevin Donahue will remain in their roles. Epic has raised $51 million in funding to date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/byjus-acquires-us-kids-reading-co-for-500mn/articleshow/84625118.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

Such jobs include software test specialists in the IT sector, banking trainers in the BFSI industry, and compliance officers in the construction industry. The report covers 17 sectors including agriculture, automobile, banking, ecommerce and healthcare. “It is heartening to note that many business sectors are helping dispel the second wave gloom that surrounds us in the way they know best – making pay actions that are appreciably higher than in 2020, and are more effective. Paying forward the incentive to innovate and to grow, these sectors are shining the light at the end of the livelihood tunnel,” said Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder and executive vice president of Team-Lease Services.

---||Pune||Maharashtra mulls more easing up for fully vaccinated citizens||MUMBAI/PUNE: Consensus seems to be growing within the government in favour of granting fully vaccinated people further relief from Covid restrictions, including allowing them to use the Mumbai local trains. State health minister Rajesh Tope said on Wednesday fully vaccinated people have a reduced chance of getting infected and transmitting the virus, and should be given some relief. The state government may consider allowing them on the local trains, but the “final decision will be taken by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray”. Speaking at an event in Pimpri Chinchwad, deputy CM Ajit Pawar agreed that the fully vaccinated can be allowed more easing of restrictions. “We shall discuss it with CM on Friday” he said. Pawar had said last week during the review meeting that he would suggest the state government to allow malls to open with “fully vaccinated staff” for "fully vaccinated customers”. On the vaccine supply, Ajit Pawar said, “The Union government is supplying the doses. CM Thackeray has requested for supply of vaccine doses in accordance with the state’s population, so that citizens do not have to face any inconvenience.” He said they were told that the supply would streamline from July, but the situation had not improved much. “We are in constant touch with the Union government for supply of more doses,” he said. Ajit Pawar said the apprehension about the vaccine had reduced and the overall response to the inoculation drive had improved across the state. On the Covid situation, Ajit Pawar said the next 100-120 days were quite important. He stressed that citizens needed to remain vigilant and follow all the Covid safety guidelines. He said when he recently visited Solapur, he saw many people moving around without masks. Such a careless attitude could increase the Covid infection and responsible behaviour was the only solution, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-mulls-more-easing-up-for-fully-vaccinated-citizens/articleshow/84625140.cms||---

Both the missiles are still undergoing developmental trials but will boost the firepower of the armed forces once they are fully operational for induction. The earlier version of the Akash missiles, which can intercept hostile aircraft, helicopters, drones and subsonic cruise missiles at a range of 25 km, have already been inducted in large numbers, with orders worth around Rs 24,000 crore being placed. “The new Akash-NG weapon system, once deployed, will prove to be a force multiplier for the air defence capability of IAF,” said a DRDO scientist. The missile was tested from Integrated Test Range (ITR) off the Odisha coast at 12.45pm. “The flawless performance of the entire weapon system was confirmed by the complete flight data captured by radars, electro-optical tracking and telemetry systems. During the test, the missile demonstrated high manoeuvrability required for neutralising fast and agile aerial threats,” he added. The low-weight, fire-andforget MP-ATGM was also successful in hitting the target, which was “mimicking a tank”, in a direct-attack mode and destroying it with precision. The Army at present has a huge shortage of ATGMs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/new-gen-akash-shoots-to-success/articleshow/84625187.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Farmers get LG nod to protest at Jantar Mantar from today||NEW DELHI: The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has permitted protesting farmers to hold what they call the Kisan Sansad at Jantar Mantar in the heart of the city from Thursday till August 9. Before Delhi police commissioner Balaji Srivastava visited the city’s traditional protest space Wednesday to take stock of the situation, several layers of barricades had already been erected and paramilitary personnel deployed there. Security cameras at Jantar Mantar, close to Parliament House, have been inspected to ensure cops can monitor the situation. The protesters will be taken to the site in buses with police escorts. Strict observance of Covid-appropriate behaviour is to be enforced. The approval for the extension of the farmers’ protest from the border sites was given by the LG and DDMA chairperson Anil Baijal. DDMA has allowed a maximum of 200 protesters bearing identity cards at Jantar Mantar each day between 11am and 5pm. Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella organisation of farmers’ bodies, said the list of the 200 would be shared with police each day in order to avoid a repeat of the violence that broke out this January 26 when the agitating farmers had entered Delhi from their sit-in locations on the borders. At Jantar Mantar, protesters will be seated within a barricaded areaSpeaking to TOI, Darshan Pal, SKM leader, said “We have capped the number of people who will be protesting at 200. Each of the 200 will have to submit a photostat copy of their Aadhaar card for our scrutiny. We will give them identity cards to hang around their necks for quick identification. As Parliament’s monsoon session proceeds, our Kisan Sansad too will carry on from 11am to 5pm every day. In order to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour, the 200 protestors will commute in five buses every morning.” There, the protesters will appoint a ‘speaker’ and ‘deputy speaker’ each day to coordinate the discussions on agrarian issues. “We want to protest peacefully,” said Pal. “The seating arrangement at Jantar Mantar has been done keeping social distancing requirements in mind. On July 26, when the movement completes eight months, only women protestors will participate here. On August 9, since it’s the anniversary of the Quit India Movement, we will conduct a special session at Jantar Mantar.” When TOI visited Singhu border, where the farmers have been protesting for over seven months now, meetings were being held on Wednesday to finalise the first list of 200 people to go to Jantar Mantar on Thursday for the Kisan Sansad. Verification of the Aadhaar cards was under way. Kisan Ekta Morcha has maintained that no political party will be allowed on stage, and its leaders reiterated that those who wished to support the farmers could be a part of their audience. On Thursday morning, the participating protestors will gather at the SKM office at Singhu and will be escorted to Jantar Mantar by a Delhi Police pilot team. At all times, the buses will move between a pilot and escort car till they reach Jantar Mantar. As a police officer explained, “Since the farmers are not on foot or in vehicles that could cause harm or inconvenience to the public, we saw no need for a traffic advisory.” Once the buses reach Jantar Mantar, the protesters will be seated within a barricaded area to avoid unnecessary public gathering there. In the evening, they will be driven back in the same manner. This exercise will continue till August 9. Chinmoy Biswal, PRO, Delhi Police, said, “After several rounds of negotiations with the farmer organisations, and on being assured in writing that they will remain peaceful, and with DDMA’s approval, the farmers have been permitted to protest at Jantar Mantar. They have been cautioned not to take out any march in view of the Covid restrictions.” All police personnel deployed on duty with senior officers as well as those in different cells are being kept on standby. An order issued by DCP (Headquarters) said that off duty staff should also be present in their homes with a maximum transit time of an hour to the protest site. “The mobile phones of all the personnel posted in the security unit will not be switched off at any cost,” the order said.

In interpreting a statutory provision, a judge must put himself in the shoes of the Parliament and then ask whether Parliament intended this result. Parliament very clearly intended that no power of modification of an award exists in section 34 of the Arbitration Act,” a bench of Justices R F Nariman and B R Gavai said. The bench said it is only for the Parliament to amend the provision in the light of the experience of courts in the working of the Arbitration Act, 1996, and bring it in line with other legislations the world over. The court passed the order on an appeal filed by the Centre against the HC order. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the Arbitration Act, 1996, being based on the UN Commission on International Trade Law’s Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, 1985, has specifically restricted the grounds of challenge and the consequent remedy, which is only to set aside or remit in limited circumstances. The case pertains to the litigation on land acquisition for national highways 45 and 220. The bench, however, dismissed the appeal on facts. “Givenhat in several similar cases, NHAI has allowed similarly situated persons to receive compensation at a higher rate than awarded, and given the law laid down in Nagpur Improvement Trust, we decline to exercise our jurisdiction under Article 136 in favour of appellants on the facts of these cases,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/courts-cant-modify-an-arbitral-award-says-sc/articleshow/84625201.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa asks Centre to reduce vaccine gap from 84 to 30 days for teachers||PANAJI/BICHOLIM: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Wednesday that he has written to the Union government requesting that the gap between the two vaccination doses be reduced from the current 84 days for school teaching and non-teaching staff. “It is being said that the third wave will affect children more, and so we have asked teachers and school staffers to take vaccination on a priority basis," Sawant said. "If the demand (for shorter gaps) is approved, just as we had reduced the gap in the case of seafarers from 84 days to 30 days, the same will be done for teachers and other school staff, including Balrath drivers.” Even if physical classes are conducted for Class X and XII, they will be held by observing all pandemic norms like social distancing, said the CM.“We are concerned about the children of Goa. Only once 100% vaccination is completed, we will be able to start physical classes by maintaining social distancing, at least for Class X and XII. That is why we have demanded with the Centre that this gap of 84 days should be reduced so we can vaccinate teachers faster,” he said. If the response from the Union government comes within the next few days, the work of administering the second dose to teachers will begin shortly, he said. Goa has the best vaccination coverage in the country, with only about one lakh of the eligible population not having taken a dose, said Sawant. “Ninety percent of the eligible population in the state has received at least their first dose. By July 31, we want to ensure 100% take their first dose. I appeal to them to come out in large numbers and get their vaccination ,” said Sawant. “Our target is to complete administering the second dose by September 30,”he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-asks-centre-to-reduce-vaccine-gap-from-84-to-30-days-for-teachers/articleshow/84623323.cms||---

They assured the villagers that they would try and resolve their connectivity issues. The officials — Jayesh Naik, Mukul Jain, Sanjay Jaiswal, Patrick Dsouza and Madhu Desai — held a meeting with the sarpanch of Cotigao to discuss how the issue could be resolved. The team also visited the Poinguinim and Loliem-Polem village panchayats and took stock of the prevailing situation. They sought the cooperation of the local authorities and residents. Naik, while speaking to TOI, said that they need space to put up towers. “If this issue is solved by the locals and their MLA, then the connectivity issue can cent percent be solved,” Naik said. He said that when they visited Poinguinim last year and made the same request, the locals were not ready to allot any space to put up the tower. “So the issue of network connectivity remained dormant,” he said. It may be recalled that last week the issue of network connectivity in rural areas was discussed and chief minister Pramod Sawant had told mobile telecommunication officials to provide services in remote areas of the state. The meeting was held following complaints of poor connectivity which was hampering online education of students in remote areas and villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/telecom-co-surveys-rural-areas-assures-connectivity/articleshow/84623333.cms||---

We will assess the situation and decide whether to increase buses on the routes. Even if one person is found to be Covid positive, the entire bus will have to be turned back. Only people that present an antigen test result and RTPCR test done within 72 hours will be allowed to board the bus,” KTC managing director Derek Pereira Neto said. Currently there are only two interstate buses going to Karnataka and none to Maharashtra. One bus has been operating from Goa to Belagavi, only available at the Margao, Panaji and Porvorim bus depots. The Goa to Gulbarga and Muddebihal bus operates only from the KTC Vasco bus stand for now. “These are mainly for migrant workers employed in Goa that travel to and from the state. While there are about 30 to 50 leaving per day, there are only eight to ten coming to Goa, on an average,” a KTC official from the Panaji depot said. In addition, the corporation has also resumed local schedules from Panaji to Ponda, Pernem and Bicholim after a year of suspending the route due to the pandemic. “We used to run 45 schedules on these routes, which have been reduced to only six routes. Footfalls are seen only during peak hours – early morning and in the evening,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ktc-to-resume-belagavi-karwar-sawantwadi-routes-from-aug-1/articleshow/84623344.cms||Nida Sayed

Delta, which was first detected in India, has now been recorded in 124 territories — 13 more than last week — and already accounts for more than threequarters of sequenced specimens in many major countries, the WHO said. The WHO also said there were over 3.4 million new global cases of the coronavirus last week, a12% increase from the previous week. But the number of deaths is continuing to decline, with about 57,000 in the last week. Of the three other coronavirus variants of concern, Alpha, first detected in Britain, has been reported in 180 territories (up 6 from last week), Beta, first detected in South Africa, in 130 (up 7) and Gamma, first detected in Brazil, in 78 (up 3). According to SARS-CoV-2 sequences submitted to the GISAID global science initiative over the four weeks to July 20, the prevalence of Delta exceeded 75% in several countries.

The complaint filed by Haji Hashim Ali alleged that on February 25, 2020, a mob of 20-25 people, armed with sticks, rods, petrol bombs and acid, broke into Madina Masjid at Shiv Vihar and destroyed everything they could lay their hands on. Police clubbed Ali’s complaint with another FIR (no. 72/ 2020) registered on the complaint of one Naresh Chand regarding the burning of his house, in which Ali was named as an accused, thus making Ali also a complainant. Court: Strange that complainant in riot case an accused tooAli was arrested in the case but subsequently got bail. Following this, he approached the magistrate court seeking registration of a separate FIR, which was allowed when police told the court that FIR 72/2020 had Ali’s complaint too. Police challenged this before the sessions court and informed that they had already filed an FIR (no. 55/ 2020) in the Madina Masjid arson case before Ali had approached the court. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav said police were not even aware that an FIR had already been registered at Karawal Nagar police station when Ali approached the magistrate court. "This prima facie reflects the callous attitude/negligence on the part of the investigating agency, as it was incumbent upon it to have placed complete material before the learned additional chief metropolitan magistrate (North East). This court is quite pained to see the lackadaisical attitude adopted by the investigating agency in the matter," added the order. Noting that the magistrate court had not committed any flaw as its order to file an FIR on Ali’s complaint was based on insufficient material, the sessions court remanded back the case to it to consider the matter afresh. The sessions court also noted that it was "really strange" that Ali was not only the complainant in FIR 72/2020, but also an accused, which was an "apparent absurdity". Advocate M R Shamshad, appearing for Ali, claimed that various wrong status reports were submitted before the court and police had disclosed the second FIR (55/ 2020) exactly a year later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/callous-attitude-delhi-court-pulls-up-cops-in-riots-case/articleshow/84625223.cms||Usha Das
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Vaccination cover, infrastructure key for reopening, say experts||PUNE: The state task force and health experts have said that steps can be taken towards easing of Covid curbs as long as there are enough people fully vaccinated and districts are ready with infrastructure to deal with a possible third wave. The public health department is currently considering proposals that allow fully vaccinated people to return to work across malls, restaurants, public transport networks and factories. Experts said such attempts will need a good mix of vaccine cover and shored up medical infrastructure. Head of the state task force, Dr Sanjay Oak, said full vaccination will help slowly boost important sectors. He said, "While state officials are working on preparedness and have guided district administrations as well as the regional task force on the importance of testing, tracking and close monitoring of home-isolated people, the state health department has reinforced full vaccination as an important component for de-escalation, which should be graded.” Another task force member, Dr Rahul Pandit, said fully vaccinated people should be allowed to operate in "bio-bubbles", with staggered timings, to give the economy the necessary'momentum. Health experts said there's now evidence, including data from the latest national sero-survey that suggests this could be the right time to take strong steps towards normalcy, while keeping a good grip on preparedness. Epidemiologist Dr Sanjay Rai, a professor of community medicine at the All India Institute Of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, said evidence from around the world has demonstrated that Covid infection provides better and longer protection. He said, "Besides, the reinfection rate is very low if we analyse breakthrough cases after vaccination. Therefore, we can safely consider that two-thirds of the population is protected as of now. So it’s the right time to move towards normalcy with close monitoring of the situation.” Pune-based clinical epidemiologist Dr Amitav Banerjee said, "The latest national sero-survey has revealed that 67% of our population has acquired IgG antibodies. The actual population immunity level is likely to be higher by 10-15% as IgG levels wane after some time. But immunity due to priming of memory and T cells last much longer Given this level of population immunity restrictions can be lifted to enable resumption of economic activity without fear of a surge in infections. ” Dr Banerjee said targeted vaccination is also important. "To be on the safer side, the elderly and people with comorbidities, who do not have IgG antibodies, can be vaccinated on priority without going for mass vaccination, which would only be a duplication of nature’s efforts at natural immunity. It will save time, resources, and efforts," he said. State officials said steps are being taken towards a safe reopening. Relief and rehabilitation secretary Aseem Gupta said they have forwarded proposals for various economic sectors to the health department for a final decision on rules. “We are now awaiting their decision,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-vaccination-cover-infrastructure-key-for-reopening-say-experts/articleshow/84625188.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian announced that the present special envoy on Afghanistan Liu Jian will be replaced by former Chinese Ambassador to Qatar, Jordan and Ireland, Yue Xiao Yong. Liu has served as China’s ambassador to Afghanistan, Malaysia and Pakistan before he was appointed as special envoy to Afghanistan early last year. Addressing a presser, Zhao said now that the Afghan issue is now the focus for the international community, China attaches high importance to communication and coordination with all relevant parties and will continue to play a constructive role for peace and stability in Afghanistan. Yue will “establish working relationships with colleagues rather than parties and maintain close communication and coordination,” he said without elaborating. The new appointment followed China stepping up its diplomatic engagement in Afghanistan following the announcement by the Biden administration to withdraw US troops by August 31.

---||Goa||Goa: CCP’s new policy rationalises sanitation fees||PANAJI: Doing away with the arbitrary fixed sanitation rate for all commercial establishments in the city, the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) has unveiled a new sanitation policy. The proposed sanitation fees, which are collected as per CCP’s Solid Waste (Management and Handling) by-laws 2019, will benefit small traders and restaurants while imposing higher fees on guesthouses and vehicle service centres. The proposed revisions come in the backdrop of Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) study which found that fees for door-to-door collection of solid waste were levied on an ad-hoc basis, with no co-relation with the waste generated. “CCP has proposed to amend the Schedule I sanitation charges,” said CCP commissioner Agnelo Fernandes. “The draft amendments have been uploaded on the CCP website.” Under the new policy, restaurants will be charged Rs 20 per sqm per month based on the area of the kitchen and dining space. Banks, financial institutions will be charged Rs 10 per sqm while small commercial establishments will pay Rs 5 per sqm with a minimum fee of Rs 150. Homes will continue to be charged Rs 50 per month for door-to-door collection of garbage. CCP has also kept the sanitation fees for hospitals, clinics, pathology labs, canteens and petrol pumps unchanged. “Those willing to share suggestions can download the draft from the CCP website and submit them in writing on or before August 3,” Fernandes said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ccps-new-policy-rationalises-sanitation-fees/articleshow/84623380.cms||---

The lab study, released on the preprint server bioRxiv, hasn’t been peer-reviewed and focuses on one key portion of the immune response, called neutralising antibodies. New York University scientists found that J&J’s vaccine produced roughly five-fold lower levels of the protective antibodies against Delta compared to the levels raised against an early strain. “The message that we wanted to give was not that people shouldn’t get the J&J vaccine, but we hope in the future, it will be boosted with either another dose of J&J or a boost with Pfizer or Moderna,” said the study’s lead virologist Nathaniel Landau. The study examined only one aspect of protection, J&J said, and didn’t consider long-lasting responses among immune cells stimulated by its shot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/jj-vaccine-not-very-effective-against-delta-says-study/articleshow/84625252.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Fresh survey of unsafe structures in Panaji||PANAJI: The Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) has started a fresh effort to identify unsafe structures in the state capital and is likely to complete the survey by the weekend. CCP commissioner Agnelo Fernandes said that a team of CCP officials are identifying weak and dilapidated buildings in the city that were missed out from the initial list of 18 unsafe structures identified in Panaji. Goa witnessed a week-long spell of heavy rainfall which brought down part of an old building next to a popular bakery in Panaji. The collapse of the building, which was not on CCP’s list of unsafe structures, forced the civic body to take a close look at the structural integrity of old and heritage buildings. “A team of junior engineers and supervisors are on the job going around the city. By Friday the report will be ready and submitted and then we issue an advertisement,” Fernandes said. Panaji mayor Rohit Monserrate had said that the CCP would do a “much more thorough survey” in the city. Unsafe structures have to be repaired by the owners or have to be vacated and demolished for safety reasons and to prevent loss of life. Most of Panaji’s unsafe buildings are in Fontainhas and CCP has struggled to contact many of the owners who are either living abroad or unknown. None of the 18 structures identified by the CCP suffered any damage due to the heavy showers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ccp-surveying-unsafe-structures-expects-report-tomorrow/articleshow/84623415.cms||---
---||Delhi||No one dying for lack of oxygen is a lie: Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia||NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Wednesday that the central government had ‘shamelessly’ lied in Parliament about no deaths being caused by the lack of oxygen during the second wave of Covid-19 infections. Sisodia alleged that people lost their lives due to the Centre’s ‘failed management system’. Responding to a question on whether a large number of Covid patients had died on roads and hospitals due to shortage of oxygen during the recent Covid upsurge, Bharati Pravin Pawar, Union minister of state for health and family welfare, told Parliament in a written answer, “Detailed guidelines for reporting of deaths have been issued by the Union health ministry to all states/UTs. Accordingly, all states/UTs report cases and deaths to the Union health ministry on a regular basis. However, no death due to lack of oxygen has been specifically reported by the states/UTs.” At a digital press conference on Wednesday, Sisodia said, “During the second Covid wave, there was a situation of panic in the whole country due to lack of oxygen. People were dying and all this was the result of the failed management system of the central government. Instead of taking responsibility, the Centre shamelessly lied that there were no deaths due to lack of oxygen in Parliament yesterday.” Sisodia alleged that oxygen distribution system policies formulated by the Centre on April 13, without any planning behind them, caused a massive oxygen crisis across India. Delhi recorded more than 13,000 Covid fatalities in the months of April and May. The deputy CM said that Delhi Government constituted a committee to investigate deaths caused by oxygen deprivation with the aim to give an assistance of Rs 5 lakh to families of such deceased, but the central government had rejected the formation of this committee through an order of the lieutenant governor. “The Centre was afraid that its oxygen mismanagement and the truth of its inefficiency would become public knowledge through this committee,” he asserted. He also accused the central government of repeatedly lying by saying that states hadn’t submitted any figures about oxygen deaths. “When you don’t allow the states to investigate such deaths, where will the figures come from? If the central government has the courage and wants the oxygen deaths investigated, I challenge it to let Delhi government’s inquiry commission carry out its work,” Sisodia said. In a separate press briefing on Wednesday, Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said that the central CoWin portal didn’t have any column where the reason for a death could be recorded and the Centre doesn’t ask for any such data from the state governments either. “Even then, Delhi Government tried to find out the number of deaths caused by lack of oxygen, but the Centre stopped us,” he claimed. Jain added, “Many hospitals in Delhi moved the high court and said they had run out of oxygen. After the intervention of the Supreme Court, a lot of lives were saved, especially in Delhi. Had the high court and the Supreme Court not got involved, then we would have seen a dystopian state of affairs. The Centre is rubbing salt on the wounds of those who lost their kin to the lack of oxygen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-one-dying-for-lack-of-oxygen-is-a-lie-delhi-deputy-cm-manish-sisodia/articleshow/84625266.cms||Sidharatha Roy

It is the day the Muslim League launched its Direct Action Day and began the Great Calcutta Killings in 1946. In today’s West Bengal, ‘Khela Hobe’ has come to symbolise a wave of terror attacks on opponents,” BJP member and Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta tweeted. BJP IT department head Amit Malviya lashed out at Banerjee for calling BJP a “virus”. “It shows Mamata Banerjee’s priorities. She is least interested in fighting Covid. Bengal continues to struggle against the pandemic, with crumbling health infrastructure and vaccine scams,” Malviya said. He took a swipe at Banerjee on her proposed rally of opposition leaders in Kolkata in order to cobble up an anti-BJP front. “She is free to do so, except that the unelected CM should realise that all non-TMC leaders, invited in Delhi, left the venue, even before she started speaking,” Malviya said. Banerjee on Wednesday addressed her supporters virtually, which was livestreamed and opposition leaders were invited to watch it at the Constitution Club in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-why-pick-aug-16-muslim-leagues-direct-action-day/articleshow/84625315.cms||---

The governor said Goa has lost a true sanyasi in every sense of that term and it is an irreparable loss. He said Swamiji tirelessly worked for the spiritual upliftment and served humanity through education, healthcare and service to the needy. His passing leaves behind a deep spiritual void.

---||Kolkata||Anticipating third wave, West Bengal holds on to Covid infrastructure||KOLKATA: The state is holding on to most of its Covid infrastructure despite cases reducing to a trickle, taking a lesson from the second wave, when a reduction in the Covid bed count after first-wave cases waned triggered a crisis in April and May. On May 14, when daily Covid cases had spiked to 20,486, hospital bed occupancy had also peaked to over 40% state-wide. On that day, the state had 20,043 Covid beds. On Wednesday, with 869 fresh Covid cases reported in Bengal, bed occupancy has also fallen to around 5.4%. But Covid beds across facilities in Bengal remain at 23,947. State officials say this would be further augmented with beds for children and their mothers. The Beliaghata Infectious Diseases hospital had ramped up its Covid bed count to 315 during the second-wave surge. Even as all beds remained occupied during the surge, the hospital on Wednesday had only 21 patients. “There is a sharp drop in Covid patient count,” said hospital principal Anima Haldar. “But we are keeping all Covid beds intact, in view of a possible third wave. In fact, we are trying to improve our infrastructure.” At MR Bangur Hospital — Kolkata’s biggest state-run Covid facility — only 31 of the 580 beds were full on Wednesday. “Currently, there is a lull in Covid patient inflow, and we are taking this as an opportunity to revamp our facility,” said Sisir Naskar, the hospital superintendent. “On directions from Swasthya Bhavan, we have increased our bed strength to 713 so that we are prepared well before the third wave strikes.” The Bengal government had scaled up Covid beds to 24,796 on June 16. It let go of some last month. Likewise, there were 3,613 ICU beds on June 16, which has been marginally reduced to 2,861. “We cannot afford another bed crisis that we saw during the second wave. Therefore, we need to keep all Covid beds aside as the third wave could hit around September,” said a member of the government’s expert committee. In addition, the state plans to add 1,300 paediatric ICU beds, 350 SNCU beds and 10,000 general beds for women at government hospitals. The government decided to have more than 2,000 PICUs (paediatric intensive care units) and over 700 NICUs (neo-natal intensive care units) at the existing Covid facilities, apart from 10,000 oxygenated beds, where mothers could be treated along with their children. Doctors, too, are undergoing intensive training, keeping in mind the imminent third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/anticipating-third-wave-bengal-holds-on-to-cov-infra/articleshow/84623833.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||West Bengal, not Gujarat, is growth model: Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: Mamata Banerjee, into her third tenure as chief minister, on Wednesday showcased the Bengal model of development and urged states to replicate it, in contrast to four-time Gujarat CM Narendra Modi using Kutch’s robust industrial growth as a showpiece for the country’s development before becoming Prime Minister in 2014. The West Bengal CM, during her address to Trinamool Congress supporters and opposition leaders who had assembled at Constitution Club in Delhi to listen to her speech, countered the Modi government’s top-down growth approach with her alternative of “cash benefit transfers” at grassroots, claiming how it worked during the Covid pandemic. “Bengal is the model and not Gujarat. We all have seen what happened to Gujarat,” Banerjee said. She had elaborated on the Bengal approach during state Budget discussions. “Our approach is to boost demand at grassroots that can take care of supply line,” Banerjee had said. The Centre, she argued, was giving concessions to big business to energize supply, which didn’t happen as estimated. The CM touched upon elements of inclusive growth route that takes the underprivileged on board while crafting the development plan. “Instead of helping the poor and the jobless, they are spending public money on spyware,” she said and added that Bengal was the only state that gave rations free to all. “We are giving free rations to people of our state. No state in this country does so. Our Swasthya Sathi scheme gives health cover to a much bigger population than Ayushman Bharat. Treatment is free in state government hospitals,” Banerjee said. Her party reaped rich dividends in the recently-concluded assembly polls, thwarting a no-holds-barred attack by PM Modi and his council of ministers. She showcased several state schemes for girl children and women, from Kanyashree to Lakshmir Bhandar, and Rs 10 lakh credit-card loans to students and Rs 10,000 support for each farmer irrespective of their holdings, to take care of the disadvantaged. “Responsive governance, unity, harmony, development, prosperity — instead of division in the name of religion and caste, surveillance on people — are the basic elements of our development route,” the CM said. While her political opponents discounted the approach as “dole politics”, Banerjee argued how this approach had helped reduce poverty in Bengal. “People living below poverty line have gone down below 40%,” she said. The CM also seized the opportunity to point out that the Bengal government didn’t lose out on revenue because of its “pro-people” policies. Addressing former Union finance minister P Chidambaram, who was listening to her speech, Banerjee said: “Mr Chidambaram knows very well about the debt we inherited when we came to power. Our own generation in 2011 was Rs 21,000 crore. It has gone up to over Rs 75,000 crore now, despite the burden of debt servicing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-not-gujarat-is-growth-model/articleshow/84623851.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee urges SC to suo motu take up snoop case||KOLKATA: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday alleged that her phone was “definitely tapped” as she urged the Supreme Court to take suo motu cognisance of the Pegasus row and order a probe by a special investigation team. “Pegasus, dangerous, ferocious,” Banerjee said, holding up her phone — with the camera lens covered by a plaster tape — while addressing her party’s Martyrs’ Day virtual rally. “Only the judiciary and people can save this democracy,” she said. “They are snooping on Abhishek (Banerjee) and Prashant Kishor. I talk to them. My phone is tapped. So I have plastered it,” she said, urging voters to “plaster” the BJP government to save India from being ruined. “All opposition leaders know their phones are being tapped. I cannot speak to Sharad Pawarji, Chidambaramji or other opposition leaders and CMs even when I want to. We are being snooped and spied on by the centre,” Banerjee said. “But snooping on us will not save the BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha poll,” she said, adding: “You stooped so low but still Bengal did not choose you.” Pegasus would be the Modi government’s “nabhishwas (last breath)”, she predicted, saying India had become a “surveillance state” and dubbing Pegasus worse than the Watergate scandal. “There are three important things in a democracy — media, judiciary and the Election Commission — and Pegasus has captured all three. I would appeal to the SC to come to the nation’s help. Save the country, save our democracy. Can’t you (SC) take suo motu cognisance when even phones of judges are being tapped? Please set up a special investigation team,” Banerjee pleaded. “BJP took Rs 3.75 lakh crore on fuel tax from public pocket. Where is it going? Spygiri is going on. No vaccine or medicine is available but they are spending the money on surveillance. Phones of even their own ministers are being tapped. They cannot even trust their own,” she said. The Trinamool has already raised the issue in Parliament and threatened to “stop it from functioning” till the centre responds to its eight Pegasus posers, including releasing details of people under surveillance, the time frame and the process followed. CM Banerjee alleged in her pre-poll meetings that her phone was being tapped when two conversations she had with politicians — one from Nandigram and the other from Coochbehar — became public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-urges-sc-to-suo-motu-take-up-snoop-case/articleshow/84623883.cms||---

Carrying forward the legacy, businessmen from south Gujarat are now looking to explore new opportunities in the north-eastern state of Tripura. A delegation of businessmen of Surat from different sectors, headed by president of Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry Dinesh Navadiya, recently visited Tripura to explore new business opportunities. The delegation visited tea estates, mega food parks, industrial estate, bamboo processing and furniture making units, rubber processing units and agarwood plantations. “The state has a lot of potential, but it is hardly known outside. There are many industries in which businessmen from south Gujarat can invest and the state government has also promised benefits like subsidies, GST reimbursements among others,” said Navadiya. The other members of the delegation said that the products of Tripura — be it tea, bamboo furniture, fruits like pineapple, litchi and processed food — are of much better quality and cost much less as compared to goods from other states. It also has a lot of potential to be developed as a tourism hub, delegation members said. “If any businessperson from Surat or from south Gujarat is interested then they can contact SGCCI and we can help them with further process,” Navadiya said. Some of the delegation members representing the textile and food industry have already begun researching the market potential.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/gujarati-businessmen-look-north-east-for-new-opportunities/articleshow/84622022.cms||---

Police said they had violated Covid-19 curbs. The arrests were slammed by the party as harassment of the opposition in a democracy. TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee tweeted: “We strongly condemn the attack on @AITCofficial supporters in @BJP4India ruled states. We will NOT be cowed down by such intimidation tactics! On #ShahidDibas let me reiterate that Trinamool will not budge an inch in its fight against the oppressive forces. COME WHAT MAY!” The leaders were paying tribute to Youth Congress activists who were killed in police firing in Kolkata on July 21, 1993, when CM Mamata Banerjee was a Youth Congress leader. Police said that 21 people had been arrested for unlawful gathering in breach of pandemic norms. The arrests were made as Singh and other leaders were hoisting the party flag.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-leaders-held-in-tripura-over-martyrs-day-gathering/articleshow/84623878.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Doing oppn politics in Bengal now a ‘crime’, says Dilip||KOLKATA: Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh, in his virtual address with photographs of party supporters killed since assembly poll results were declared in May, said that doing oposition politics was a “crime” in West Bengal. Ghosh trashed claims by chief minister Mamata Banerjee that there was no post-violence violence, saying 30 BJP workers had been killed since she took charge as CM on May 5 for the third time. “There have been 11,782 incidents of violence in the state after assembly poll results came out on May 2. Around 80,000 people had to leave their home and hearth and take shelter in other states,” he said. The Bengal BJP president presented a report on the attacks on women after assembly polls. “I wonder how a woman CM could brush aside the 123 cases of violence against women. As many as 39 women were gang-raped, of which only three victims could lodge formal complaints. When the National Commission for Women chairperson urged others to lodge complaints, they shied away, saying their family members would lose their lives if they did so,” Ghosh said, citing findings of the NHRC panel report to the Calcutta High Court. While describing post-poll violence, he alleged: “Heavy earth movers were used to raze to the ground shops and houses belonging to the opposition. Police didn’t take any action.” Bengal leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari likened the violence to the Great Calcutta Killings of 1946. “The violence this time was quite different from past incidents. Members from a particular community, the believers of Sanatan culture and values, were targeted. The attack was led by another community, reminiscent of the Great Calcutta Killings, Noakhali riots, the riot against Sikhs. The NHRC report is only the tip of the iceberg,” he said. BJP MPs from Bengal, led by Ghosh, staged a dharna near Rajghat in Delhi. Former Union minister Debasree Chaudhury, BJP MPs Jayanta Roy and Arjun Singh narrated their experiences. BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta took to his Twitter handle to post about the coincidence of ‘Khela Hobe Divas’ with the Direct Action Day of Muslim League. “Interesting @MamataOfficial has declared August 16 as “khela hobe divas”. It is the day the Muslim League launched its Direct Action Day & began the Great Calcutta Killings in 1946. In today’s West Bengal, “Khela Hobe” has come to symbolise a wave of terror attacks on opponents,” he tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/doing-oppn-politics-in-bengal-now-a-crime-says-dilip/articleshow/84623934.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||Suvendu guard case: CID calls 8 cops to Kolkata||KOLKATA: CID has summoned eight cops — all from Bengal police and most of them part of leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari’s security detail in 2018 — to Bhabani Bhawan on Thursday in the probe into the mysterious death of Adhikari’s security guard Subhabrata Chakraborty three years ago. The former IC of Contai police station, who was questioned a day before by CID’s anti-homicide wing, has been summoned again. This is the first time so many cops have been summoned to Kolkata by CID in the ongoing probe into the death of Chakraborty, a State Armed Police (SAP) personnel. The investigators have so far recorded the statement of 16 cops. All were either present at the Contai barracks (opposite the Shantikunj home of the Adhikaris) on the day Chakraborty died or were involved in the probe after his death at a hospital in Kolkata. CID sources said the decision to summon these cops to Kolkata was taken after the agency had summoned three officers — the former IC, an ASI and a constable — to record their statements on Tuesday. Sources said they found certain anomalies in the statements of various witnesses recorded so far (including 16 cops) and might summon them again for further clarification. “Kolkata headquarters offers us better amenities and infrastructure to carry out questioning,” a senior CID officer said in a terse reply on suddenly summoning these cops to the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suvendu-guard-case-cid-calls-8-cops-to-kolkata/articleshow/84623933.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Khela hobe in 2024 in all states. People won’t forgive us if we don’t unite, says CM Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee used the July 21 Martyrs’ Day platform to pitch for a united “front” of opposition parties to take on the BJP in the 2024 general election. “People will never forgive us if we don’t (unite),” Banerjee said, urging senior opposition leaders “not to waste a single day” and to set aside “self-interest for national interest” to “work together... and make a front” to take on the “goli and gali ka sarkar”. “Khela hobe in 2024 in every state in the country till the BJP is ousted,” she promised. “We have to unite, for our people, for our country,” she added. “Bura na mano, Modiji. Mohabbat kaam ki baat se hota hai, mann ki baat se nahi (Don’t mind, Modiji. Work, not talk is proof of love),” the Bengal CM said, targeting PM Narendra Modi. Banerjee’s call for opposition unity was the highlight of her address on Shahid Diwas, marked every year on July 21 to commemorate the death of 13 Youth Congress workers in police firing in 1993. The party’s second “virtual rally” in as many years was beamed live across several thousand venues in Bengal and other states and, significantly, was attended by important opposition leaders, including P Chidambaram and Digvijaya Singh from the Congress, Sharad Pawar and Supriya Sule from the NCP, Jaya Bachchan and Ram Gopal Yadav from the Samajwadi Party as well as representatives from the DMK, the TRS, the RJD, the Shiv Sena, AAP and the Shiromani Akali Dal. Banerjee asked Pawar and Chidambaram, who attended the rally at Delhi’s Constitution Club, whether a meeting of opposition parties could be arranged on July 27, 28 or 29, when she would be in Delhi. “At least we can talk,” she said, adding that she was planning a rally at Kolkata’s Brigade Parade Ground “if the Covid situation is over... during the winter” for which she would send out invites to all opposition leaders and CMs. But she made it clear that she did not harbour prime ministerial ambitions. “I am only a worker. I will carry out instructions of senior leaders,” she said. “Elections are two-and-a-half years away but we need to start to work together,” Banerjee said, explaining that “(even) independence is at risk” with the BJP — “a highly loaded virus, even worse than corona” — in office. “A country cannot run like this,” she said, adding that the BJP-led government was now “only a conductor of (central) agencies”. “BJP-r mogoje morubhoomi (The BJP has a barren brain),” she said, accusing the centre of being a “monumental failure” in tackling Covid that led to 4 lakh-plus deaths. “The PM praises UP’s handling of Covid when bodies are dumped in the Ganges and it is left to us to find and cremate them with the respect they deserve. They don’t even respect the dead. Where are the vaccines? We need 14 crore vaccines, have got only 2.1 crore. When will everyone be vaccinated?” she asked. “Their CM, Yogi, removes Rabindranath Tagore from the school syllabus (in UP),” Banerjee said, quoting Tagore multiple times in her speech. “People in Bengal have cast their vote despite several obstacles. They (the BJP) used money, mafia, government, agencies. Now they are shouting post-poll violence. What else do you expect when a BJP leader becomes an NHRC member? There was was only pre-poll violence here. The Election Commission became a BJP party office,” Banerjee said, asking the BJP leadership to have “some shame”. “LPG prices have increased 47 times in the last two months. There is vaccine, no medicine. Fuel prices have run away beyond control. I urge all political parties to protest in every state. I believe we will succeed and there will be a new dawn in India if we keep the faith,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/khela-hobe-in-2024-in-all-states-people-wont-forgive-us-if-we-dont-unite-cm/articleshow/84623856.cms||---

The dharna was led by state party president Dilip Ghosh and addressed by Supriyo’s former colleague Debasree Chaudhury, now an MP. According to BJP sources, Bishnupur MP Soumitra Khan was present. Hooghly MP Locket Chatterjee and Barrackpore MP Arjun Singh spoke, along with others. The absence of the former junior Union minister raised some eyebrows, even after he told his admirers to not pay heed to rumours about his leaving BJP and to judge him by his “deeds”. Supriyo has also become less active on social media. The Asansol MP took a call from TOI on Wednesday evening but declined to comment on the issue. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Supriyo recommended 35 actions to the district magistrate under his MPLAD fund, urging him to take up the work as soon as possible. He captioned it “Manusher Takai Manusher Kaaj (people’s work with public money)”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/babul-supriyo-absent-from-bjp-dharna-in-delhi/articleshow/84623900.cms||Mohammad Asif
---||Kolkata||Bengal BJP lobs tap charge back at TMC||Kolkata: Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh on Wednesday pointed a finger at chief minister Mamata Banerjee and her government, alleging they had been using Pegasus spyware for long. “Mamata Banerjee and her government use the spyware to keep a tab on the opposition and her own men. You can ask Mukul Roy, who had moved up to the Supreme Court alleging that the CM was tapping his phone. She, along with Congress, is raising an uproar on Pegasus only to malign Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his good work,” alleged Ghosh, who is also the Midnapore MP. The Bengal BJP chief said tapping phones was part of “Congress” culture. “It is an open secret that Indira Gandhi used to tap phonecalls, even of her ministerial colleagues and partymen. Mamata Banerjee hails from the same Congress culture. Our party has never been into such things,” he said. Ghosh also took exception to the Trinamool complaint against junior Union minister Nisith Pramanik over his citizenship. “Trinamool leaders get oblivious of the past so fast. They had no complaints against the young minister when he was a leader of Yuva Trinamool. It didn’t even strike them that Pramanik had served under the state government. They started making bogus allegations after Pramanik became a Union minister,” he said. Ghosh further complained that the Trinamool government had been slapping “false cases” against BJP workers for long. “The Trinamool government has slapped 35,000 false cases against BJP workers, including grave charges like murder. More than a 1,000 BJP workers have been released on bail while others are pending,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-bjp-lobs-tap-charge-back-at-tmc/articleshow/84623898.cms||---
---||Kolkata||2 dead in firing on TMC supporters in Haroa||HAROA: Two persons, including a 62-year-old woman, were gunned down and eight others seriously injured after a group of miscreants opened indiscriminate fire on a Trinamool Congress rally at Haroa in North 24 Parganas on Wednesday. “We have already arrested 18 people in this connection and recovered three firearms. Preliminarily, we suspect the shooting occurred during a clash between two groups on a local issue,” Basirhat police superintendent Jobby Thomas told TOI. The victims were identified as Laxmibala Mondal (62) and Sannyasi Sardar (28), both of whom were declared brought dead at Haroa State General Hospital. All injured who suffered severe bullet injuries were admitted to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata. The condition of four is said to be critical. According to local sources, the incident took place around 4.30pm when the Trinamool supporters were returning home after attending a virtual rally on the party’s Martyrs’ Day, organised by Trinamool’s Mohanpur ‘anchal’ president Tapan Roy at Tangramari ground in Haroa’s Mohanpur. “While we were passing by the house of Mohanpur Trinamool booth president Jaggeswar Pramanik, armed miscreants hidden in an abandoned room opened fire, at least 10-12 rounds. We scattered in panic and ran for cover. Several of us were hit by bullets while two died on the spot,” said Sabir Ali Mondal, a local Trinamool supporter. Sources said two Trinamool groups, one led by Roy and the other by Pramanik, used to engage in bitter battles over several issues. Trinamool’s Minakhan leader Mrittunjoy Mondal, however, said: “There is no factional feud within Trinamool. Shots were fired by some criminals over an old rivalry. Police are looking into the matter.” A large police contingent, including RAF and Combat Force, led by senior district police officers has rushed to the spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2-dead-in-firing-on-tmc-supporters-in-haroa/articleshow/84623887.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

However, it remains to be seen whether Amarinder will be willing to bury the hatchet and attend the event to congratulate Sidhu as a public apology by Sidhu for his ‘derogatory’ tweets does not seem to be in the order. Sources said a letter to this effect was endorsed by the MLAs who had converged on Sidhu’s residence in Amritsar to make a request for Amarinder’s presence. Sidhu will officially take over on Friday as the new PPCC chief along with four working presidents. Nagra deputed to hand over invite to AmarinderWorking president Kuljit Singh Nagra has been deputed to hand over the letter to Amarinder on Thursday and he has sought an appointment with the CMO. Earlier in the day, Nagra told reporters, “We make a request to the chief minister, besides the entire Congress leadership and party cadres to attend the programme and bless the new team.” However, sources close to Amarinder, meanwhile, said no such letter had been received by the CM till Wednesday evening. Cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa confirmed the development to TOI, adding that he had made a prior attempt on behalf of Sidhu to reach out to Amarinder through his loyalist former MLA Lal Singh. He, however, rejected reports that the MLAs passed any resolution in Amritsar. “We had gone there to pay obeisance at the Golden temple and not to pass any resolutions,” he said. AICC in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat is likely to attend the event. There are plans to invite Rahul Gandhi for the official take over, besides Congress leader Kamal Nath and the Rajasthan CM. However, there was still no official confirmation. Sidhu, meanwhile, met the outgoing Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar as many as three times in the last few days and the event on Friday will merely be a formality. However, there are indications that the MLAs are mobilising supporters from the state for the ceremony. “On Tuesday evening, a message was sent out to the MLAs to come over to Amritsar and those present signed the letter to the chief minister. There were around 60 MLAs present at Sidhu’s residence. Any new president who takes over goes to the Golden Temple but in this case the entire turn of events is being overhyped due to the annoyance of the chief minister,” said an MLA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-team-navjot-singh-sidhu-to-invite-cm-amarinder-singh-for-friday-event/articleshow/84625257.cms||Vibhor Mohan

The house was ransacked and several ornaments and valuables were missing. The domestic help — who came from outside Bengal had joined work a week ago — was missing and cops are looking for him as the prime suspect in the case. The woman was found lying on her bed in a nightgown with a towel wrapped around her neck. Her body has started decomposing and cops suspect she was strangulated to death a couple of days ago. Neighbours have told cops they hadn’t seen the woman since Monday. “A mineral water supplier alerted neighbours that no one was responding to the repeated knocks for two days. Our officers reached the house and found the woman dead in her bedroom and almirahs ransacked,” said an officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate. The woman’s son lives in Teghoria and daughter in Salt Lake. They said that in 2019, the woman had been to Mumbai where she had stayed at a hotel and met a domestic help.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-62-year-old-found-murdered-in-lake-town-help-missing/articleshow/84625410.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Attendance improves in Chandigarh govt schools on Day 3||By: Poviet KaurCHANDIGARH: There was a slight improvement in student turnout in UT government schools on Wednesday as compared to Monday when schools had reopened. On Day 1, around 4,000 students out of 40,000 had attended the school in person. Maintaining social distance and waiting for their turns, students were beaming with excitement on the third day of reopening. At present, the city has 53 government high schools (up to Class X ) and 43 government model senior secondary schools (up to Class XII). Priya, a student at Sector 18 government school, missed the first day due to heavy rains. She said, “I had missed my first day at school due to heavy rains, but today I loved it. It was refreshing for me to be taught in person that I have missed during online sessions.” Talking about their experience of offline classes after a gap of five months, the students were beaming with excitement. However, some parents remained anxious about the safety of their children. The staff of several schools is confident of seeing an improvement in attendance in the coming days. “Our main priority is safety of the students. We are following all guidelines and protocols related to Covid-19 regulations,” said a staff member of Sector 18 government School. Talking to TOI, Rubinderjit Singh Brar, school education director, said, “As compared to the opening day, attendance for the second day slightly improved and the reassessment of the same will be done on Friday.” On the other hand, the principal of a government school was of a different opinion. He said, “The number of students who came to the school on the second day dropped as compared to Day 1. It might remain the same way as some of the parents and children are in fear of the third wave.” An education department official said the attendance was likely to pick up from Monday. Earlier, the UT administration had announced closure of schools amid Covid-19 crisis in the city. Now, with the number of active cases ebbing, school authorities feel that parents would sign the consent form to send their children. According to administration orders, schools will remain open from 8.30am to 1pm for students and 8am to 2pm for the staff. The students will need to bring a consent letter signed by their parents. For those, who do not wish to attend physically, online classes will continue. All heads of schools have been asked to ensure compliance with Covid protocols and vaccination of all teaching and non-teaching staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/attendance-improves-in-ut-govt-schools-on-day-3/articleshow/84623703.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: ‘Interested investors can approach us ... will ensure ease of doing business’, says IT minister T Mano Thanga raj||Tamil Nadu’s brain drain in the IT sector to other states and in some cases other countries is a matter of serious concern. The DMK government is working towards putting brakes on this by creating a conducive ecosystem. IT minister T Mano Thanga rajin an interview to Jayaraj Sivan talks about the initiatives to ensure that startups flourish and IT majors set up new facilities and create employment opportunities. Excerpts:Tamil Nadu has slipped from one of the top three states in software exports to being one among the topWhat are your plans to regain the lost ground?Our target is to make Tamil Nadu a technology hub and top software exporter in the country. Despite the state churning out 1.5 lakh IT graduates every year, we have provided employment to just eight lakh IT professionals till now. Qualified IT engineers are either going to other states and countries in search of jobs or they remain unemployable. We will put brakes on this brain drain and create a conducive ecosystem for startups to flourish and IT majors to set up new facilities here to generate employment opportunities. Tamil Nadu IT department does not know how many IT companies function in the state. No one has made any effort to take a head count. We are doing it now. We want to bring giants like Google, Facebook and Apple to Tamil Nadu. Anyone interested in investing in Tamil Nadu can approach me. I will ensure that there is ease of doing business here and they get clearances without delay. Very few colleges in the state are focusing on innovations and emerging technologies. The government will take efforts to bridge this gap and focus on deep technologies, fintech, artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Improving the skill set of our engineers and taking IT services to the 12,534 village panchayats are high on the government’s priority. It will also improve rural employment. The CM has already announced seven new IT parks, most of which will come up in tier-two and tier-three cities and towns. We are considering the request for an IT park in Karur too. Elcot has many buildings, which are unused. We are working on re-configuring Elcot facilities to make them compatible for startups, whose space requirement is minimal. We are in the process of studying the IT requirements. A policy shift is on the cards. It will provide answers to all the problems faced by startups. Tamil Nadu is paying the price for the last AIADMK government’s investor-unfriendly approach. It did not look like there was an IT department or IT minister in the state for the past 10 years. We have to make everyone believe that Tamil Nadu has changed and there will not be any delay in decision-making. Post-Covid, nothing is predictable, but with policy corrections, administrative changes, departmental intelligence and aggressive marketing, we are confident of surging forward. Having talked about making digital space accessible to rural folk, how is it possible to do so without implementing the BharatNet project that is mired in a scam?Tamil Nadu Fibrenet Corporation (Tanfinet) is working on taking fibre network to the hinterland. Of the four packages in BharatNet, only two are locked in litigations. We will roll out the remaining two shortly. We are confident of resolving the legal tangles. The government will abide by the court’s decision as regards the packages under litigation. This will take e-seva service to the doorstep of rural folk. Once it is implemented, there won’t be any requirement for students in villages to climb trees to get signals to attend online classes. When will the government go completely paperless and depend fully on technology for governance?The first step towards this is a paperless e-budget, which the finance minister has already announced. e-services and e-governance will progress simultaneously. Our IT policy stipulates that 0.5% to 3% of money allocated to every department should be used for the IT sector. The reality is different. In most offices, computers are used as typewriters and system operators are merely dataentry operators. To bring about a change, we have to start with training government employees. As per Tamil Nadu Business Rules, all IT and ITES activities come under the IT department. The previous government did not follow that. Most departments do not make use of Tamil Nadu e-governance agency’s services. Despite having an in-house Centre of Excellence, many departments outsource IT-related work to private agencies. It should stop, because apart from unnecessary expenditure, working on different platforms hampers system integration. How effective is the ICT Academy in Tamil Nadu?We have reviewed its functioning. It will be revamped to improve services qualitatively and quantitatively. The academy will play a major role in training teachers and improving the skill set of our students. The government is aware that tech giants are no longer interested in conventional degrees. We will address their needs and equip our students accordingly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-interested-investors-can-approach-us-will-ensure-ease-of-doing-business-says-it-minister-t-mano-thanga-raj/articleshow/84625443.cms||Jayaraj Sivan
---||Ahmedabad||Schools in Gujarat may restart classes 9, 11 from next week||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government is most likely to start offline teaching for classes 9 to 11 from next week. The government has already permitted offline classes for Class 12 students. The decision to start schools followed a drastic drop in coronavirus cases. Education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasma said, “We will discuss and take a decision on the opening of schools for classes 9 to 11 at the cabinet meeting scheduled on Thursday. A decision on starting schools for classes1 to 8 will be taken by the core committee which will meet shortly.” However, officials in the education department said attendance will not be mandatory and schools, will have to get permission from parents in writing, allowing their children to attend classes. The government will also direct the schools to have only 50% students in each class. For the past one week, Ahmedabad city has been reporting less than 10 cases, while the state has been reporting less than 50 cases. The government even permitted coaching and tuition classes to operate from the second week of July. Officials in schools’ management said that even for class 12, the attendance was just 50% of the sanctioned strength. “Parents are still reluctant to send their children to schools.” ‘Kids falling behind academically due to online teaching’The Self-Finance School Management Association and Association of Progressive Schools have also given a memorandum and representation to the government to start schools for all classes. The associations said, “Getting back to normal is what we have been anticipating for a long time. With reduction in corona cases, we have witnessed the reopening of most sectors, be it offices, tuitions, or amusement parks. However, with this reopening, we are highly concerned about children, who still stay home in the absence of parents, as the working location of the latter has transferred from home to office. The safety and guidance of the children hence stand at risk.” According to the associations, studies suggest that children in remote learning situations are falling behind academically, especially those who already struggle with writing. They argued that schools serve as a safety net for children, offering a safe place to spend the day. Educators and school counsellors are often the first to spot signs of students struggling to understand concepts, and intervene. The associations suggested that prior to reopening the schools traditionally, all teachers should get vaccinated, preferably with both doses and they would permit only those teachers who have taken at least one dose of vaccine in the classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/schools-in-gujarat-may-restart-classes-9-11-from-next-week/articleshow/84625362.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh just short of herd immunity, say experts||CHANDIGARH: The city is nearing herd immunity to coronavirus. That’s what experts believe. The optimistic projection stems from the preliminary findings of a government hospital’s serosurvey pointing out that 79.4% of the adult population have developed antibodies against Covid. “Taking into account the variants, if more than 80% have antibodies, herd immunity is achieved,” said a public health expert at PGI. The recent serosurvey by ICMR has said 62% of the population in the country have developed antibodies. Going by these reports, experts are hopeful that the next surge will be limited to certain pockets and not as widespread as during the second wave. “Due to the larger vaccination coverage in the city and seropositivity both in rural and the urban areas, the next wave will be manageable,” said the expert. The ongoing serosurveys both in adult population and paediatric group — being conducted by PGI — have enabled experts to understand the prevalence of the infection. “It will also help in focusing our strategies to areas which need attention” said a health department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-just-short-of-herd-immunity-say-experts/articleshow/84625499.cms||Shimona Kanwar

However, no school in the city has so far received any complaints on sexual harassment or those relating to the Protection of Children Against Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. While Hindustan International School has put up Google forms on its website, Velammal Vidyalaya has created exclusive e-mail IDs where students can raise complaints, with confidentiality assured. “We have created a strong monitoring system to ensure students feel safe,” said Shyamala Subbu, principal of Velammal Vidyalaya. The school now has an ‘observer’ or a ‘silent teacher’, whose identity is not revealed, attending every online class. The observer reports on how the classes are conducted to their superiors. C Bharati Lakshmi, principal of Hindustan International School, said apart from the complaint box, senior teachers, including her, regularly interact with students. “ Any complaint that a student raises will be treated confidentially,” said the principal. Mita Venkatesh, principal of Sri Sankara Senior Secondary School, said they also conducted exclusive sessions through their counsellor, raising awareness about the Act. The Madras high court had recently directed every school in the state to set up exclusive complaint boxes in their campuses. Educationists say the virtual platform is ideal for a temporary period. While many schools do have these boxes in place, child rights experts say it is rarely put to effective use as schools often take matters in their own hands and conduct their own inquiries. “Schools need to understand that if any complaint relating to Pocso is raised, they need to take it to law enforcement agencies instead of conducting their own investigations,” said Dr Saranya Jaikumar, educational psychologist and member of the Tamil Nadu State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (TNSCPCR).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/schools-in-chennai-launch-online-complaint-boxes/articleshow/84625509.cms||Aditi R

Of the total 2.2 crore people who have taken the first dose in the state, only 54 lakh have availed the second dose so far. However, health department officials say the number of people waiting for the second dose is inflated due to duplication in names and phone numbers of recipients. Due to technical glitches, many who took the second dose have been issued first dose vaccine certificates. Arundhathi Chandrashekar, mission director, National Health Mission, Karnataka, said it is estimated that 30-40% of the data pertaining to those who have received the first dose is duplicated, inflating the number. The state is now making efforts to contact people waiting for the second dose either through phone or messages from both the state and Co-Win portal, she said. Karnataka Vaccination Support, a WhatsApp service run by StepOne, a private firm working with the state government, is also sending messages to people who are due for the second dose. Errors in names, numbersOfficials said staff at vaccination centres are registering afresh many who are seeking the second dose due to errors in phone numbers or mistakes in spelling of their names when they received the first dose. This has resulted in an increase in the number of those who have taken the first dose and reduced the number who have received the second dose. They say districts have been asked to deploy ASHA workers to verify the list of first dose recipients. Officials say the problem is not unique to Karnataka; multiple states have raised the matter with the central government. “People may have given one phone number while registering for the first dose and another while taking the second dose. The website checks a person’s ID or phone number. If Co-Win, for whatever reason, does not accept the phone number or the ID, the person is registered afresh and added as a new beneficiary,” said Chandrashekar. She added: “The districts will now have to tell us the exact extent of the data duplication. All first dose recipients have to be contacted and checked to find out how many of them have taken the second dose too.” Not as highDr Srinivas G, Bengaluru Urban district health officer, said 20 out of every 1,000 persons who are considered to have taken only one dose would have got their second dose too. “This is an issue, but not as high as 30% in Bengaluru Urban at least. This is due to data entry errors in feeding mobile numbers or the ID of the vaccine beneficiaries,” said Dr Srinivasa. Dr Srinivasa said that due to a mix-up of phone numbers and Co-Win IDs some of those who received the vaccine would not have got their first dose certificates. “Many such cases come to light only when beneficiaries come back for the second dose. They then find there is no data pertaining to their first dose in the system. This is largely mismanagement from data entry staff,” he said. He also pointed out that there were technical glitches with the Co-Win portal too. “In many cases, people have no proof of having received the first dose either in the form of SMS or certificates. When they turn up for the second dose, if the system does not validate their registration, they are registered afresh and treated as first dose recipients,” another district health officer said. Officials said the Co-Win portal, under the ‘Raise an Issue’ link, now has the facility to merge two first dose certificates so that a final Covid vaccination certificate can be obtained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/karnataka-first-dose-count-inflated-with-duplicates-say-officials/articleshow/84636778.cms||Sunitha Rao R
