The explosion occurred at 7.30am when Chinese workers and accompanying Pakistani staff were headed to their work place for an ongoing hydroelectric project in Dasu area of Kohistan district in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. An emergency statement was posted by the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan in response to the attack, stating: “Recently, personnel of a project of our company in Pakistan have been attacked, causing casualties among our citizens. The Chinese Embassy in Pakistan urgently reminds Chinese citizens, enterprises and projects in Pakistan to pay close attention to the local security situation, strengthen the safety of project personnel , take strict precautions, and do not go out unless necessary.” Condemning the attack, China’s foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian urged Pakistan to “severely punish the perpetrators“ and “earnestly protect the safety of Chinese nationals, organisations and projects” in the country. Initially, there were conflicting reports with some officials saying that the bomb was planted in the bus while others describing it as a roadside explosion. Hours later, the foreign office contradicted reports of an attack, saying that the bus “plunged into a ravine after a mechanical failure resulting in leakage of gas that caused a blast”. The FO put the death toll at 12, including nine Chinese nationals. Meanwhile Prime Minister Imran Khan’s aide on parliamentary affairs Babar Awan, speaking on the floor of the National Assembly, termed it a “cowardly attack” and said that it would “not divert attention from the special initiatives between Pakistan and its neighbours”. Chinese engineers along with Pakistani construction workers have been working on the Dasu hydroelectric project and several others in the region where the blast took place.

While family members alleged there was a mix up of the vaccines, health authorities attached to Gudipalli PHC who conducted the vaccine drive at Bevahalli said the baby might have died of ‘aspiration’ after her mother breast fed her at midnight. Aspiration is where a foreign object, say food, is sucked into the airways or lungs and often leads to death by asphyxiation. A Covid vaccination camp was held in Bevahalli, about 110km from Bengaluru and home to 800 households, on Tuesday and about 25 persons were administered Covaxin in the afternoon session. Radha Rani, senior nurse with the PHC, said it would be better if the eight kids due for pentavalent vaccination too were given the shot. With the help of an Asha worker attached to the village, Rani asked the mothers to get their kids jabbed too. The children’s vaccination was over by evening and the health department staff left the village. The three-month-old daughter of Anjali and Nagaraj was among the children who were administered pentavalent vaccine. The baby kept crying till late in the evening and slept. However, she woke up around midnight and her mother breast fed the child and put her to sleep. Kin allege mix up, doc says it may be due to aspirationThe family members found the baby dead in the morning. The issue was brought to the notice of Dr Surendra, in charge of the PHC at Gudipalli, who rushed to the village. The villagers alleged the baby might have died owing to a mix up of the vaccines. However, after examining the baby, the doctor said the death may have been caused due to aspiration. Dr Surendra said the nurse who administered the vaccine has about 15 years of experience and there was no way there could be a mix up of vaccines as the used vials and the number of people jabbed matched. He said the baby might have suffered aspiration after her mother breast fed her. Babu, who owns a school, said taluk health officer Dr Varnashree visited the village in the morning and found everything regarding the vaccines in order. The villagers too were satisfied with the authorities and the issue was laid to rest, Babu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/three-month-old-girl-dies-a-dayafter-pentavalent-vaccination/articleshow/84421523.cms||---

Chief minister BS Yediyurappa released comprehensive guidelines for operation of the vehicles. “In cities like Bengaluru, allowing e-bike taxis will not only help ease traffic congestion, but also reduce pollution and provide the public an economical option to travel short distances,” the CM said. The policy came into effect from Wednesday. Yediyurappa had announced in his 2020-21 budget that they will come out with a policy to introduce e-bike taxis after some aggregators like Ola, Uber and Rapido tried to introduce bike taxi services in the city by attaching personal motorcycles of riders (white-board vehicles) in the absence of guidelines. As per the rules, aggregators interested in operating e-bike taxis have to obtain a licence in each city. Other than aggregators, the policy will also allow individuals to register e-bikes as taxis to earn a livelihood. They will be allowed to attach the vehicle with an aggregator or operate independently. The rules allow pillion riders (customers) to book e-bike taxis to travel only for distances up to 10km. Motorcycles running on fuel won’t be allowed to operate as bike taxis. Licence for 5 yearsThe government announced two flat fares will be fixed for the taxis, one for up to 5km and another for above 5km and up to 10km. The rules say any person above the age of 15 can book e-bike taxis. Once registration is done, antecedents will be verified by the local police station and a licence will be issued for five years. The security deposit for each bike, while obtaining a licence, is Rs 5,000 and needs to be paid at the local RTO. However, individual licensees can be exempted from the deposit. The e-bikes will have the colour specified by the transport commissioner and the words ‘bike taxi’ painted on both sides of the vehicle, with white plates on the rear and front bearing the same words. The name and phone number of the driver should be affixed on to the e-bike. The vehicle needs to be fitted with GPS if the company has more than 50 bike taxis. Feeds will be shared with law enforcement and administrative authorities whenever required. Rapido welcomed the new policy and its co-founder said: “We appreciate the Karnataka government’s decision to let e2W register as a commercial bike taxi. This is a long-awaited step in the right direction and will help people utilise their well-earned assets to earn a livelihood. We are in talks with the government to consider regular bikes as taxis and hope to see a similar development on this front too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/e-bike-taxis-can-ply-in-state-flat-fares-for-5km-and-10km/articleshow/84421525.cms||---

Pakistani authorities sealed the Chaman-Spin Boldak border crossing for all kinds of trade and travel after the Taliban captured the area, border security officials said. In a video shared with TOI, an Afghan insurgent leader called it a "peaceful" takeover of the border post in Wesh town of the southern Afghan province and claimed that 50 border guards had joined them without putting resistance. The video shows Pak-Afghan flags being hoisted over a building in the background. Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesperson for the militant group, said an important road linking to the Wesh-Chaman border crossing with Pakistan was now under their control. Afghan troops, locals in the border areas said, surrendered the key trade route following a fierce battle with the insurgents. In a Twitter post, Mujahid reassured locals that the Taliban would maintain security in the area and that cross-border trade would resume once an agreement has been reached with Pakistan. The post is the second-most important crossing on the border of landlocked Afghanistan with Pakistan, linking the southern Afghan city of Kandahar to Pakistani ports. Afghan government data shows about 900 trucks cross the Chaman-Spin Boldak frontier every day. The militants seized control of the post a week after Afghanistan’s main trade gateways with neigbouring Iran and Turkmenistan in the western Herat province had fallen to the Taliban. With the spectre of civil war looming over the country, the Taliban have intensified their offensives from the country’s north to the south since the US forces vacated their largest military base in Bagram. In recent weeks, insurgents have even gained ground in areas that had never been considered as their stronghold. Hundreds of Afghan soldiers had fled to Tajikistan and many others surrendered earlier this month when the Taliban captured most of the northern province of Badakhshan, bordering China and Pakistan. One of the most significant victories of the insurgent forces in recent weeks was the capture of Panjwai district in Kandahar. It had fallen to the Taliban hours after the Americans vacated the Kandahar military base. It has put Kandahar city, the second biggest city in Afghanistan, under siege. Kandahar, which is the birthplace of the Taliban movement, had been the venue of fierce battles between the insurgents and Nato forces for over a decade. The Taliban, according to independent sources, now claim to have control over 200 out of 460 districts in 34 provinces. Most of them have fallen to the insurgents after the US and Nato forces began withdrawal of their remaining forces in the war-torn country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-claims-capture-of-key-town-in-kandahar-pakistan-seals-border/articleshow/84421743.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

---||Bengaluru||Covid casts a shadow over Bengaluru toy market||BENGALURU: Disruptions stemming from Covid-19 have hit supply of toys, especially imported metal ones like cars and dolls, in Bengaluru. Reduced imports, mainly from China and other Asian countries, and inter-state transport hurdles owing to the pandemic are being blamed for the situation. Four-year-old Vaibhav from CV Raman Nagar has been yearning for a particular type of a small metal car, which has been his favourite. But his father Reddy has been unable to find the item for him since October. “Even regular shops which had a series of Hot Wheels toys seem to have run out of stock and the new models are yet to arrive,” said Reddy. According to Pasha of Sapphire Toys on Richmond Road, shortage of toys hit like never before and this was soon after the first lockdown ended in 2020. “Most metal toys, dolls and other play items for children, which often originate from China, have completely stopped coming. The Covid situation in various states and the lockdown and transport restrictions have reduced supply to the city in a big way,” he said. Many toy sellers and dealers said prices of their products too went up by 30-40% after the first lockdown owing to rise in fuel rates and consequent increase in transportation charges. “Metal toys haven’t been in supply for the last eight months even at the dealers’ end, possibly due to imports falling in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak and lockdown. Moreover, transportation cost too has shot up,” said Vijetha Singh of Potato Kids, a toy store in Nagarbhavi. Stating that purchase price of each and every toy has gone up by at least 30% in the last few months, Singh pointed out that all this came in the backdrop of retailers reeling under the impact of two lockdowns and struggling to cope with slump in business. Dealers insisting on cash payments: RetailersMany toy retailers said dealers are offering credit for bulk orders and are insisting on cash payments upfront. “There has hardly been any business since April. How can retailers place orders by paying full cash to dealers,” asked Singh. As much sought-after collectibles like tiny metal cars have become hard to find, most retailers say children will have to wait for normalcy to return before they can lay their hands on their favourite toys.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/covid-casts-a-shadow-over-bluru-toy-market/articleshow/84421901.cms||Petlee Peter

Officials deployed their men and machines, including an excavator, to clear the trash. TOI had highlighted how people were dumping garbage on several plots and spaces earmarked for parks. The NPKL Open Forum, a group of allottees and residents, thanked BDA for its swift action, but demanded that all the other eight blocks too be cleared of waste, construction debris, weeds and shrubs. There are no streetlights, drawing anti-social elements to the locality. “It is important to set up barricades and open a police station to prevent theft of construction materials, robbery and illegal activities in different parts of the layout,” the forum said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bda-clears-garbage-from-its-layout/articleshow/84421953.cms||Kiran Parashar
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Maharani university students protest tentative exam dates||BENGALURU: Agitated over a circular announcing tentative dates for first and third- semester UG and PG exams, over 50 undergraduate students of Maharani Cluster University staged a demonstration on their campus. The students expressed anguish over being given only 10 days to prepare for the final exams of the previous semester. The circular was issued on July 9. Apoorva CM, AIDSO, Bengaluru district vice-president, said, “We have been demanding that they cancel the exams. That semester was over three months ago. If they still want to conduct exams, they can do so, but the least they could do is keep students informed. A notification can’t be issued 10 days prior to exams.” Exams had been discontinued after students appeared for one subject in April; exams for seven more subjects have been announced from July 19, the students said. They are now demanding that they be notified about the exams at least three weeks in advance. In addition to this, students believe that they are not fully prepared for the exams, considering classes have only happened online. “In case a student can’t clear a subject or two, it will be a black mark on her markscard for life,” said Sakshi Roy, also a BCom student. The candidates were under the impression that the exams would be cancelled as there was no word from the university for long. “In March we were given the timetable for the first semester exams and we wrote only one paper on April 5, which was followed by a series of events, including the bus strike, spike in Covid-19 cases and the lockdown,” added Sakshi. Gomati Devi, vice-chancellor of Maharani Cluster University, said, “We have only sent out a circular about tentative dates for the exams. We have not announced the timetable yet. We understand that the government has to first give permission after which we will have to reopen our hostels for outstation students. Only after the students are vaccinated, can we start setting the timetable. However, we sent out a circular because the students should start preparing. Whatever we do is in the best interest of students. Hence I met them at the protest site and explained to them that it was only a tentative date.” Gomati added that the university had never mentioned anything about cancelling exams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/maharani-varsity-students-protest-tentative-exam-dates/articleshow/84421974.cms||---

---||World||Judge delays sentencing after twists in Mollie Tibbetts case||IOWA CITY: A judge on Wednesday delayed sentencing for the man convicted of killing University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts after defense lawyers said they needed time to investigate new information pointing to other potential suspects.  Cristhian Bahena Rivera, 27, was scheduled to be sentenced to life in prison without parole Thursday before his lawyers revealed newly obtained information that they say calls his guilt into question.  Judge Joel Yates ruled Wednesday the sentencing would be delayed until after he holds hearings on the defense's requests to compel prosecutors to release information about other suspects and to order a new trial. Yates said he would hold the first hearing Thursday at the Poweshiek County Courthouse in Montezuma and set a later date for the hearing on a new trial.  Prosecutors remain confident in Bahena Rivera's guilt and were expected to respond in court filings later Wednesday, state attorney general's office spokesman Lynn Hicks said.  A jury in May found Bahena Rivera guilty of first-degree murder in the stabbing death of Tibbetts, 20, who vanished while out for a run in her hometown of Brooklyn, Iowa, in July 2018.  Prosecutors built their case on surveillance video showing Bahena Rivera driving in the vicinity of where Tibbetts disappeared while jogging, on DNA evidence showing that her blood was found in his car's trunk, and on a partial confession in which Bahena Rivera led investigators to a remote cornfield where her body was found a month after she disappeared.  Bahena Rivera, a dairy farm worker, claimed publicly for the first time while testifying at his trial that two masked men were responsible for the killing and had forced him to drive them around and dispose of Tibbetts' body at gunpoint. A native of Mexico who illegally came to the U.S. as a teenager, he has been jailed since his 2018 arrest.  Defense lawyers Chad and Jennifer Frese requested a new trial last week, saying two witnesses recently came forward independently of one another to partially support Bahena Rivera's testimony. The witnesses told investigators that a 21-year-old man with a history of violence against women had claimed responsibility for killing Tibbetts.  One of the witnesses said the man told him while they were at a county jail that Tibbetts had been kidnapped and brought to a "trap house" used for sex trafficking before she was killed, according to Bahena Rivera's lawyers.  The man told the witness that the house was owned by a 50-year-old who was running the trafficking ring and decided to have Tibbetts killed after the publicity surrounding her disappearance got too big. The man allegedly said he and an associate followed through with a plan devised by the 50-year-old to stab Tibbetts and frame a Hispanic man for the death.  The Freses said they learned Tuesday about a criminal investigation that centered on a 50-year-old man who allegedly met one of his sex trafficking victims in May 2018 at a gas station in Brooklyn, Tibbetts' hometown of 1,700 people that is roughly 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Iowa City.  The woman told investigators that the man lured her to a house in the nearby town of New Sharon, where she was repeatedly drugged, raped, and held against her will until August 2018, court records show. The woman said she sometimes would hear other women's voices in the home.  Law enforcement officials used the information to obtain a warrant to search the home days after they interviewed her in March 2019, but it had already been vacated by the 50-year-old man. They did not charge him, and Mahaska County's sheriff said recently the kidnapping and sex trafficking allegations were never substantiated.  Still, defense lawyers argue that prosecutors should have turned over details about the investigation under their duty to provide exculpatory information to Bahena Rivera. They said the potential existence of the "trap house" corroborates the new witnesses' claims.  They are asking Yates to order the state to release information about prior sex trafficking investigations, including any involving the 21-year-old and 50-year-old. They noted that several other young people have gone missing from the area in recent years, calling that "very troubling."  In court filings, the Freses noted that the 50-year-old man had come under scrutiny in the investigation into the disappearance of an 11-year-old boy, Xavior Harrelson. Xavior vanished from his trailer park in Montezuma on May 28, during closing arguments of the Bahena Rivera trial.  The defense filings noted the 50-year-old man is the former live-in boyfriend of Xavior's mother. Investigators searching for Xavior began looking for the man and arrested him on an unrelated outstanding warrant in another county the day after the boy was reported missing.  Federal authorities detained the 50-year-old man last week on charges of illegally possessing a sawed-off shotgun. He hasn't been charged in the boy's disappearance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/judge-delays-sentencing-after-twists-in-mollie-tibbetts-case/articleshow/84422036.cms||---

This is the sixth instance of a drone hovering over the Jammu area after two explosions rocked the IAF station, located some 14km from the international border, on June 27. Two IAF personnel had suffered minor injuries in the attack, following which 10 J&K districts banned the sale and use of drones for commercial and personal purposes. A BSF spokesperson on Wednesday said that a blinking red light was observed at a height of about 200m on the Indian side of the border in J&K’s Arnia sector on Tuesday night. “Alert troops fired five to six rounds from their positions towards the blinking light, due to which it retreated. The area is being searched but nothing has been found so far,” the spokesperson added. Earlier, on the intervening night of June 27-28, alert troops successfully thwarted two drone intrusions near the Ratnuchak-Kaluchak military station along the Jammu-Pathankot national highway. On June 30, vigilant Armymen again spotted UAVs hovering over the military station and Air Force signal area for the third consecutive day. The airdropping of weapons and contraband from Pakistan into J&K and Punjab is not new, with several such cases reported over the past two years. But the drone activity over high-security zones like defence establishments in Jammu has emerged as a new security threat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pakistan-drone-spotted-over-jammu-border-forced-to-retreat/articleshow/84422040.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

The security forces took extreme care and avoided collateral damage by safely evacuating civilians from the area before the anti-terror operation began. The slain terrorists were identified as Aijaz alias Abu Huraira from Pakistan, and two local terrorists — Javeed Ahmad Rather from Pulwama and Shahnawaz Nazir Ganie from Awantipora. “Aijaz, who was wanted in a string of terror-related cases, was instrumental in luring Kashmiri youth into picking up arms, besides planning and executing terror attacks in the area, including those on police and security establishments,” IGP (Kashmir Range) Vijay Kumar said. The other two were also involved in several terror crimes and civilian atrocities, police said. Based on intelligence inputs about the presence of terrorists in Pulwama’s New Colony Hospital road area, a joint team of the Army, CRPF and J&K Police had launched a cordon-and-search operation there late Tuesday, IGP Kumar said. Once the presence of terrorists was established, the security forces gave the ultras an opportunity to surrender. The holed-in terrorists, however, opened fire at the search party, triggering an encounter. “The operation was temporarily suspended as night fell, even as the cordon remained intact. The terrorists tried to escape taking advantage of the darkness but weren’t successful,” the IGP said. “As dawn broke, repeated announcements were again made asking the terrorists to surrender, but they once more fired on the security forces. In the ensuing gunfight, the Lashkar trio was killed. Their bodies were recovered along with two AK rifles, a pistol, and other incriminating materials from the site of the encounter,” IGP Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lashkar-trio-killed-in-jammu-and-kashmir-encounter/articleshow/84422632.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||World||US probes ties of Colombian suspects in Haiti president's assassination: source||WASHINGTON: US investigators are studying the backgrounds of Colombian mercenaries accused of assassinating Haiti's president last week to see if any of them had past ties to US government agencies, a US source familiar with the investigation said. Seventeen Colombians and two Haitian-Americans were arrested last week by Haitian authorities and accused of shooting President Jovenel Moise dead in his home, an event that further destabilized the poor Caribbean nation. The source said that so far US investigators have not found hard evidence of any connections between the Colombian suspects, who include former members of the Colombian military, and the US government. But they believe some evidence of links are likely to turn up. One of the two Haitian-American men arrested and accused of taking part in the assassination was a former informant for the US drug enforcement administration, the DEA said on Monday. Two US government sources identified him as Joseph Vincent, 55, of Florida. Vincent and the other Haitian-American man accused of joining the assassination, James Solages, 35, told a source they acted as interpreters. Meanwhile, court documents and a defense lawyer said that a Haitian living in Florida who Haitian investigators want to talk to about Moise's murder cooperated with the DEA in a large-scale drug trafficking investigation. Rodolphe Jaar, who was jailed by US federal authorities in 2015 for his alleged role in a conspiracy to smuggle cocaine via Haiti, is the subject of a wanted poster which Haitian police issued related to the assassination. Documents filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, allege that Jaar "conspired to have a portion of a 420 kilogram cocaine load that arrived in Haiti," from Colombia or Venezuela in February 2012 and was ultimately headed for the United States set aside "for his personal gain/interest." At a sentencing hearing in 2014, a federal prosecutor told the court that Jaar "was cooperating with the DEA at the time of the offense, making them aware of a drug shipment that was coming into Haiti", and that "because of his efforts" the DEA was able to seize more than half of the drugs and make an arrest. Prosecutors recommended a reduced prison sentence for Jaar due to his cooperation. A third Haitian-American, Christian Emmanuel Sanon, was arrested on Sunday by Haitian authorities, who accused him of being a mastermind of the attack.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-probes-ties-of-colombian-suspects-in-haiti-presidents-assassination-source/articleshow/84422272.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Company under lens over malware emails to army officers||BENGALURU: Police are on the lookout for a suspected spy who sent malware-laden emails to personal IDs of a few serving Indian Army officers on April 16 and 17. Sleuths from the Military Intelligence and Anti-Terrorism Cell (ATC) of Central Crime Branch on Tuesday swooped down on a private firm’s office at HRBR Layout and conducted a search. The suspicious spy activities were recently traced to the company’s office by military intelligence based on the IP address. A few firm employees were questioned on Wednesday. The raiding party seized three laptops and seven desktops, joint commissioner of police (crime) Sandeep Patil said, adding cybercrime police have registered a case based on information provided by the army. The military intelligence unit recently shared information with state Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and Bengaluru police about the phishing attack. According to sources, the suspicious emails originated in Bengaluru and the suspects accessed a National Informatics Centre email ID to send emails containing a zipped PDF file to the army officers.

The baby was kidnapped from the Bengaluru hospital soon after birth on May 29, 2020, allegedly by a city-based psychiatrist, who handed over the child to an agriculturist-couple from Koppal. The psychiatrist had told the Koppal couple that the child was born to a surrogate mother and had collected Rs 14.5 lakh for sealing the surrogacy deal. The psychiatrist, Dr Rashmi Shashikumar, 34, a resident of Vijayanagar, has since been arrested. On directions from a Bengaluru court, Basavanagudi police subjected five persons — the two couples and the baby — to DNA tests to decide the child’s biological parents. “The reports have come and they confirm that the Bengaluru woman, from whose bedside the boy was kidnapped in May 2020, is the child’s biological mother and her husband, the father. We will approach the same court now seeking permission to legally hand over the custody of the baby to his biological parents,” an investigating officer told TOI. Currently, the child is in the Koppal couple’s custody. “We have intimated them about the DNA results. We have directed them to appear before the Child Welfare Committee, when the court decides on the date to hand over the child. We have also informed the child’s biological parents and have asked them to be present on the same day to get him back,” the officer added. Police investigations had revealed that Dr Rashmi Shashikumarhad taken around Rs 14.5 lakh from the couple after subjecting them to medical formalities for surrogacy. Rashmi had lied to the couple that she had found a woman, who had agreed to become a surrogate mother to their child and that the baby would be delivered in late May 2020. To keep her word, Rashmi stole the baby, said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/dna-test-city-couple-parents-of-rescued-baby/articleshow/84423538.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

Twenty four-wheelers worth Rs 1.8 crore have been seized from Shabbir Khan, in his 30s, a resident of Banashankari. Search is on for his associates Shaktivelu and Saravanna from Hosur in Tamil Nadu. In November 2018, Abdul Sahid, a driver with an ATM van, went missing with Rs 75 lakh from KG Halli. The case was cracked in May this year and police had arrested his four associates. They told cops they had murdered Sahid, a resident of Wilson Garden who hailed from Assam, after he refused to be part of their conspiracy to steal the money. They dumped the body in Sakleshpur Ghat. Police had recovered Rs 3.5 lakh, two SUVs, three two-wheelers and 120 grams of gold from the accused. Police had not found the car used in the crime while arresting the suspects. The accused told them they had disposed it of soon after committing the crime. Deputy commissioner of police (east) SD Sharanappa said: “The accused said they had sold the car to Khan. But they did not have much details of Khan. We traced him to his workplace in Hosur. Khan had purchased the car from the accused and sold it in Tamil Nadu after changing its number plate and producing fake documents. He used to steal cars from the city. He would change Karnataka registration numbers to those of Tamil Nadu. He sold many, claiming the cars were owned by travel agencies which wanted to sell them due to financial losses suffered due to the pandemic.” Another officer said Shaktivelu and Saravanna are big-time offenders dealing in stolen cars. “According to Tamil Nadu police, the trio has sold more than 50 cars since 2018 by forging documents,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/murder-probe-leads-cops-to-thief-20-vehicles-recovered/articleshow/84423544.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: SEC, govt clash over dates for ZP-TP polls||BENGALURU: The government and the state election commission (SEC) are on a collision course over conducting elections for zilla and taluk panchayats. While the government is hesitant in view of the anticipated Covid-19 third wave, the commission is determined to hold them in October-November. The elections, which were due in June, could not be held because of the second wave. While rules mandate to conduct elections within six months of expiry of the term of local bodies, the SEC is preparing for polls notwithstanding the repeated requests of the government to postpone them. The poll panel received 2,500 objections till July 8 after it announced draft reservation for constituencies announced a week before. It followed the delimitation exercise. “We may take 10 days to examine the objections before notifying the final notification of reservation. The election dates will be announced after 45 days,” said Karnataka state election (KSE) commissioner B Basavaraj. With 31 ZPs and 226 TPs, including 56 newly formed taluk panchayats, going to polls, the panchayat elections are the second largest after the assembly polls involving around three crore voters. The ZP-TP polls are fought on party symbols and hence, they are politically significant. The government is upset about the SEC’s move to go ahead with the announcement of reservation despite the cabinet officially requesting to put off the poll process. Minister for rural development and Panchayat Raj KS Eshwarappa even went to the extent of terming the commission “dictatorial.” “I made the statement since it ignored the cabinet’s resolution to postpone the polls. It did not even show courtesy to inform the government before announcing the draft reservation,” said Eshwarappa, adding that the government will not pursue further to postpone the polls since it is the SEC’s prerogative to schedule them. “The opposition may blame the ruling party for stalling elections. BJP is confident of winning the elections and we’ll start preparations instead of requesting to postpone,” he said. KPCC president DK Shivakumar said BJP should not delay elections on the pretext of Covid-19. “But it should take utmost care while holding these polls to ensure the safety of people keeping in mind that bypolls for Belagavi Lok Sabha and two assembly constituencies had triggered the second wave,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/sec-govt-clash-over-dates-for-zp-tp-polls/articleshow/84423545.cms||---

A video of the incident has gone viral on social media, but there has been no police complaint yet. Sullia police are conducting an inquiry on their own. The incident took place three days ago at the grounds of a shrine dedicated to a demigod in Sullia taluk, about 90km from here. TOI could not independently confirm the video’s authenticity. The footage shows the shrine committee member asking the Christian boy to leave the ground and instead play at church premises. At that juncture, Hindu boys are seen supporting their Christian friend and requesting the committee member to not drag religion into the issue. The committee member suddenly turned his ire on the Hindu boys, upbraiding them for playing cricket “with people from other religions”. He is heard telling the boys that he has spoken to the MLA over the phone on the issue. Sources claimed that the shrine committee had decided to plant saplings and dug up pits for the same. Since it was not possible to play cricket at that place, a few youths protested saying they were Hindus and should be allowed to play cricket at the ground. This allegedly irked the committee member, who said a Christian boy was among the players and questioned his presence at the temple. The committee member, identified as Praveen, later offered apologies and said he had no intention to hurt anybody. A police officer said they informally spoke to the committee member and the boys, and both denied the intention to hurt anyone on religious grounds.

While Cidco MD Dr Sanjay Mukherjee did not respond to calls and text messages from TOI, PRO Priya Ratambe said they will verify the claims. The lands originally belong to Sir Mohammed Yusuf trust-Mumbai, Khan Bahadur Hormasji Maneckji Bhiwandiwala (KBHMB)- Mumbai, Jama Masjid trust-Uran and Sarvodaya trust-Uran, and the Bhaiji and Tungekar families. Salt pan land ownership issues complex, says Uran tehsildarPrivate landowners have been running from pillar-to-post to get back their salt pan lands spread across Uran, Panvel, Alibaug and Pen talukas of Raigad district that had been acquired to set up Navi Mumbai in 1973. “Our lands in Navi Mumbai and Raigad were illegally grabbed. These salt pan lands were in our possession for over three centuries,” claimed Alim Bhaiji (53), a Bhaiji family litigant in Uran. “The problem started with a government land acquisition notification issued in 1973 for Cidco’s Navi Mumbai. The land parcels were illegally taken over on ‘Nil award’, ‘No Right’ basis,” he added. Bhaiji told TOI that some of the salt pan lands in Uran were illegally given on rent to private and public sector oil storage tank companies. “The Supreme Court judgments of 2002 and 2016 as well as high court and lower court orders in our favour have not been acted upon by the revenue department officials, who fear they will be exposed,” Bhaiji added. A power of attorney holder of Khan Bahadur Hormasji Maneckji Bhiwandiwala (KBHMB)-Mumbai, alleged: “Large tracts of salt pan lands of our trust have been illegally grabbed by builders in connivance with government officials. Neither the 12.5% nor 22.5% land compensation was awarded to us for the acquisition. Every time we approach the court, the authorities do not act to resolve the issue under the influence of the builders’ lobby. Some family members of trustees even illegally obtained 12.5% land compensation by producing fake documents claiming ownership.” Sir Mohammed Yusuf trust-Mumbai trustees were unavailable for comment. A Tungekar family member and Jama Masjid trust-Uran trustees did not respond to calls and text messages, while Sarvodaya trust-Uran could not be contacted. Uran tehsildar Bhausaheb Andhare said; “The salt land ownership issues are complex and various litigations are on. Some of the individual members have been given land records. The claimants should approach us with documents and court orders whatsoever with them.” Dr Vivek Vartak, a scientist at Panvel’s Kharland Research Centre, a government agency which conducts research on salt pan land in the Konkan region, said: “The land issues are being dealt with by the revenue department and if there are mangroves on it then it’s the forest department. We are only into research.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/salt-pan-owners-wait-for-justice-50-years-on/articleshow/84426752.cms||Umesh K Parida
---||World||US bid to attract talent: Opening statement at the subcommittee hearing||MUMBAI: Part 1: A group of US lawmakers recently held a hearing titled – ‘Oh, Canada! How outdated US immigration policies push top talent to other countries.’ The aim of this subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship, was to understand how Canada’s immigration laws and procedures are helping it to attract top talent, these learnings in turn could perhaps spur the necessary immigration reforms in the US. Soon after Joe Biden was sworn in as President – one of the first steps announced was the presentation of a comprehensive immigration reform legislative package to the Congress. While several steps have been taken to strengthen the legal immigration system, there has till date been no major legislative reform. Read also: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-reforms-on-day-1-set-to-cheer-indian-diaspora/articleshow/80377087.cms"With today’s hearing, we explore the harmful effects that our antiquated immigration system has had on our ability to compete in the global race for talent, particularly in relation to Canada," was the opening statement by House judiciary committee chairman, Jerrold Nadler. "A diverse talent base that includes the best and brightest minds from around the world is critical to strengthening our STEM advantage, and by extension—our national security interests. Toward that end, I note that the bipartisan National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence calls immigration reform a national security imperative." "The last time any significant changes were made to our immigration laws was in 1990. Back then, most of us were not using the internet, and cell phones had yet to be mass-produced. Things like text messaging and grid computing—which paved the way for cloud computing—had not even been invented. The Human Genome Project was launched but our understanding of the role that genes play in disease causation was only just beginning," he added. "Things that we take for granted today were the stuff of science fiction 30 years ago. And yet today, we remain bound by an immigration system that is frozen in another era. Without reforms, there is no doubt that we will lose top scientific talent and innovators to both allies and adversaries with modernized systems," he continued. Indian professionals, including highly-skilled workers in the STEM field can well relate to Nadler’s following statement. "First, temporary visa options for highly skilled workers are quite limited. Visas are available to individuals who have already risen to the very top of their fields, as well as those who are transferring from an overseas company to a US affiliate. But graduates of US universities—including those with master’s and Ph.D. degrees—who wish to start their STEM careers here must often compete with thousands of others for one of a limited number of 'specialty occupation' visas." (This refers to H-1B visas). "Those who are fortunate enough to beat the odds and obtain a temporary visa, face other obstacles if their employer wishes to sponsor them for permanent residence. As a result of annual caps on employment-based visas, many are forced to wait years—and in some cases decades—for an immigrant visa to become available." (TOI has often quoted a CATO Institute study. According to David J Bier, Immigration Policy Analyst at this think-tank the employment based green card backlog (EB2 and EB3 skilled category) for those from India had reached 7.41 lakh in April 2020, with an expected wait time of 84 years ). Nadler remarked that many immigrants who would otherwise pursue the American dream are now turning to other countries – notably Canada, which has made significant strides in building flexibility and incentives into their immigration system to attract skilled professionals to their shores. "Programs like Express Entry, the Start-Up Visa, and the Global Talent Stream have proven so successful that those who have been failed by the US immigration system are now turning to Canada. Ironically, Canada’s successful Start-Up Visa Program was inspired by legislation introduced in the House in 2011 that never became law. The results are paying off, with Toronto earning the moniker—the 'Silicon Valley of the North,' he stated. "It is my hope that with this hearing, we can begin to build some consensus on reforms that are needed to ensure that our immigration system works for—not against—the American people,” summed up Nadler. In a series of articles, TOI will bring to you excerpts of suggestions made by some of the witnesses called for the hearing and by other experts who gave their written submissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-bid-to-attract-talent-opening-statement-at-the-subcommittee-hearing/articleshow/84423865.cms||Lubna Kably
---||World||Iran foreign ministry: Iran kidnap plot is 'imaginary story'||NEW YORK: An Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson said Wednesday that accusations by US authorities that Iran is plotting to kidnap Iranians abroad who criticize the country are "baseless and ridiculous.'' The spokesperson, Saeed Khatibzadeh, was quoted by Iran's semiofficial ISNA news agency a day after US federal authorities in New York announced criminal charges against four Iranian intelligence operatives. The authorities, quoting from an indictment, say the individuals plotted to kidnap a prominent Iranian opposition activist and writer in exile from her Brooklyn residence and take her to Tehran. Khatibzadeh derided the plot as "Hollywood-style scenarios'' and "baseless and ridiculous'' accusations unworthy of a response. "Making such an imaginary story is not unlikely by the US Its entire short history is full of assassination, kidnapping and sabotage in other countries,'' Khatibzadeh said. Later Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told a briefing that Iran's "actions to attempt to silence the voices of those peacefully working to address the situation both inside of Iran and outside of Iran are appalling.'' "We categorically condemn Iran's dangerous and despicable reported plot to kidnap a US citizen on US soil,'' she said. She said law enforcement actions like those announced Tuesday were part of a strategy to defend US citizens and interests that includes actions taken to defend US forces from Iranian-backed militant groups and diplomatic efforts to constrain Iran's nuclear program. The indictment in Manhattan federal court described the plot as part of a wider plan to lure three individuals in Canada and a fifth person in the United Kingdom, along with individuals in the United Arab Emirates, to Iran. The identities of the alleged victims were not released but Brooklyn-based Masih Alinejad confirmed that authorities had told her she was among the targets. "I knew that this is the nature of the Islamic Republic, you know, kidnapping people, arresting people, torturing people, killing people. But I couldn't believe it that this is going to happen to me in United States of America,'' Alinejad told The Associated Press. Alinejad, who worked for years as a journalist in Iran, long has been targeted by its theocracy after fleeing the country following its disputed 2009 presidential election and crackdown. She is a prominent figure on Farsi-language satellite channels abroad that critically view Iran and has worked as a contractor for US-funded Voice of America's Farsi-language network since 2015. She became a US citizen in October 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/iran-foreign-ministry-iran-kidnap-plot-is-imaginary-story/articleshow/84423650.cms||---
---||India||Terror group activities key factor in Afghanistan instability: SCO||NEW DELHI: Pledging support for an Afghanistan free of terrorism, war and drugs, the SCO foreign ministers on Wednesday condemned in a joint statement the ongoing violence and terrorist attacks in Afghanistan, the victims of which are civilians and government officials, and advocated an early end to them. With the US withdrawal near complete, SCO is seen is playing an increasingly important role in ensuring a stable and peaceful Afghanistan. Touching upon India's concerns over terrorism, the joint statement issued after the Afghanistan Contact Group meeting stated that the activity of international terrorist organizations remains one of the key factors of instability in the country. Participating in the meeting earlier, foreign minister S Jaishankar called for efforts to ensure that neighbours are not threatened by terrorism, separatism and extremism. He also called for an end to violence and terrorist attacks against civilians and state representatives, for settling conflict through political dialogue, and for respecting interests of all ethnic groups. With India concerned about extremism imposed from beyond Afghanistan's borders, he said the challenge was to act seriously and sincerely because "there are forces at work with a very different agenda". India remains concerned about the Taliban's links with Pakistan's ISI and India-specific terror groups like LeT and JeM. The contact group meeting was also attended by Jaishankar's counterparts from Pakistan, China and Russia and other member states. Significantly, reports from Beijing said on Wednesday that China had also asked Taliban in the meeting to " make a clean break" from all terror groups, especially the al-Qaida-backed Uyghur Muslim militant group ETIM fighting for the volatile Xinjiang province's independence. According to an agency copy, foreign minister Wang Yi stressed that further spread of the war in Afghanistan, especially an all out civil war, should be avoided and called for restarting intra-Afghan negotiations and "prevention of all kinds of terrorist forces from gaining ground in Afghanistan". The SCO statement expressed deep concern over the growing tension in the northern provinces of Afghanistan as a result of the sharp increase in the concentration of various terrorist, separatist and extremist groups. "We consider it important to build up the joint efforts of the SCO member states in order to counter terrorism, separatism and extremism. We urge all parties involved in the conflict in Afghanistan to refrain from using force and actions that could lead to destabilization and unpredictable consequences in the areas of Afghanistan's borders with the SCO member states," it said. The statement also reaffirmed the position of the SCO member states that there is no alternative to the settlement of the conflict in Afghanistan through political dialogue and the "implementation of an inclusive peace process by the Afghans themselves and under the leadership of the Afghans themselves". "We call for building up cooperation of all interested states and international organizations with the UN's central coordinating role in order to stabilize and develop this country," it said.

---||World||EU unveils tough climate rules, eyes tax on foreign firms||BRUSSELS: The European Union unveiled sweeping new legislation Wednesday to help meet its pledge to cut emissions of the gases that cause global warming by 55% over this decade, including a controversial plan to tax foreign companies for the pollution they cause.  The legislation presented by the EU's executive branch, the European Commission, encompasses about a dozen major proposals, ranging from the de-facto phasing out of gasoline and diesel cars by 2035 to new levies on gases from heating buildings.  They involve a revamp of the bloc's emissions trading program, under which companies pay for carbon dioxide they emit, and introduce taxes on shipping and aviation fuels for the first time.  Most of the proposals build on existing laws that were designed to meet the EU's old goal of a 40% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels - and must be endorsed by the 27 member countries and EU lawmakers.  World leaders agreed six years ago in Paris to work to keep global temperatures from increasing more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees C (2.7 F) by the end of the century. Scientists say both goals will be missed by a wide margin unless drastic steps are taken to reduce emissions.  "The principle is simple: emission of CO2 must have a price, a price on CO2 that incentivizes consumers, producers and innovators to choose the clean technologies, to go toward the clean and sustainable products," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.  The commission wants to exploit the public mood for change provoked by the COVID-19 pandemic. It's already channeling more than one-third of a massive recovery package aimed at reviving European economies ravaged by coronavirus restrictions into climate-oriented goals.  The aim of the "Fit for 55" legislation, commission officials say, is to ween the continent off fossil fuels and take better care of the environment by policy design, rather than be forced into desperate measures at some future climatic tipping point, when it's all but too late.  European Commission Executive Vice-President Frans Timmermans said that by failing to act now, "we would fail our children and grandchildren, who in my view, if we don't fix this, will be fighting wars over water and food."  Given the implications, the proposals are certain to be subject to intense lobbying from industry and environmental groups as they pass through the legislative process over at least the next year. They'll also face resistance because of the very different energy mixes in member countries, ranging from coal-reliant Poland to nuclear-dependent France.  Germany's environment minister, Svenja Schulze, said negotiations need to focus on maintaining the ambitious targets in a reliable way, be fair to the poor and ensure all of Europe "goes down this path together."  "National solo efforts won't lead to the goal," she said. "There needs to be a coordinated, massive expansion of sun and wind power from the North Sea to the Mediterranean."  Echoing the thoughts of some climate scientists, Oxfam EU head Evelien van Roemburg urged the member countries and lawmakers to be more ambitious than the European Commission.  "They must step up ambition by ensuring all EU climate rules contribute to carbon emission cuts of at least 65% in 2030, rather than the current 55%," she said.  Among the legislation's most controversial elements is a plan for a "Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism." It would impose duties on foreign companies and therefore increase the price of certain goods, notably steel, aluminum, concrete and fertilizer.  The aim is to ease pressure on European producers that cut emissions but struggle to compete with importers that don't have the same environmental restrictions.  The question is how the EU - known for its staunch defense of open trade - will ensure that the carbon tax complies with World Trade Organization rules and not be considered a protectionist measure.  Another concern is the need to help those likely to be hit by rising energy prices. The commission is proposing the creation of a "social climate fund" worth several billion euros to help those who might be hardest hit.  "This fund will support income and it will support investments to tackle energy poverty and to cut bills for vulnerable households and small businesses," von der Leyen said.  But Martha Myers, a member of the climate justice team at Friends of the Earth Europe, said the decision to extend emissions trading to buildings "throws low-income people into high energy price waters while offering only a swimming float of support to relieve energy poverty."  Under Fit for 55, a drastic acceleration in sales of battery-powered cars also is likely as the EU aims for a 100% reduction in auto emissions.  Hildegard Mueller, president of the German Association of the Automobile Industry, said the industry supports the EU goal of reaching climate neutrality by 2050. But she said that goal can only be accomplished "if the consumers and companies can implement these goals."  Mueller warned of a "substantial" impact on jobs at auto suppliers that would struggle with the pace of the changeover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/eu-unveils-tough-climate-rules-eyes-tax-on-foreign-firms/articleshow/84425114.cms||---
---||India||Explain how UP is allowing kanwar yatra: Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: Noting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement that "we cannot compromise even a bit" on Covid pandemic as the third wave is lurking, the Supreme Court on Wednesday said it was a “little disturbed” as it took suo motu cognisance of news reports that the Uttar Pradesh government was going to allow Kanwar Yatra from July 25 and sought responses from the state and Centre. Taking into account contradictory voices, including the Uttarakhand government’s decision to call off the yatra, the bench of Justices R F Nariman and B R Gavai directed the UP and Uttarakhand governments to file their response within two days and posted the next hearing for July 16. "The headline just above this headline speaks about the Prime Minister’s statement when he met the northeastern chief ministers that when people ask about the third wave of the Covid-19 virus striking the citizenry of India, it’s up to us to stop it and we cannot compromise ‘even a bit’. Given the disparate political voices, all speaking at the same time, it is important that the relevant secretary, Union of India, respond to this news report," the order said. The bench said: "Given the fact that this yatra is to take off from July 25, it is necessary to fix a short time period for this case. Affidavits will be filed by Friday morning, July 16, responding to the aforesaid news article…" The Uttarakhand government on Tuesday decided to cancel the Kanwar Yatra, ending days of speculation that the Pushkar Dhami-led government may reverse the decision taken by the previous Tirath Rawat administration on cancelling the yatra. "At a time when the threat of Covid-19 is still looming and a case of the Delta-plus variant has also been reported from Uttarakhand, we cannot allow Haridwar to become a hotbed of the pandemic," Dhami said while announcing his government's decision. "People’s lives are important and we cannot play around with them. It is important to save lives during a pandemic. Even God will not like it if any lives are lost," he said.

Proposals to legalize marijuana are nothing new. But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is a sponsor of the effort unveiled Wednesday, underscoring how a once-fringe idea is increasingly mainstream. The measure would erode a central pillar of the decades-long war on drugs, which has disproportionately affected communities of color in the United States.  "I will use my clout as majority leader to make this a priority in the Senate," said Schumer, of New York, who is the first Senate leader to support such an effort. "It's not just an idea whose time has come, it's long overdue."  The bill would treat marijuana much like alcohol or tobacco, allowing it to be taxed and regulated. States could still outlaw its use. And those under the age of 21 couldn't purchase it. It would remain illegal to sell significant quantities without proper licensing and authorization, much like bootlegging alcohol. It would also clear the path for additional cannabis medical research.  But besides clearing obstacles to recreational use, advocates say the bill would help the poor and those from communities of color who have disproportionately been arrested, charged and jailed for marijuana crimes.  The bill would expunge federal nonviolent convictions and allow for records of them to be sealed. Those currently serving nonviolent marijuana-related sentences could also seek a review hearing and receive an expungement.  "We have our precious resources being used to lock up ... Black and brown people for doing things that presidents, Congress people and senators have done," said Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, who is also a cosponsor of the bill, along with Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden.  A similar bill has passed the House. But the measure faces a virtually nonexistent path in a narrowly divided Senate, where 60 votes are needed to pass most legislation.  Schumer acknowledged that not all Democrats support the bill. That includes President Joe Biden, who has said he supports decriminalizing marijuana but believes the federal prohibition should remain.  "I've spoken in the past about the president's views on marijuana. Nothing has changed and there's no new endorsements of legislation today," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday.  Republicans and influential law enforcement groups are certain to oppose it, as well.  "I don't understand how Republicans who say they are for 'states rights' won't support what my colleagues are talking about," said Wyden. "What this bill does is we decriminalize at the federal level, but we don't require states to legalize."  Schumer and the other sponsors of the bill say their proposal is a "discussion draft" that's intended to get the conversation started.  Though 18 states have legalized recreational use and 37 allow for some sort of medical marijuana, the remaining federal prohibition has created headaches for the industry in states where it is legal, making it hard for businesses to get banking services and loans.  Those in the marijuana industry called Schumer's support a significant advance.  "It is a big ask and I'm a realist," said Joe Caltabiano, CEO of Choice Consolidation Corp. and the cofounder of Cresco Labs. "It will take a lot to get this bill through Congress."  Maritza Perez, of the Drug Policy Alliance, said Congress is finally catching up with where the general public has long been. Meanwhile, those who are convicted of marijuana-related offenses face life-altering consequences, making it hard to get a job or receive public benefits.  Earlier this month, American sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson was left off the U.S. team's Olympic roster following a positive test for marijuana, costing her a chance at running on the relay team in Tokyo, in addition to her spot in the 100-meter individual race.  "Today is a historic day in the sense that we have the Senate majority leader introducing a bill to regulate and legalize marijuana. That's huge," said Perez, who is a director in the office of national affairs for the organization. "For the public, marijuana has become culturally acceptable. But people forget that more than a half-million people are arrested for marijuana possession each year."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/senate-leader-lends-clout-to-marijuana-legalization-push/articleshow/84425669.cms||---

The directive bars the US-based network from issuing either prepaid, credit or debit cards to new customers under its network in India. The RBI said the order would not impact existing customers of Mastercard. Mastercard is the second-largest credit card issuer (after Visa) in India and the central bank’s tough stance could have implications on foreign relations. The RBI has been pushing all regulated entities to store data relating to Indian customers on Indian soil since April 2018. “Notwithstanding lapse of considerable time and adequate opportunities being given, the entity has been found to be non-compliant with the directions on storage of payment system data,” the RBI said in a statement. While it is banks and finance companies that issue cards, they partner either Mastercard, Visa or RuPay for network usage. Whenever a card is swiped, the processing takes place on the payment network cloud. Mastercard has been directed to advise all card-issuing banks and non-banks to conform to these directions. “Mastercard is fully committed to our legal and regulatory obligations in the markets we operate in. Since the issuance of the RBI directive requiring on-soil storage of domestic payment transaction data in 2018, we have provided consistent updates and reports regarding our activities and compliance with the required stipulations. While we are disappointed with the stance taken by the RBI in their communication dated July 14, we will continue to work with them to provide any additional details required to resolve their concerns,” the company said. In terms of the number of employees, India ranks second among all markets for Mastercard. The company has invested $1bn in India and has announced plans to invest $1bn more. “Building on our considerable and continued investments in India, we remain committed to working with our customers and partners in advancing on the government’s Digital India vision,” the statement added. Mastercard is the third US company to face an RBI ban after American Express and Diners Club, which faced similar restrictions in April. Amex has said that while it is not accepting fresh applications, it is committed to complying with all regulations. Banking sources said that Visa has complied with the data-localisation norms, which is why the payment network was not subject to any strictures. Compliance required the company to create storage capacity in India requiring investment in “hundreds of millions”, said sources. Mastercard has repeatedly sought more time. Sources said that the payment network might have been waiting for personal data protection laws to be in place. Suresh Ganapathy, research analyst, Macquarie Capital, said: “The key concern is that credit cards, which are a profitable product for banks, could get impacted as banks now will have to transition to a Visa or a RuPay platform which will take time. Our conversations with bankers reveal that it could take two months for the new payment platform (say Visa) to issue new plastics and take up the additional capacity vacated by Mastercard.” The payment network has been arguing for allowing data mirroring as the transaction information was required to ascertain fraud trends. The company’s argument was that if Indian transaction data is disconnected from the world, the Indian market will not have the advantage of global trends. The RBI’s directive appears to have come as a surprise for Mastercard. As recently as July 8, Mastercard announced the launch of a ‘One Mumbai Metro Card’ in partnership with Axis Bank and Mumbai Metro. Others in the industry were also shocked as MasterCard had agreed to comply. The local storage norms do not apply to those payments where one leg of the transaction is offshore. RBI norms also allow data to be sent abroad for processing but the same must be deleted from overseas servers by end of the day. The challenge here is that wherever data is being sent overseas, the RBI wants an audit report certifying that data is being deleted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mastercard-cant-issue-new-cards-from-july-22-rbi/articleshow/84425817.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||India||Supreme Court seeks AG help to study PIL against sedition law||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court Wednesday sought Attorney General K K Venugopal’s presence for examining merits of a PIL filed by a retired Major General requesting a fresh examination of the constitutionality of the sedition provision under Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code, unhindered by a five-decade-old SC judgment upholding the section. Maj Gen (Retd) S G Vombatkere said a statute criminalising expression based on unconstitutionally vague definitions of “disaffection towards government” was an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right to free expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) and causes constitutionally impermissible “chilling effect” on speech. Times ViewThe PIL is noteworthy because dissent is an intrinsic part of democracy. Recently, an SC judge too had observed that tough laws cannot be used as means to curb dissent. The SC is rightly taking a close look at the section’s validity and examining whether it needs to be tweaked to minimise the potential for its misuse.A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices A S Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy asked Vombatkere’s counsel P B Suresh to give a copy of the PIL to the AG and posted the matter for fresh hearing on Thursday. The petitioner said the five-judge Constitution bench of the SC's 1962 judgment in the Kedar Nath case upholding the validity of sedition provision was rendered in an era when the apex court was conservative in interpreting the ambit of fundamental rights. He said the fundamental rights, especially the right to free speech and right to life, are given a wide meaning in many subsequent landmark judgments. Vombatkere, who supported agitation by farm unions against agricultural laws, said the right to free speech and expression got wings with the advent of social media allowing citizens to freely express opinion for and against the government. The SC never had an opportunity, in the era of transparency and openness, to examine the constitutional validity of Section 124A of IPC, which is now often used to silence dissent, he said. Vombatkere had also unsuccessfully challenged the validity of Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 being passed as a Money Bill by Parliament. "The SC in Kedar Nath case upheld the validity of the impugned provision and ruled that the very existence of the state will be in jeopardy if the government established by law is subverted. The impugned provision, however, was read down to mean that only those expressions that either intend to or have the tendency of causing violence are punishable. Despite the reading down, the continued employment of the charge of sedition to silence dissent continued undeterred and has been taken judicial notice of. This prompted the SC to reiterate the Kedar Nath law in 2016 in Common Cause case, directing all authorities to scrupulously follow the Kedarnath dictum." "The SC has, however, not had a chance to reopen the issue of constitutionality of the impugned provision since 1962. The march of the times and the development of the law has to be taken into account in dealing with such a question now, unconstrained by the Kedar Nath ruling,” he said adding that the Kedar Nath reasoning has to be understood in the context of an era when “the reading of fundamental rights was rather restrictive". In 1962, a five-judge SC bench had upheld the constitutional validity of Section 124A but caveated it by saying, "The explanations appended to the main body of the section make it clear that criticism of public measures or comment on government action, however strongly worded, would be within reasonable limits and would be consistent with the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression." "It is only when the words, written or spoken, etc. which have the pernicious tendency or intention of creating public disorder or disturbance of law and order that the law steps in to prevent such activities in the interest of public order. When so construed, the section, in our opinion, strikes the correct balance between individual fundamental rights and the interest of public order," the SC had said. Two more petitions by Kishorechandra Wangkhemcha from Manipur and Kanhaiya Lal Shukla from Chhattisgarh, both of whom have been booked under Section 124A for allegedly objectionable social media posts, have also challenged the validity of the provision and a three-judge bench of SC has already entertained it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-seeks-ag-help-to-study-pil-against-sedition-law/articleshow/84426123.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices A S Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy said, “What is evidential value of WhatsApp messages these days? Anything can be created and deleted on social media these days. We don’t attach any value to the WhatsApp messages.” The issue related to a December 2, 2016 Concession Agreement between South Delhi Municipal Corporation and a consortium comprising A2Z Infraservices and another entity for collection and transportation of waste materials. On April 28, 2017, A2Z entered into another agreement with Quippo Infrastructure (now Viom Infra ventures) for carrying out a part of the contracted work and it was agreed that all monies received by A2Z would be deposited in an escrow account from which payments would be made to parties. On May 28 last year, A2Z terminated the contract agreement and Quippo moved the Calcutta HC on September 14 for appointment of an arbitration panel on certain issues relating to the contract agreement with A2Z. The parties agreed for an arbitrator on January 14 this year. A single judge bench of the Calcutta HC was told by Quippo counsel about a WhatsApp message of March 19, 2020 in which A2Z purportedly admitted payment of Rs 8.18 crore due to Quippo. Quippo also showed an email of year 2018 in which A2Z had agreed to deposit all money received from SDMC in an escrow account. A2Z told HC that the WhatsApp message was forged and fabricated. But, the HC directed A2Z to “deposit all the money received by them in future from South Delhi Municipal Corporation in connection with the work covered by the Master Service Agreement in the escrow account subject to further direction in this behalf by the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral award that may be passed”. Appearing for A2Z before the SC on Wednesday, senior advocate Ranjit Kumar said though the agreement was terminated and the dispute stood referred to arbitration, it was incomprehensible why the HC ordered all receivables from SDMC be deposited in the escrow account. “I will not be able to pay workers engaged in the collection and transportation of solid waste management in Delhi. Why should the HC believe a WhatsApp message when we have disputed it as forged and fabricated.” For Quippo, senior advocate Ritin Rai said that the escrow account was created on the basis of an agreement for equitable distribution of the money between the parties. However, the SC bench led by CJI Ramana said that once the matter has been referred to arbitration, why should a party which terminated the agreement deposit the receivables in an escrow account? “Prima facie we are not satisfied with the HC direction for depositing the money in an escrow account. We are not considering the purported admission in WhatsApp message. If it is not late, then go before the arbitrator and parties would be bound by the arbitrators award,” the bench said. However, with Rai persisting on his stand, the bench issued notice and asked Rai's client to file a reply to the petition by A2Z.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/whatsapp-messages-have-no-evidential-value-supreme-court/articleshow/84426237.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||Business||Government restores DA for staff, raises it to 28%||NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday announced an increase in the dearness allowance for central government employees and dearness relief for pensioners to 28%, from the current 17%, lifting the 18-month suspension to cover inflation. The freeze that had been imposed in the wake of the Coronavirus outbreak was expected to help the Centre save Rs 38,000 crore -- a little more than the Rs 35,000 crore budgeted for the current fiscal year for vaccinating against Coronavirus. “The increase reflects the additional instalments arising on 1 January, 2020, 1 July, 2020 and 1 January, 2021. The rate of dearness allowance/dearness relief for the period 1 January, 2020 to 30 June 2021 shall remain at 17%,” an official statement said. The development that was being closely watched by central government employees, immediately saw them pulling out calculators to work out the impact on their salaries and allowances. A large section, however, was not pleased with the announcement. Some argued that “their contribution” in helping the Centre fight Covid-19 should be recognised by the government. Others said that those who retired during the last few months would have lost out on some leave encashment and pension-related benefits. Besides, many viewed the increase for the last six-month period to be inadequate, arguing that retail inflation had shot up and the price of auto fuel, edible oil and several pulses had soared to record levels. Government officials had justified the freeze on DA, arguing that central government employees and pensioners too needed to contribute during a health emergency, which had resulted in companies slashing salaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/government-restores-da-for-staff-raises-it-to-28/articleshow/84426395.cms||---

Hearing a plea filed by Uttar Pradesh government against the Allahabad HC which had passed a slew of directions on management of the pandemic in the state and passed adverse observations against the government, a bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari asked whether the HC should have entered the arena. The bench said the intention of the court could not be questioned and there was no doubt it wanted to improve the situation but the issue was whether interference was at all needed during the period of crisis which should be left to be handled by government and experts. The SC bench’s views come in the wake of the court and several high courts taking up issues like oxygen supply and vaccination. “Howsoever good (is the) intention and objective, when there is demarcation, then we have to respect the demarcation. We have to be very careful..,” the bench said, referring that the judiciary should not interfere in the domain of the executive as per the principles of separation of power. “Everybody needs to be conscious about what is to be done by whom. How far the constitutional court goes into such matter,” it said. The difference of opinion among different SC benches on various issues, including the pandemic, showed up with Justice Chandrachud on Monday saying the state is empowered to take policy decisions on the pandemic but if this infringes on the constitutional rights of the people, the validity of the policy is amenable to judicial review. However, since the Supreme Court sits in smaller and co-equal benches, it gives way to contestations about the interpretation of same socio-economic rights and the level of deference that is shown to the executive on issues of policy, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/courts-shouldnt-step-into-executives-domain-supreme-court/articleshow/84426606.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

On Wednesday, foreign minister S Jaishankar told his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi that troops should complete the disengagement at the LAC “at the earliest” and that the unsettled situation has cast a negative light on the entire bilateral relationship. After an hour-long meeting between Jaishankar and Wang Yi in Dushanbe on the sidelines of an SCO meeting on Afghanistan, the Indian minister tweeted, “Highlighted that unilateral change of status quo is not acceptable. Full restoration and maintenance of peace and tranquility in border areas is essential for development of our ties.” The reiteration of the Indian position, despite the Chinese reluctance to complete disengagement in Ladakh, was reaffirmed by an official statement by the MEA which said, “there was also an understanding that both sides will continue to ensure stability on the ground and neither side will take any unilateral action that could increase tension.” The situation remains tense in several areas in eastern Ladakh, particularly Gogra-Hot Springs. There is also the “legacy” issue of the Depsang plains where Indian troops have been prevented from patrolling. After an agreement on disengagement at Pangong Tso, there has been no further progress. The last round of military commanders’ talks on June 25 too did not break the deadlock. It was believed then that the issue would have to be escalated to the political level, which resulted in Wednesday’s meeting. In his meeting, Jaishankar said the border situation was “visibly impacting the relationship in a negative manner.” China’s attempts to “change the status quo” in the border areas “disregarded commitments... agreements have inevitably affected ties.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/unilateral-status-quo-change-on-lac-not-acceptable-india/articleshow/84426710.cms||---

As a result, Congress, he said, had now geared up to contest the 2024 general and assembly elections which, he reiterated, the party would fight on its own. A week ago, Pawar had declined to comment on Patole’s “going solo” remarks, saying he would respond “only to statements made by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.” Incidentally, Patole is scheduled to address a party workers’ rally at Baramati, Pawar’s hometown, on July 29. “Keeping in mind the experience of 2014, we’ve geared up for the 2024 Lok Sabha and assembly elections, which we will contest on our own. As head of the party at the state level, my job is to expand the party at all levels and ensure that we reach out to every individual. I have been given the task of attacking BJP. So far as the MVA government is concerned, it is firmly in the saddle and routine issues are sorted out by coordination committee,” he told TOI. Patole said in view of NCP’s unilateral decision to terminate the alliance earlier, Congress had to pay a heavy price as it wasn’t prepared to contest the 2014 polls independently. He said in view of the changing political situation and the fact that Congress had suffered heavily in past, its strategy for the 2024 general polls was being finalised. On his Baramati rally, Patole saidthat he was not challenging Pawar but was going on demands of the party workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ncp-betrayed-us-in-2014-congress-will-go-solo-in-2024-nana-patole/articleshow/84426875.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar

The home secretary has asked states to issue strict directions to the local authorities to regulate crowded places, take action against violators as per law and ensure that concerned authorities and officials are held accountable in case of any laxity in enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour. The MHA expressed special concern over crowds violating norms in hill stations and market places. In his letter, home secretary Ajay Bhalla said while with the decline in number of active case, states and UTs have started ‘unlocking’ in a gradual manner, the process should be carefully calibrated. He also cited the June 29 order by the MHA for implementation of targeted and prompt actions for Covid-19 management. “However, blatant violations of Covid norms have been observed in several parts of country, especially in public transport and at hill stations. Massive crowds are also thronging the market places, violating norms of social distancing. Consequently increase in R factor (reproduction number) in some of the states is a matter of concern,” he said. The letter emphasised that the second wave of Covid is not yet over. The MHA said that states must be aware any increase in R factor above 1.0 is an indicator of the spread of Covid-19. “Therefore, it is important that the authorities concerned shall be responsible for ensuring Covid appropriate behaviour in all crowded places, such markets, restaurants, bus stations, railway platforms, public parks, banquet and marriage halls, sports complexes and all areas identified as hotspots for transmission of the virus,” Bhalla said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/check-blatant-violation-of-covid-norms-mha-to-states/articleshow/84426926.cms||---

It is high time the country thought of controlling population growth so that future generations get better education, healthcare and other facilities,” Sharma said. “I’ve been championing this cause on many platforms.” The draft policy states that those who have more than two children will cease to be eligible for government jobs and certain other facilities. Congress and other opposition parties have attacked BJP for provisions that they claim targets minorities. Amid Sharma’s support to the population-control initiative, fellow minister and state Congress chief Govind Singh Dotasra termed the UP population bill a “diversionary tactic”. He said there were more pressing issues that required the government’s attention. Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas alleged that when former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi coined the slogan of “Hum do, humare do” in the 70s, RSS had opposed it. “They made it a poll issue and the policy wasn’t allowed to be implemented. They won an election playing on the issue.” He said had the policy been implemented then, the population of the country would not have swelled to 1.3 billion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hum-do-humare-ek-health-minister-of-congress-led-rajasthan-backs-population-control/articleshow/84427010.cms||Joychen Joseph

While the retail portion of the offer was subscribed 2.7 times, the institutional part was nearly subscribed fully, the high networth (non-institutional) part 13% and the part reserved for employees 18%, data on BSE showed. Overall the total IPO was subscribed 1.05 times. The issue, being offered at a price of Rs 72-76 per share, will close on Friday. On Tuesday, Zomato had offered 55.2 crore shares to a group of foreign and domestic investors for about Rs 4,200-crore. Data relating to those who applied on Day 1 in the Zomato IPO was pointing to some shift in investor profile, PayTM Money, one of the tech-driven broking houses, said. Data analysed by the broking house showed that more than one in five investors in the IPO were first timers. Other than top cities like Delhi, Bengaluru, and Mumbai, first time participation was seen from smaller towns like Kodinar in Gujarat, Tuensang in Nagaland and Rangapara in Assam. It also showed that 60% of the IPO investors on its platform were under the age of 30 years and 27% were under 25 years. Earlier, about 55% of the IPO investors were under the age of 30 years. The analysis also showed that average investment in Zomato IPO on Day 1 was 20% higher than the average investment in previous IPOs on PayTM Money platform. PayTM Money is the first broking house that allowed its investors to apply in the Zomato IPO ahead of the opening of the offer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/zomato-ipo-fully-sold-on-day-1-in-retail-rush/articleshow/84427031.cms||---

A statement issued by Marico said the equity stake will be acquired over a period of two years through primary infusion and secondary buyouts. The investment is in line with Marico’s strategy to accelerate its digital transformation journey through building scalable digital-first brands, either organically or inorganically, as well as to premiumise its play in personal care. The acquisition is a strong indicator that the demand in the ‘naturals’ space is only going strong and is here to stay. The growth trend in naturals, which started a few years ago with Patanjali launching a range of personal care products, prompted Hindustan Unilever to launch Ayush and acquire Indulekha. Colgate-Palmolive (India) too entered the space with ‘Vedshakti’. What started as a trend in the mass segment, is now picking up in premium/luxury as well. Apcos Naturals is co-founded by CEO Arush Chopra and brand director Megha Sabhlok. The range of products, based on their pricing, fall in the super-premium or luxury category. While the brand garners majority of its business through its own D2C website, it is also available on online marketplaces (Amazon, Flipkart and Nykaa) and its exclusive offline stores in select cities. Marico’s MD & CEO Saugata Gupta said, “Just Herbs presents an exciting and differentiated opportunity to have a meaningful play in Ayurveda-led beauty categories. The brand has built a healthy consumer franchise on the back of the quality and efficacy of its offerings. The digital presence it has built in a short span of time is impressive and we strongly believe in its potential to reach critical mass over the next couple of years. This investment is another step towards our aspiration to build a portfolio of at least three Rs 100-crore-plus digital brands within the next three years.” Chopra said, “We believe that Marico’s evolved capabilities, processes and systems will complement our ambition to scale up online as well as offline. We are very positive about the future prospects of this partnership and look forward to a fruitful journey with the team.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/marico-buys-60-in-apcos-parent-co-of-just-herbs/articleshow/84423480.cms||---

OPDs, where patients are provided medical consultations and other allied services, have started functioning like in normal days, but with a lot of safety measures. The elective surgeries have also been picking up as people muster courage to reach the hospitals. From zero patient due to closure of OPD at the AIIMS-Patna, the number of non-Covid patients increased up to 2,000, said Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer for Covid-19 at AIIMS-P. Initially, when the OPD services resumed after the second wave of pandemic, less than 200 patients visited the hospitals. “Now the registration in the OPD has increased to 2,000. On an average, 24 elective surgeries are being performed per day as the 12 operation theatres (OTs) are operational now. Since the second wave has slowed down, patients who were avoiding a hospital visit, are now turning up for treatment and check-ups,” he said. The number of Covid patients at AIIMS-P has declined to 12. Similarly, at Nalanda Medical College and Hospital, the number of admissions at OPD has increased to 1200 per day from zero during the Covid surge when the hospital was made a dedicated health facility for Covid patients. PMCH superintendent Dr IS Thakur said the footfall of patients at the OPDs has increased by 75% in the past few weeks. “The emergencies, OPDs and OTs are mostly full, like it used to be before the pandemic. People are also coming with post-Covid complications,” he told this newspaper. IGIMS has also lifted the restriction on the number of patients registering for the OPDs. Its medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said the total number of patients in the different OPDs has increased from 50 to 100 per day from Wednesday. “The registration for the OPDs take place only through online medium, which is being done a day in advance,” he said. Paras HMRI regional director (east) Dr Talat Halim said on an average 500-600 patients are visiting the OPDs per day. “As per the record, around 12,000 patients are getting themselves registered at the OPDs per month, which was below 7,000 during the second wave of pandemic. However, before the pandemic, it was around 16,000 per month,” he said, adding that since the Covid situation has improved, they are also witnessing rise in elective surgeries and emergency services. The hospital has been conducting 450 elective surgeries per month, which went down to 120 during the surge in Covid-19 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hospitals-witness-rise-in-non-covid-patients-at-opds/articleshow/84419339.cms||Faryal Rumi

The court said the ACB failed to provide suitable grounds for cancellation of bail. ACB counsel Gayatri Reddy told the court that Narendra Kumar and Gopalakrishnan have violated bail conditions. She said one of the conditions for granting bail was not to influence witnesses in any manner and not leave Vijayawada without prior permission. However, several witnesses participated in a meeting conducted by Narendra Kumar in Vijayawada, she said, adding that he has not been cooperating with investigation officers even after giving notices. Senior counsel B Adinarayana Rao, arguing for Narendra Kumar, said a meeting of the board of directors was conducted to discuss increasing milk prices. There was no such condition that Narendra Kumar should not hold board of directors meeting in his capacity as chairman. He further stated that the police booked a case against his client for violating Covid-19 norms by holding the meeting, which shows that it was politically motivated. After hearing both sides, Justice K Lalitha said there is no evidence to substantiate that Narendra Kumar violated bail conditions and dismissed the petitions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-dismisses-acbs-plea-to-cancel-bail-of-sangam-dairy-chairman-md/articleshow/84419917.cms||---

Announcing the statewide protests, leader of opposition in the state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, said the RJD workers and leaders will stage protests at all the block headquarters on July 18 and and at all the district headquarters of Bihar on July 19. Tejashwi said his partymen will raise the voice of common people and take up their issue in and outside the state legislative assembly. “Those who had promised ‘achhe din’, have brought us the worst days. While the crude oil price has been reduced in the international market, in India the fuel prices have been increased, leading to the increase in the prices of other commodities,” he said. Tejashwi said life has becoming unbearable for common people, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic which made many unemployed and increased medical expenses. He said a letter will also be sent to other alliance partners to join the RJD protests. The state Congress is already protesting against the price rise in different pockets of Bihar. Earlier in the day, Tejashwi wrote a letter to Bihar Vidhan Sabha Speaker reminding him of the incident which occurred on March 23 in which a few legislators were thrashed. “All the MLAs are afraid of raising the question in the House after that incident. I have asked the respected Speaker to let us know the result of the investigation, if he had done any. That was the black day which will never be forgotten,” Tejashwi told the media. He said all the Grand Alliance leaders will jointly discuss this issue and decide their stand on it in the upcoming monsoon session from July 26. “Be it in the assembly or on the road, anyone who asks the question of public interest is being thrashed,” Tejashwi said, training guns at chief minister Nitish Kumar. When asked about his stand on the Yogi model of population control bill, Tejasshwi said he will speak when the issue comes to Bihar. “I will not talk in the air,” he added. Tejashwi also lashed out at the central government for not giving reservation benefit to the candidates belonging to OBC category in the NEET.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-to-protest-against-price-rise-on-july-18-19/articleshow/84419269.cms||Sheezan Nezami

There will be nothing more unfortunate if we lose this place to miscreants and history-sheeters,” said a morning walker. A majority of morning walkers and sportsmen generally walk up to the Maidan as parking is prohibited in and around the area. “Maidan becomes extremely busy with activities even before the break of dawn. People jog, play football, cricket and even rugby. Some sit in the corners to read holy scripture. By 6am, it becomes a wonderful cultural melting pot, where you will find people from every walk of life, speaking many dialects,” said Gurdeep Singh, a Maidan enthusiast and morning walker. The Maidan area has had a separate police station, the only one with no civilian residence in its jurisdiction, formed in early 2000 to look after the law-and-order situation in and around it. In fact, after the formation of the police station, the law-and-order situation here has dramatically improved. Earlier, Maidan used to witness the dumping of bodies after murders and a couple of rape cases were also repo-rted from the area in late 90s, said a retired police officer. “We never felt any insecurity to walk up to Maidan even in the darkness of the early hours of the day. The morning walk on the greens of Maidan leave me refreshed for the rest of the day. Now I feel really frightened. But I have great faith in Kolkata Police, which manages to maintain law and order in the city in the most difficult times,” said Arup Ghosh Dastidar from Taltala, who comes to walk at Maidan every morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/panic-grips-city-morning-walkers-over-green-zone-law-and-order/articleshow/84421744.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The case relates to trading in shares of Aptech in which Jhunjhunwala is the promoter with about 48.5% holding. Sebi on Wednesday said that the Jhunjhunwala couple, along with eight others including Ramesh S Damani and Utpal Seth, have agreed to settle the charges through the regulator’s settlement mechanism. Under this process, the people against whom the charges are framed by Sebi agree to pay a monetary penalty without accepting or denying the charges. According to Sebi orders against these 10 entities, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala has already paid about Rs 9.5 crore as settlement amount, nearly Rs 5.9 crore as disgorgement charges and another Rs 3.1 crore as interest on the same. Other nine people have also paid all the three charges to settle their respective charges. The case relates to trading in shares of Aptech, a computer education company, in 2016. Sebi, in its show-cause notice, had alleged that on September 7, 2016, after the market hours, Aptech announced that the company was foraying into the preschool segment. The information was considered as unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) and the relevant period was between March 14 and September 7 of 2016. Sebi had alleged that Utpal Seth and Rakesh Jhunjhunwala were in possession of the UPSI and communicated the same to other applicants. On the basis of the UPSI, the entities were alleged to have traded in Aptech shares during the relevant period. Accordingly, Sebi had initiated proceedings against the entities, subsequent to which the settlements with these entities were reached.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/jhunjhunwala-others-settle-insider-trading-case/articleshow/84423506.cms||---

The CM inaugurated 75 projects worth Rs 40.72 crore and laid the foundation stone for another 48 projects worth Rs 39.54 crore in the Gorakhpur district. The projects launched by the CM on Wednesday will benefit areas like Gorakhpur Rural, Pipraich, Sahjanwa, Bansgaon, etc. Focussing on his government’s priority of development, the CM said that in the tourism sector, development did not mean just roads but also old temples. “Development is an important component that drives economic growth, improves infrastructure, and raises the living standards of the people. It will help in making India self-reliant,” he said. He said that it was important to use funds for the right projects and that the government was leaving no stone unturned to ensure development of every town and village in the state. The CM further stressed on the need to complete projects on time as delays would invariably lead to an increase in cost which was a waste of public funds. “Even as the rest of the world was struggling with the Covid-19 pandemic, work continued on all projects in Gorakhpur because of which we are able to launch many of them today. The government ensured that while it saved lives during the pandemic, it also did not allow livelihoods to be affected,” he said. The CM thanked the monitoring committees for their work, and said that the government had recognised their hard work in ensuring that people in rural UP were safe from the Covid-19 infection. Encouraging people to get vaccinated, he said that the pandemic had taken the lives of many people and one could not afford to take the pandemic lightly. Till the virus is around, he said, strict Covid protocols should be followed. The CM also spoke about two new schemes introduced by his government for the welfare of children orphaned by the pandemic and women who had been widowed due to the virus. He said that the government would be giving Rs 4,000 a month to children who had lost both parents to the pandemic and would take care of their education and living till they became independent. “Our Government is also working towards the welfare of women who lost their husbands due to Covid-19. Camps will be set up to enlist such women and provide them with pensions. They will also be employed based on their skills so that they can become self-reliant,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/pm-will-inaugurate-aiims-fertiliser-factory-in-gorakhpur/articleshow/84420769.cms||---

The gang leader is a software engineer with a degree from Pune University expert in mobile hacking. Police raided the gang’s call centre and recovered several Android phones, computer hard disks, ATM cards, etc. ,and are now trying to zero-in on the other members of the gang in other cities. “The team of city Crime Branch arrested four international cyber fraudsters after raiding the call centre operational for the past one year in Kakadeo area. The fraudsters were cheating US people in dollars by hacking their mobile phones through the call centre. The team has arrested master-mind Munendra Sharma, a software engineer from Pune University, and a resident of Noida, Sanjeev, a resident of Firozabad, Zikrulla, a native of Pratapgarh, and Suraj Suman, a resident of Bihar,” said police commissioner Asim Kumar Arun. Police have recovered 27 hard disks, six ATM cards of different banks, passport, Aadhar card, driving licence, five Android phones, American Express Bank debit card, two PAN cards, Hotel Taj membership card from their possession, said official. “None could have slightest inkling of the fraudsters operating a Call Centre in the Kakadeo area of the city and duping American citizens. They used to trap people in a completely different way from the International Call Centre. As soon as American citizen clicks on blinking ads on any site, such as reduce obesity, reduce belly, strengthen knees, increase length or stop hair fall, then a malware, a kind of virus, is uploaded to his/her mobile. Once the malware is uploaded to the system, popup messages on the mobile start appearing on the screen again and again, causing a lot of inconvenience to the mobile user. He/she is not able to do any operation on mobile properly. The same happened with the people sitting in America who were victims of fraud,” said the official further. To avoid the virus, the victim used to get caught in the trap of the thugs gang as soon as he/she called the helpline number that came with the popup message. As soon as the trapped person makes a call on the helpline number, the gang used to ask for a charge in dollars to clean the virus and give service. The user used to transfer money to the specified account, after which he was asked to download some app for technical support. Mobile was hacked as soon as the user downloaded the app. The plan was sold by the call centre in the name of removing the malware and providing service, which was for six months and one year. In case no service was given, they promised to refund the full amount. The game of cheating used to start from here, now when a user asked for the money given back by saying that the service was not good, he used to become a victim of fraud. Since the caller’s mobile was already hacked, due to which the gangsters used to change the coding by going to the HTML of the account details on remote access. By changing the coding of the account, the fraudsters used to send fake messages of online transactions to the user’s phone. In this message, the amount was shown to be many times more than the amount to be refunded, whereas in reality no amount was transferred. At the same time, the user felt that he had been refunded more, police said. “Now, by calling the user and pretending that more money has been transferred to his/her account, the user deducts the service charge and transfers the remaining amount again to the account specified by the call centre, which was in dollars. In this way, the gang has defrauded 12,000 people in the US of nine lakh dollars in the last one year,” police added. According to police officers, the number of people who have been cheated may be more, at present, the police have got the details from the bank statement of the transaction of nine lakh dollars.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/4-cyber-fraudsters-held-for-duping-12000-us-citizens/articleshow/84420869.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

They were served with soft drinks, snacks and meals," informed a group of villagers. Prior to that the bride and groom reached the temple of Brahma Dev Baba in the village. Later, the couple exchanged 'jaimala' amidst loud cheers and flower showering from their son and other guests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/live-in-couple-of-tie-nuptial-knot-after-20-years/articleshow/84420885.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

These artifacts have been handed over to the district administration. Under the guidance of GI expert Rajni Kant of Human Welfare Association (HWA), a team of wooden craft artisans, including national merit awardee Rameshwar Singh and state awardee Raj Kumar have prepared a wooden model of Rudraksha. It took a week’s time to finish the model, said the artisans. A stole prepared by local artisans for the PM on ThursdayOther artisans too have something to offer. Master craftsman Mumtaz Ali of Lallapura locality has prepared a unique ‘angavastram’ (stole) studded with rudraksha beads amid beautiful zardozi work. Similarly, a master weaver Bachchelal Maurya of Chhahi village has also prepared a stole with calligraphic inscription displaying the shloka of Shri Bhagwat Gita — ‘Yada Yada Hi Dharmasya Glanirbhavati Bharat…….’. Kant said that these artifacts have been handed over to the district administration. “We hope that the Rudraksha VCC would play a significant role in promoting art and crafts of this region globally,” he said. Earlier, local artisans had also prepared many artifacts of intricate brocade, gulabi meenakari (pink enamelling), wood carving and soft stone craft undercut works during the visit of then Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe with Modi in December 2015. ‘Rudraksha’, a powerful spiritual symbol of Lord Shiva, in its new avatar has come up as Varanasi International Cooperation and Convention Centre (VCC), an architectural symbol of Indo-Japan friendship in the millennia old city.

The first of its kind ‘Sanskritik Forest’ of Uttar Pradesh will be created at Sadaphaldeo Ashram on the Jhunsi side of Sangam (Chatnag). The details for developing this forest has been prepared and at the same time, talks are going on with three institutions to develop this forest in Chatnag. The initiative aims at restoring the eco-system with the effort of Forest Research Centre for Eco-Rehabilitation (FRCER), Prayagraj wherein forestation and taking care of saplings would go hand in hand with the religious belief of the common man. The first Sanskritik forest will be developed in the premises of Sadafaldeo Ashram in two hectares i.e. eight bighas of land. In this, over 100 saplings, of the trees mentioned in the religious texts, would be planted. These trees would be carefully segregated as they are related to the main deities of Sanatan Dharma in one way or the other. Kumud Dubey, senior scientist at FRCER said, “There are more than 100 trees including Ashok, Kadam, Banyan, Pipal, which have mythological importance. These trees are related to some deity in some era or the other and people should know and recognise these trees for, which this effort is being made.” She also added that the religious and traditional importance of the tree would be mentioned in the sapling of each tree that will be planted in the ‘Sanskritik forest’. “The idea is to have number of ‘Vatika’ within the forest, each named after the sect or deity that the sect follows like ‘Sankar Vatika’, Buddh Vatika, Jain Vatika etc. And each of these Vatika’s would have trees related to the deity concerned”, said Dubey. FRCER also plans to plant number of saplings in the Chandrashekar Azad park of the city. Saplings of the trees that have medicinal properties will be planted in the park on behalf of center. “More than 100 saplings will be planted within a week and the same would relieve people from various ailments when they grow up”, said Dubey. Along with saplings of trees, the centre also plans to plant herbs and plants, which have medicinal importance, especially in terms of fighting coronavirus. On similar lines, recently, the volunteers of Ganga Samagra, an organisation associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) have decided to develop areas, within the five kilometres of the radius of river Ganga, as forest land. For the purpose, villagers would be made aware to protect the environment and intensive plantation drive would be carried out, planting saplings in the form of ‘Panchkol’ i.e. five trees including Peepal, Pakkad, Banyan, Bel and Babul. The drive would be carried out in rural areas of both trans-Ganga and trans Yamuna areas of the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/sanskritik-forest-to-be-developed-at-chatnag/articleshow/84419481.cms||---

This sensational revelation has come out in three cases reported recently from the three districts coming under Jhansi range--Jalaun and Lalitpur and Jhansi. SP (City) Vivek Tripathi, who is also its nodal head, said that a female nurse of the city recently approached the police station with a complaint that someone had fraudulently taken out Rs 7.55 lakh from her account. “During investigation it was found hat it was her own nephew who had committed the fraud. As he was addicted to one such game, he bought a virtual 5G mobile phone and a number of arms and ammunition for the game. The stunned nurse later took back her complaint”, the SP said. A Lalitpur-based contractor in his report filed at the cyber cell alleged that Rs 1.5 lakh were mysteriously missing from his account. After investigation by cyber wing, it was found that his own son, who addicted to online games, was involved in it. He too had bought a virtual 5G mobile phone and other equipment. In another case reported from Jalaun district, a boy had bought mobile phone and other equipment worth Rs 2 lakh. The matter came out after after his father approached the cyber police station. In all the three cases, the victims withdrew their complaints after knowing that their own kin had been involved by making online payment through portals the details of which were overlooked by the elders. Talking to TOI, DIG Jhansi range Jogendra Kumar said since the transactions had been legal, therefore, no action could be taken against the seller company. “I appeal to parents that they should be vigilant regarding their online transactions and must never share the details even with their kids”. They should keep a tab on the online surfing of their children while engaged in online studies which are essential but they should time to time scrutinize their other online activities, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/kids-addicted-to-online-games-dupe-parents-buy-game-products-over-rs-11-lakh/articleshow/84420911.cms||---

Her family members and locals came to know about the incident only after some passersby saw her body floating in the drainage. The area falls under ward number 64 of Azimabad circle of Patna Municipal Corporation. Surendra Ram, the city manager of Azimabad circle of the corporation, said the drainage cover was broken after a tractor ran over it. “It is from this broken portion that the girl fell into the drainage. I came to know about the incident late,” he said. Chowk police station SHO Gaurishankar Gupta said the deceased was identified as Roshni. He said she was playing in front of her residence and fell into the drainage. “The concrete cover was missing and there was a gap in which the girl might have slipped,” he said. The SHO said her father Mohammad Zafar has not registered any case as the family didn’t wanted any postmortem. “They submitted a written application for that. The ward member has also endorsed it. We made the father talk to the Sadar circle officer too, that if no police case is registered and postmortem is not conducted, then the administration will not be in a position to pay any ex gratia amount to the family,” he said. The SHO said the girl’s family, however, remained adamant on not registering any case. “Police have made a station diary entry of the incident,” he added. In November 2018, 10-year-old Deepak Kumar had fallen into open drainage near a sump house in Punaichak in the state capital. The body was not found despite several days of search operations by the NRDF and SDRF teams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/4-year-old-girl-falls-into-drainage-dies/articleshow/84419241.cms||---

Municipal commissioner Himanshu Sharma said a Haryana-based private firm has been selected to execute the work to be awarded in the next 2-3 days. The civic body expects the technology-driven smart parking system to be ready by August-end. Himanshu said the project was being taken up under the public-private partnership (PPP) mode to address the conventional parking problem in Patna while providing organised parking area. “The smart parking facilities will be equipped with boom barriers with RFID (radio frequency identification) sensors to control the entry and exit of vehicles, smart ticketing system, closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras to record vehicle model and number and automated-pay stations,” he said. The parking lots will be laced with LED direction signage for better guidance and other passenger facilities like portable cabin, drinking water and toilets. Charging facility for e-vehicles will also be available, but to only those vehicles which are parked there. The PMC commissioner told this newspaper on Wednesday that smart parking system would also include a special mobile application to help riders check online the availability of parking slots. “With the help of this app, residents will get the real-time information about the parking lots, available space, parking guidance and make pre-bookings for the same to reserve their parking slot in advance. There would also be an option to make online payments as well, apart from app smart card and automated-pay stations to make it convenient for people to park their vehicles while they are visiting market places or other areas,” Himanshu said. According to the civic body officials, the right information about the parking lots will save residents from touts, who collect parking charge from people in the name of PMC. The smart parking system will come up at Exhibition road, Boring Canal road (from Hartali Mor to Rajapur Pul), near Mithapur bus stand, Patna Market, in front of Eco Park, Transport Nagar, near Patna Women’s College, Sahdev Mahto Marg, near Dinkar roundabout, in front of Hanuman Mandir, near Kali Mandir, Maharaja Complex, Maurya Lok Complex, three spots at Kadamkuan and Rajendra ROB among other places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pmc-to-develop-38-smart-parking-lots-by-august/articleshow/84419537.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Ahmedabad||Scientists find green option to plastic||Rajkot: Scientists have discovered an environment friendly option to plastic that’s used in packaging of food, cosmetics and other products. The bio-polymer developed by scientists at the Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (CIFT) was made from seaweed, which already has scientifically proven uses as nutrition-packed human food and industrial applications. In Rajkot alone, which has emerged as a hub of farsan (fried snacks) industry, nearly 40 tonnes of plastic waste is generated daily and the majority is that of namkeen wrappers. After four years of research, scientists at Veraval-based Central Institute of fisheries technology (CIFT) have developed a biodegradable plastic film extracted from seaweed. This film, they say, will be a game changer as a substitute for plastic used in food packaging. Veraval CIFT was given the project to find seaweed extract that could be a cheaper and biodegradable option for plastic. CIFT is set to handover the technology to industries for commercial production. “Biopolymers provide an excellent alternative to petroleum-derived polymers as they are environmentally friendly and naturally available. Not only it’s biodegradable but antimicrobial agents, anti-fungal compounds and nano silver particles that have anti-bacterial property can also be added do it, explained Ashish Kumar Jha, one of the scientists who worked on the project. Food companies like those making fried snacks use a multi-layer plastic which keeps the contents fresh. But once dumped, such plastic wreaks havoc with earth’s ecosystem as it takes hundreds of years to get destroyed. The key component for this was agar, which was extracted from seaweed. Agar is known for its excellent gel forming ability, bio-compatibility, thermo plasticity and therefore it was tested as an alternative to petroleum-based plastic packaging material. The silver nano particles reinforced with agar film has antibacterial function which can preserve the packaged food better with extended shelf life. Sources said there is a huge potential to make this bio-polymer along Gujarat’s long coastline. If scaled, it can generate employment too and create new business avenues for locals. This discovery was discussed at a webinar on ‘Secondary raw material: A new avenue in fisheries business’ organized by CIFT last week under Bharat ka Amrut Mahotsav, a central government initiative to commemorate 75 years of India’s independence. The importance of seaweed was also discussed along with other issues regarding fisheries industries in this programme attended by Junagadh MP Rajesh Chudasama and CIFT director CN Ravishankar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/scientists-find-green-option-to-plastic/articleshow/84422315.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

In their email to Modi, the two had raised several issues, including delay in payment of salaries. Modi is the Acharya or chancellor of the university while Kovind is Paridarsaka or visitor. Terming this act as “misconduct”, the university has asked the duo to explain why action should not be taken against them for breaching Visva-Bharati’s code of conduct. While the economics teacher had earlier been suspended by the institute, the teacher from the philosophy and religion department is currently taking onli-ne classes. The two sent the email on July 5 in the capacity of being president and secretary of the teachers’ organization — Visva-Bharati University Faculty Association (VBUFA) — raising the issue of non-payment of salary for June. Before issuing the letter on Tuesday, the university had sought a clarification from the two teachers. The response was not found “satisfactory” by the university authorities, an official said. The two have been asked to reply to the show-cause within three days. A VBUFA official said the two functionaries had written out of concern as the university authorities had not said anything about why the salary was delayed and when it would be paid. The delay has caused trouble for both present employees and pensioners. “The PM is our chancellor. He is a member of the V-B family. Is it a crime to inform him of our sufferings? To whom should we write?” he asked. In its centenary year, teachers and students at V-B have been in continuous conflict with the authorities led by VC Bidyut Chakrabarty. The latter has been accused of humiliating teachers, issuing a gag order on the university staff, slapping show-cause notices on employees, evicting students from hostels and clashing with locals over construction of a high wall around the campus. He has even engaged in a public spat with Nobel laureate and Santiniketan resident Amartya Sen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/v-b-show-causes-teachers-for-complaining-to-pm-prez/articleshow/84421826.cms||---

She will be preparing genetic data of people in the UAE and make tailor-made drugs for them against cancer and many other complex diseases. Ritambhara has been selected as a scientist by G-42 Health Centre in Dubai on an annual package of Rs 50 lakh. She has recently completed her doctoral research under the direction of Munish Kumar Pandey, assistant professor of the department of biochemistry at Allahabad University. According to her guide, Prof Munish Kumar Pandey, “Genome is becoming an effective platform for the treatment of severe ailments. An important link is the study of the human genome and the analysis of the relationship of those genes with the environment and gene-gene interactions.” Genomics is the study of all the genes (genomes) of an individual, including the relationship of those genes with each other and with the individual’s environmental exposures. He further explained that genomics and the entire genome sequencing are transforming healthcare and giving us the opportunity to understand complex diseases such as cancer, the medicine of the future and personalized medicine. Ritambhara, a native of Azamgarh, completed her PhD in 2020 and master’s in 2013 from the department of biochemistry, AU. She did her schooling and graduation from Varanasi. Her father owns a grocery shop in Varanasi. After completing her PhD, she joined Thyrocare in Mumbai as a scientific officer and after four months in the job, she moved to UAE and joined G-42 healthcare company in genome sequencing laboratory. A project manager in the UAE-based company, she is working on a project of the UAE government. The UAE government has entrusted her company with the work of surveying people based on their genomics and make them aware about the probability of getting infected with different types of cancer (based on genome sequencing and element of the environment). The project also involves suggesting people a set of medicines which does not have side effects. Ritambara will do the entire genome sequencing and prepare a genetic data of the people there. She will then work towards making useful medicines for genetic disorders, complex diseases, lifestyle-related disorders and cancer, informed her guide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/aus-phd-holder-bags-job-in-uae-to-find-cure-of-cancer/articleshow/84419460.cms||---

Regarding the release of 16,000 cusec of water by Haryana, Chadha said that the neighbouring state’s government was pressured into the action by the petition filed in the Supreme Court. He added that it takes around three days for the released water to reach all treatment plants in the city and an extra day or two to reach the households. The two big water channels of Delhi, namely CLC (Carrier Lined Channel) and DSB (Delhi Sub-Branch), have started receiving the Yamuna water in good proportions, said the DJB VC. “Wazirabad Barrage — from where the raw water from the rivers is transported through different channels — will soon see a spike in water levels. DJB engineers and officers are present at treatment plants in Delhi and Haryana to monitor the flow of water,” he said. More than 200 MGD of water treated at the Haiderpur plant, said Chadha, adding that the water levels in the city will soon be back to its usual, with plants going back to the optimum production of 945 MGD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/chadha-takes-stock-of-water-treatment-plant/articleshow/84456382.cms||---

The private vaccination centres have collectively gave the vaccine to a minuscule 4.01 lakh people ever since the ambit of the drive was widened to include private centres. Factors such as high pricing (compared to free vaccination at government centres), distance and limited private centres are some reasons for the lower coverage. On the other hand, the health department is leveraging healthcare centres, community centres, school buildings, village/ward secretariats and other government offices to increase the reach and scale of the drive. In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about two weeks ago, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy recommended that vaccine stocks not lifted by private hospitals should be procured and supplied for implementation of the vaccine drive through government channels. “It may be noted that 17,71,580 doses have been earmarked for private hospitals for July. Past experience and the demand for the vaccine at private hospitals in Andhra Pradesh clearly indicates that such huge quantities cannot be utilised by the private hospitals,” said the chief minister in the letter. Meanwhile, the state has exceeded 100% vaccination coverage among mothers with children under the age of five. As per the recommendations of the Covid-19 Paediatric Task Force Committee, the state has identified nearly 18.7 lakh mothers. But the coverage has crossed the 100% mark as the health department has administered jabs to 19.6 lakh mothers. The state has also recently extended the drive for pregnant women after the Union health ministry gave its nod. After foreign education/employment aspirants were added to the vaccination priority groups in Andhra Pradesh, about 27,000 people received their jabs. There are about 1.33 crore eligible vaccine beneficiaries aged 45 and above in Andhra Pradesh, apart from other priority groups such as healthcare workers, frontline staff, young mothers, foreign travellers and now pregnant women. Nearly 68 lakh people in the 45-plus age category have already got their first dose, while 26 lakh people are fully vaccinated. This translates to about 70% vaccination coverage among the 45-plus age group. Andhra Pradesh took permission from the Union health ministry to defer the vaccination for the young cohort till the time it concludes the ongoing drive for existing priority groups. The health department is now making preparations to vaccinate teaching staff in private and government educational institutions as institutions may reopen in August.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/pricey-doses-limited-centres-slowing-vax-rate-in-pvt-sector/articleshow/84419701.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Altogether 4,638 assistant professors in 52 subjects in 13 conventional universities of the state are to be appointed by the commission. On the first day, applicants for four posts of newly introduced subject of Angika (taught in Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University) would be interviewed at the BCUSC office. They have to report at 8am with their original documents and certificates and also the negative report of Covid-19 test of at least three days prior to the date of interview. BSUSC chairman Rajvardhan Azad said the interview will start with the subjects in which the number of applicants was relatively low. Only five subjects have been selected in the first phase, starting with Angika. The next interview would be held for the appointment of teachers in Puran on July 27. Besides Angika and Puran, interviews would be held in Prakrit, Nepali and Russian, he said. Azad said the interview dates are being fixed after the confirmation from the subject experts coming from different places, mostly from outside the state. Many outside experts are not willing to come owing to the Covid pandemic and, hence, sufficient gap is being given between two subjects. He said the applications received in as many as 25 subjects have been thoroughly screened and the candidates’ scores on academic backgrounds, research papers and teaching experience have been completed. The newly constituted commission had advertised all these vacant posts in the last week of September last year, with December 31 as the last date for submission of hard copies of applications. Last time, in 2014, the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) had advertised 3,364 posts of assistant professors and the appointments in different subjects continued till last year. This time, however, the appointments would be finalized in a much shorter period, Azad added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/interviews-for-4638-assistant-professor-posts-to-start-today/articleshow/84419815.cms||B K Mishra

Additional security forces have been deployed at Patna Junction to keep a close watch on the activities of miscreants as well as passengers. According to Danapur divisional railway manager (DRM) Sunil Kumar, railways has installed a vehicle scanner device in the circulating area of Patna Junction so that railway security personnel could easily trace the details of the vehicles parked there. “Besides, the number of CCTV cameras has been increased at both Mahavir Mandir and Karbigahiya ends of Patna Junction,” he said. “The RPF dog and bomb squads have been pressed into services at Patna junction during peak hours, especially in the evening. All long- distance premier special passenger trains, including Rajdhani Express, are being thoroughly searched to ensure foolproof safety to passengers during journey. Suspicious passengers are being frisked thoroughly by the security personnel,” he said. According to the DRM, railways has decided to install luggage scanners at Patna Junction, Rajendra Nagar Terminal and Patliputra Junction soon on the pattern of airports. “Railways has also issued an advisory to check parcel luggage reaching Patna Junction and other major stations from different places to avert any kind of parcel blast incident that had occurred at Darbhanga railway station on June 17,” he said. Keeping in view the gravity of the alert, railways has allowed RPF personnel to travel in mufti and keep an eye on the suspect passengers. Railways has already set up a security control at the Danapur control office to monitor threat perception to railways either on platforms or on running trains. “Each RPF post in the Danapur division has been put on alert to thwart any kind of attack on railway property by antinational people. A section of RPF personnel has been deployed on round-the-clock track patrolling at vulnerable places,” Sunil said. “Railways is also making announcements through public address system at Patna Junction, warning passengers not to touch any discarded items lying either inside the coaches or on railway platforms. In case anything suspicious is seen, passengers must inform the railway security personnel on duty,” the DRM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/security-beefed-up-at-patna-junction/articleshow/84419772.cms||Kumod Verma

The total number of deals and average deal sizes too are at an all-time high, say venture debt firms, as founders at late-stage startups find new and specialised use cases for venture debt with clearer business models. They are also clubbing equity rounds with venture debt to have better leverage on their books, and look for more variations in products besides term loan and considering options such as invoice financing, vendor financing etc., they added. Venture debt firm Alteria Capital said it funded more than 20 companies with total commitments of $90 million in H1 of 2021 in what could be the largest deployment in a six-month period. Some recent deals include investments in Infra.Market, Dealshare, Bharatpe, Rebel Foods, Mensa Brands. “One sector which has been in focus recently is the Thrasio model where we have partnered with Mensa Brands with a commitment of $10 million upfront,” Vinod Murali, managing partner, Alteria Capital, said. For the Thrasio model — where consumer brands are identified and acquired — the leverage construct needs to be in place for the model to be attractive, and while large equity cheques come in, debt too has emerged as an important component, he added. Ashish Sharma, CEO of InnoVen Capital said that with more venture capital available, more startups are getting into fundraising, and some of these entrepreneurs look to mix both equity and debt in their rounds. “More equity means better ability of the startup to service the debt and hence the equity boom has been positive for venture debt,” he added. Another venture debt player BlackSoil said it closed almost 4x the number of deals in H1-2021 compared to the same period last year, and despite the second wave, disbursements also reached an all-time high. “A healthy pipeline will ensure that we do close to Rs 300-Rs 350 crore in cumulative venture debt disbursements this calendar year,” Ankur Bansal, Co-founder and Director, BlackSoil, said. Ishpreet Singh Gandhi, founder and managing partner of venture debt firm Stride Ventures observes that startups are also raising debt for financing acquisitions amid high consolidation in certain sectors, besides conventional use cases of working capital financing and runway extension. “The venture debt market is getting aggressive. In the last one month alone, Stride Ventures has announced five to six deals,” he added. However, while venture debt makes up around 15% of the total venture capital market in the US, here in India it’s still at less than 5% share and has a long way to go.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/venture-debt-investment-sees-sharp-rise-in-h1-2021/articleshow/84421446.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Suresh, who addressed reporters along with Telugu & Sanskrit Academy chairperson N Lakshmi Parvathi, urged political parties not to make an unnecessary controversy out of this. “The government is giving top priority to both Telugu and Sanskrit, which is why GO 31 was issued renaming the academy. The decision was taken after a long discussion in the cabinet,” he said. Targeting N Chandrababu Naidu, Suresh said the TDP chief is trying to bluff the public with false statements. “Telugu Academy was established by then chief minister PV Narasimha Rao in 1969. But Naidu is claiming it was established by NT Rama Rao. He has no love for Telugu, but is using this issue to create controversy,” Suresh said.

The state government has sanctioned Rs 2 crore for the facility that is likely to become operational by October this year.  According to officials, the tendering process to get equipment for the laboratory will start this month. Currently, samples from NCR cities are sent to the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) in Delhi for genome sequencing. Uttar Pradesh has two such laboratories, one at King George’s Medical College and University (KGMU) and the other at the Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI), both in Lucknow. “The state government has cleared Rs 2 crore for setting up the lab at GIMS. It will be the first such facility in NCR and western UP. The state has two genome sequencing labs and CDRI, Lucknow, is a central government institute. The GIMS lab will have modern equipment. The two facilities in the state have old equipment and can handle a limited number of samples. We will start the tendering process for the GIMS lab in seven-10 days and we expect it to become operational by October this year,” said Brigadier (rtd) Dr RK Gupta, director, GIMS. Currently samples from GIMS, that caters to Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Hapur, and Saharanpur among other places are sent to IGIB in Delhi, which is an Institute of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). Usually, reports take about two months. Once the GIMS lab becomes operational, test results can be available within seven to 12 days. Dr Vivek Gupta, an associate professor in the pathology department and also the in-charge of molecular diagnostics and research laboratory, GIMS, said: “The lab at KGMU has a 16 capillary sequencer, which is an older model. We will have the next generation sequencing machine and around 100 samples can be tested at the lab at one go.” Genome sequencing helps identify what type of variant of the coronavirus a patient has. In June, GIMS had sent 199 samples from Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Hapur and Saharanpur and other places to IGIB in Delhi for genome sequencing. Of those 137 samples were found to have the Delta variant. While 59 of these samples were from Ghaziabad, 56 were from Hapur and 23 were from Gautam Budh Nagar district. Delta plus variant was not found in these samples, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/west-ups-1st-genome-sequencing-lab-to-open-at-gims/articleshow/84423811.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

Chief secretary Dr Adityanath Das, in a letter to union Jal Shakti ministry secretary Pankaj Kumar, explained that their decision to file the writ petition in the Apex court is not against the Centre but only to strengthen the hands of the Centre. He said that the Centre had not issued the notification even though it is seven years since the bifurcation of the state took place. “We appreciate the stand of the Centre taken at the IInd Apex Council meeting (held last December) that it will issue the notification despite objections of the state of Telangana,” said Das. He said that Andhra Pradesh would not have faced the distress and inconvenience had the Centre issued the notification by now. He said that the notification was stalled due to the whimsical action of the Telangana government. He said that it was disheartening to bring to the notice of the Centre that Telangana continues to violate the provisions of AP Reorganisation Act, 2014 with utter disregard to the operational protocols and directions of KRMB causing lot of distress to AP. He said that Telangana was depriving of their right full share of water in Krishna and wasting precious water. “So far, Telangana had utilized 62.59 tmc of water of which 7.1 tmc of surplus water was left into the ocean,” said Das.

The spot where the incident happenedThe two accused rode down Kidderpore Road on a scooterette and attempted to rob Vyas near the Kidderpore oval around 5.15am. When one of them asked Vyas to hand over his iPhone and valuables, the stoutly built Vyas, a regular jogger at Maidan, resisted and tried to pin him to the ground. The other accused took out a knife and stabbed him repeatedly. As Vyas fell, bleeding heavily from his head, hands and legs, the accused fled with the mobile towards Outram Road. Five minutes later, they robbed Rana and Shaw at gunpoint near Mohammedan Sporting Ground and fled with two cellphones and Rs 4,500. Morning walkers found Vyas lying in a pool of blood and informed cops. He was taken to SSKM Hospital. “Our son has been released, but he has received three dozen stitches,” said a family member. Cops arrested the accused within nine hours. “We arrested the two about 3pm,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. Cops registered the case on the basis of a complaint lodged by Rana and tagged Vyas’s incident to it.

---||Vadodara||Vadodara: 30gm gold chains looted from showroom in 2 secs!||VADODARA: It was one of the fastest robberies that ever took place in the city. A jeweller lost his gold ornaments worth lakhs of rupees in just two-and-half seconds! The incident occurred in Khodiyarnagar on Wednesday afternoon when Ronak Soni was sitting behind the counter in his jewellery shop. An unidentified man walked into Vallabh Darshan Jewellery shop wearing a hoodie and jeans at about 12.30 pm. Soni was busy showing some gold ornaments to a customer. The accused casually approached Soni and then threw chilli powder on him. Before Soni and an employee sitting next him could react, the accused picked up three gold chains weighing about 30 grams and ran out of the shop. CCTV footage of the shop has captured images of Soni but the face of the accused isn’t visible as he had covered his head with the cap on hoodie and he kept looking downwards to ensure that the cameras don’t record his face. “Soni ran towards a man who was waiting outside the shop on a motorbike. The accused and the man on the bike fled towards Khodiyarnagar crossroads where the CCTVs captured their images. But the duo then disappeared in some by-lane,” said Jignesh Patel, police inspector, Bapod police station. Patel added that the motorbike they used didn’t have a license plate. “We have formed three different teams to trace the duo,” he said. The police said that the accused may have been doing recce of the shop located on the ground floor of Shreeji Plaza and they chose afternoon time to commit the crime as crowds thin out during that time of the day. The jewellery showroom is flanked by a mobile shop and a garments shop. In February this year, a man had stabbed a jewellery showroom owner on the Old Padra Road and looted all the ornaments in the shop. The accused Deepak Mishra was arrested by the police from Uttar Pradesh one week later.

Also, the Covid protocols will be strictly followed at all the centres for conducting the Indian Economic Service (IES), Indian Statistical Service (ISS) and Indian Engineering Service (preliminary) examinations. While IES and ISS examinations would be held at one centre each here with 330 and 271 examinees respectively, 8158 candidates are to write the IES preliminary examination to be held at 19 centres on July 18, Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agrawal said on Wednesday after a meeting with DM Dr Chandrashekhar Singh and SSP UK Sharma besides other officials. Agrawal said there would be adequate arrangements at railway stations and bus stands for managing the rush of examinees reaching the state capital from different places. All examination centres would ensure Covid protocols, including use of masks by examinees, proper sanitisation of the venue and social distancing both inside and outside the examination halls. “Any examinee found carrying mobile phone, bluetooth or other gadgets would be debarred from taking any UPSC examination in future,” Agrawal warned. Examinees would have to enter the venue ten minutes before the commencement of the examination and those reaching late would not be allowed inside, he said. The centres for IES and ISS examinations are at Government Girls High Secondary School, Shastri Nagar and Mahant Hanuman Sharan High School, Mainpura, respectively.

---||Patna||Arms smugglers use women & kids to avoid police suspicion||PATNA: Arms smugglers in the state, of late, have started using their female family members or children as shields to avoid police suspicion or checking while transporting their consignments. In at least three cases of major arms and ammunition consignments seized by the Special Task Force (STF) over specific intelligence inputs within a fortnight, either female family members or children or both were travelling with the consignments. A senior IPS officer posted at the state police headquarters said such methods were used several years ago. He said in the cases of women or children used as shields, the arms consignments are intercepted only on accurate intelligence nputs. “Otherwise, consignments are transported easily, avoiding police suspicion on the road. This trend is seen in drug smuggling, too,” he said. On Thursday, STF seized two regular rifles of .315 bore, one regular pistol of 7.65mm and 460 live cartridges of three different bores from a car. A BSF constable, Jai Pukar Rai, who has not reported to his unit for more than a year, was transporting the consignment from Ranchi to Bhojpur. When the STF intercepted the car, Rai, his wife and son aged below 10 years, were accompanying him from Ranchi. On June 30, the STF intercepted another car at Kinjar in Arwal and recovered a regular carbine and nine cartridges being smuggled to Beur in Patna after purchasing it for Rs3 lakh from an arms smuggler at Mau under Tekari block in Gaya district. The carbine was purchased by an alleged notorious arms smuggler Shambhu Kumar Yadav. His 4-year-old son was travelling in the front seat with four more persons in the car. On June 24, the STF arrested Balvir Mandal and Sadhna Devi from an autorickshaw stand at Sangrampur in Munger while allegedly smuggling 13 countrymade semi-automatic pistols, 26 magazines and 100 live cartridges. The STF arrested Sadhna’s brother Chandan Bhagat and busted a mini gun factory at Dariyapur under Gangta police station area in Munger the next day. Another senior IPS officer said police avoid checking a vehicle with women and children inside it. “It makes things easy for the smugglers. They also act as shields in case of a shootout. Police can’t open or return fire in such a scenario,” he said. Citing Thursday’s interception, he said Rai’s wife didn’t know about the arms smuggling. “Rai had fake arms licence. He used to flash them before her but he was into arms smuggling,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/arms-smugglers-use-women-kids-to-avoid-police-suspicion/articleshow/84419432.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Surgeons, medical officers asked to promote use of contraceptives||PATNA: State health minister Mangal Pandey on Wednesday instructed all the civil surgeons and chief medical officers to counsel Asha workers to promote the use of injectable contraception Antara and oral contractive Chhaya. He stressed on the need of family planning and population control for the overall development of the country. Pandey was speaking at a programme organized to highlight the family planning journey of Bihar and way forward. The event was organized in association with Care India as a part of World Population Day, which was observed on July 11. “Each Asha worker is also given Rs100 as an incentive for getting one injection administered. They should especially go to the married couples and encourage them to use family planning methods. Earlier, these injections were not affordable for all. But now, under the Union government’s national family planning programme, the injections are being given free,” Pandey said. He also shared the population data of Bihar from 1951 to the estimated figures in 2021. Pandey said while the population of the state was 2.9 crore in 1951, it is estimated to have reached around 12.7 crore in 2021. “In 70 years, our population has multiplied nearly four times. Imagine how a family with four members has to deal when it increases to 16. Our land area is the same, but the population is increasing,” Pandey said. “We do expect good infrastructure, educational institutions for our children with skill development programme and employment generation. For all these, we will have to make family planning,” said Pandey, adding that the newborn kids should become an asset and not the burden. Talking about the national programme for family planning launched in 1952, Pandey said policymakers must have thought of developing various infrastructure like schools, hospitals and other institutes as per the population. He appreciated the achievements of Bihar in the field of health and family planning, including reduction in total fertility rate, maternal mortality rate and infant mortality rate. Total fertility rate of Bihar has decreased from 3.4 in NHSF-4 to 3.0 in NHSF-5. However, he said, Bihar was lagging behind others in the field of nutrition. Pandey said the average TFR of intermediate pass women in Bihar is 1.7 children, while that of the country is 1.8. In the graduate women category, the average TFR in Bihar is 1.7 and that of the country is 1.8. He said fertility rate was also related to the literacy of the population and praised CM Nitish Kumar for deeply analysing this parameter and promoting women education by giving various incentives. State health department special secretary Manoj Kumar said as per NHSF-5 data, over 40% of the girls in Bihar get married below 18 years of age. He called it a disturbing trend. He said family planning pakhwara was being organized regularly to create awareness in this regard, which he said will show good results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/surgeons-medical-officers-asked-to-promote-use-of-contraceptives/articleshow/84419728.cms||Sheezan Nezami

This indicates that the resolution process would spill over beyond FY22 to address the high number of residual entities with low recovery potential. Earlier this year, in its previous update, the board had revised upward the recovery target to Rs 61,000 crore from 56% earlier. Of the total debt of Rs 99,355 crore, Rs 29,030 crore has already been addressed through resolution and cash recovery, and another Rs 14,643 crore is expected from applications filed with courts. The board has projected an additional Rs 7,700-crore recovery by September 2021 and Rs 6,700 crore by March 2022. This will take the overall recovery to Rs 58,000 crore (95% of the target). The challenge before the Uday Kotak-led board will be in addressing 95 group entities, from which only Rs 3,000 crore of recovery is anticipated. According to the board, there is a limited buyer universe for these companies and the process for closure is long drawn out. As a result, there are time and cost implications on IL&FS as the group will have to continue as ‘going concerns’. The bulk of the recovery/resolution is from joint ventures and special purpose vehicles that are operating and generating profits. These businesses account for Rs 42,600 crore of expected recovery, which is 89% of their debt. Among other infra companies — IL&FS Maritime Infrastructure Company, IL&FS Energy Development, IL&FS Townships & Urban Assets and ITNL International — the expected recovery is around 47% (Rs 1,700 crore). Among large subsidiary companies, IL&FS Financial Services is expected to have the lowest recovery rate of 37% (Rs 6,000 crore). The holding company itself expects to recover 28% (Rs 5,500 crore) of its debt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/resolution-of-95-ilfs-cos-debt-to-spill-into-2022-23/articleshow/84389771.cms||Mayur Shetty

---||Business||Mutual fund investors have final say in scheme’s closure: Supreme Court||MUMBAI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday empowered investors in a mutual fund scheme to have the final say on its closure after trustees who manage it give a “reasoned nod” for winding it up. Under present rules, trustees alone have the right to decide on the closure of a scheme. The landmark verdict came in the case relating to the winding-up of Franklin Templeton MF’s six debt schemes. In April 2020, Franklin Templeton MF’s trustees had agreed to close down the schemes due to a severe liquidity crunch in the debt market after a Covid-induced lockdown. The SC also upheld the validity of Sebi’s mutual fund regulation under which these schemes are being closed down. The court held that Sebi can look into the decision of the trustees in case of a closure of a scheme. The SC judgment came on an appeal filed by Franklin Templeton MF against a Karnataka high court order that had asked the fund house to get the consent of its investors by a simple majority to its decision to wind up the six schemes. Some aggrieved investors had also moved SC challenging the validity of Sebi’s MF regulations. In their 77-page order, Justices S Abdul Nazeer and Sanjiv Khanna dealt with the interpretation of Sebi’s rules and regulations related to the issue of winding up of a scheme and the process followed during the same. They also said that to start the winding-up process, the trustees should give a public notice in newspapers to disclose circumstances leading to their decision to close the scheme. Justice Khanna said that they had “reservations on the said observations (of Karnataka HC) for the simple reason that if there is a violation of the regulations...by the trustees or AMC, it is open to Sebi to proceed in accordance with the law”. The apex court said that Sebi had the powers to pass directions under Sections 11 and 11B of the Sebi Act which deal with the protection of investors’ interests. SC, however, said that trustees need not take prior approval of Sebi while deciding to close a scheme. On February 12, the SC had allowed the e-voting process for winding up of six MF schemes. In December last year, the investors had voted their consent to the decision to close down the six schemes but the final results of the voting was not disclosed till February 12 under the apex court’s order. The SC had also allowed disbursal of funds to investors in these schemes under the supervision of SBI MF. According to the disbursal schedule, by the end of the week nearly Rs 21,100 crore would have been distributed to the investors of the six FTMF schemes, a release from the fund house said last week. The six schemes are FTMF’s Low Duration Fund, Ultra Short Bond Fund, Short Term Income Plan, Credit Risk Fund, Dynamic Accrual Fund, and Income Opportunities Fund.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mf-investors-have-final-say-in-schemes-closure-sc/articleshow/84423696.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Woman arrested in Tirupati for marrying and duping three men||TIRUPATI: A 30-year-old woman, who married three persons and duped them all by escaping with their valuables and money, landed in police net on Wednesday. The woman, identified as M Suhasini, was arrested by Alipiri police nearly a month after her third husband lodged a police complaint. Alipiri CI Devendra Kumar said the complaint was lodged by Sunil Kumar (29), who lives in Satyanarayanapuram in Tirupati. Sunil met the accused while she was working at a finance company in Tirupati. He said his parents gifted 20 grams of gold jewellery to Suhasini at the time of their marriage last December. A few months later, she took Rs 4 lakh from Sunil and Rs 2 lakh from his father, saying she had to repay the debts she incurred before their marriage. When Sunil enquired about the money a month later, she disappeared one night along with some valuables and cash. Her phone too was switched off. Later, he checked her Aadhaar card and was shocked to find she was already married to a person from Konetirajupalem in Nellore district and they have two children. After coming to know that Sunil had managed to dig out her past, Suhasini called him over phone and told him she was married twice before. After her arrest on Tuesday, police found that one Vinay from Kothagudem in Bhadradri was also one of her victims. The woman has been found to be committed the con jobs with the help of her first husband, who is also her maternal uncle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/woman-arrested-for-marrying-and-duping-three-men/articleshow/84419811.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

This is when the Covid-19 pandemic had not arrived,” he said and feared that the state’s economy was headed towards a financial crisis. Mohan is in Patna on a five-day visit to seek suggestions and issue directions on the annual audit plan for year 2021-2022 and performance audit of the state. He said the estimated revenue deficit is based on the trends of the audit for the fiscal year 2019-2020, which is about to be completed. He further said the revenue deficit ratio is expected to increase further for fiscal year 2020-2021. Mohan also expressed concern over the state’s financial mismanagement and indiscipline and poor budgeting exercise. “To some extent, an inflated budget is tabled by the state government in the legislative assembly intentionally to amuse people despite knowing that the increased allocation made to the specific departments might not be used,” he said. He said some of the state government departments like urban development and housing department and few others were in the habit of not giving reports or replying for audit. “This is lawlessness. This is a serious issue. It should not happen,” he said. Highlighting the issues, Mohan said utilisation certificates of Rs55,405 crore for fiscal year 2018-2019 against central grants have not been provided yet, which is a serious matter. “One or two government entities, which are now defunct, have not prepared any accounts ever in the last 43 years,” he said. Mohan said only eight public sector undertakings of the state government are making nominal profits. The senior CAG officer has already met deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad, who holds the finance department portfolio and discussed several issues. He is scheduled to leave Patna on July 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-may-have-revenue-deficit-of-rs-1k-crore-additional-deputy-cag/articleshow/84421724.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Jitan Ram Manjhi backs Nitish Kumar on population control steps||PATNA: The controversy and differences over the need for population control law has engulfed the Bihar NDA. Former CM and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi on Wednesday came in open support of CM Nitish Kumar whose stand has divided the state NDA. “In matters of population control, HAM welcomes the statement and ways as given by Nitish Kumar. It is due to the impact of education among girls that the fertility rate of Bihar is less than the national average,” Manjhi tweeted. “Therefore, it is necessary that other states also adopt the Nitish Kumar model on population control,” he added. On Monday, Nitish took the position that the population control law alone will not help in checking the population growth and, in fact, providing education to girls is the sure and certain route to it, as the Bihar example had shown. After the janata darbar programme, Nitish cited statistics and said the fertility rate in women of Bihar, who had completed their intermediate level of education, was 1.6 percent against the national average of 1.7%. On the other hand, the fertility rate among the matriculate women was on par with the national average at 2%. Nitish also said the education of women will help in controlling the state’s population by 2040. He pointed out that law could have its value, but education and awareness was the more effective route to population control. On Tuesday, several BJP leaders, including deputy CM Renu Devi, minister Samrat Choudhary and party president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal had either made veiled criticism of Nitish, or praised UP CM Yogi Adityanath for bringing out his government’s draft Bill on population control law for his state, taking it as a model, which, in fact, has also spurred the central BJP to take the issue to Parliament. Indeed, as the BJP braces for a discussion in the Rajya Sabha on the need for a law on population control in the monsoon session of Parliament in August, the Bihar NDA partners are divided over the issues related to population control. Clearly, the JD(U) led by CM Nitish Kumar and the state BJP brass on the two sides of the divide. Of the four NDA partners in Bihar, Manjhi has come in support of Nitish, while minister and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) chief Mukesh Sahani with four MLAs in the assembly has not yet opened his mind on it. Sahani is an MLC on the BJP quota. Given the context, Rajya Sabha member, Bihar BJP senior and former deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi on Wednesday issued his tweets on the matters related to population control, and also asked the Bihar NDA partners to be restrained. “On this issue the NDA components should not make statements publicly, and instead, they should sit together to consider as to how should population be controlled to increase the pace of development, and also how should the population be used as resources,” Modi said, adding: “There should not be politics on this issue.” He said that the central and state governments in the country have been giving incentives – like LTC benefits, Rs 1500 monthly support, I-T relief and benefits under Janani Swasthya Yojana -- to their employees who abide by the two-child norm policy. Other benefits include I-T relief and under Janani Swasthya Yojana. Further, Modi said that “in Bihar, after the formation of the NDA government, the municipal corporation Act was amended to provide that only those with two children can contest the elections to the urban local bodies.” Without saying if a similar condition and arrangement will be provided to contest the forthcoming panchayat elections in Bihar, Modi said that it was the norm in the states like Rajasthan, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand and Odisha. Similarly, mandatory adherence to the two-child norm by a family provided the route to getting a government job in Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/manjhi-backs-nitish-on-population-control-steps/articleshow/84419303.cms||Abhay Singh

The authorities are also planning to bring more animals under exchange programmes. Among work that have either been lined up or undertaken are, renovation of pavements, which were damaged during Yaas, giving a natural touch and greener look to animal enclosures, installation of display boards giving scientific information and repairs of the railings and enclosures. The officials are also planning to bring Indian one-horned rhino, green anaconda, king cobra and Siamese crocodile to the zoo. Siamese crocodile — a critically-endangered species — might either come from Madras Crocodile Bank Trust or Odisha’s Nandankanan, while the green anaconda and king cobra may be brought from Madras Crocodile Bank Trust. Member secretary of state zoo authority, Saurabh Chaudhuri, said: “Our honourable minister Jyotipriya Mullick had recently visited the zoo during which the plans were taken up. Besides, the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) officials have already done an online review and are planning a physical visit shortly, before which we want to wrap up the renovation.” According to him, the zoo will also keep squeeze cages inside every enclosure so that animals can be quarantined fast if they develop any Covid symptom. Chaudhuri said that display boards in front of every enclosure will have detailed scientific information not only about the species, but also about their habitat, diet, places they are found etc. “As per the CZA guidelines, we are creating a natural environment for the animals inside their enclosures and giving them a greener look,” he said, adding that more display boards were being installed to give visitors clear directions towards sections like primates, herbivores and carnivores. “Three big trees had fallen on the day cyclone Yaas had struck, damaging a section of the pavements. While the trees had been restored, we are now repairing the pavements,” added Chaudhuri. On possible new arrivals, Chaudhuri said that it’s still at a planning stage. “We have initiated the process to submit a proposal to CZA and a final decision will be taken only after we get a clearance from them,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-zoo-to-get-facelift-may-bring-in-siamese-croc-green-anaconda/articleshow/84421341.cms||---

The DPR for construction of another jetty at Budagatlapalem in Srikakulam is expected to be ready shortly. The state government is gearing up to float tenders for construction of the new jetties. In fact, the state government had proposed construction of new jetties in seven locations including Budagatlapalem, Chinthapalli, Manchineelapeta, Bhimili, Visakhapatnam fishing harbour, Rajayyapeta and Biyyaputhipa almost two years ago. The state requested the Centre to grant the financial assistance to take up the projects for the benefit of the fishermen under Coastal Berth Scheme (CBS), which is part of Sagaramala project. The Centre readily agreed to extend its support and directed the state government to ready the DPRs but it asked the state government to give 50 per cent as matching grant to its support. Sources said that each project would cost around Rs 30-40 crore. The delay in readying the blue-print and unwillingness of the state government to share the burden is believed to have resulted in the delay of launching the project works. The state government had recently communicated to the Centre that the experts had visited the locations and submitted their reports on Manchineelapetta, Chinthapalli and Budagatlapalem. It said that it was waiting for inputs from the experts on the remaining four locations. “The nodal officer is being persuaded for the pending inputs. We will forward the inputs as and when we receive,” the state told the union ministry of shipping and ports. According to sources, the government had finalized the DPRs for Manchineelapetta and Chinthapalli and had uploaded the required documents for final clearance from the Centre. It also said that the DPR for Budagatlapalem was under finalization and the documents would be uploaded shortly. It said that DPRs of other locations, including Visakhapatnam fishing harbour, were pending due to the delay of inputs. The Centre is of the view that a floating structure, because of its inherent advantages, is an attractive solution. The floating jetties have the advantage over the conventional quay and fixed concrete structures as they are a cost-effective solution and much cheaper than the price of conventional structures. Also setting up of floating structures is much faster when compared to conventional jetties. Usually, floating structures can be built in 6-8 months as compared to 24 months for conventional structures and its environmental impact is minimal. “Expansions are easily feasible due to modular construction techniques,” the Centre said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/ap-readies-dprs-for-construction-of-two-cargo-jetties/articleshow/84420063.cms||Samdani MN

Towards this, the American automaker has been in talks with various car companies for both contract manufacturing and/or sale of its Indian factories, the latest with Ola, which could use Ford’s factories to build electric cars. An Ola spokesperson refused to comment, while Ford India’s spokesman termed it speculative: "We would not like to comment on speculations. We continue to assess our capital allocations in India and expect to have an answer in the second half of this year,” Ford India’s spokesperson said. Ford went slow with their contract manufacturing discussions for two years because "talks were at an advanced level with Mahindra & Mahindra" and was looking at "cross badging and new product alliance plans with the Indian partner would take care of Ford India's 400000 units per annum capacity at Maraimalainagar and Sanand," said a source. After the talks with M&M fell through, in January, Ford initiated the process all over again to identify partners including MG, Changan and Great Wall. Changan and Great Wall though evinced preliminary interest, but dropped their India plans (for now) because of geo-political tensions at the Indo-China border. The passenger vehicle market has shrunk sharply leaving manufacturing capacities under utilised, across manufacturers. "The uncertainty in the long-term growth prospects of the auto industry has resulted in serious challenges for Ford, including capacity utilization," said another source. Ford can make cars and engines across its two factories, one in Chennai and another in Sanand, Gujarat. The Chennai plant can make two lakh cars and 3.50 lakh engines, while the Sanand facility can manufacture 2.4 lakh cars and assemble 2.7 lakh engines. The struggling automaker sold less than 2,800 cars in June.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ford-looks-to-wrap-up-india-factory-ops-soon/articleshow/84421288.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

Justice Prateek Jalan asked CBSE to consider as representation a petition by Deepa Joseph, mother of a Class X student studying in a CBSE-affiliated school, who had paid Rs 2,100 as examination fee. The CBSE’s decision would be open to challenge if Joseph is not satisfied, the court clarified as it disposed of the petition. Claiming that the expenditure incurred by CBSE to conduct board examination, as well as its role in the process, was less, the plea pointed out that as per the new policy, “schools were uploading the marks”. The court, however, disagreed and wondered how the role of the board can be reduced.“If CBSE is not doing anything, you take the marksheet from schools and go,” it told the petitioner. CBSE said it was a self-financing body and its expenditure was principally funded by the examination fees collected from students appearing in boards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/decide-within-8-weeks-on-exam-fee-refund-hc-to-cbse/articleshow/84423838.cms||---

They may have been murdered, police said. The woman’s husband has filed a complaint against a distant kin of the deceased for "killing the two over an illicit relationship". Neighbours called the police after a foul smell started coming out from the house which was locked from inside. “The bodies were badly decomposed. They may have died on Sunday or even before that," a neighbour said. Locals said the family did not socialise much and very few visited them. A senior police officer investigating the case said the 'killers' had murdered the mother and son and also took away the CCTV cameras installed outside. The cop added that the woman’s husband has named a distant relative in the complaint. “The woman was living separately from her husband for long. It seems that the 'lover' had killed the woman and her son as he was fed up with the expenses and demands. We have filed an FIR and teams are raiding various places to arrest him,” Santosh Singh, the SSP, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/decomposed-bodies-of-murdered-mom-son-found-in-bulandshahr/articleshow/84418993.cms||Ishita Mishra

Opposing a batch of petitions challenging the policy, the government said all apprehensions against it were fanciful and not based on real ground. Several petitions have been filed challenging the new excise policy before the high court, which had earlier refused to pass any stay order. On Thursday, while hearing a few fresh petitions, a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh issued notice and sought reply from Delhi government and the Centre. It did not, however, pass any order on staying the policy or extending the July 20 deadline for applying for tender under the policy. When one of the counsels opposing the policy submitted that, in the new policy, which divides Delhi into 32 zones, only 16 players could be permitted in the market and would lead to monopoly, the bench said such control was for public welfare and not for those in liquor business. “Control is for public welfare and not for you to run your business. It is for the public at large,” the bench noted. Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing Delhi government, submitted that, “There is a full-scale assault on us. I will put in a reply. The policy minimises corruption, gives fair competition.” Since the court heard the first challenge to the policy on July 12, eight petitions have come before different benches, Singhvi along with Delhi government standing counsel Santosh Kumar Tripathi said, adding that the petitions were by people well-versed in liquor business. HC as hearing a fresh challenge to the new excise policy, which alleged that it was illegal, unfair, arbitrary and violative of the Delhi Excise Act of 2009. The petition also sought to quash the June 28 e-tender notice of Delhi government, prescribing the procedure to be followed for inviting zone-wise electronic bids for grant of 32 zonal licences of retail vends of liquor for supply of Indian and foreign brands in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-excise-policy-will-cut-graft-delhi-govt-tells-hc/articleshow/84456453.cms||---

In several other tourism destinations in the state including Digha and Santiniketan, either of the two documents have been made mandatory. The exercise is part of awareness and sensitizing campaign of the district administration to restrict the spread of Covid -19 in wake of the second wave and the expected third wave. Sources within the Darjeeling district administration said meetings had been held with hoteliers, restaurant and homestay owners and other tourism stakeholders to create awareness. “In order to contain the Covid-19 spread in tourists locations, we have advised hotels and homestay owners to take booking only after ascertaining either RT-PCR negative status (not less than 72 hours) or double vaccination certificates of the tourists,” the source said. With relaxation in the restrictions offered by the state government, tourists from Kolkata as well as from other states have started reaching the Hills. In the absence of district level strictures to contain the disease spread, there are apprehensions that it could prove fatal. “We are continuing to ask tourists coming to our hotel to provide the RT-PCR tests report and double vaccination certificates. We cannot risk the health of our staffs. However, we have not received any official communication from the district administration, yet,” said Pine Tree Resort and Spa general manager Rajesh Rajak. The number of active cases in Darjeeling district is going higher and is second in the state.

The justice A K Rajan committee which studied NEET’s impact on state students submitted its report on Wednesday, which is a step towards getting the exemption,” he said. He said they are worried over the sudden announcement from the Centre on NEET 2021. Asked about NEET coaching for government students, he said interested students are undergoing online NEET training since November. Students are making use of pre-recorded video sessions and clearing their doubts through web-based training. While JEE coaching too is taking place from January, interested students are on track to face the exam. Asked on the possibility of a crash course for students as the coaching has not been convincing, he said the state board syllabus is on par with CBSE which will help the students. Asked about the shortage of textbooks in government schools, he said the high number of students joining government schools from private schools this time has led to the shortage, but the demand will be met. On the lack of online classes for government school students, he said offline classes are unmatched in terms of learning. “While Puducherry has planned to open high and higher secondary schools, we will see if it can be replicated in Tamil Nadu,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/neet-exemption-tns-aim-but-students-will-be-trained-for-test-min/articleshow/84421403.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: 79 more trommel machines at Bhalswa landfill by early December||NEW DELHI: From August 1, North Delhi Municipal Corporation will empanel 31 companies to set up, maintain and operate 79 trommel machines at the Bhalswa landfill. “Once fully operational by the beginning of December, these machines will process up to 20,000 tonnes of legacy waste at the landfill every day,” said an official. Tenders have been allocated and these companies will first have to level the surface to install the machines. The landfill currently has 25 trommel machines being operated by 11 companies, which are processing around 6,000 tonnes waste every day. “We are working towards intensifying the process for processing the legacy waste at the site. The companies will also be responsible for installing related equipment,” said the official. The decision to speed up the process was taken after the corporation found some sites where inert material could be dumped regularly, including a 30-acre site at Mukundpur. “As the disposal of inert left after biomining of waste has been an issue, we identified our own sites to dump enough inert every day to create space for new residues generated by trommel machines,” said the official. The sites include an open site at Mukundpur, another at Sector 28, Rohini; in Kirari and other low lying areas. “But we still need more sites,” the official added. Earlier, the north corporation had issued a public circular inviting common people to take inert for free to fill low-lying areas and claimed to have received encouraging feedback. “They had to only arrange for transportation of the material. We had mentioned the name of the officials to be contacted and some government agencies also showed interest,” said the official. The corporation is also trying to finalise concessionaires for daily collection of refuse derived fuel (RDF)/plastic waste left after biomining. The civic body currently has around 80,000 tonnes of RDF stock at the landfill. “Of the 6,000 tonnes of waste processed every day, at least 800-1,200 tonnes RDF are extracted. Of this, 400-500 tonnes are consumed by the waste-to-energy plant at Bawana and some are taken by the approved companies under CSR initiatives for disposal as per norms. But the remaining amount is still a headache,” the official said. The corporation is in the process of finalising the tender in 10-15 days and sending this RDF to a cement plant in Rajasthan for proper disposal, the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/79-more-trommel-machines-at-bhalswa-landfill-by-early-dec/articleshow/84423898.cms||Vibha Sharma

The school management moved court claiming it is a minority institution and cannot be asked to follow the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, which is mandated for all private schools. The school approached the high court after the state government refused to grant the status of minority institution to the trust. A single judge bench rejected its petition, but the division bench admitted its appeal, sought a response from the state government on the issue and stayed it from sponsoring students under the RTE laws. The school claimed that it has been running since 1979. Its secondary section enjoys the status of a minority institution, but the primary section has not been accorded the same status, though the same trust runs both sections. When the issue of admission under the RTE Act arose, minority institutions approached the court objecting to the arrangements. Many schools did not have certificates of their being minority institutions. The issue is pending before the Supreme Court, which has temporarily protected such schools by staying RTE admissions, if their applications seeking minority status are pending. Seventh Day also applied to the state authorities for minority status, but its request was declined. It has filed an appeal before the National Commission for Minorities against the state government’s rejection. Meanwhile, the school’s name was mentioned on the list of those schools which had to admit students in its primary section under provisions of the RTE Act for the year 2021-22. It approached the HC challenging the state government’s decision to decline its request for the minority institution status. Before the division bench, the school’s advocate also submitted that the single judge was “grossly mistaken” and passed an order, which was under challenge before the division bench. After hearing, the bench headed by the chief justice said that prima facie, the case for interim relief was made out. It restrained the authorities from sponsoring children at the school till further orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rte-holdout-school-gets-hc-relief/articleshow/84421388.cms||---

The public drive will initially start at 36 centres that routinely offer ante-natal care. Vaccination will be held for three hours on Thursday from 2pm to 5pm, said the BMC. An estimated 1.5 lakh pregnant women will benefit from this. The corporation had started the vaccination of lactating mothers on May 19 following a go-ahead from the Centre. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that women will be given every information about the risks if they get infected with Covid-19 and the benefits of vaccination. The Centre has said that they can get vaccinated anytime during pregnancy, although the corporation has stated that women should make an informed choice about vaccination. Women who have developed Covid-19 or have been treated with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma can get vaccinated after 12 weeks, the BMC said. It has cautioned that after vaccination, some may experience mild fever, pain at the injection site or feel unwell for one to three days. In rare cases, they may experience severe symptoms lasting up to 20 days after vaccination. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said that they have chosen medical colleges, suburban hospitals, maternity hospitals and some government hospitals that routinely offer maternal care. “Necessary training has also been imparted to all the concerned staff on Covid vaccination and counselling of pregnant women. We are also ensuring that when pregnant women come for ante-natal check-ups they are counselled as well,” she said. The union health ministry had on July 2 allowed the vaccination of pregnant women based on recommendations of the National Vaccination Technical Advisory Group. The Centre had found that pregnant women are more likely to have severe infection with Covid-19. The rate of pre-term delivery was higher. Around 90% of pregnant women affected by Covid-19 do not need hospitalisation. In 10%, who have gestational diabetes, obesity, chronic respiratory diseases, or heart disease, the risk of acute Covid-19 infection increases. Some of the centres that will start vaccination are: Cama in Fort; Nair in Mumbai Central; Jagjivanram in Byculla; JJ Hospital; Central Railway Hospital, Byculla; Mumbai Port Trust, Wadala; LTMG Municipal College, Sion; KEM in Parel; MGM Hospital and Naigaon Maternity in Parel; Mahim Maternity Hospital; ESIS, Worli; VN Desai, Santacruz (E); KB Bhabha Hospital, Bandra; Cooper, Juhu; Shirodkar Maternity Hospital, Vile Parle; and Bhabha Kurla. Gomare said the city received a lakh doses on Wednesday, but most centres will be collecting these in the morning. On Wednesday, footfall improved as 65,244 people came for the shot. The city has administered 62.33lakh doses so far. A special drive was held to vaccinate 81 female sex workers and transgender persons on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmcs-free-covid-19-vaccination-for-pregnant-women-from-today/articleshow/84423947.cms||---

Rupani had taken over from Anandiben Patel as the CM on August 7, 2016 and was sworn in as CM again after the BJP won a majority in the 20917 assembly election. On Wednesday, the state cabinet appointed a five-minister committee led by senior minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama to chalk out the celebration plan for the completion of Rupani’s continuous five years as chief minister. Sources close to the development informed that starting from the CM’s birthday on August 2, a number of events will be organised to mark the milestone. The government is likely to hold a number of functions to pass on individual benefits to beneficiaries of government schemes. Events to highlight the achievements of the Rupani government over the past five years are also being planned in a phased manner. All departments have been asked to submit their plans for the event. “The state government is expected to announce few new welfare schemes as well to mark the occasion,” sources added. Rupani will be the fourth Gujarat CM among a total of 16 CMs who had enjoyed an uninterrupted 5 years in power. Till now, Hitendra Desai, Madhavsinh Solanki and Narendra Modi have served continuously as CM for 5 years or more. Rupani is all set to join this select group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cms-5-years-at-helm-to-be-celebrated-in-aug/articleshow/84421459.cms||---
---||Trichy||Modify bylaws of Tamil Nadu universities for a level-playing field: Teachers Association||TRICHY: The Teachers Association of Bharathidasan University (TABU) has urged Tamil Nadu governor to modify the bylaws of state-run arts and science universities to ensure that faculty members from arts and science backgrounds alone are appointed as vice-chancellors (VC). The demand comes at the time when engineering professors were frequently appointed to the post of vice-chancellors in arts and science universities. Members of TABU urged governor Banwarilal Purohit, who is also the chancellor of state universities, to ensure a level-playing field for faculty members from arts and science disciplines while appointing vice-chancellors. The essential qualification for the post of vice-chancellor for technical, law and agriculture universities is fixed as specialised degrees with PhD relating to those universities. But arts and science universities are open to all disciplines. “This would greatly disincentivise those contributing to the reputation of these purely arts and science universities,” said president of TABU M Selvam. He said there is no logic in evaluating candidates belonging to engineering, agriculture, medicine, arts and science, with the same yardstick. Hence, the selection committee can consider providing leverage to the evaluation criteria of arts faculty. Further, the academic environment of arts and science universities is different from specialised universities like Dr MGR Medical University, Anna University and Tamil Nadu Agricultural University as these faculty members are exposed to different environments. The problems and difficulties faced by the students, scholars and faculty members of arts and science disciplines can be well understood only by the vice-chancellors, drawn from the arts and science disciplines. Even within arts and science universities, UGC has set two different criteria for career advancement scheme promotions - one for arts faculty and another for science faculty. This indicates the different level playing fields, prevailing between arts and science university and technical university, Selvam said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/modify-bylaws-of-varsities-for-a-level-playing-field-tabu/articleshow/84421444.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: NCP betrayed Congress in 2014 polls, says Nana Patole||MUMBAI: A week after NCP president Sharad Pawar dismissed his remarks that the Congress would contest future elections on its own, state Congress president Nana Patole on Wednesday targeted the NCP, saying it had “betrayed” the Congress in the 2014 assembly elections. As a result, he reiterated, the Congress had now geared up to contest the 2024 general and assembly elections on its own. “Keeping in mind the experience of 2014, we have now geared up for the 2024 Lok Sabha and assembly elections, which we will contest on our own...So far as the MVA government is concerned, it is firmly in the saddle and routine issues are sorted out by the coordination committee,” Patole told TOI. A week ago, Pawar had declined to comment on Patole’s “going solo” remarks, saying he would respond “only to statements made by Congress president Sonia Gandhi.” Incidentally, Patole is scheduled to address a party workers’ rally at Baramati, Pawar’s hometown, on July 29. In 2014, when Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan was the CM, there were serious allegations of corruption and irregularities against then deputy CM Ajit Pawar and water resources minister Sunil Tatkare. Following a white paper on the status of irrigation projects, it was revealed that less than 1% area had been brought under irrigation. This was followed by supercession of the NCP-controlled Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank and charges of corruption against Chhagan Bhujbal over construction of the Maharashtra Sadan in New Delhi. These developments prompted the NCP to withdraw support to the government, and as a result, President’s rule was imposed in the state. Later, the NCP decided to terminate its alliance with Congress and contested the assembly elections independently. Patole said in view of the NCP’s unilateral decision to terminate the alliance, the Congress had to pay a heavy price as it was not prepared to contest the 2014 elections independently. The BJP was the biggest beneficiary as it won 122 seats and with the outside support of NCP, it formed the government. The NCP had extended its support to BJP at that time even before final results were declared, even when the BJP had not sought NCP’s support for formation of government. Patole said in view of the changing political situation and the fact that the Congress had suffered heavily in the past, its strategy for the 2024 general elections was being finalised. “As head of the party at the state level, my job is to expand the party at all levels and ensure that we reach out to every individual. I have been given the task of attacking the BJP”, he said. Known for making controversial statements, Patole reiterated that the government and party are two different entities. “As a head of the party, I have different responsibilities. I will have to ensure that the party expands in all parts of the state, while the government has to provide better administration. Problems faced by the administration are resolved by the coordination committee comprising cabinet members of the Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP,” he said. On his Baramati rally, Patole said he was not challenging Pawar but was going to visit that place on the demands of party workers. “Congress workers are insisting on a rally in Baramati, and I have accepted the invitation. It will be an interaction with our workers,” Patole said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/betrayed-in-14-polls-will-go-it-alone-patole/articleshow/84426174.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The civic body had selected Rawmatt Industries Private Limited to convert 237 standard diesel-run buses into CNG and set June 30, 2021 as the deadline. “Of the 400-odd buses in its fleet, the NMC has so far converted 54 buses, deployed on different routes, to run them using CNG,” said a senior official from the transport department. “The firm has missed the deadline due to various reasons including non-availability of spare parts and Covid-induced lockdown,” said transport committee member and former chairman Jitendra Kukde. He also admitted lack of funds as one of the reasons for the delay. “Now, a budgetary provision of Rs6 crore has been made for this,” he added. In March 2019, Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari had rolled out NMC’s first CNG bus on city roads. Gadkari had suggested the civic body to convert all its diesel-run vehicles into CNG. The then mayor Nanda Jichkar too had announced that even her official car will be converted into CNG-run vehicle. The senior official further said that additional 30 standard buses are in the pipeline for conversion and awaiting nod from the regional transport office in the city. Apart from 54 CNG buses, the NMC is currently operating six electric midi buses also, he said. The civic body has also placed an order for 40 electric midi buses having seating capacity of 32 passengers each. For this, the NMC had received funds from the central government under Phase-II of Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric vehicles (FAME). It had also received a subsidy (Rs14 crore) for procuring the e-buses. Each bus costs around Rs1.49 crore and the manufacturer Olectra-BYD had agreed to run the e-buses by not charging the capital cost. In exchange, the NMC will pay the firm Rs66.30 per km as operation cost, which will also include capital cost of the 40 e-buses. The official explained that the operational cost of each electric bus is around Rs42.30 per km and the capital cost share will be Rs22 per km. Olectra-BYD will deliver the first lot 12 buses in September this year, he added. Besides this, the Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) will be providing 15 electric buses to the NMC free of cost. It is in tendering stage and will join the Aapli Bus fleet before March next year, said the official. Rs7 crore Viability Gap Funding! Currently, the NMC is paying Rs62 per km for standard buses, Rs55 for midi and Rs45 for mini. Before the Covid lockdown, the civic body used to operate around 370 Aapli buses, including six e-buses, and spent around Rs13 crore per month. However, the buses generated around Rs6 crore from fare, while the viability gap funding was around Rs7 crore. Addition of electric buses will increase the NMC’s expenditure on operating the Aapli Bus service by almost Rs85 lakh per month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2-years-on-only-13-5-aapli-buses-converted-into-cng/articleshow/84421480.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The cheque was handed over to the wife of the deceased cop by the SSP on Wednesday. Every policeman, be it SSP to a constable, has donated their one day salary to help the family of Vineet Sharma, who was the computer operator in the city’s Police Lines since 2014. Vineet died last month after battling with cancer. As the deceased cop was survived by his wife Gunjan Sharma and two young girls, the police in Bulandshahr came forward to help the family of the sole breadwinner. “Vineet was a good employee and his children and wife deserve to live a decent life. To help them, everyone one in the police community has donated their one day’s salary. We managed to arrange Rs 33.28 lakh which were handed over to his wife today,” said Bulandshahr SSP Santosh Kumar. The senior cop added that Vineet's wife will also get a job in the police department and monetary help as per the government norms. "It will happen in the due course of time," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/bulandshahr-cops-collect-rs-33-2-lakh-for-kin-of-police-lines-comp-operator-who-died-of-cancer/articleshow/84419030.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Yet to get refund for cancelled vaccine orders, cash clog hits private hospital jab drive||KOLKATA: Private hospitals and healthcare units that had paid for vaccines they had ordered through bank loans in June are now facing a financial challenge as the orders have got cancelled after a switch in the procurement process. Several crores that these city private hospitals had paid to the National Health Authority (NHA) through their portal are yet to be refunded, landing them in a cash crunch. Even as they have been told that the amount will be refunded, there is no clarity when the amount could be reverted. Meanwhile, all of them have been forced to go for another round of loan to pay upfront for the fresh orders through Co-Win Portal. “We had taken a cash credit of Rs 6.5 crore from a bank to pay for 1 lakh doses we had ordered in June. The order got cancelled after the payment. We do not know when the refund will be made. Meanwhile, we have run out of stock and can resume the drive only after getting a fresh supply,” said Suraksha Diagnostics MD Somnath Chatterjee. The diagnostic chain that has administered about 1 lakh doses has now placed a fresh order of 1 lakh doses, made the payment and is waiting for its stock. It stopped its inoculation drive from Wednesday. Many private health facilities had started placing their orders from mid-June via the state government that was then acting as an aggregator. They made the payment through NHA once their orders were approved. But the central government shifted the procurement system to the Co-Win platform, leading to cancellation of all June orders. “As per the June 21 vaccination policy, Woodlands was allotted 30,000 doses of Covishield for the balance period of June. We were told that stocks will be delivered within one week of making payment. However, we have neither received the stock nor a refund till date. Our cash flow has been affected,” said Woodlands Multispeciality Hospital MD Rupali Basu. While the hospital’s refund of about Rs 1.9 crore is stuck, Peerless Hospital’s Rs 3 crore refund, which it had paid in mid-June for 35,000 Covishield doses and 7000 Covaxin doses, is pending. “Since the procurement system changed, our order got cancelled. We have placed a fresh order about a week ago for which we have made a payment and we expect to get the supply in another 10 days,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. Fortis Hospital had paid Rs 3 crore plus in the third week of June for 50,000 doses. While the hospital was told that the refund would be made in early-July, no amount has been refunded yet. “Our payment is stuck after since the order got cancelled,” said AMRI Hospital group CEO Rupak Barua. “The procurement system got changed when we started expecting our June order requiring us to apply afresh in July. We are told that state government is pursuing the refund with the Centre,” said Narayana Health regional director (East) R Venkatesh. “We paid around Rs 40 lakh through NHA on June 25 and the order got cancelled 10 days later. For a smaller unit like ours, the amount through bank loan is quite huge,” said Charnock Hospital CEO Ipsita Kundu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/yet-to-get-refund-for-cancelled-vaccine-orders-cash-clog-hits-pvt-hosp-jab-drive/articleshow/84421509.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Panneerselvam and the top officials from the agriculture department had convened a meeting in Thanjavur on Wednesday in which representatives of farmers’ associations in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam and Mayiladuthurai districts participated and submitted their suggestions and demands for the budget. “With the participation of farmers in the meeting, a good budget on agriculture will be tabled. The schemes to boost organic farming will be a top priority,” the minister told reporters. Farmers suggested the development of integrated farming, re-opening of sugar mills to boost sugarcane cultivation, creation of cold storage facilities for vegetables, distribution of agriculture equipment at subsidized rates, establishments of new agriculture colleges, research institutes and the inclusion of agriculture as a subject in school education. Appreciating the move for expanding the scope for organic farming, Thanjavur district secretary of the Cauvery farmers’ protection association, S Vimalnathan, suggested that Tamil Nadu Agriculture University (TNAU) should be named after organic farming scientist G Nammazhvar in his honour. The association also asked the government to get the expertise of agriculture scientist Subah Palekar from Maharashtra on ‘zero-budget farming’. Tamilaga Cauvery Vivasayigal Sangam led by its general secretary P R Pandian suggested the formation of district and state-level consultative committees of farmers to plan and discuss agricultural activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/organic-farming-to-get-boost-in-agri-budget/articleshow/84421498.cms||---
---||Delhi||HC ultimatum to Centre on digital crowdfunding platform for rare diseases||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Wednesday said it would take action for “wilful non-compliance” if the Centre failed to make operational a digital platform for crowd funding of expensive medicines and treatment for rare diseases. The court said despite specific directions on January 28 that the digital crowd funding platform be made operational by March 31, it has not been done.Justice Rekha Palli was informed by Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma that he was not aware if the platform was working or not. Directing that instructions be sought in this regard by the counsel for central government, the judge said, “This court would be constrained to take action for wilful non-compliance.”“I will have to say you are in contempt”, it cautioned, while posting the case for August 4. The court was hearing a batch of petitions on behalf of children suffering from rare diseases, including Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Mucopolysaccharidosis II or MPS II (Hunter Syndrome), and seeking direction to the Centre to provide them uninterrupted and free of cost treatment as the therapy is very expensive.DMD, one of the various forms of muscular dystrophy, is a rare genetic disease that affects boys almost exclusively and causes progressive weakness. MPS II is a rare disease that is passed on in families and it mainly affects boys and their bodies cannot break down a kind of sugar that builds bones, skin, tendons and other tissues.On January 28, Justice Prathiba Singh had passed an order directing the Centre to make operational the digital crowd funding platform for medicines and treatment for rare illnesses. The court had said that it was issuing the direction to finalise the policy and operationalise the digital platform by March 31.An affidavit filed by the Union health ministry had said that both things were “likely” to be done by March 31. Subsequently, on March 23, the court passed a slew of directions in connection with the treatment of persons with rare diseases, including a direction to notify the National Health Policy for Rare Diseases by March 31 and setting up a National Consortium for Research, Development and Therapeutics, a rare diseases committee at AIIMS and a fund for such ailments.The platform created under the policy for receiving crowd funding shall be linked to the fund and individuals and companies wishing to contribute shall make direct contributions into it, the court had said.

On Wednesday, the city police launched the facility for the eligible candidates, irrespective of their districts or states. The recorded videos of the classes would also be saved on the YouTube channel of the Ludhiana police. Besides, at present, 1,500 candidates are getting free physical training at Ludhiana police lines, where a training camp is organised between 4am and 8am by 35 trainers. Each trainer handles three batches each comprising 30 candidates. Additional deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Ashwini Gotyal said, “Since June 27, the Ludhiana Police has been providing free physical training to the candidates willing to join the force. Besides, it is for the first time that a written examination will also be conducted for the recruitment of constables. It will be held before the physical test. As the candidates may be clueless about the syllabus, subjects and the marking system, the Ludhiana police started the online classes.” “We have roped in professionals who have the experience of competitive exams. The recently-recruited sub-inspectors who have volunteered for it will hold a half-an-hour session during the online classes. The classes will be of three-hour from 5pm to 8pm and held five-day a week,” she added. ADCP Gotyal said, “The online classes are for all eligible candidates irrespective of their districts or states. The Punjab Police already has some personnel from Haryana. Link of the class has been shared on the official Facebook page of the Ludhiana Police.” The officer said while providing the physical training, the biggest challenge they came across was that none of the candidates was vaccinated. “As per the guidelines of the Punjab government, for any kind of gathering, the persons must have got at least one dose of the Covid vaccine. However, of all the 1,500 candidates, none was vaccinated. We organised a vaccination camp for them at the police lines and 500 have been jabbed,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/police-start-free-online-classes-for-recruitment-exam-aspirants/articleshow/84419085.cms||Payal Dhawan

They also requested the appointment of a new state president and leader of opposition (LoP), from those who have not served at these key positions earlier. Senior MLA and deputy LoP Shailesh Parmar, former MP Raju Parmar, former LoP and senior MLA C J Chavda and senior MLA Himmatsinh Patel visited Venugopal in Delhi. He assured them the process was under way and the All-India Congress Committee will soon appoint the state in-charge. The leaders sought an appointment with former party president Rahul Gandhi to apprise him of the political situation in the state. After the death of Rajiv Satav, there has been no appointment of the state in-charge and the Gujarat unit president had resigned after the loss in the civic elections. Congress spokesman Randeep Surjewala is reportedly being considered for the post of the Gujarat in-charge.

---||Meerut||Hindu artisans work to restore Meerut’s Shahi Jama Masjid||MEERUT: Vinod, Pappu and Dharamveer are working tirelessly day and night to finish the task they were assigned in 2019. These stone carvers from the stone city of Hindaun in Rajasthan, are trying to complete the task of craving detailed inscriptions and verses of the holy Quran on one of the main gates of the Shahi Jama Masjid, the oldest mosque in the city. With little understanding of what they are carving on the stone, the trio risks its health inhaling the dust and enduring the noise emitted by the stones to finish the task delayed by a year due to the outbreak of Covid. So far, these carvers have worked in over 40 mosques across India, including the Jama Masjid in Delhi. The three have also worked in Delhi’s Swaminarayan Akshardham temple and several Jain temples across the country. But 60% of their work is concentrated on Islamic structures. “We get more work in mosques as they still use the art of stone carving,” said Dharamveer, a fifth generation stone carver and probably the last as his children are not interested in pursuing the family profession. Pappu said he did not want his children to follow in his footsteps. “This dust is making us ill. Over 50 people in our village have died over the past 10 years due to silicosis caused by inhaling silica dust.” Once the task here is done, the trio proposes to move to Delhi to join others from Hindaun working there. The men from Hindaun are engaged in carving mosques in Nainital and Delhi currently. Bablu Chaurasia, the contractor at the site, lamented that the stone artists of Hindaun may be the last to work with their hands as machines are being used as substitutes everywhere. Meanwhile, the artisans are attracting students and visitors at the mosque who come to watch them handcraft inscriptions on stone at the Jama Masjid here. According to Ata-Ur-Rehman, a teacher at the mosque, the building is around 700 years old and was built in 1306 by Sultan Nasiruddin Shah. Hence the need for repairs. “The mosque management wants to preserve its history for which we were looking for people who could carve stones exactly the way it was done originally. The giant gates and domes have verses of the Quran and history of the mosque in Urdu inscribed on them. These artisans are doing the job with such dedication that it looks like they do it from the heart,” Rehman said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/hindu-artisans-work-to-restore-meeruts-shahi-jama-masjid/articleshow/84419069.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Delhi||Just 472 red zones in Delhi now, South East has none||NEW DELHI: The number of containment zones in the city has reduced from nearly 58,000 less than two months ago to 472 as of now. South East district is the first among Delhi’s 11 districts to have no containment zone. East district has only six, Central eight and North East 10. Currently, New Delhi district has the largest number of 176 containment zones, followed by North district that has 86 such areas. South district has 64 containment zones, West district 35, Shahdara 34, North West 30 and South West 23. Containment zones indicate where the virus is still active and needs to be stamped out. They are created to stop Covid-19 from spreading to other areas and infecting a larger population. Initially, red zones were huge and covered a large population, but later the strategy was changed and the authorities started creating micro-containment zones, which had smaller areas and comparatively fewer people. The number of containment zones witnessed a dramatic jump in the second half of April and reached 58,000 by mid-May. Between April 13 and May 13, on average 1,700 such zones were created every day. In April, there were only 6,852 containment zones, but within 30 days the number touched 57,550. This was also the period during which Delhi witnessed a phenomenal rise in the number of active Covid-19 cases. The authorities then sealed the hotspots in a bid to prevent the virus from spreading. Delhi reported 28,395 cases on April 20, the highest number of cases in a single day ever. From then, the cases started reducing slowly. The current number of containment zones is one of the lowest since the authorities started creating them towards the end of March 2020. All residents living within red zones are screened for Covid-19 symptoms and tested. Surveillance is also increased in such places. Apart from a focused testing strategy in the hotspots, enforcement action is also higher. A red zone is decontained after 14 days if no new cases are reported and the patients recover. An official said some districts were also creating containment zones even if one case was being reported. All districts have been asked to ensure that minimum 50% of active cases are located inside sealed areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/just-472-red-zones-in-delhi-now-south-east-has-none/articleshow/84424018.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Delhi||Lajpat traders seek support in Covid fight||New Delhi: Lajpat Nagar market has been witnessing less congestion since its reopening after the two-day closure due to Covid violations, prompting the traders’ associations to request the district administration to continue its support and provide enough civil defence volunteers to ensure better compliance. They also argue that the number of illegal hawkers and encroachments have come down drastically since authorities decided to act against them. “The action taken by the district magistrate’s team on July 4 came as a blessing in disguise for us. As a result of the closure, everybody became alert. Shopkeepers decided to discipline themselves fearing further sealing orders,” said Ashwani Marwah, general secretary of Traders’ Association Lajpat Nagar.“The civic bodies removed illegal hawkers and squatters, and encroachments restricting shops within legal permissible boundaries; stopped open kitchens on footpaths or pavements; and instructed eateries not to serve food in the open,” Marwah said. “Customers can now walk easily without brushing their shoulders, they are happy to wait outside a shop and wearing masks,” he added. The association claimed they had deployed additional manpower to sensitise visitors and planned to restrict the crowd after 7pm on weekends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lajpat-traders-seek-support-in-covid-fight/articleshow/84421534.cms||---

Trichy district administration organised vaccination camps at Kalaiarangam marriage hall and Jamal Mohammed College in Trichy city. Both the centres were given 750 doses of Covaxin each. Covaxin camps were held in three places in rural areas on July 8. As the news about the camp was out on Tuesday night, people who crossed the 30 days after the first dose of Covaxin formed queues early in the morning. Police personnel were deputed for crowd management. The rush for getting the jab led to altercations among those in the queue. A health department official said verbal quarrels among the people led to police action but the police managed to settle the problems without resort to any action. In the rural areas, camps were held at Alampattipudhur and Nachikurichi where 500 doses and 400 doses were available. The health department also allotted 200 doses to BHEL and each 150 doses to NIT and OFT. Deputy director of health services (DDHS), Trichy Dr S Ramganesh said the district had 4500 people in line to get the second dose of Covaxin. With this camp, over 3000 got the second doses. “The vaccine will be available to cover the rest of the people soon,” said DDHS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/residents-formed-long-queues-to-get-second-dose-of-covaxin/articleshow/84421531.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Only agriculture, labour departments saw increase in RTI complaints||AHMEDABAD: While there has been a decline in the number of complaints and appeals under the Right to Information (RTI) Act in most departments of the state government, only two departments registered an increase in the number of appeals and complaints in 2019-20 as compared to the previous year 2018-19. They are the agriculture and co-operation and the labour and employment departments. All other departments of the state government registered a dip in RTI complaints and appeals in the year 2019-20, a report of the Gujarat Information Commission (GIC), which was tabled in the state assembly earlier this year, said. Section 18 of the RTI act permits citizens to file complaints with the state information commission regarding information. Citizens can file appeals either in departments concerned or with the commission, under Section19 of the RTI act. The sharpest decline (52%) in RTI complaints and appeals was in the information and broadcasting department, official figures reveal. In 2019-20 there were 122 complaints as compared to 25 in the previous year. This was followed by a 48% dip in complaints in the ports and transport department and a 42% decline in complaints and appeals in the food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department. RTI activists say that in the first place, a decrease in appeals and complaints is not desirable at all. However, an increase of complaints in the labour and agriculture departments reflects the fact that common peoples’ problems are not being solved effectively. “There has been an increase in denial of information, which should ideally reflect in an addition of complaints and appeals in the commission. The agriculture and labour departments are directly connected with common people,” said Pankti Jog, executive secretary, Mahiti Adhikar Gujarat Pahel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/only-agriculture-labour-depts-saw-increase-in-rti-complaints/articleshow/84421554.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: VHP slams MVA for banning dindi, warns of statewide stir||NAGPUR: Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has planned statewide token protests targeting Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government over ban on annual dindi, which is over seven-century-old tradition, by Warkaris to the temple of town of Pandharpur in the name of Covid restrictions. The VHP and leaders of Warkari sect have termed the government stance as ‘anti-Hindu’ and have planned protest march against the MVA regime. They have demanded that being son of Hindutva proponent Balasaheb Thackeray, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray should tender an apology for the action taken against Warkaris this month. Thackeray should also take the moral responsibility for the wrongdoing and not come to Pandharpur for the official worship of Lord Vithoba at the hands of chief minister. Press conferences were held by VHP units across the state, including Nagpur, to announce protests that are slated to begin from July 17. The annual dindi starts from July 1, in which devotees carrying palanquins that have footprints of saints Tukaram and Gyaneshwar reach Pandharpur. The procession has been banned due to Covid. The VHP and Warkari sect leaders have alleged the government is pushing its anti-Hindu agenda by taking advantage of the pandemic. The leaders also hit out at the other alliance members of the MVA government. It has been alleged that Warkaris, who tried to go ahead with the dindi, were insulted by making them take off their traditional attire. Devotees, including senior leader Bandatya Karadkar, were arrested. “Why should religious procession be banned in Maharashtra alone if it’s happening elsewhere in the country? Did the Kumbh mela not happen in Uttar Pradesh. Events are also being held in Gujarat and Rajasthan with all precautions. We are ready to follow the protocol, but the state government is bent upon imposing the ban,” said Srirampant Joshi of the Warkari sect and a senior VHP functionary. “Does Covid not spread if liquor shops are open,” said Joshi when asked about the risk of infection due such a congregation and the flak that Delhi’s Markaz incident had drawn. “The protest march planned across the state will be of token nature. Warkaris in small numbers will be taking part in what I term as bhajan andolan. Singing devotional songs along the way, protesters will hand over a memorandum to respective district collectors,” said Sanat Gupta, joint secretary of VHP’s Vidarbha unit. The protests will be held in every taluka of the state and safety measures will be followed strictly, he said. The sect leaders said if the demands are still not met, then the agitation would be intensified. “We may forcibly open the temple,” said Joshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vhp-slams-mva-for-banning-dindi-warns-of-statewide-stir/articleshow/84421579.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Ludhiana||‘Arrest Bains’: Akalis protest outside Ashu’s office in Punjab, try to break barricades||LUDHIANA: High drama was witnessed outside the office of cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu on Wednesday, when leaders and workers of Shiromani Akali Dal gathered there to protest to seek arrest of Lok Insaaf Party MLA Simarjit Singh Bains, who has been booked in a rape case. The Akali leaders alleged that the Congress government has failed to take timely action against Bains, as earlier there was a delay in the registration of the case and now the cops were not arresting him. The protesters alleged that Ashu was saving Bains. Heavy police force was deployed around the residence and the office of the cabinet minister for controlling the protesters. The situation turned tense when agitators tried to break the barricades and the cops used force and resorted to cane charge to stop them from crossing the line. SAD leaders like Ranjit Dhillon, Manpreet Singh Manna and others tried to climb over the barricades. As they were being stopped, a few of them fell on the road. After the hour-long face-off between police and protestors, the Akali leaders courted arrest and started sitting in a police van. The situation took a comical turn when cops told them that the police van will not go anywhere as its tyres were flat. The Akali workers then stepped out and started leaving the spot. The cops remained there even after the protest got over. A fire tender and ambulances were stationed at the site to avoid any untoward incident. Senior Akali leaders Hira Singh Gabria and Maheshinder Singh Grewal said, “The woman had to approach the court for justice because police did not take action on her complaint despite many protests outside the police commissioner’s office. We will keep on waking up the government from its slumber for justice and arrest of the accused.” On behalf of Ashu, Congress councillor Mamta Ashu said, “The police were doing their work. The matter is in court and no one can give shelter to anybody. Moreover, SAD leader Harish Rai Dhandha had his own political interests in this case, so he was maligning the image of Ashu as well, but he will not succeed in his intentions.” Gabria feels uneasy During protest, senior SAD leader Hira Singh Gabria felt uneasy and cops had to take him away in their vehicle to Sarabha Nagar police station. As he was about to faint, cops helped him sit in the car. On learning about it, Congress councillor Mamta Ashu went to the police station to inquire about his health. Division among SAD supporters During protest, the SAD supporters looked a divided lot. Before the arrival of the senior leadership, the junior leaders had started raising slogans. Senior SAD leader Gabria and district president Ranjit Singh Dhillon, along with their supporters, were seen as one group, while other leaders came later. After an unwell Gabria was taken away, half of the workers left the protest site.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/arrest-bains-akalis-protest-outside-ashus-office-try-to-break-barricades/articleshow/84419127.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra to ask private schools to try to reduce fees by 15%||MUMBAI: The school education department will ask private schools in the state to try to reduce their fees by 15% fees, based on a Supreme Court directive from May 2021. The SC order in a fee-related matter from Rajasthan, where it had directed reduction of 15% fees in lieu of unutilised facilities, will be circulated to private schools. The department’s recommendation, however, will not be imposed. In a related development, the school education department’s draft ordinance, which will give powers to the state to regulate fees in private schools during a crisis situation such as the pandemic, was tabled in the state cabinet on Wednesday. However, a few senior ministers suggested reconsidering the draft and seeking legal opinion from the advocate general before issuing such an ordinance. The state plans to amend the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fees) Act through this draft ordinance. During the cabinet meeting, a few ministers raised questions about whether the ordinance will stand in the court of law in case private schools challenge it. Finally, CM Uddhav Thackeray, who was chairing the meeting, directed that a legal opinion from the advocate general be sought on the issue. He also asked the school education department to circulate a copy of the SC order directing private schools to reduce fees by 15%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-to-ask-pvt-schools-to-try-to-reduce-fees-by-15/articleshow/84424012.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Anil Deshmukh PA says didn’t collect money from Sachin Waze||MUMBAI: Former home minister Anil Deshmukh’s personal assistant Kundan Shinde and dismissed cop Sachin Waze differ on the Rs 4.7 crore tainted money that went into the account of the minister’s education trust. Shinde, during questioning by the Enforcement Directorate, reportedly denied collecting Rs 4.7 crore cash from now-dismissed API Waze, but Waze during his custodial interrogation countered it by providing key details to support his claim, sources said. The ED had recorded Waze’s statement a second time last Saturday and Sunday, confronting him about Shinde’s claim. Waze reportedly shared details of the location where he handed over the cash to Shinde and provided other details. Waze, in his earlier statement, told ED he gave the money to Shinde. The ED arrested Shinde and Deshmukh’s PS Sanjeev Palande recently. During questioning, Shinde reportedly denied collecting money from Waze, which prompted ED to confront Waze. Earlier, ED had recorded the statement of bar owners who said they had collected money between December 2020 to February 2021 from others too and contributed their share. They handed over Rs 4.7 crore to Waze. ED sources said the agency had evidence that support’s Waze’s claim. An officer said, “ED has evidence to connect the chain of the transaction. From the collection of Rs 4.7 crore to its diversion into Deshmukh’s Nagpur’s trust account as a donation.” Advocate Kamlesh Ghumre for Deshmukh said Waze had given a different statement in his affidavit before the commission, compared to the one recorded by the agencies. “In the affidavit, Waze doesn’t say anything about giving money to Deshmukh or his PA,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-deshmukh-pa-says-didnt-collect-money-from-waze/articleshow/84426065.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Delhi||Tragedy strikes at lightning speed, here’s how to stay safe||NEW DELHI: A few days ago on July 11, 41 were killed by lightning in Uttar Pradesh, with Allahabad reporting a toll of 16, and seven in Madhya Pradesh. The same day, 11 tourists lost their lives when lightning struck them at Amer Fort in Jaipur. Delhi was spared the tragedy, but experts say that Delhi-NCR and the Indo-Gangetic plains have atmospheric conditions in the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons that are ideal for severe thunderstorms during which lightning can strike at tall structures. For their safety, people should take cover in well-constructed buildings or even vehicles with hard roofs during such episodes. Earlier this year, lightning killed one and injured three at a residential township in Gurugram’s Sector 82. In CCTV footage, lightning can be seen striking a tree under which four men have taken shelter from the train. All four fall down almost instantly from the bolt. One died, the three others escaped death. Experts advise avoiding waterbodies, trees and electric poles and tall structures when there is thunder and lightning in monsoon season. If no shelter is available nearby, one should then sit in a crouched position to reduce the area of impact. “This can be done if lightning strikes are close and there is no place to hide,” said a Met official. “Only the sole should be touching the ground and that too not completely. This considerably increases chances of survival.” According to the National Crime Records Bureau data, there are 2,500 deaths every year in India caused by lightning and thunderstorm-related events. A report released by National Disaster Management Authority, ‘Thunderstorm and Lightning — Tackling Weather Hazards’, notes that from 1967 to 2012, lightning strikes accounted for 39% of the deaths resulting from natural disasters in India. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, loss of lives across the country due to lightning totalled, respectively, 2,833, 2,582 and 2,641. Based on the lightning strike frequencies, data plotted by Skymet Weather, a private forecasting agency, shows severe thunderstorms with lightning can occur all across the Indo-Gangetic belt, with parts of the Northeast, Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha prone to very severe thunderstorm and lightning activity. G P Sharma, meteorologist at Skymet Weather, said, “Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha and the Indo-Gangetic plains of north India, including Rajasthan and UP, are most vulnerable to fatal lightning strikes. Hilly areas both in the north and north-east are prone to this calamity too. Lightning, along with high velocity winds and heavy downpour, forms a deadly combination to reckon with. Sufficient precautions are the only safeguard to minimise damage.” Thunderstorms occur round the year in different parts of the country. However, their frequency and intensity are maximum in the summer months from March to June, according to meteorologists who point out that the key factors for their occurrence include the combination of intense heating of the atmosphere at the surface level and moisture availability. Navdeep Dahiya, founder of Live Weather of India, who tracks weather in northern India, said the local weather features were generally most active during the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons, leading to an increase in lightning-strike events. He said, “During the recent Jaipur lightning incident, the monsoon's axis and western arm was passing from southwest UP into central Rajasthan. Moisture-feeding easterly winds were active and a cyclonic circulation was induced over Rajasthan. Heatwave conditions had also been observed in the past few days, so heated air was also present. These meteorological features led to the formation of cumulonimbus clouds, which are towering vertical clouds that result in intense cloud-to-ground lightning strikes.” Watch Explained: How to stay safe when lightning strikes||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tragedy-strikes-at-lightning-speed-heres-how-to-stay-safe/articleshow/84421570.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Ludhiana||Punjab: Illegal colonies, water crisis, poor roadwork rock municipal corporation’s house meet||LUDHIANA: The issues of illegal colonies, water scarcity and shoddy roadwork dominated municipal corporation’s general house meeting at Guru Nanak Bhawan on Wednesday. As the councillors demanded immediate action, mayor Balkar Sandhu and MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal directed the officials to remove illegal colonies at the earliest. BJP councillor Sonia Sharma said, “I have been raising the issue of illegal colonies in the ward for the past two years. I had first lodged a complaint on September 19, 2019, but to date no action has been taken. Water supply in the ward got affected as load on the amenities increased.” Echoing her, Akali Dal councillor Jaspal Giaspura said, “Around 40 illegal colonies have mushroomed in wards 30 and 31, but building branch officials remained mum. There is one colony about which I have been complaining for the past two years. The officials did not act despite my submitting proofs. About 12 areas are worst affected by water scarcity in summer. I had also complained that the roads constructed recently in the ward were of poor quality and strict action should be taken against the erring officials and contractors.” Congress councillor Baljinder Singh said for the past about eight months, a road in his ward has been under construction. He demanded that the contractor should be blacklisted immediately. The mayor said in the coming days, development works worth Rs 250 crore to Rs 300 crore would start and all the councillors should act as watchdogs of MC and keep a check on quality of material. He said officials concerned have been asked to remove the illegal colonies immediately. The MC commissioner said, “Illegal construction work or unlawful colonies will not be tolerated and strict action against lax officers will be taken. I have asked the officials to ensure water supply where there is scarcity. However, illegal water supply connections in the colonies will be severed as soon as possible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/illegal-colonies-water-crisis-poor-roadwork-rock-mcs-house-meet/articleshow/84419164.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Scientists find green option to plastic||RAJKOT: Scientists have discovered an environment friendly option to plastic that’s used in packaging of food, cosmetics and other products. The bio-polymer developed by scientists at the Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (CIFT) was made from seaweed, which already has scientifically proven uses as nutrition-packed human food and industrial applications. In Rajkot alone, which has emerged as a hub of farsan (fried snacks) industry, nearly 40 tonnes of plastic waste is generated daily and the majority is that of namkeen wrappers. After four years of research, scientists at Veraval-based Central Institute of fisheries technology (CIFT) have developed a biodegradable plastic film extracted from seaweed. This film, they say, will be a game changer as a substitute for plastic used in food packaging. Veraval CIFT was given the project to find seaweed extract that could be a cheaper and biodegradable option for plastic. CIFT is set to handover the technology to industries for commercial production. “Biopolymers provide an excellent alternative to petroleum-derived polymers as they are environmentally friendly and naturally available. Not only it’s biodegradable but antimicrobial agents, anti-fungal compounds and nano silver particles that have anti-bacterial property can also be added do it, explained Ashish Kumar Jha, one of the scientists who worked on the project. Food companies like those making fried snacks use a multi-layer plastic which keeps the contents fresh. But once dumped, such plastic wreaks havoc with earth’s ecosystem as it takes hundreds of years to get destroyed. The key component for this was agar, which was extracted from seaweed. Agar is known for its excellent gel forming ability, bio-compatibility, thermo plasticity and therefore it was tested as an alternative to petroleum-based plastic packaging material. The silver nano particles reinforced with agar film has antibacterial function which can preserve the packaged food better with extended shelf life. Sources said there is a huge potential to make this bio-polymer along Gujarat’s long coastline. If scaled, it can generate employment too and create new business avenues for locals. This discovery was discussed at a webinar on ‘Secondary raw material: A new avenue in fisheries business’ organized by CIFT last week under Bharat ka Amrut Mahotsav, a central government initiative to commemorate 75 years of India’s independence. The importance of seaweed was also discussed along with other issues regarding fisheries industries in this programme attended by Junagadh MP Rajesh Chudasama and CIFT director CN Ravishankar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/scientists-find-green-option-to-plastic/articleshow/84419172.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Covid accelerates disease progression, says study||Mumbai: Doctors in JJ group of hospitals carried out 51 autopsies on Covid-19 victims to understand how the SARS2 virus affected various organs. The virus affected the kidneys of 24 victims, while 29 showed liver changes. “Our series of minimally invasive autopsies on Covid-19 patients is the largest in the world so far,” said the study’s main author, Dr Ajay Bhandarwar, head of JJ Hospital’s general surgery department. When Dr Bhandarwar, along with pathology head Dr Sanjay Bijwe and radiology head Dr Shilpa Domkundwar, started the study in August 2020, only doctors in Italy had carried out similar autopsies and announced that Covid-19 triggers clotting in blood vessels that leads to death. A few autopsies have been done in teaching hospitals in Bhopal, Ahmedabad and New Delhi (the Indian Council for Medical Research advises against open autopsies of Covid victims due to the higher risk). “The pathological involvement of multiple organs on microscopic analysis supports our finding that Covid-19 infection is a multi-organ process that involves the lung, kidneys, liver, heart and spleen, and may, in fact, produce pathological changes in other organ systems which were not examined within our study,” said Dr Bijwe. The team carried out the autopsies in St George’s Hospital, which was a Covid hospital, while the main JJ Hospital in Byculla was a non-Covid hospital. “Within two hours of a death occurring, we had to contact the victim’s family and seek permission for the autopsy,” said one of the authors, Dr Nikhil Dhimole. While the families of victims were initially hesitant, the fact that the body wouldn’t be cut open helped change the minds of 51 families. The autopsy was carried out in a side room of the Covid ward, with doctors from the radiology and surgery departments collecting tissues from various organs using biopsy needles under ultrasound guidance. More important, the study found Covid-19 accelerated disease progression. In four patients who were recently diagnosed with a kidney problem, their autopsies found the Covid-19 infection had worsened their kidney functions. Incidentally, when the study was being carried out between August and November 2020, 38 doctors from the general surgery department were affected by Covid-19. “There is no way to link the autopsies to our contracting the disease as we would work in Covid wards for long hours every day,” said a doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-covid-accelerates-disease-progression-says-study/articleshow/84424109.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Kolkata||Wait for second dose at Kolkata Municipal Corporation units get longer as daily pendency rises to 50,000||KOLKATA: Even as Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has received a portion of 4 lakh Covid vaccine doses from the state health department, the allocation is grossly inadequate for the civic body to clear the second dose backlog that continues to soar. The Covid vaccination clinics operated by KMC is facing a Herculean task with daily pendency for second dose going up by two-and-a-half times from 20,000-a-day a fortnight ago to 50,000 on Wednesday. To tackle the situation, the civic health department has decided to only offer second doses at 30 clinics where the due date for the second jab has already passed for over 500 people at each centre. Civic health department officials say the figure is set to get more skewed in the days ahead due to continued mismatch in demand and supply of vaccines across vaccine centres in the city. “We needed to administer the second jab to over 50,000 people on Wednesday but given the allocation, we were able to vaccinate around 11,000. Thus, the pendency of 39,000 will remain. A further 15,000-odd who are due to get the second dose on Thursday will get added to this. These people have all completed 84 days since taking the first vaccine shot,” a KMC health official explained. While the situation is still manageable now, officials say the pendency needs to be cleared before the numbers escalate. Around May, KMC had gradually increased the daily vaccination target from 10,000 a day to 15,000 and then 20,000. In June-end, it had administered the vaccine to 62,000 people on a single day, followed by 50,000 the following day. “We need the kind of allocation that was done in the latter half of June to wipe out the pendency. At the time, there were days when a clinic would receive 500-600 doses in a day. Now, that has been reduced to 100 doses at 30-odd CVCs where pendency is over 500 and 50 doses in CVCs where pendency is below 300,” an official said. Civic health officials posted at the CVCs say the situation is extremely embarrassing with senior citizens reaching the clinics only to learn there aren’t enough vaccines. “Since the supply isn’t enough, we are unable to even commit them to any date for the second dose. Quite justifiably, they are getting jittery since vaccination at private CVCs is also on the decline due to low stocks. The situation needs to be addressed quickly,” an official at a CVC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/wait-for-second-dose-at-kmc-units-get-longer-as-daily-pendency-rises-to-50000/articleshow/84421649.cms||Saikat Ray

With the hospital handling more than 1,000 patients few months back, oxygen supply was dependant on a private supplier. Minister for municipal administration K N Nehru and minister for school education Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi inaugurated the plant in the presence of Trichy collector S Sivarasu on Wednesday. Speaking to reporters after the inauguration, Nehru said that the oxygen plant, first to be established at this tertiary care hospital, could produce 350 litres of oxygen per minute. It was constructed at a cost of Rs 53 lakh from the municipal administration fund, said Nehru. Sources said that the hospital could produce oxygen to a larger extent with the establishment of the new plant. A senior doctor said that the hospital required nearly 8kl of oxygen per day when the hospital was handling more than 1,000 patients. With the new plant, the hospital can bring down the supply of oxygen from outside and can save up to Rs 35,000 per day. Sources said that the hospital had plans to set up two more oxygen plants in the capacity of 1,000 and 350 litres. The hospital also received modern medical equipment like narrow band imaging endoscopy, endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pacreatography (ERCP) and Fuji intelligent chromo endoscopy (FICE).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/mgmgh-turns-self-reliant-in-oxygen-gets-its-first-plant/articleshow/84421584.cms||---

Though light rain is expected on Thursday and Friday, the intensity of rain is likely to increase from July 17. There are chances of light rain along with a thunderstorm on July 17 and heavy rain is predicted in parts of the capital on July 18.” Wednesday was a fairly cool July day with a maximum temperature of 35 degrees Celsius and a minimum temperature of 26 degrees, one below the normal. The relative humidity oscillated between 100% and 60%. The weather meant that Delhi’s air continued to remain in the ‘satisfactory’ category with an overall Air Quality Index of 83. SAFAR, a forecasting body, said, “Surface winds are high and with the southwest monsoons advancing into Delhi, increased rainfall activity is likely to positively influence the AQI.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/heavy-spell-of-rain-in-some-parts-of-city/articleshow/84421612.cms||---
---||Delhi||Day 2 of monsoon: Heavy rain sparks chaos on Delhi roads||NEW DELHI: For the second day in a row, rainwater inundated roads in places like Pul Prahladpur, Gandhi Nagar, Bhairon Marg, Pragati Maidan, Azadpur and Vikas Marg on Wednesday. Traffic was also hit and the situation was reckoned to be worse than on Tuesday with major gridlocks in ITO, Dhaula Kuan, Vikas Marg, Najafgarh, Delhi Cantonment, Mehrauli, DND Flyway and Pul Prahladpur. The day’s events mocked the claims of PWD and the municipal corporations of 100% desilting of the stormwater drains. While these agencies spoke about how well the situation was handled on the first day of monsoon on Tuesday, they weren’t as enthusiastic on Wednesday. The only saving grace was Minto Bridge, which has become a symbol for civic negligence with the underpass there submerging vehicles even as big as buses every monsoon. On Wednesday, there was no water accumulation and, consequently no traffic jams, though vehicular movement was slow due to the rain. Delhi Traffic Police alerted commuters several times during the day on Twitter to avoid certain routes. “Waterlogging reported at Bhajanpura near Mazar (both carriageways). Kindly avoid the stretch,” read one tweet. Another read, “Traffic is affected from Azadpur towards Mukarba Chowk due to waterlogging at Azadpur underpass. Kindly avoid the stretch.” Yet another said, “Traffic is affected from Karkari Mor towards Shahdara (both carriageways) near Kanti Nagar bus stand under railway bridge due to waterlogging.” Rasna Kalra was stuck in traffic for more than two hours in Narela. “There were cars everywhere. Some people tried to reverse to go back and that created more problems,” said Kalra. “People were screaming at each other. My day, as you can see, started on a terrible note. How much can the traffic police do when there’s so much water on the roads?” Naresh Wasan kept taking diversions suggested by his GPS device, hoping to reach his workplace faster. But he was delayed by three hours. Waterlogging was common throughout Delhi. In east Delhi, rain-related complaints were mostly concentrated in the Shahdara north zone, including Yamuna Vihar, Dilshad Garden, Bhajanpura and Karawal Nagar. Waterlogging was also reported from Geeta Colony in Shahdara south. EDMC standing committee chairman Satyapal Singh alleged that desilting work hadn’t been carried out properly by PWD leading to waterlogging in the EDMC areas. “The first spell of rain has exposed PWD’s claims,” Singh said. B S Vohra, who heads the East Delhi RWA Joint Front, said that there was no respite from waterlogging in the past 30-40 years. “What was achieved under Master Plan Delhi 2021? Can we expect a better drainage system under MPD 2041?” he asked. “We are fed up with the blame game indulged in by the municipal corporation and PWD each rainy season.” While a tree fell in Pocket B1 of Dilshad Garden, four similar incidents were reported in south Delhi at Lado Sarai, Chittaranjan Park, Defence Colony and Janakpuri. SDMC received complaints of waterlogging from Malviya Nagar, Okhla and the WHO building in ITO. According to the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, pumps were deployed to clear water at Rang Mahal, Keshavpuram, Mubarakpur, Sanjay Enclave, Rajan Babu Road, Majlis Park and Mohan Park. The multiplicity of agencies overseeing Delhi’s drainage network has often been blamed for the annual urban flooding. The corporations manage the smaller drains in residential areas, while PWD carries out maintenance of drains along wider roads. Delhi government’s irrigation & flood control department, DDA and the Cantonment Board also have jurisdiction over other drainage networks. Recommendations made by Delhi Drainage Master Plan, among them separation of sewage and stormwater drains, independent certification of desilting work and redesigning of problematic drainage points, still remain unimplemented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/when-it-rains-it-pours-misery-on-city/articleshow/84421662.cms||Paras Singh

The bridge construction was allotted to a contractor in 2017. The Rs59-crore project was to be completed in 2019. With the work still not completed, the BMC has decided to appoint MMRDA. Opposition leader in the BMC, Ravi Raja, said the contractor has been paid Rs16 crore. Paying Rs51 crore to MMRDA will escalate costs.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||In crisis, these schools come to aid of staff||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Ever since the rise of online learning in the wake of Covid-19, the city schools have been in for a rough ride. Fearing economic crisis, many schools were forced to lay off their non-teaching staff including ayahs and drivers. But some private schools in the city are doing their bit to provide for their non-teaching staff. By raising funds from financial aids provided by banks, the schools ensure that the non-teaching staff continue drawing their salaries. “During the pandemic, we solely depend on the tuition fees of the students. Considering the financial crisis of the parents we give fee concessions too. We have to consider the efforts of our ayahs and drivers. Though their services couldn’t be utilised now, all these years they were working for the institution. So, with the fees and loans, we find a way to pay their salaries without any fail,” said an official at The School of the Good Shepherd in Akkulam. The school has a total of 70 employees as ayahs and drivers. The drivers were deployed to deliver books and other study materials to students. The ayahs were also called to schools for regular cleaning twice a week. Again, the school buses and drivers were used to transport them. The authorities are also planning to deliver library books to the students in near future. The principal a private school said her school succeeded in sustaining its 10 drivers and nine ayahs even after providing fee concessions and reducing the students’ fees by 30%. “As the school buses are not in a good condition, we will avail the service of drivers who have autorickshaws. Ayahs will come most of the days for cleaning,” she added. Jyothis Chandran, chairman of the Jyothis group of schools, said none of their ayahs and drivers had to struggle to make the ends meet, despite the massive cuts in students’ fees. Their services were used in sorting books and parcelling them to students. Food kits were provided for those who had contracted Covid-19. Binu, a driver at The School of the Good Shepherd for the last eight years, said he is happy that the school is taking care of them. “We know that the school is going through a difficult phase, still they haven’t laid off us. When our friends narrate the stories of pain and anxiety of losing their job, we feel relieved about receiving our salaries on time.” A school bus driver had committed suicide early this year after losing his job. Nirmala, an ayah at a private school for the last 23 years said she is thankful to the school as workers were not ditched by the management. “As we are provided with the salary, we could lead a decent living even during the pandemic time,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/in-crisis-these-schools-come-to-aid-of-staff/articleshow/84421630.cms||---

A majority of the complaints have been received from Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta and Alappuzha. Of the 1,333 complaints received from June 24 till July 13 this year, 187 are related to dowry cases and they are being taken up on a priority basis. “At least one-tenth of the cases are related to dowry issues. We are looking into these complaints on a priority basis and are assigning them to women police stations of the concerned district for necessary follow-up action. In districts with no women police stations, these are being handled by the district women’s cell,” Nishanthini said. The complaints are categorized into three — those relating to dowry, regarding family disputes and those pertaining to violence due to alcohol consumption. “We are holding a periodic review of the complaints and are ensuring that all complainants are contacted from the respective district within 24 hours of registering the complaint,” Nishanthini said. Their statements are being recorded and further action is being taken in coordination with other government organizations set up under the women and child development department, Kudumbashree, etc. Those seeking counselling are directed to the domestic conflict resolution centre, those who seek shelter are directed to the one-stop centre (under women and child development department) or Snehitha (under Kudumbashree) and those requiring legal help are directed to the district legal services authority. Government had appointed R Nishanthini as the state nodal officer for probing all complaints relating to dowry. In the wake of the death of a young woman in Kollam allegedly due to dowry issues, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had announced that from June 24, all such complaints will be probed by the nodal officer exclusively appointed for the task, and assisted by a woman sub-inspector. The complaints can be registered at 9497999955. Earlier, as per Kerala state women’s commission’s data, 1,096 dowry-related harassment cases have been registered with the commission alone since 2010, of which a majority of cases were from Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam districts. The data showed that seven southern districts — Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Idukki and Ernakulam — contributed 80% of the total cases registered by the commission (866 of 1,096 cases).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/nodal-officer-gets-over-1300-plaints-from-women-in-20-days/articleshow/84421741.cms||KP Saikiran

When the woman demanded her money back, the accused along with her two accomplices allegedly confined and thrashed her. The victim said the police did not lodge an FIR on her statement. The 22-year-old woman, requesting anonymity, said, “I wanted to get my sex reassignment surgery done. I came across a woman on a social networking site a couple of months ago who said she hailed from Himachal Pradesh and lived in Ludhiana. She claimed that she also got her sex changed and offered to help me.”  In the first week of July, the victim left her house without telling anyone. “I came to Ludhiana with Rs 2 lakh, which we had kept for the treatment of my ailing father. My online friend took me to her rented accommodation in Daba. I gave her Rs 2 lakh and asked her to fix an appointment for me. She told me to wait for a few days. One day, she asked me to go back to my hometown. I then realized I was cheated and sought my money back. She threw me out of her house.” The victim told her brother about it and he came to Ludhiana. “My brother talked to my online friend on phone and asked her to return the money. On Sunday, she called me to her house to take the sum. She asked me to come alone,” she added. “I went to her house and my brother waited at a distance. The accused woman and her two accomplices confined me in the house and thrashed me. She asked me to call up my brother and tell him that I wanted to live in Ludhiana and he should go back to UP. When she made me talk to my brother, I told him that they had confined me. My brother called the police and I was released from their custody,” she said. Her brother said, “The cops took my sister and the accused women to the police station. The accused woman revealed that they had purchased gold with the money and had only Rs 60,000 left. The police made them return Rs 60,000 and refused to lodge a complaint. My father was unwell and so I had to return with my sister. But I have asked my relative, who lives at Tibba Road, to pursue our complaint with the police.” Assistant commissioner of police (Industrial Area-B) Randhir Singh said, “The matter is in my notice. I have asked the complainants to meet me. The case will be investigated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/woman-cheated-on-pretext-of-sex-reassignment-surgery/articleshow/84419186.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Sentinel survey to fight Covid surge||KOLKATA: Fresh Covid-19 cases in Bengal have now trickled down to three-digit figure for 10 straight days. But the state government is keeping its ante up on the virus. The health department has launched sentinel surveillance to assess the Covid situation with the aim to zero down on the geographic spread of the virus, its intensity of transmission and severity of trends. For this purpose, 28 government hospitals have been chosen. A hospital will collect 400 samples each in the third week of a month from general patients apart from the ones coming with Covid symptoms and get these samples tested for Covid-19. In case a patient tests positive, there will be contract-tracing and identification of the locality to see if more asymptomatically infected patients are in that locality. “Currently, Covid is not that visible due to the decline in number. Random testing will give an assessment on what is going on actually. When Covid surge slows down, you might find one out of 100 testing positive against say 20 positives when the surge was up. The continuous sentinel surveillance will give you an indicator if the number is going up from one in 100. Even if the number of rising slowly, we can get a sense that the outbreak is picking up,” said IPGMER hepatology head Abhijit Chowdhury, a member state’s expert committee for countering the possible third wave. “This kind of epidemiological survey will be helpful in combat policy where an effort can be put to douse the flame before the fire gets too ferocious,” Chowdhury added. Four hundred samples from each of these 28 hospitals will be collected starting the third week of July and will be tested in attached labs. The cycle will go on every month. People who come for Covid-19 test are generally those with either symptoms or has had a close contact with a positive patient. But for this surveillance, samples will be collected only from patients who come for treatment of other ailment. “This will help trace the hidden/missing cases as many patients remain asymptomatic. Contract-tracing can further help identify particular zones to see if there are other asymptomatic patients in that zone. In such a case, containment and other preventive measures can go a long way on the face of the third wave,” said public health specialist Anirban Dalui, who is attached with Swsathya Bhawan. Senior physician Sukumar Mukherjee said that testing asymptomatic patients can give a more comprehensive clue on the actual burden of the infection. “Picking out such cases through the surveillance would be an effective way of containment while raising the much needed number of tests,” said Mukherjee, a member of Bengal’s Global Advisory Board on Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sentinel-survey-to-fight-covid-surge/articleshow/84421746.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Menacing monkey terrorizes Ratan Pol||AHMEDABAD: A monkey has been creating terror in the hearts of residents and commuters in Ratan Pol area over the past 10 days. The simian, which seems to be injured, has been attacking passers-by, but the forest department as well as zoo officials are having a tough time caging it.  The monkey has been creating havoc in areas around Roopam Cinema, Ashok Cinema, Mahkali Vadi, Nagori School, and Gheekanta. It also attacked a safai worker from behind. Hemraj Parmar was among the dozen-odd people that the monkey attacked. He said, “The residents marked the animal with red dye so that it is easily identifiable. Such is its terror that vendors in the area carry a stick to ensure that the monkey does not get close to them.” Despite this, the monkey managed to bite a vendor on Wednesday. The person was immediately rushed to Civil Hospital. A senior forest officer said that they identified and located the monkey. However, by the time a team reached the area, people gathered in large numbers, scaring the monkey away. Officials said, “The monkey is limping. Hence, it appears that it had been attacked by a human. This could be why it is attacking people. Once caged, it is likely to kept behind bars permanently.” The officials said that the zoo authorities have been put on alert as the monkey will have to be tranquillized. The officials said a cage has been kept in the area and people are on their toes. The monkey had been spotted on several occasions but has not been caught yet.  “It is not safe to use a tranquillizer in such a dense area. The teams returned late on Wednesday without success. Five teams will be deployed in the area on Thursday to ensure that the monkey is tranquillized as soon as possible,” says District forest officer Sakira Begum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/menacing-monkey-terrorizes-ratan-pol/articleshow/84421811.cms||---
---||Delhi||As Delhi's Kamla Nagar goes down under, shopkeepers worry about what next||NEW DELHI: Rainwater entered shops and damaged the goods stored inside at Kamla Nagar in north Delhi on Wednesday, leaving shop owners grumbling about the stormwater drains that had not been cleared and had caused the flooding. Worried about the situation in the coming days, the business owners later shifted their stocks to other places to avoid further losses. Nitin Gupta, president of Kamla Nagar Traders’ Association, said that similar waterlogging of the roads had taken place last year too, but the rain had not flowed into their shops. “The stormwater drains are connected with sewers at a number of places. This is why things are more problematic,” explained Gupta. “Most of the sewer lines are around 50 years old and as soon as the rains start, these drains cannot handle the water and start overflowing. The blocked drains, those which are not desilted properly, add to the nuisance. Drains in some parts of the area are under the North Delhi Municipal Corporation and others under PWD. We have written to the authorities, including Delhi Jal Board, to come out with concrete solutions for this problem, but to no avail.” Sumit Grover, a shop owner in Kamla Nagar market, claimed that the shops suffered unnecessary losses because their stocks got damaged due to water flowing in. “We were not prepared for this. We didn’t expect the water to enter the shops within an hour of raining,” said Grover. “Till late evening on Wednesday, we were busy moving our stocks to other places and cleaning the premises to rid them of the foul stench. I think it’s high time the authorities woke up and looked at proper solutions for the problem.” Area councillor Jogi Ram Jain said that waterlogging was a natural occurrence in Kamla Nagar Market because it was a low-lying area and run-off water flowed towards the market from the Ridge area. “Waterlogging happens every monsoon season also because of the overflowing of the old sewer lines,” added Jain. “We can install pumps, but then we have no big drain or a suitable place to pump the water to. We have desilted the drain and I have anyway asked my staff to be alert during the rainy months and initiate immediate precautionary measures whenever necessary.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-kamla-nagar-goes-down-under-shopkeepers-worry-about-what-next/articleshow/84421698.cms||Vibha Sharma

Vinayak Vispute, BMC’s assistant municipal commissioner of H-West Ward, told TOI they have already appointed security and workers to sweep the area around the lake. “Two security guards are present per shift. We also plan to appoint an agency to arrest the floating material in the lake,” said Vispute. Mushtaq Ansari, a citizen volunteer, said, “Last Sunday, we cleared 100kg of waste. However, there is a lot of cleaning to be done.” Corporator Asif Zakaria said maintainence of the lake has been long pending. Sanket Jalgaonkar, founder of a movement called Clean Sweeps which has a twitter handle --@sweepsclean said that they have been holding clean up drives at Bandra Talao since January this year. "Gaurav , another founder of our movement, along with me and our team of 20-30 volunteers have been gathering for almost 11 weeks every Sunday to clean the area around the lake. We have found everything from kitchen waste to alcohol bottles and have gathered at least 1,000 kgs of waste so far," said Jalgaonkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-to-take-over-bandra-talao-upkeep/articleshow/84421685.cms||Richa Pinto

The government has decided to set up a dry port (multimodal logistic park) in about 1,400 acres under Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode in the state. With the help of customs department, on the lines of integrated container depot (ICD) in Sanathnagar, two more ICDs would be set up in the state. Similarly, 10 integrated logistics parks would be developed like Bata Singaram logistic park developed by the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA). The cabinet led by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao decided to provide incentives to the industrialists who would invest in the food processing units and logistic parks. The cabinet felt the necessity for food processing units and logistic parks since agriculture production had improved with the irrigation facilities due to the policies of the state government. It has been decided to set up at least 10 food processing zones in about 500 to 1,000 acres each. The government wants to have food processing zones in about 10,000 acres by 2024-2025. The government is also planning to attract Rs 25,000 crore investments, which would create employment to 70,000 people directly and three lakh more people indirectly. For receiving applications for food processing zones, the period is from July 12 to 31. “The government will acquire land and create infrastructure facilities in the food processing zones. Those eligible will be allotted land in the zones,” KCR said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cabinet-approves-policies-to-promote-food-processing/articleshow/84424143.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Nagpur||For over five years, Maharashtra government sitting over Bor and Nagzira unified control plan||NAGPUR: Even as tigers are crying for space and better wildlife management in the areas surrounding the reserves, the state government is sitting over proposals to hand over administrative (unified) control of Bor and Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR) to the wildlife wing. Notifying the buffer zone around tiger reserves is mandatory under the Tiger Conservation Plan (TCP) after amendments to the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, on September 4, 2006. The 661 sqkm buffer zone of Bor and 1,241 sqkm of NNTR was notified in December 2015 and September 2016 respectively but even after 5-6 years, it has not been brought under the unified control of tiger reserves. Buffer zones of Melghat, Pench and Tadoba have been under the administrative control of the tiger reserve. The state’s new PCCF (wildlife) Sunil Limaye admits that unified control with wildlife is a cause for concern. “The proposal was submitted to the state government last June and we will expedite it,” he said. In 2019, Limaye as APCCF (wildlife-east) had promised to take over the buffer zone of Bor and NNTR in one month. Unified control aims at protection of tiger reserves and providing site-specific habitat inputs in the buffer zones for a viable population of tigers, co-predators and prey animals. According to the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), a minimum inviolate space of 800-1,000 sqkm should be maintained to support a viable population of tigers in the landscape. P Kalyan Kumar, CCF, Nagpur circle, which includes Nagpur, Wardha, Bhandara and Gondia divisions, where the area concerned with unified control falls, said, “The entire process about unified control is over and the proposal has been pending with the state. We had also finalized the issue of matching staff after the administrative control is given to tiger reserves.” “Technically speaking, it is true that as per NTCA directives, unified control should be implemented, but our staff is more or less playing the same role in the buffer zone like wildlife officials to resolve man-animal conflict and tiger monitoring. There are no differences. I had even gone a step ahead by suggesting conversion of the Wardha territorial division into wildlife division,” Kumar said. According to sources, one of the reasons for the delay in unified control was Covid-19 due to which offices worked with low strength. Even as there was no Covid in 2019, the file didn’t generate much interest when Sanjay Rathod was the forest minister. Secondly, in the last 1.5 years, three forest secretaries have changed hands and none showed interest in clearing the proposal. Even the forest department failed to push the proposal during that period. In NNTR, buffer wildlife management has been hit with encroachments on forest land, unchecked grazing, forest produce extraction and neglect of wildlife, which is succumbing to poaching and electrocution. “In the last three years at least a dozen gaurs have died in the Nagzira-Navegaon corridor area of Jambhli, Koylari, Dodke, Shenda and Shashikaran. As water sources are not available in the buffer in abundance, these gaurs are dying due to thirst,” says Sawan Bahekar of Sustaining Environment & Wildlife Assemblage (SEWA). Bahekar alleged dispersing animals from NNTR are forced to suffer while moving in buffer areas where there is no awareness among locals who still resort to electrocution to protect crops from wildlife. Large-scale logging operations in FDCM areas have also affected wildlife habitats. “Bor being the smallest tiger reserve in the country, bringing its 661 sqkm buffer area under unified control is urgent and important. This is good for the long-term survival of tigers too. The process to hand over the buffer area to wildlife officials should be expedited,” said Parag Dandge of Environmental Research & Conservation Society of India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/for-over-5-years-maha-govt-sitting-over-bor-and-nagzira-unified-control-plan/articleshow/84421781.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

State police chief Anil Kant launched the initiative at the police headquarters here, by launching the poster for the programme. He said that all district police chiefs have been asked to take immediate action on all petitions relating to atrocities against women, including domestic violence.  The police will also organize vehicle rallies and slogan contests in all districts in cooperation with socially-committed organizations. The police chief has also directed that all petitions regarding atrocities against women should be handled by the station house officer themselves, and should be processed in a time-bound manner. However, the initial response from the public to the police campaign on social media accounts of the police generally are against government officials. Some responded saying that all government officials should implement this in their lives to begin with before trying to educate the public, and some said that to begin with, it should be implemented within the police force. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-police-begins-anti-dowry-campaign/articleshow/84421795.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Ex-staffers claim machines worth Rs 50 crore, MAPL books show Rs 26,000, HAL seeks Rs 10 lakh insurance||NAGPUR: The case of missing medicine manufacturing heavy machinery from the plant of Maharashtra Antibiotics and Pharmaceuticals Limited (MAPL), Nagpur, is murkier than suspected by former employees. The book value of the machinery was Rs26,000 in balance sheet of MAPL whereas its parent company — Hindustan Antibiotics Limited (HAL) —had insured it for Rs60 lakh and sought insurance claim of Rs10 lakh. Former employees and a former director had claimed the machinery costs crores and its current value would be around Rs50 crore. TOI had reported on June 13 how heavy machinery had gone missing from the plant in suspicious manner. In the intervention plea filed by former employee and union leader Suresh Gotmare pleading for restarting of the plant for production of Covid-19 vaccine and Remdisivir, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on May 4 had directed the central and state governments to submit replies. On May 14, HAL, a Government of India undertaking, under whom this plant falls, had expressed its inability to restart the plant citing problem of skilled manpower and other issues. Guardian minister Nitin Raut had reportedly directed joint director of industries AP Dharmadhikari to inspect the plant and submit report whether it can be revived for producing vaccine and medicines related to novel coronavirus. On May 17, Dharmadhikari along with Gotmare and representative of former nominee director in MAPL — Environmental Engineering Inc (EEI) — Sudhir Paliwal visited and informed the court there was no machinery inside the plant. Gotmare and Paliwal claimed the machinery cost crores, and was worth at least Rs50 crore even now, as it could manufacture various medicines and dry powder injections. A HAL official told TOI, “Book value of fixed assets as per balance sheet was around Rs26,000. Theft of machinery took place in April 2016. As per FIR lodged in MIDC police station on April 14, 2016, the value of materials was indicated as Rs26,000.” The officials said there was insurance of Rs60 lakh on the plant and other infrastructure. “HAL had claimed loss of Rs10 lakh against the total insured sum of Rs60 lakh (for plant and other infrastructure) with National Insurance Co Ltd. We are yet to get any amount as we do not have documents from when the machinery was purchased,” the official said. The official said a security agency was appointed after closure of the plant. “MAPL, a subsidiary of HAL, was formed in 1979 and has been non-functional since 2003-04. The government had decided to close MAPL and accordingly all employees were given VRS in 2006. Security agency was to take care of the plant. After the theft, three letters were sent to Superintendent of Police, Nagpur, with copy to IG, Mumbai, to provide protection to the property of MAPL. A letter was also written to Sales Tax Department to take possession of MAPL office, plant and machinery. Third letter was sent to secretary of ministry of chemicals and fertilizers, pharmaceuticals department, requesting to look into protection of MAPL property,” the official said. Asked who was responsible for machinery going missing, and why no responsibility fixed on anyone, the official said registering FIR and claiming insurance was the proper action. “Also, HAL had asked superintendent of police to provide security to MAPL facilities as it is property of the central government,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ex-staffers-claim-machines-worth-rs50cr-mapl-books-show-rs26k-hal-seeks-rs10l-insurance/articleshow/84421784.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Even as the number of cases and positivity rate have dipped, Delhi government-run hospitals are preparing for a likely third wave with concepts like ‘ICU at hospital doorsteps’ to save as many lives as possible. The city’s biggest Covid facility, Delhi government-run LNJP Hospital, is working on a war footing to provide centralised oxygen supply to all Covid beds in the hospital, along with working on processes to ensure patients with severe symptoms get intensive care immediately. “Changes are being made and arrangements will be in place so that sick patients are immediately shifted to ICUs and those whose oxygen saturation level is above 90 are taken to other Covid wards. Protocols and guidelines are being made so that there is absolutely no room for confusion now,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of LNJP Hospital. While new protocols will ensure Covid-19 patients with severe symptoms are shifted from the emergency ward to ICUs swiftly, Delhi government’s Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital is bringing the ICU at its doorsteps. Dr BL Sherwal, medical director of the hospital, said that “a Covid emergency ward has been made at the hospital, which has oxygenated beds and life-saving equipment to provide treatment to serious patients right from the moment they are brought to the hospital, even as necessary formalities are taken care of simultaneously.” “The emergency ward that we have made has a provision that the ambulance can come inside. Now, treatment begins immediately and right at the door as soon as the patient gets down from the ambulance,” he said. “We have made an ICU there itself.” “Initially, patients faced some time lag between shifting and being provided oxygen. During the second wave, there were many problems and we are improving wherever there were issues,” the medical director said. “Apart from the triage system and ICU facilities, we will ensure that at least five beds are available at any point of time in the emergency ward. The emphasis will be on shifting patients who have arrived earlier to ward or ICU beds as soon as possible, to maintain the availability,” Dr Sherwal said. “We already have 500 separate ICU beds at Ramlila Ground for adults and are now creating 150 paediatric ICU beds, keeping in mind the third wave,” Dr Suresh Kumar said. “Also, while LNJP already has 2,000 beds for Covid-19 patients, 1,500 of these are oxygenated and work is now going on very fast to connect the rest of the 500 Covid beds to the central liquid medical oxygen supply through pipelines,” Dr Kumar said. “This will ensure all the 2,000 beds are connected to the pipeline and there will be no need for oxygen cylinders. Also, ventilators or BiPAP machines can work on these oxygenated beds,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/icu-at-hospital-doorstep-among-ideas-to-combat-3rd-covid-wave/articleshow/84424190.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The victim, Altaf Ansari (35), was sitting in a black car near the Pantaloons showroom in Hinoo when motorbike-borne men fired at him indiscriminately. Altaf was grievously injured after being hit by four bullets. The killers fled from the spot as people, hearing gunshots, ran for cover. Local people later rushed the victim to Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences but he died on the way. One of Altaf’s friends, Md Jilani, said that the victim had informed the local police about a threat to his life but the cops did not pay any heed. The police on Wednesday evening said the family of the victim is yet to file an FIR. While stating that time would be given as the relatives are in shock, the police said they have already launched an investigation and added that they would register the case if required. City superindent of police Saurav who visited the spot after the crime said, “The police will investigate all angles. The closed-circuit television cameras, the victim’s call record, movement of the criminals and witnesses are being examined. Prima facie the crime is related to a land dispute.” He added that cases were also registered against Altaf in different police stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/man-shot-dead-in-broad-daylight-on-busy-ranchi-road-over-land-row/articleshow/84421882.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Delhi||Delhi: How blood on fridge led cops to killers||NEW DELHI: The young couple that was arrested by Dwarka district cops for the gruesome murder of a 72-year-old woman had almost got away with it. After strangling the woman and hacking her body into three parts, the suspects, Tanu and Anil Arya, thoroughly cleaned the entire house multiple times to wipe away any signs of the crime. However, a few drops of the victim’s blood had splashed onto the fridge, which the couple failed to notice and eventually led police to them. The investigation, which TOI had reported on Wednesday, revealed that the elderly woman, Kavita, was murdered on June 30 and the couple disposed of the body parts on July 1 in Najafgarh drain. Confident that they had not left any trails, the couple stayed put in their house till July 3 to thwart any suspicion on them. When Kavita’s son and daughter-in-law returned from their hometown, they lodged a missing complaint on not finding her at home. This was when the accused couple left for their hometown. Initially, it was believed that Kavita may have gone somewhere, but after minutely checking the house police discovered the blood drops on the fridge. Though they became suspicious of a mishap, they could only file an FIR of abduction on July 6-7 in the absence of a body. Soon, police stumbled upon two leads. CCTV footage from an adjacent house showed the couple entering the house and exiting with trolley bags. When cops looked around for the couple, they found their house locked. They then became the prime suspects. Technical surveillance and inquiries ended in the couple being caught from their hometown. Police said they had recovered a part of the body and suspect that the rest either got dispersed with the flow of the water or may have been eaten by animals. On Wednesday, Tanu blamed her event manager husband for the crime and claimed innocence while talking to reporters. “I haven’t killed anyone. After killing Kavita, my husband tried to kill me and my daughter too. He has assaulted me several times. I kept quiet fearing for mine and my daughter’s life,” she claimed. However, police said they had ample evidence of her involvement in the murder. Cops said the couple owed Kavita Rs 1 lakh and were unable to return it due to financial crisis. Therefore, they planned to kill her. When her son and his wife were away, they went to her house on the pretext of returning the money and strangled her to death. They then hacked the body into pieces, packed it in bags and dumped them in Najafgarh drain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-blood-on-fridge-led-cops-to-killers/articleshow/84424278.cms||---

Therefore, we request senior counsel Chandrashekhar Kaptan to assist the court by submitting proposal in this regard,” said a division bench comprising Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Anil Kilor. The HC was hearing a plea (No 4549/2009) by lawyer Kirti Nipankar along with Govind Khekale and Sudhakar Bugdane from Buldhana, through counsel Anand Parchure, claiming that Lonar Lake was slowly degrading because of pollution and silting. Kaptan had submitted one such proposal in earlier hearings, but thereafter some suggestions were received from various stakeholders, which the HC said should be considered. “It’s necessary that a fresh proposal, after all the suggestions of the stakeholders are duly considered, is submitted to this court. We expect that the same would be done on or before the next date of hearing,” the bench said before adjourning the matter till July 28. In the last hearing, the court had observed that the lake’s pathetic condition has arisen mainly due to callous indifference of many authorities responsible in their own way for its conservation and preservation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/form-panel-for-lonar-lakes-devp-hc/articleshow/84421866.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Coimbatore||Covid-19: Residents in containment zones dismayed by continuing ordeal in Coimbatore||COIMBATORE: The district recorded 270 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, taking the total number of cases to 2,25,889. With 414 people getting discharged, the number of active cases was at 3,629. The total number of people cured went up to 2,20,144, taking the recovery rate to 97.4%. The district however recorded eight deaths, the highest count in a week, taking the toll to 2,116. Though daily fresh cases have reduced drastically to 5% of the peak and positivity rate to less than 3%, the health department is continuing to follow all Covid-19 prevention protocol, including earmarking containment zones. At present, the district has 94 containment zones. Of them, 44 are spread across rural areas, including 10 in Sulur, nine in Karamadai, and six in Thudiyalur. Residents in containment zones feel frustrated despite flattening of Covid curve and lifting of lockdown restrictions. People in the containment zones keep testing positive within the 14-day period, thereby calling for further extension of the quarantine period. For instant, some residents of Serene Retirement home community at Idigarai are upset as they have been placed in containment zone since July 1 after a third person in their community tested positive. However, while the gated community was under containment zone, another couple tested positive on July 5 and 6. On Tuesday, which is their 13th day in containment, two more people tested positive, taking the total number of residents infected from June-end to seven. “The containment will not be lifted until July 27, which is the end of 14-day since last two positive results. And if someone else tests positive within the next 14 days, will it again be extended, how long is this to go on for?” one of the residents Gopalakrishnan said. As they are in containment zones, some people are unable to visit doctors to check their blood sugar levels. “My wife needs to visit the doctor at least once a month. Our doctor opened his clinic only in June-end, but since we have been in containment from July 1, we have not visited him since May,” another resident said. “If the containment zone measure is not working to eliminate fresh cases, shouldn’t the health department identify the source of infections and control it instead of just locking us up,” asked another resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/residents-in-containment-zones-dismayed-by-continuing-ordeal/articleshow/84421888.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Fundraising surges in healthcare, allied sectors||AHMEDABAD: With the Covid-19 pandemic turning the focus on healthcare, several companies in the sector are now raising funds to meet the growing need for innovative therapies, diagnostics, and healthcare services. Initial public offerings (IPOs) and private equity (PE) are the preferred means for raising funds in the healthcare and allied sectors. Gujarat-based companies such as Aashka Hospitals Limited and Ami Organics Limited have set the ball rolling to launch their IPOs. Veeda Clinical Research, too, is mulling an IPO, said sources. Aashka, which operates a 200-bed multispecialty hospital in Gandhinagar, is gearing up to raise Rs 101 crore through an SME (small and medium enterprise) IPO by the end of this month. Aashka Hospitals will be listed on the BSE’s SME Exchange. Big cities have many tertiary care hospitals, but such hospitals are not adequate in tier-II and tier-III towns. “We aim to bridge this gap by reaching out to small towns with the best healthcare services,” said Bipin Shah, chairman and managing director, Aashka Hospitals. “As part of our capital-light growth model, we are coming up with 20-50 bed hospitals in small towns of Gujarat by merging local hospitals with Aashka Hospitals,” Shah said. “This will enable patients to avail of the state-of-the-art healthcare services in or near their hometowns without the hassles of travelling to big cities for quality treatment.” Shah has envisaged 1,000-bed capacity through mergers with 35 hospitals over the next two years. According to Shah, doctors will also be relieved of day-to-day administration and focus only on treatment as the end-to-end management will be completely taken care of by Aashka Hospitals. Ahmedabad-headquartered Veeda Clinical Research is also mulling an IPO, said people aware of the matter. The full-service clinical research organization (CRO) last month raised $16 million (approximately Rs 118 crore) from the private equity fund Sabre Partners and other investors. Surat’s specialty chemicals maker Ami Organics Limited has filed its papers with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for an IPO. The company manufactures pharma intermediates for regulated and generic active pharmaceutical ingredients and new chemical entities. Healthcare and allied sector companies in other states are also increasingly raising funds from the primary market. Companies from other states such as Glenmark Lifesciences Limited, Windlas Biotech Limited, Krsnaa Diagnostics, Supriya Lifesciences Ltd, and Vijaya Diagnostic Centre Limited have filed papers with SEBI for their IPOs. Companies such as Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences have already raised funds through an IPO. “Healthcare is a sunrise sector and poised to grow significantly over the next decade. Apart from the IPOs, a lot of private equity deals are being struck in the sector,” said Viranchi Shah, national senior vice-president, Indian Drug Manufacturers Association (IDMA). This can be seen from the fact that Ahmedabad-headquartered pharma firm La Renon Healthcare in January this year reportedly raised around $30 million (about Rs 220 crore) from a venture capital firm A91 Partners. In April, ChrysCapital acquired 27% stake in the city-based Corona Remedies Private Limited for an undisclosed sum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fundraising-surges-in-healthcare-allied-sectors/articleshow/84421919.cms||Kalpesh Damor

Sandalwood stolen from city is sent to Gujarat and Rajasthan where there is high demand for it. According to insiders, thieves from a specific community which is mostly into illegal activities, are known to have skills in identifying sandalwood trees and chopping them in no time. Wearing ‘commando’ like attire, they conduct a recce in the daytime and strike in the night between 1.30am and 4am. Last year, around 10 members of this gang were nabbed and around 60kg-70kg stolen sandalwood was recovered after cops detected four such cases. The then asstistant sub-inspector Vinod Tiwari posted at Sadar police station had busted the gang. Sandalwood trees had been stolen in the past too from Maharajbagh, Gorewada, Seminary Hills, divisional commissioner’s office and other places. While the gang boldly cut the tree from Hasan’s bungalow, which is at a stone’s throw from the Sadar police station, last year similar theft had taken place at the official residence of DIG, Naxal range, in Civil Lines. In the latest case, the gang likely entered through the rear side of the bungalow having a nullah flowing adjacent it to. The wall is being repaired. After cutting the tree, the thieves chop it into smaller pieces and take it secret godowns on Katol-Sawargaon road. From there, the wood is loaded into containers and taken to Gujarat, and Ajmer and Kota in Rajasthan. According to a cop who had visited one such godowns last year, these places are heavily guarded with entries allowed only with a password. It’s learnt, the sandalwood is generally used in attar (scent) factories in Rajasthan from where the ‘dust’ is diverted to agarbatti or dhoop factories. In Gujarat too, the sandalwood has demand in attar and agarbatti factories. Sources also stated that some of the sandalwood pieces also are also on online markets. According to insiders, the thieves earn from around Rs3,000 to even as high as Rs50,000 per kg depending on the quality. Senior inspector Arun Vakal of Sadar police station said his team has come across a potential clue and is likely to zero in upon the gang soon. “We are working on some information. Soon, we may apprehend the gang,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/stolen-sandalwood-from-city-in-high-demand-in-gujarat-rajasthan/articleshow/84421875.cms||Soumitra Bose

Surendran was summoned following reports that the complainant in the case, Dharmarajan, had contacted him several times in relation to this case. But, Surendran alleged that BJP had no links with the money that was looted and claimed that this was a politically-motivated investigation. “Police are enacting these dramas to appease their political masters. Investigation is going in a strange direction. Investigators are tracking and questioning people based on the call list of the complainant, whereas they are not chasing those in the contact list of the accused who had looted the money,” he alleged. Talking to reporters after questioning, Surendran said police were undecided on the clarification they wanted from him. “BJP has no connection with the case though the government is trying to fabricate a link. The intention is to malign the party. I have been saying this right from the beginning. Let police establish that the money that was looted was meant for BJP, we have no objection. We are sure police will not be able to establish such a link,” he added. But, the report submitted by police in Irinjalakuda court, said that Dharmarajan had disclosed that the looted money belonged to BJP. Police had made elaborate arrangements in the city to avert protests by BJP workers when Surendran appeared for questioning. Several leaders, party men had assembled near the police club where Surendran was questioned for around 90 minutes. On April 3, money that was transported in a car allegedly for election work of the party was looted at Kodakara. Goons intercepted the car by faking an accident. SIT, led by Thrissur DIG A Akbar had questioned Surendran’s secretary Dipin and his driver Ledheesh on June 5. The team also questioned several BJP leaders including state organizing secretary M Ganesh, state office secretary Girish, Alappuzha treasurer KG Kartha, Thrissur unit president Advocate KK Aneeshkumar and central region secretary L Padmakumar. SIT arrested 20 accused in the looting case. The initial complaint was that only Rs 25 lakh was looted from the car. Later Dharmarajan, who claimed that he had sent the money, admitted that Rs 3.5 crore was looted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sit-questions-surendran-in-highway-heist-case/articleshow/84421957.cms||T Ramavarman

The Saravanampatti police said Chellaiya used to quarrel with his 28-year-old wife Uma Devi, a mother of two children, for talking to her friends over phone for long hours. “He had asked her to stop the excessive use of mobile phone several times, but she refused to listen to him. So, the couple used to fight over the issue often,” said a police officer. “On Tuesday evening, the officer said, Chellaiya saw his wife speaking to her friends over phone when he returned from work and fought with her. On Wednesday morning too, they picked up a quarrel and in the heat of the moment he strangulated her with her sari,” the officer said. Hearing the commotion, neighbours rushed to the house and alerted the Saravanampatti police, who recovered and sent the body to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) for postmortem. During inquiry, Chellaiya confessed to the crime and said he had suspected his wife’s fidelity. “As she was always speaking over phone, he thought she was having an extra-marital affair,” the officer said. Police have booked Chellaiya under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code and produced him before a judicial magistrate, who remanded him in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/man-strangles-wife-to-death-suspecting-her-fidelity/articleshow/84421935.cms||---

While finalising his name, a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Vinay Joshi said he has impeccable reputation and very good credentials. “We’re of the view that instead of entrusting the responsibility to numerous persons, especially in an institution like Anjuman which runs several institutions, requiring an administrator of discipline and pointed focus with vast experience in the field of law, administration and educational matters, it would be appropriate that we choose Justice Haq to conduct the affairs,” the bench stated. The HC was hearing two petitions filed by Anjuman Hami-E-Islam Hifazat-Ul-Tanzeen president Altaf Ahmed and Hasan Ahmed Mirza through counsels Vikram Marpakwar and AB Mirza. One intervention was also filed by lawyer Raheel Mirza. According to petitioners, the trust runs institutions from nursery schools to colleges offering postgraduate and engineering courses in various parts of the city, but those are either in possession of strangers or under illegal occupation. It was brought under the control to some extent with an appointment of an administrator earlier, they said. The bench listed the cases for urgent hearing after earlier administrator BA Sheikh, former principal district and sessions judge, expressed inability to continue with the job. His counsel Ashutosh Dharmadhikari informed that due to his advanced age, he’s now finding it difficult to look after extremely challenging task of running the trust affairs and its institutions which are quite in sizeable number. While accepting Sheikh’s statement, the judges discharged him from the responsibility stating that they understand his difficulty. “Administrator’s appointment to conduct trust’s affairs is essential as the issue of holding of managing committee elections is still sub-judiced. Till it was resolved and adjudged upon through judicial determination, there would have to be a responsible person acting as an administrator.” Conferring the authority on justice Haq to seek consultation/advice from experts in the field of education, academics, law and administration, the bench said his appointment would bring in order, discipline, and desired efficacy in overall administration of trust and its institutions. “The lawyers from both sides are unanimous in his appointment. Accordingly, we appoint him for running trust’s affairs and for taking appropriate decisions necessary and incidental to conduct of administration. He shall be paid honorarium of Rs1 lakh/month by the trust,” the HC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-appoints-justice-haq-as-anjuman-trust-administrator/articleshow/84421996.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

However, fatalities in the state reported a dip — 170 against 196 on Tuesday. The state saw nearly a 20% rise in detections while in the city, the jump was 36% over Tuesday. Maharashtra reported 8,602 cases against 7,243 cases on Tuesday, taking the caseload to 61.8 lakh and fatalities to 1,26,390. The daily detections in Mumbai rose to 619 on Wednesday compared to 454 the day before. BMC officials said this was possibly because more tests (35,968) were done. With the daily positivity below 2% (1.6% as per Wednesday’s update), they said there is no cause for worry. Further, the number of critical patients in Mumbai dropped below 700 (657). Daily deaths in the city, which rose above 20 two weeks ago, are back in the range of 10. The city’s tally is 7.3 lakh cases and 15,654 deaths.

The struggling textile industry, which had seen exports stagnate for the past four years, has now begun seeing good marketing opportunities for post-Covid and this move would make pricing of Indian apparels competitive in the global market, the associations said. The Union cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, recently approved RoSCTL with the same rates on exports of apparel and garments till March 31, 2024. The move critically reduces price of Indian products in the global market, because manufacturers don’t have to add the cost of state and central taxes on it. Sima chairman Ashwin Chandran said that the industry could not stick to their earlier commitments and complete orders without the rebate benefit for the past couple of months. “This announcement has now given textile and garment exporters confidence and provided a level-playing field to help them increase exports and create new jobs for several lakhs of people,” he said. AEPC chairman A Sakthivel said the scheme will go a long way in bringing back positive sentiments and help the Indian textile value chain attain $100 billion annual exports in next three years. “The scheme will help generate lakhs of new employment, particularly for the vulnerable sections including semi-skilled, rural youth, migrants and women in the MSME segment. It will also help in achieving the envisioned goal of Aatmanirbhar Bharat. RoSCTL scheme will make Indian textile and apparel industry more competitive in the global market,” he added. Sima also welcomed the cabinet committee’s decision to cover all remaining textile products in the value chain in the remission of duties and taxes on export products (RoDTEP) scheme, further improving global competitiveness of yarns and fabrics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/textile-sector-hails-extension-of-rosctl-scheme/articleshow/84421904.cms||---

Police said the advocate, Arun Sharma, had lied to the staff of the hospital where he had rushed the victim, Swikar Luthra, stating that two men shot him inside a park near the courts complex. Footage from CCTV cameras located outside the lawyer’s chamber showed the four men removing Luthra’s body, cleaning up the crime scene and hiding the weapon. Luthra was arrested in 2016 for running a counterfeit coin racket. He was out on bail and had come to meet Sharma around 9pm along with his friend Pradeep. Later, he called Darshan, an auto driver involved in cases of theft, to the chamber. Sharma’s driver Rohit was also sitting in the chamber and all five of them were drinking. Some of them had criminal antecedents. DCP (Dwarka) Santosh Meena said, “Late on Tuesday, Pradeep, who was absconding since the incident, was also nabbed. All four of them, including Sharma, Rohit and Darshan, have been arrested. The pistol used in the crime, which the accused claim belonged to the deceased, was seized from the lawyer’s chamber. A case of murder has been registered.” An investigation revealed that Sharma and the others had signed on the medico-legal case report. It came to the fore that Pradeep got into an argument with Luthra and during the ensuing scuffle took his weapon and shot him. A bullet hit Luthra in his spine and he collapsed. After cleaning up the crime scene, the accused took Luthra to the hospital and cooked up a story to tell police. In the meanwhile, Pradeep fled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lawyer-3-others-held-for-shooting-man-in-chamber/articleshow/84424320.cms||---

The accused was identified as G Murasoli of Singanallur, who was working as a wireman in PWD’s electrical division. Murasoli had joined the department as a temporary electrical helper on daily wage in 1996 and had submitted Class X certificate and diploma certificate in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. In 2012, when the state government regularized the workers who had worked for more than 10 years, Murasoli was appointed as wireman grade II in Coimbatore division. In January 2018, when the department sought applications for promotion, Murasoli applied for it. “His educational certificates were sent to the directorate of technical education for verification. As the roll number did not match with the documents, the directorate sought the original certificate and transfer certificate in October 2020 and found that the certificates were forged,” a police officer said. Subsequently, the department sought explanation from Murasoli. As he did not respond, disciplinary action was initiated against him and he was suspended on November 24, 2020. Police have booked a case under sections 465 (forgery), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating) and 471 (fraudulently using documents) of IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/pwd-staffer-booked-for-certificate-forgery/articleshow/84421914.cms||---

The BJP has energetic youth and experienced seniors in the right mix, which was the perfect recipe for emerging as the biggest party in the state soon, Annamalai told reporters in Coimbatore, from where he began a two-day road journey to Chennai, where he would take charge as the state party president on July 16. He said the state BJP was planning to chart the growth path in the state and that he would elaborate on his plans after taking charge on Friday. The former police officer said the BJP was giving responsibilities to both senior leaders as well as youth, whereas in some parties only family members were given postings. Stating that he considered the posting as a responsibility, Annamalai said he considered himself a servant and not as the president of the state unit. In Tirupur, where a large number of party cadres gathered to receive him, Annamalai said there was a time when the BJP wanted Tamil Nadu. “But now the state needed the saffron party. We can no longer wait. We have to capture power soon.” He said the BJP was the only party with a strong ideology, which is intertwined with patriotism. The DMK’s governance was miserable, he said, accusing the ruling party functionaries of cornering Covid vaccines meant for the public and blaming the Centre for shortage. Accusing the DMK of peddling lies against the BJP and the Centre’s policies, including the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test, he said the saffron party would transform Tamil Nadu into a better state. He said people of Tamil Nadu had considerable respect for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Tirupur, in particular, had benefited a lot from the Centre’s schemes. “We should take the ideology and Prime Minister’s good initiatives to every doorstep,” he urged the party cadres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/bjp-will-emerge-as-biggest-party-in-state-soon-says-annamalai/articleshow/84421955.cms||---
---||Kochi||Educationists flag SSLC liberal marking system||KOCHI: Even as the state recorded the highest ever pass percentage in SSLC examination, experts raised concerns about the evaluation system and called the liberal marking system a dangerous trend. Educationists and officials of CBSE schools in the state said that such a high pass percentage and huge number of students securing A+ grade in all subjects raise doubts whether students were given the marks they did not deserve. They said that it might affect the quality of students who would find it tough to meet the challenges when they join for higher education. Moreover, the high pass percentage contradicts reports of ineffectiveness of online education in the last one year and raises a question whether offline classes are needed anymore. Educationist PK Ravindran said that giving marks to students in a liberal way is fine during the pandemic but the authorities should not give them undeserving marks by diluting the evaluation criteria. “Giving undeserving marks to students will make them think that they have those strong academic abilities which they don’t really have. The parents too will be overconfident about their children’s academic quality, which will be dangerous in future,” he said. Ravindran also said if online education can result in such a high result, it questions the relevance of schools and teachers. Ibrahim Khan, president of Kerala CBSE Schools Management Association, said that the trend of liberal marking system in state schools will affect the standard of general education and the assessment of the quality of the students. “If an undeserving student secures A+ grade in all subjects, he will not be able to know his strength and weakness in learning and it would affect him in higher studies,” Khan said. K A Francis, general secretary, Confederation of Sahodaya Complexes, said that the latest results showed the dilution in assessing the quality of students. “If students think they will get high marks without much effort, they will lose the seriousness in studies. Moreover, such a liberal marking system will increase the disparity between the marks of SSLC students and other-stream students,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/educationists-flag-sslc-liberal-marking-system/articleshow/84422037.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

The court clarified that there was no provision in law to direct the investigating officer to provide copies of the chargesheet in the language known to the accused. The court said that Lakdawala could take assistance from the Legal Services Authority in this regard. Lakdawala said that since he was accustomed to English, he was unable to read the document writte nin Marathi. The case dates back to 1996. A murder case was registered against Lakdawala and extradited gangster Chhota Rajan. They absconded. After Rajan was brought back to India, the CBI took over more than 70 of his cases and submitted supplementary chargesheets. While the older police chargesheet was in Marathi, the CBI submitted its document in English. The prosecution opposed Lakdawala’s plea, submitting that he had spent a majority of his life in the city and there was nothing to show he did not understand Marathi. It also contended that the application was an attempt to create nuisance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lakdawala-wont-get-english-chargesheet/articleshow/84426271.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu: Oarsmen seek nod to resume coracle rides in Hogenakkal||DHARMAPURI: Oarsmen in Hogenakkal on Wednesday urged the district administration to grant permission to resume coracles rides on river Cauvery. The rides were closed for tourists in March 2020, following the outbreak of Covid-19. The district administration also banned tourists from visiting Hogenakkal due to the lockdown. One of the oarsmen V Sigamani said, “Tourists usually visit Hogenakkal to enjoy the beauty of the Cauvery, mainly at the ‘five’ falls area.” He said that he and other oarsmen could not earn a living due to the lockdown. Even after the first wave, we could not resume the rides due to heavy water flow between September and December, he added. The plight of hoteliers and lodge owners was akin to the oarsmen. “While the government granted permission to open lodges and shops across the state after the second wave, a few tourist spots, including Hogenakkal, remain closed,” said G Viswanathan, a lodge owner. “The lodge owners and spa centre owners will be happy if the state government allowed tourists to visit Hogenakkal.” They requested the district administration and state government to allow them to resume their operations, considering the plight of their families.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/oarsmen-seek-nod-to-resume-coracle-rides-in-hogenakkal/articleshow/84421978.cms||---

She was found to have a massive rupture of the heart muscle in her left ventricle, which is a rare complication of heart attack. While the usual procedure to close big holes is an open heart surgery, the hospital didn’t go for it. Instead, it used a 40mm atrial septal defect (ASD) device to close the hole. While using devices to close holes in upper chambers of the heart is common, using a 40mm device is rare. “The giant left ventricular pseudoaneurysm is known to have an extremely high death rate. But in this patient, the rupture was contained with the blood outside the heart held together by its thin membrane,” said a statement from the hospital. Since the hole was large, the patient was advised urgent open heart surgery, but she had complications like uncontrolled sugar, obesity and poor coronary vessels. Moreover, she was unwilling to undergo a major surgical procedure. The hospital’s structural heart team finally decided to attempt to close the rupture using a button-like device. However, this was a big rupture and such large devices were used in this clinical situation previously. “The procedure was extremely complex since the hole was very large and the tissue being soft and dying out, there was difficulty in holding the device. So, we used an extra-large atrial septal defect device, and it sealed the rupture completely,” said, Dr Thomas Alexander, a team member. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the third day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/hospital-brings-elderly-woman-with-giant-hole-in-heart-back-to-life/articleshow/84421963.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Customs man under suspicion allegedly faked Covid report||AHMEDABAD: The city crime branch and Ahmedabad customs officers, inquiring into the burglary of estimated 7kg cargo suspected to be gold from the Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex (AACC), say that the suspect customs officer had allegedly faked a Covid-19 positive report and admitted himself to a private hospital in a bid to evade arrest. The concerned consignment from Dubai was declared as ‘automobile parts’. Customs officials said they had received an intelligence input that gold was smuggled in the consignment. Upon checking, the cargo was found to be 7 kg lighter. Further probe revealed that the missing cargo suspected to be gold was stolen by a customs officer. Following this, the AACC moved an application before the city crime branch on May 14 to undertake further investigation. “The suspect, an official working with the Ahmedabad customs, had identified the parcel believed to be containing gold. In April 2021, he offered bribe worth Rs 10,000 in cash to a custodian for helping him steal the precious cargo” said a crime branch officer. “Upon the suspect’s instructions, the custodian is believed to have removed cargo suspected to be gold from the consignment containing automobile parts and hid it at another location in AACC.,” the officer further explained. Sources confirmed that as the incident came to light in May, following which Ahmedabad customs launched an internal inquiry into the issue and the suspected official was identified. However, by then, the suspect had admitted himself at a private hospital by furnishing an allegedly fake Covid-19 report. “We learnt that the suspect was admitted at the hospital for about 15 days for which he paid around Rs 5 lakh. Once he got discharged from the hospital in May, he fled and is not traceable,” said a police officer. It is learnt that Ahmedabad customs had summoned the accused official thrice; however, he has not yet presented himself citing health concerns. Sources said that his driver and custodian were summoned and questioned about the incident. “The suspect’s driver told us that he saw something ‘yellow’ but he was unsure whether it was gold. When questioned further, he said it was some hard object. We suspect the drive evaded our questions,” said a source privy to the development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/customs-man-under-suspicion-allegedly-faked-covid-report/articleshow/84421960.cms||Ashish Chauhan

DDHS collects data of daily vaccination from NMC for city limits and ZP for rural, and releases numbers for the district. NMC and ZP are executing agencies administering doses and uploading data on Co-Win application. The PHD takes data from Co-Win application and also releases the data in public every day. Despite DDHS, NMC and ZP being executing agencies, the figure of administered doses to the people is lower with these agencies as compared to PHD. There is a huge difference in all categories. As per DDHS, 65,066 healthcare workers (HCW) took first dose whereas it is 67,626 as per PHD. When it comes to frontline workers, 1,18,540 had taken the first dose as per DDHS whereas the number is 1,34,314 as per PHD. Similarly, data of DDHS says 2,97,318 people from 18-44 year age group had taken first dose whereas the number was 3,75,922 as per DDHS. Also, 8,29,816 people from 45-plus age group have taken first dose as per DDHS, whereas the number is 8,99,531 as per PHD. Thus, there is a huge difference in number of beneficiaries.

---||Delhi||Delhi Police busts fake call centre, 7 women among 19 held||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has busted a fake call centre and arrested 19 employees, including seven women, who used to call US citizens impersonating as officials from the ministry of finance, USA and dupe them on pretext of providing free grants to them. The accused have so far duped US citizens of at least Rs 1.2 crore. A total of 22 computers, 21 mobile phones, six routers and three switches were seized following the raid. According to the police, the forgery came to fore when information was received by an email reporting that an illegal call centre is being run from Malviya Nagar in south Delhi. Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Thakur said this information was further developed and his teams zeroed in on the identified premises that was a basement at P-4, Malviya Nagar from where the call centre was being operated. “A raid was then conducted at the address and 19 persons, including seven women, were found engaged in calling the customers in the USA impersonating as officials from the ministry of finance department, USA. The callers used to dupe foreigners on the pretext of providing them free grants. It was found they were cheating innocent people based in the USA by using Vicidial through cloud servers, then talking to the customers on the pretext of providing them free grants if the customer pays a fee of US $ 100 and US $ 200 or they induced the customer to provide the same amount through gift cards of Google Pay or any other wallet,” Thakur said. He said, a total of 22 computer systems were installed in the premises out of which 15 systems were being used by the callers. On checking the seized computer systems, Vicidial calling software and scripts were found open on their screens, the officer added. “They were contacting the victims through an automated computer system to dial the phone numbers one by one in sequential order from the list of phone numbers uploaded in a cloud-based server, to start and induce the customers in the name of providing free grants after paying a basic fee. These calls were automatically being transferred to the caller who was free to attend at that time. On average, three innocent USA citizens were being duped every day and approximately 50,000 -75,000 INR was being cheated from them,” the DCP said. The police have found that the call centre was being run since January 2021. The accused were paying a monthly rent of Rs 36,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fake-call-centre-busted-7-women-among-19-held/articleshow/84424360.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Court commissioner to check AC parts in consumer case||AHMEDABAD: A consumer court has ordered for appointment of a court commissioner, who will visit a household in Memnagar to check parts of an air conditioner, after a complaint that a motor was missing from the AC when it was installed earlier this year. In March, complainant Sandeep Parikh first approached the Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, Ahmedabad (rural) saying that he had an old AC at his home replaced with a new Daikin Air Conditioner model in January this year. He paid Rs 30,000 for the AC and Rs 2,500 towards installation charges. But when switched on, there was no cooling effect. On inspection, the dealer’s representative found out that there was no motor inside the indoor unit of the air conditioner. Parikh complained that his problem was not resolved for more than two months, and sought the district commission’s intervention. He later requested the commission to direct the dealer and the company to remove the AC from his home and to carry out a panchnama of every part of the AC. The district commission did not accept the demands saying that since the notice was not served on the dealer and the company, there was no question of granting interim relief, which was in form of final relief. Parikh filed a revision petition in the Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission in May and reiterated his demand for inspection of AC parts and for its removal. It was due to the defective instrument, his family suffered during the summer. After hearing, the state commission said that it was a misconception on part of the district commission not to accede to his demand. Interim relief can be granted at the time of filing of the complaint if circumstances warranted. It ordered the district commission to appoint a court commissioner for preparing panchnma of every part installed in the AC within one month. The expense should be borne by Parikh. It also said that if the dealer and the company desire to remove the AC, they can do it and give receipt to the court commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-commissioner-to-check-ac-parts-in-consumer-case/articleshow/84422042.cms||---

Two months after his death and constant approach by his kin succeeded in getting his death acknowledged as Covid death on July 8. Shubham’s is not an isolated case, there are several people like him who are waiting for death certificates of their kin certified as Covid deaths. His case also brings to fore the allegations of social activists and political outfits about underreporting of figures during the peak of Covid-19 second wave. On July 12, a total of 1,478 such death cases were added in the state’s Covid-19 death tally by the government. Official sources said that of these 762 deaths took place at private hospitals and 208 people died in home isolation and 508 died in different districts. “My father used to run a food stall and our family was dependent on it. He got sick, was admitted to a hospital on April 23 and died on April 24. He tested Covid positive. He was admitted to a Covid-19 ward and his body was not handed over to us and cremation was performed as per Covid protocol. We had seen his positive test reports too, but Covid-19 as cause of death was nowhere mentioned in the death certificate issued on April 29,” Subham Lakhera, 23, son of deceased Bhupendra, a resident of Begumganj in Raisen district told TOI. “We approached officials urged them to mention cause of death on the death certificate. And it was finally on July 8 that a fresh death certificate was issued which mentions Covid-19 as cause of death”, he added. TOI has copy of both the death certificates issued for the same person. In the second certificate, there is mention of the SRF Id, which is a unique id number given to the samples taken for Covid-19 RTPCR tests. Had not the chief minister announced a compensation of Rs 1 lakh to kin of those who died by Covid, these 1,478 death cases would have remained buried; it is for the same reason that people are now approaching officials, said sources. Still there are several others who have lost their kin due to Covid-19 but their death certificates do not mention it, added sources. One such case is of Golu Sharma of Sehore district. “My brother Tushar Sharma, 34, died on March 31 at a private hospital in Bhopal, 23 days later my mother Aruna Sharma, 50, died at district hospital Sehore. Both tested positive for Covid-19 and we had seen their reports. Brother’s body was cremated as per protocol by the state government at Bhadbhada in Bhopal and mother’s cremation was also done at district head-quarters in Sehore under Covid-19 protocol. But death certificates of both had no mention of Covid-19 as cause of death.” “I approached the officials but to no avail, it has not been rectified till now,” Golu Sharma said. There were several such reports during the second wave peak, wherein crematoriums reported far more cremations of Covid-19 patients than the official death figures. In Bhopal alone, more than 4,000 cremations were performed under Covid-19 protocol during April and May months, say unofficial sources while the administration reported only around 250 deaths, said sources. When contacted over the issue, health minister Dr Prabhuram Chowdhary said, “During the peak of second wave it was panic all throughout. Firstly, patients from other districts were admitted to nearby districts where beds were available. In case of deaths, reporting from one district to the other became a problem. Similarly, several people died in home isolation whose records were not updated and thirdly some patients died at private hospitals whose records could not be updated. It is for this reason that we sought data from the districts and after scrutiny and reconciliation updated the official records.” “If some other cases are left out, they too would be considered,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/after-2-months-kin-get-fresh-cert-mentioning-covid-as-death-cause/articleshow/84421999.cms||Amarjeet Singh

---||Nagpur||Around 150 schools to reopen for Std VIII to XII students in Chanda||CHANDRAPUR: Students in around 150 schools at gram panchayat level will return to school as physical classes for Std VIII to XII resume from Thursday, as per new directives of state government to reopen schools in Covid-free areas. More schools in Covid-free villages are likely to reopen gradually in coming days, said district education officer (secondary) Ullhas Narad. As per officials statistics, there are 425 zilla parishad schools in gram panchayat areas. Out of these, 296 schools are eligible to reopen as per the criterion there should not be any Covid positive patient found in their gram panchayat areas since a month or more. With education department taking the lead, necessary formalities of instituting gram panchayat committee and discussion on protocol and regulations for reopening schools were carried out as per the standard operation procedure (SOP) given by government. Narad informed that mandatory preparations like sanitization of school premises, RT-PCR tests of teachers and staff, and ensuring their priority vaccination, arranging rotation of students on alternate days, seeking consent of gram panchayat etc have been accomplished in around 150 schools in the district. They will formally reopen from Thursday. “More proposals for reopening of schools are under process and they are likely to reopen gradually in coming days. All these schools will strictly follow the guidelines given by school education and sports department while operating physical classes in the schools,” he said. Narad informed that even as schools are reopening secondary and higher secondary classes from Thursday, zilla parishad teachers are taking efforts to teach students at their doorsteps under ‘Shikshak Aplya Dari’ (teacher at your doorstep) project since last week of june. He claimed that students are sitting at home since more than a year following the pandemic. This has physical and psychological impact on them, and is also likely to increase the number of dropouts. “Hence, I had given a call to our ZP teachers to reach out to students to fill the gap in their studies. Teachers responded positively to the call and are holding cluster classes by gathering few students at one of their houses, temples or community halls,” he said. Teachers have also provided books and study material to the students to prompt them to continue their studies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/around-150-schools-to-reopen-for-std-viii-to-xii-students-in-chanda/articleshow/84422054.cms||Mazhar Ali

A week ago, NCP chief Sharad Pawar had declined to comment on Patole’s “going solo” remarks, saying he would respond “only to statements made by Congress president Sonia Gandhi.” Patole is scheduled to address a party workers’ rally at Baramati, Pawar’s hometown, on July 29. Patole said in view of the NCP’s unilateral decision to terminate the alliance in 2014, the Congress had to pay a heavy price as it was not prepared to contest the 2014 elections independently. On his Baramati rally, Patole said he was not challenging Pawar but was going to visit that place on the demands of party workers. “Congress workers are insisting on a rally in Baramati, and I have accepted the invitation. It will be an interaction with our workers,” Patole said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-patole-says-ncp-betrayed-cong-in-2014/articleshow/84426321.cms||---

On Wednesday, the residents lodged a complaint with deputy commissioner of Ludhiana as well as chief secretary of Punjab government and other senior officials regarding the same and alleged that municipal corporation (MC) officers are turning blind eye to this problem. Rohit Anand, resident of the area, said, “Cases of illegal and non-compoundable change of land use in blatant violation of all regulations and bylaws from purely residential to commercial are mushrooming in Model Town. Our area from house number 10 to house number 40 is purely residential area. But due to the turning of blind eye by MC officials, in our locality alone there are multiple cases of illegal change of land use from residential to commercial. In latest case, owner of a house in our locality has illegally converted his residential property into commercial and has started repairing cars in his property.” Anand also added, “This is in clear violation of law as the change of land use of the residential properties of Model Town, except the couple of roads approved by MC Ludhiana for commercial activity, is strictly prohibited according to bylaws of Punjab Municipal Corporation Act, 1976 and according to the master plan of Ludhiana, which came into force in 2008.” According to Raj Kamal, another resident of the area,”People of our area are suffering hugely due to the apathy of the authorities. Already, a couple of residential properties have been converted to large-scale office-cum-godown, where commercial vehicles and heavy vehicles conduct loading and unloading of goods during day time and even at odd hours. This is not only resulting in noise pollution and air pollution, but also posing hazard to safety of area residents. The lackadaisical attitude of officials concerned of MC Ludhiana towards illegal change of land use from residential to commercial is taking away our mental peace and comfort.” Another area resident, on condition of anonymity, said “Due to illegal commercialisation of properties in our area, the traffic in the inside lanes has increased manifold. Moreover, the people who conduct work of car accessories encroach upon road and execute their work on road due to which there are traffic jams and danger of accident. Littering is another big problem. Also, from morning to evening, encroachments on roadside have became a usual affair, as vehicles of people visiting the commercial places remain parked on road sides. The illegal conversion of residential property to commercial, including godown, is against the rights of residents guaranteed to them by Indian Constitution as Right to Life. It is our request to the deputy commissioner to get these properties sealed immediately.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/model-town-residents-allege-of-illegal-commercialisation-of-residential-properties/articleshow/84419554.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Delhi||Delhi cops, intel agency bust espionage racket||NEW DELHI: In a joint operation with an intelligence agency, Delhi Police’s Crime Branch is learnt to have busted an espionage racket and apprehended a suspect from Rajasthan’s Pokhran. The suspect has been identified as Habib Khan (34) from Bikaner. A couple of Indian Army personnel, including one based in Agra, may have shared classified information with Khan and are being investigated under the Official Secrets Act, a source said. Khan is suspected to have passed on information related to a sensitive operation, he added. Khan was acting as an intermediary in a big network for receiving confidential documents and coordinates from an Army personnel. He supplied them to his handler in Pakistan’s ISI and also made arrangements for payment to the information provider. The military intelligence started tracking him four months ago after stumbling upon suspicious electronic communications and money transactions. According to police, Khan had been working as a vegetable supplier for the base, including Indira Kitchen, on contract for the past two-three years and had access to many areas. The cops from the interstate cell of Crime Branch have conducted raids at multiple places in Jaisalmer, Agra and Pokhran. Khan accompanied them during these raids. The cops will share details about the operation on Thursday, a senior officer said. Khan also masqueraded as a social worker and activist in Rajasthan.

Children should be taken care of and coolers in the households should be removed immediately,” she said. Later, while interacting with the media for the first time after taking over the charge, the collector said she would take strict action against touts indulging in black marketing of stamp papers. She also appealed to the citizens to lodge complaints in such cases. Vimala added that a proposal to appoint 200 nurses in various government hospitals was pending with the government. It was drafted and sent to the government by her predecessor Ravindra Thakare, she said. Speaking on Covid-19 third wave, Vimala said her administration is fully prepared to tackle it and had set up two paediatric wards at GMCH and IGGMCH. “Beds would be made available for the children over two years of age at both the places. For those below this age, we’re trying to get ventilators. We’re also trying to vaccinate the children. However, it’s up to the people to prevent this third wave by strictly following Covid-appropriate behaviour like compulsorily wearing mask when out of home and following distancing.” Earlier, the collector convened a meeting of the district task force regarding implementation of various schemes. Directing her subordinates to pay Rs100 each for Asha workers, she urged them to visit door-to-door to collect information to find out if anyone is suffering from illnesses etc. “Ask the people to drain the stagnant water in the house and maintain cleanliness. Parents and caregivers need to inculcate appropriate behaviour related to diarrhoea as well as Covid prevention and management. Care should be taken to maximize the use of ORS and zinc for children suffering from diarrhoea. Careful management of paediatric diarrhoea should be ensured at the social and health institution level,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/observe-dry-day-once-a-week-to-defeat-dengue-collector/articleshow/84422172.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Bhopal||Back to school, with mixed feelings||BHOPAL: Absence of vaccination for children is a major concern for parents after the government announced reopening of schools for class 10 and 12 students. Parents said that there is no clarity as to how students’ safety would be ensured in the absence of vaccination. Schools, on the other hand, claimed that they have taken measures like ‘no vaccination, no salary’ for their staff to ensure 100% safety on school campus. After CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced that the schools will be reopened for class 11 and 12 in a phased manner, concerns for students’ vaccination have also been raised. Parents said that they also want to see the schools reopening but vaccination of their wards is their prime concern. “School campuses need to reopen. But there is no clarity as to how the authorities or the schools will ensure the safety of our children when there is no vaccination available for them,” said Ashok Sharma, a parent. He said that vaccination should be brought at the earliest. Parents also demanded that the state government should make it mandatory in the SOPs to have vaccination for students. “There is a lot of talk about vaccination being made available for people below 18 years of age also. I think the state government should wait till that time instead of making any decision in haste. Let the students also vaccinate and then open the classes for them,” said Anuradha Tripathi, mother of a student. Schools said that they have done all preparations for vaccinating their staff completely. “We have launched the policy ‘no vaccination, no salary’ for the staff. Even in my school 100% vaccination of the first dose and 90% vaccination of the second dose has been completed. Schools will make campuses 100% vaccinated,” said vice president, Madhya Pradesh Association of Un- aided Private Schools, Vinny Raj Modi. He said that schools are also ensuring that students’ parents would also be vaccinated. “Several schools have made it mandatory for the parents to be vaccinated before sending their kids. Even several camps were also organised,” said Modi. About students’ vaccination, Modi said, “As there is no vaccination available for students nothing could be done. However, schools will make it mandatory for students to be vaccinated once it is launched. We will cooperate with both parents and the district administration as students’ safety is our priority.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/how-can-kids-be-safe-without-vax-parents-will-ensure-safety-of-each-student-schools/articleshow/84422080.cms||Ramendra Singh

The Olympic fanfare is set to begin on July 23. But while no Goan athlete is among the 126 Indians who have qualified for Tokyo 2020, the state will ensure that everyone takes note of the biggest sporting spectacle on earth. “We need to create better awareness about the Olympics,” said Union minister of state for ports and GOA president Shripad Naik. “Besides the sporting activities in north and south (Goa), we plan to felicitate five sportspersons in each discipline. Officials who have served Goan sports will also get the recognition they deserve.” The awareness events will commence on July 23 and end on August 8 to coincide with the opening and closing ceremonies in Tokyo. In Margao, the events will culminate on August 1. “Our plan is to screen all Olympic events at Panaji (KTC bus stand) and Margao (Agakhan municipal park) from 5pm to 7pm,” said GOA secretary Gurudutta Bhakta. In north Goa, the events planned includes cycle rallies, mini marathons (including one at Ponda), tennis ball cricket match at Indoor Stadium, Mapusa, and Olympic quiz for higher secondary and college students. In south Goa, there is an Olympic quiz besides cycle rally in collaboration with Cycling Association and Xaxti Riders. Meanwhile, Goa State Tennis Association secretary Rajendra Godinho has been nominated by GOA as the state representative for the Tokyo Olympics. “Godinho will study in detail all the facilities, infrastructure, transport arrangements and provide the SAG and GOA with a report,” said Sports Authority of Goa executive director VM Prabhu Desai. “Efforts are on to bring the Tokyo Olympics to India in the future and if that happens, Goa will host one or two disciplines. The report will be important.” The Olympic awareness events, the organisers said, were also an attempt to get sports started again after the Covid-19 pandemic brought everything to a halt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/need-to-create-better-awareness-in-goa-about-olympics-says-ios-president-shripad-naik/articleshow/84454645.cms||---
---||Kochi||Customs summons Thillankery on Monday||Kochi: Customs’ headquarters preventive unit, probing Karipur gold smuggling case, has summoned the accused in Shuhaib murder case, Akash Thillankery, for questioning at its Kochi office on Monday. On Wednesday, the agency had searched his house in Kannur and is learnt to have recovered some documents. Sources said he was summoned based on the information collected from other accused, including Ajmal VK from Panur who was arrested recently. Customs said Thillankery had links with Arjun Ayanki, another accused in the case. Recently, Thillankery had courted controversy through his comments on Facebook (FB) where he had stated that ‘he can’t accept being tagged a traitor overnight and he will be forced to respond publicly, if those who spread lies against him don’t correct themselves’. He had, in his responses to comments, replied that he can’t cosy up to certain leaders of youth organizations who deliberately try to tag him as a person who betrayed the party (CPM). After TV channels flashed his comments as a challenge to CPM, Thillankery claimed on FB that his statements were twisted by the media. Meanwhile, Ajmal was produced in court and remanded in judicial custody. In the remand application, customs stated that Ajmal, posing as Muhammad, connected the carrier with a person in Dubai, named Saleem, who arranged 2.3kg of gold that was later seized by customs at the airport on June 21. “Verification of the mobile number, which reflected in the WhatsApp chats, and on verification of call details of Shafeeque the number of the said Muhammad was registered in the name of Sakeena VK, from Kannur. Sakeena was then summoned and her statement was recorded on July 12. Sakeena deposed that though the number was registered in her name, it was being used by Ajmal, her son. Ajmal VK, was then summoned on July 12 and his statement was recorded on July 13,” customs said in the report. The agency claimed that Ajmal had warned Shafeeque about the probable threat to his life if he collaborated with Ayanki. Ajmal also asked Shafeeque to ‘withdraw from the smuggling conspiracy’. The agency did not seek his custody as Ajmal was cooperative with the investigation team and revealed names of others involved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/customs-summons-thillankery-on-monday/articleshow/84422227.cms||---

These salt pan lands were in our possession for over three centuries,” claimed Alim Bhaiji (53), a Bhaiji family litigant in Uran. “The problem started with a government land acquisition notification issued in 1973 for Cidco’s Navi Mumbai. The land parcels were illegally taken over on ‘Nil award’, ‘No Right’ basis,” he added. Bhaiji told TOI that some of the salt pan lands in Uran were illegally given on rent to private and public sector oil storage tank companies. “The Supreme Court judgments of 2002 and 2016 as well as high court and lower court orders in our favour have not been acted upon by the revenue department officials, who fear they will be exposed,” Bhaiji added. A power of attorney holder of Khan Bahadur Hormasji Maneckji Bhiwandiwala (KBHMB)-Mumbai, alleged: “Large tracts of salt pan lands of our trust have been illegally grabbed by builders in connivance with government officials. Neither the 12.5% nor 22.5% land compensation was awarded to us for the acquisition. Every time we approach the court, the authorities do not act to resolve the issue under the influence of the builders’ lobby. Some family members of trustees even illegally obtained 12.5% land compensation by producing fake documents claiming ownership.” Sir Mohammed Yusuf trust-Mumbai trustees were unavailable for comment. A Tungekar family member and Jama Masjid trust-Uran trustees did not respond to calls and text messages, while Sarvodaya trust-Uran could not be contacted. Uran tehsildar Bhausaheb Andhare said; “The salt land ownership issues are complex and various litigations are on. Some of the individual members have been given land records. The claimants should approach us with documents and court orders whatsoever with them.” Dr Vivek Vartak, a scientist at Panvel’s Kharland Research Centre, a government agency which conducts research on salt pan land in the Konkan region, said: “The land issues are being dealt with by the revenue department and if there are mangroves on it then it’s the forest department. We are only into research.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-salt-pan-land-ownership-issues-complex-says-uran-tehsildar/articleshow/84426423.cms||Umesh K Parida

---||Meerut||Haridwar closed for kanwar yatra, Uttar Pradesh looks at new routes||MEERUT: The tiny town of Garh Mukteshwar in Hapur district, about 119km from Delhi, is likely to host lakhs of kanwar pilgrims if the UP government comes good on its promise to allow the yatra. With Haridwar out of bounds after the Uttarakhand administration called off the pilgrimage for this year citing threat from the pandemic, Garh Mukteshwar is slowly emerging as an alternative destination for the Shiva devotees. The UP government, which had earlier requested Uttarakhand to let the pilgrims pass en route for Haridwar, from where they collect water from the Ganga, has sked all those participating in the yatra to carry a Covid-19 negative certificate. The yatra is likely to begin from July 25 unless there is a change of plans. Apart from UP, kanwariyas from Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and even Himachal take part in the yatra. The administration, after mulling several alternatives, has zeroed in on the ancient Garh Mukteshwar town which hosts pilgrims throughout the year but not on a large scale. The Ganga river and NH-24 criss-cross the town. Divisional commissioner of Meerut, Surender Singh, said, “We are ready for the yatra and have already started preparations for the security and overall management. Now that Uttarakhand has cancelled it, we have to find another destination from where kanwar pilgrims can fetch Ganga water. For instance, devotees in eastern UP bring the holy water from Prayagraj and Varanasi. In the western region, one such site could be Garh Mukteshwar in Hapur. But our options are open and we are working in this direction.” District magistrate of Hapur, Anuj Singh, said that the administration will be able to hold the kanwar yatra in the town as the numbers will be less this time due to the Covid-19 situation. “The possibility of using Garh Mukteshwar ghats for the kanwar pilgrimage is being explored as religious fairs take place throughout the year here. One to two lakh pilgrims routinely visit the town during various melas. It is right that kanwar yatra is a big event, but due to the pandemic we don’t expect large gatherings," the DM said. Asked about the steps which will be taken to ensure that pilgrims follow pandemic protocols, especially in the face of a looming third wave, commissioner Singh said, “The health department will have a major role to play in this. Directions have been given to strictly observe Covid-19 protocols. They will put up help desks on the kanwar route and at temples. These desks will be equipped with sanitizers, masks, thermal screening facility and Covid-19 testing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/haridwar-closed-for-kanwar-yatra-up-looks-at-new-routes-destinations/articleshow/84419604.cms||Sandeep Rai

Earlier, also the checking drives were being carried out, but it could not yield results. However, mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu said in the house on Wednesday if councillors do not interfere in the work of officials, there will be results. The civic officials will carry out the awareness drive first and then will start taking action against violators. The councillors claimed that plastic was main cause of sewerage choking and environment pollution so it should be stopped. The house also gave nod to the notification of one-time plastic use ban. The mayor said it is a great nuisance and they need to act but the councillors will have to support him and nobody should try to stop the officials from conducting drive or taking action against the violators. Apart from this, various other issues were taken up in the MC house meeting. The meeting remained peaceful throughout. All party meeting for cancelling of Tata contract In the meeting, the councillors complained that Tata company was not working properly and additional streetlights points were not being allotted to them. The mayor has now decided to call an all party meeting to discuss this issue. Pilot project of road construction with plastic and waste Congress councillor from ward number 94 Gurpreet Gopi asked mayor Sandhu to get roads constructed by using plastic and waste material and one such road was constructed by mandi board a few years ago near Khanna and road does not break till date. The mayor asked the officials concerned to prepare one pilot project from councillor Gopi’s ward and construct one road and if it proved successful they will implement the same in entire city. Tussle between mayor and SAD councillor A tussle took place between mayor Sandhu and leader of opposition and senior Akali Dal councillor Harbhajan Dang even before the start of house meeting. When mayor was about to start the meeting, Dang demanded zero hour. When Dang’s turn came, he raised the issue of non-development in his ward, but the mayor countered him saying more than Rs 5 crore work were approved for his ward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-house-nod-for-strict-adherence-to-plastic-ban/articleshow/84419608.cms||---
---||Goa||No respite from rain, parts of Goa remain submerged||PANAJI: Heavy rain continued to lash the state for the third consecutive day, resulting in waterlogging in several areas, roads getting submerged, and damage to several structures, including a heritage building in Panaji. The building, on M G Road, behind Geeta Bakery, collapsed on Wednesday afternoon, but nobody was inside, and nobody was hurt. The losses haven’t yet been estimated, but fire services together with Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) personnel cleared the debris. CCP commissioner Agnelo Fernandes said that the building wasn’t one of the 80 identified by the body to be unsafe. “This one was not listed. We will check again. We will ask our junior engineers to go around again to see whether we missed out any structure,” he said. But the incessant showers were spread throughout the state. Several low lying areas, including in Sakhali, were inundated, with water even entering the town’s market. Highways were also flooded, endangering the lives of motorists Mango trees fell on houses in Pernem, Surla and Chorao, and on a jeep at Karmali. In Old Goa, a tamarind tree fell on a house, and in Loliem, a mango tree came crashing down on a cow shed. No casualties were reported in any of the incidents, fire services said. The electricity department was also on their toes after the wind caused trees to fall on lines and brought down poles causing power interruptions in Bardez, Vasco, Ponda, Curchorem, Chicalim, Mapusa and several other areas. When asked about flooding in Panaji, mayor Rohit Monserrate said CCP has cleaned the drains multiple times and added that infrastructure problems will have to be addressed as the “drainage system was not designed to handle this volume of water”. He added that CCP would have to request higher authorities to upgrade the city’s drainage system. Fernandes said the old Portuguese drains are at water level. “The moment there's a high tide, water cannot flow out any more. I wouldn’t call it flooding, it is just accumulation or waterlogging because the moment the tide goes down, in ten minutes, the city gets drained. Water doesn’t remain here for four to five days like other cities. If you see the drains, the outlets are exactly at water level,” he said. “The city has grown, we cannot raise the city, the load is much more and the displacement of water is more because of asphalting, concreting and pavers,” he added. Monserrate said CCP will have to address the issue and come up with a comprehensive plan for Panaji.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-respite-from-rain-parts-of-state-remain-submerged/articleshow/84424504.cms||Lisa Monteiro

---||Goa||Goa: Nine stations record almost four inches of rain in a day||PANAJI: The intensity of rainfall activity over Goa continued, as nine rain gauge stations received more than 100mm (3.9 inches) each, with Quepem recording the highest of 161mm up to 8.30am on Wednesday. The Pernem station has recorded over 2,175mm (85.6 inches) of cumulative rainfall since June 1, even as all other stations across the state are a little over the 1,000mm mark. There is a possibility of heavy rainfall till July 18 in Goa, and the intensity of rainfall may vary based on the weather systems prevailing, India meteorological department (IMD) warned. Monday’s rainfall was the wettest 24-hour spell of the season so far, with 130.3mm (recorded up to 8.30am), with the earlier one being recorded on June 15 with 120.8mm. Tuesday’s total of 117mm is the third highest. Though the steady precipitation has swelled the seasonal total to 1,482.6mm (58.3 inches) and a surplus of 8%, the copious rainfall activity follows a prolonged lean spell. “Last year, the state had received 1,785.6mm (70.3 inches) of rainfall by July 14, which was 30% higher than normal,” IMD scientist Rahul M said. “An equitable distribution of rainfall both in space and time is vital for agriculture and water resources within Goa. Such intense rainfall events (June 15 and July 12) or weak monsoon or break in monsoon conditions are both equally bad,” said M R Ramesh Kumar, meteorologist and former scientist at the National Institute of Oceanography, Goa. While southwest monsoon usually covers the entire country on July 8, its coverage over the Indian subcontinent was delayed by five days, though it arrived in Goa normally on June 5. The substantial increase in rainfall over Goa and the entire west coast was due to the presence of a convective system which formed in the Bay of Bengal. “This brought in lots of moisture into the west coast and Goa in particular, through the transport of moisture by the low-level jet at a height of about 1.5 km above mean sea level. This happens during active monsoon conditions, helped by convective systems over Bay of Bengal,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/nine-stations-record-almost-four-inches-of-rain-in-a-day/articleshow/84424532.cms||---

Police department sources informed that Mukesh Sonwal, blaming the Bhuj Municipality, wrote a message with his blood on the wall of the room where he ended his life. According to police, Sonwal, who lives near RTO circle in Bhuj town, was found hanging at his residence on Wednesday morning. He was working as a sanitation worker with Bhuj municipality’s drainage department. “Nagar Palika e mara Rs 30,000 chori lidha’ (municipality has stolen my Rs 30,000) was written with his blood on the wall of the room where he was found hanging,” police department sources said. As soon as the news of Sonowal’s suicide spread, many sanitation workers reached at the postmortem room and blamed the municipality for the incident. They blamed the civic body for its exploitative work system and for paying them meagre wages. Sonwal is survived by a 17-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter. His wife died a few years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/blaming-bhuj-municipality-sanitation-worker-hangs-self/articleshow/84422219.cms||---
---||Delhi||Covid gone, neuro issues & brain fog persist for some||NEW DELHI: Sudhakar (name changed) recovered from Covid-19 in May. But even now, he finds it difficult to focus at work or do basic mathematical calculations. Sometimes, the 40-year-old also suffers headaches that persist despite medication. “I underwent an MRI of the brain on the advice of a neurologist to rule out tumours or infection. There was nothing wrong. The doctor says it’s probably post-Covid complications,” said Sudhakar. But he is not the only one with such problems. According to Dr J D Mukherji, head, neurology department, Max Healthcare, there are at least one to two similar cases of post-Covid neurological complications every day. “In the last one month, I have seen at least 20 cases of brain fog (confusion, inability to focus) in Covid-recovered patients. We have also come across eight cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome in which the immune system attacks the nerves and one of facial palsy or weakness of the facial muscles,” Mukherji said. While most patients recover with symptomatic treatment, Dr Mukherji added, those with stroke and brain inflammation require prolonged treatment and appropriate drugs. “A 32-year-old girl who presented with Covid infection was administered steroids. She developed diabetes and ketoacidosis and later mucormycosis. She then had a large brain stroke that required surgical decompression, ventilation and supportive therapy. Despite this, she died after a prolonged stay and multiple complications,” he disclosed. A recent study in The Lancet revealed that 33% post-Covid patients continued to have neuropsychiatric aliments. These included loss of taste, smell, confusion, inability to focus and lack of concentration. Some others developed delirium, arterial and venous strokes and meningoencephalitis. Dr Shuchin Bajaj, founder-director, Ujala Cygnus group of hospitals, said brain fog was the most common neurological symptom in recovered patients. “They come with complaints about an inability to concentrate or remember things. Many also have post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety issues. Another very common symptom is light-headedness and blackouts,” Bajaj said, adding that all cases of light-headedness or blackouts shouldn’t be labelled as being of neurological origin because these can also be due to Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, where there is sudden tachycardia and lowering of blood pressure when the patient changes body position or stands up. “In my personal clinical practice, I'm seeing five to seven post-Covid patients with neurological symptoms almost every day,” revealed Bajaj. “And they vary in age from 30 years to 75 years. However, there are very few children, which is a good sign that youngsters don’t have a lot of post-Covid complications.” Dr Vinit Suri, senior neurosciences consultant, Apollo Hospitals, and Dr Anurag Saxena, head, neurosurgery division, Manipal Hospital, both confirmed the trend. Another doctor said, “Covid-recovered patients should watch out for symptoms such as new focal deficits like sudden onset of vertigo, sudden or significant loss in memory and new onset of stroke. Timely intervention can help in better recovery.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-gone-neuro-issues-brain-fog-persist-for-some/articleshow/84422226.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

The woman, who is a resident of Dehradun, has approached the cyber police station in the matter. In June, the woman, who wanted to gift a puppy to her daughter, had come in contact with a man online who posed as a dog breeder. The fraudster told the woman that the puppy would cost around Rs 20,000 and asked for Rs 5000 in advance. Later, the accused asked the woman to deposit Rs 1 lakh, saying the amount is refundable. For the next few days, the woman kept getting emails from the fraudsters, asking her to deposit different amounts in the name of shipping charges of the puppy. The woman was told that she would get the puppy at the Jolly Grant Airport. According to the complaint, the woman ended up paying over Rs 60 lakh but still couldn’t get the puppy. Pankaj Pokhriyal, SHO, cyber police station, Dehradun, said, “We have registered the woman’s complaint and the investigation is progressing based on the mobile numbers and the email ID she has shared with us. The modus operandi matches that of some gangs from Rajasthan and other parts of the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/woman-duped-of-rs-63-lakh-while-trying-to-buy-a-puppy/articleshow/84419713.cms||---

The paanwala had been admitted to hospital and Vishal Kale, 20, was arrested under the attempt to murder charge. Grating bail to Kale, the court said, “I take into account the fact that the victim survived and there is no prospect of the offence being escalated to higher counts... Bail is the rule and jail is the exception.” On May 7, around 8pm, Kale went to buy tobacco and cigarettes from the victim’s shop and an argument ensued after the Rs 15 demand. Kale claimed that the victim’s sister slapped him, but the prosecution alleged he attacked the victim with a knife. Kale in his bail plea said he was falsely implicated and pointed out he, too, was assaulted and taken to hospital. He alleged that despite a counter complaint by him, no action was taken. “No useful purpose will be served by keeping him behind bars till the filing of the chargesheet. Due to the pandemic, I am of the opinion he can be released on bail,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-student-gets-bail-after-attack-over-tobacco-lockdown-cess/articleshow/84424574.cms||---

Taking on both BJP and Congress, Kejriwal said Goans are fed up with their style of politics, which is riddled with defections and corruption. “Elections have become a farce, and there is no meaning because the party that was given 13 MLAs and told to sit in the opposition went and formed the government. Till now, people didn’t have an option. Now they have an option in AAP, and they want to bring in change,” Kejriwal said. AAP tasted its first electoral victory in the zilla panchayat (ZP) election when its candidate Hanzel Fernandes won the Benaulim seat. On Tuesday, Kejriwal met the state’s oldest regional party, Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), functionaries including former deputy chief minister Ramakrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar and also welcomed Chetan Kamat, the president of the Goa tourist taxi owners’ association, into the party. “Many people came to meet me, and Sudin (Dhavalikar) also came to meet me to talk about Goa’s politics. We have not discussed anything about an alliance,” said Kejriwal. The party’s Goa unit has already launched a ‘Let’s Clean Goa’s Politics’ campaign, through which it promises to bring Delhi-like clean politics to the state. “Thousands of people are registering with us and telling us that they are fed up with the two political parties. Goa wants change and wants clean politics. The people of Goa are watching Delhi’s model of politics. If Delhi can get free electricity round the clock, then why not Goa? Why can’t Goa get good schools, good healthcare and clean politics?” said Kejriwal. When asked about AAP MLAs quitting and joining Congress in Punjab, Kejriwal pointed out that despite all the pressure used by BJP, not a single AAP MLA quit in Delhi to join BJP. “For the past 15-20 years, Goa has seen the problem of defections, and this has happened in other states too. In Delhi, BJP hasn’t been able to break even one of our MLAs. But in every state, Congress MLAs are leaving and joining BJP,” he said. State AAP convener Rahul Mhambrey said Kejriwal would visit the state again next month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kejriwal-elect-aap-in-goa-get-300-units-free-power/mth/articleshow/84424572.cms||Newton Sequeira

He arrived here on a special flight to explain the party’s position against the Centre’s policies and soon left for his home state. His interaction was a part of a series of such meetings with the media by big Congress leaders to protest against the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government. Congress has launched a nationwide agitation over rising petrol, diesel and cylinder prices, inflation and other issues. Calling the PM to leave his post “due to failure to control the ever-rising inflation”, Baghel said though the Central government was being run as per diktats from Nagpur, “its parent organization here was neglecting the people’s sufferings due to jump in prices of essential commodities”. Baghel said people are suffocating due to the environment created by the Modi government. “Inflation rose to 37.6% in May from 6.1% in December. Cylinder prices jumped by 60.95%, petrol by 62.28%, diesel by 66.3% and oil by 35.94%. Grocery prices also increased by more than 40%. The rate of retail and wholesale inflation is also worrisome,” he said. According to him, institutions like Income Tax department, Enforcement Directorate (ED), CBI and others were being misused in the non-BJP ruled states by the Modi government. Congress city president MLA Vikas Thakre, district chief Rajendra Mulak, spokesperson Atul Londhe, state secretary Vishal Muttemwar and Atul Kote accompanied the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/chhattisgarh-cm-slams-bjp-led-centre-over-fuel-prices-inflation/articleshow/84422309.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Aurangabad||Vaccine drive takes a pause in Aurangabad due to shortage||AURANGABAD: The already slowed-down immunization programme against Covid touched a new low in Aurangabad on Wednesday as no vaccination took place at the state-run centres due to an acute shortage of doses. The first such incident in Aurangabad since the Covid vaccination started on January 16 has evoked angry reactions from beneficiaries. The vaccine availability, however, was much better in private hospitals, which are charging Rs 780 per dose for Covishield and Rs 1,410 per dose for Covaxin. As per CoWIN portal, booking slots for the next two to three days were available at two of the four private hospitals in Aurangabad district. Dr Smita Nalgirkar, immunization officer with Aurangabad Municipal Corporation, said the civic administration was expecting fresh stock of vaccines by early Thursday morning. “The state-level authorities have not specified any reason for inadequate supply of vaccines to Aurangabad. In the wake of acute shortage of doses, we are giving the available vaccine to beneficiaries needing the second dose on a priority basis,” she said. Asked about the availability of vaccines at private hospitals compared to state-run centres, the health authorities said the vaccines use at private institutions was much lower considering the cost. The voices of dissent are growing, especially the business community. “We are facing Covid-related curbs and the same can be lifted if the government wages effective battle against the pandemic, which includes rapid mass immunization,” said Sanjay Gaikwad, a hotel owner. A total of five lakh vaccines have been given in Aurangabad city, including 1.43 lakh citizens aged 18-44 years and another 99,601 for 45-59 year olds, who have received the first dose of vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/vaccine-drive-takes-a-pause-in-aurangabad-due-to-shortage/articleshow/84417245.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt yet to take any action against 204 officials caught for corruption by ACB||MUMBAI: There are 204 officers in the state government who have been trapped by the ACB for engaging in acts of corruption, but no departmental action has been initiated against any one of them yet. The ACB has even secured convictions for 29 of them, but even that has not resulted in moving the state to act against them. In a letter to uplokayukta Sanjay Bhatia and chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, former central information commissioner and RTI activist Shailesh Gandhi, who obtained the ACB data, has said that if the ACB’s information is true, it would imply that the state government or some of its officials were complicit in encouraging corruption and protecting the corrupt. He has written in the letter that these cases need to be taken to their logical end.TimesViewThe data clearly reveals the government’s disinterest in acting against corrupt officers. One of the most blatant cases in recent times has been the reinstatement of dismissed cop Sachin Waze, who is now in prison. The state’s inaction gives rise to suspicion that there is a mala fide intent and quid pro quo to allow tainted and convicted officers to go unpunished.A majority of the tainted officers are from Nagpur and Nanded divisions and mostly belong to the rural development, education and sports, revenue, police, and cooperatives departments. "It appears that the law requires action to be taken against such public servants, and the ACB has taken the step of putting this information suo motu on its website. This refusal to take punitive action appears to be an attempt to make the ACB toothless,” Gandhi wrote in his letter. He has requested that he be informed about specific action taken before August 15 in this regard. IPS officer-turned-lawyer YP Singh said the ACB is a caged parrot. “These are all small cases of clerks and peons, as in all big cases of civil servants and politicians, it has either issued clean chits or closed cases. It's an uninspiring performance," he said. Chief secretary Kunte did not respond to TOI’s calls and messages regarding the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-yet-to-take-any-action-against-204-officials-caught-for-corruption-by-acb/articleshow/84426470.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar
---||Goa||Weightage for job creation in GIDC plot rules||PANAJI: The Goa Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) on Wednesday approved the revised allotment criteria for plots at industrial estates, giving weightage to employment generation, quantum of investment, viability of the project and the category of the industrial unit. A four-member screening committee, which scrutinizes applications for GIDC plots, drafted the guidelines and submitted them to GIDC. The GIDC board, which met on Wednesday, approved the selection criteria and will put it up for public information. “The main idea is to see the viability of the project, the benefit it will bring to the state, the pollution category, the number of jobs that will be created, and the educational qualifications of the project proponent,” said a board member. The corporation had framed the ‘GIDC Allotment Regulations’ in 2012 to bring in transparency and to avoid manipulation in the allotment of plots. As part of the regulations, a four-member screening committee was also constituted to scrutinise the applications. The GIDC board also approved the waiver of interest penalty that was levied on the Goa Waste Management Corporation, which has taken up a plot at the Pissurlem industrial estate to set up a hazardous waste treatment plant. Board members deferred a proposal to spend Rs 4 crore to set up a solid waste collection shed at Verna and asked GIDC to prepare a detailed project report, especially operational details before spending the money. Spending on infrastructure improvement such as extension of water pipelines, improvement of roads, entry points at industrial estates and other minor works were approved by the board. The board also discussed a proposal to set up accommodation for labourers and industrial workers along the lines announced by chief minister Pramod Sawant in his budget speech. Sources said that no decision was arrived at and that the agenda item was deferred. GIDC toying with hike in industry lease rent: Panaji: Goa Industrial Development Corporation is once again toying with the idea of increasing lease rent for industrial plots, a move that is sure to draw flak from entrepreneurs and industry bodies. GIDC moved a proposal to bring lease rental rates on par with “prevailing rates”, but the board decided to keep the proposal on hold and seek legal opinion before going ahead. GIDC attempted a similar move in 2018 but had to beat a hasty retreat after all-round criticism from the industry. A couple of days earlier, chief minister Pramod Sawant held a meeting with all government departments and corporations and asked them to find additional sources of revenue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/weightage-for-job-creation-in-gidc-plot-rules/articleshow/84424600.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Bombay high court permits wildlife activist’s plea for rehearing in T1 killing||NAGPUR: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday permitted intervention filed by wildlife activist Sangeeta Dogra into alleged shooting of Pandharkawada tigress T1, popularly known as Avni. Dogra had prayed for reopening the case and fresh hearing. After hearing her through virtual mode, a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor said they were satisfied by her submissions that she is competent to assist HC in a dignified manner for upholding the cause of justice relating to the issue. She is also allowed to appear in-person whenever hearing of her various applications related to the case would be scheduled. Dogra, also the director at Red Lynx Confederation, had challenged grant of permission by the competent authority to eliminate the problem tigress. Her another application was for recalling HC’s September 6, 2018, order where it had directed the PCCF and CCF to tranquilize the tigress and capture it and in case the capture teams fail, to eliminate her. Before listing Dogra’s applications for hearing after four weeks, the bench directed her to provide their copies to the petitioner’s counsel Tushar Mandlekar, assistant solicitor general of India Ulhas Aurangabadkar, assistant government pleader NR Patil and respondents’ lawyer Kartik Shukul. The directives came while hearing a PIL filed by wildlife lover Dr Jerryl Banait seeking stay against orders to shoot the problem tigress. After the tigress was shot by the private shooter Asghar Ali Khan on November 2, 2018, NGO’s Earth Brigade Foundation and Bezuban Public Welfare Trust filed a PIL in HC praying for directives to state and National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) to initiate criminal proceedings against him for illegal hunting, tampering with evidence at the crime scene, and dereliction of duties under Section 9 of Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, Section 3 of Arms Act, 1959, Section 30 of Narcotic and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. Dogra had earlier knocked the Supreme Court’s doors for the same case alleging breach of its September 11, 2018, orders by the Maharashtra government while allowing killing of the feline. Quoting a postmortem report, Dogra contended that the tigress was not a man-eater and gunshot wounds on her body were suppressed. She also claimed that the forest department presented a silver trophy to the shooter in a violation of the SC order. However, after the top court refused to initiate contempt against the government, she withdrew the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-permits-wildlife-activists-plea-for-rehearing-in-t1-killing/articleshow/84422290.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Kochi||Sr Lucy argues herown case at HC||Kochi: Sister Lucy Kalappura, the nun who came under the spotlight for protesting against rape-accused bishop Franco Mulakkal, on Wednesday argued herself before the high court against the move to evict her from the convent. The nun approached the court after the supreme appellate authority of the Catholic Church of Vatican rejected her appeal against expulsion from her congregation, Franciscan Clarist Congregation (FCC). She has now sought police protection against her eviction from the convent. Though Sister Lucy had approached the court through a lawyer, he had later refused to continue with the case. She argued the case herself after failing to find another lawyer. Stating that she is appearing before the court for the first time, Sister Lucy said proceedings are going on to evict her from the convent at present. “I am challenging it as it is unfair,” she said while pointing out that a civil court had granted an injunction in her favour in 2019. She has no place to go, Sister Lucy said. “I am a woman, a nun fighting for justice. It is important for my nunship that I continue to stay at this convent. I have been a nun for the past 39 years, do not throw me into the streets. I have nowhere else to go,” she said. The court said as her right to continue as a member of FCC has been extinguished, her continued residence in the convent would lead to continuous strife and conflicts. Therefore, she should not continue to stay at the convent, the court said while reserving the case for pronouncing orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sr-lucy-argues-herown-case-at-hc/articleshow/84422296.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand to seal borders, in talks with other states to stop pilgrims||DEHRADUN: A day after Uttarakhand cancelled the annual kanwar yatra, but Uttar Pradesh said it would go ahead with it, the hill state on Wednesday decided to seal its borders to keep kanwariyas from entering. The administration also said it is holding talks at the government level with neighbouring states in an attempt to “scrap the yatra at the source”. Crores of kanwariyas or Shiva devotees converge at Haridwar to carry water from the Ganga during the fortnight-long pilgrimage. Most of the pilgrims arrive from UP, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi and Himachal Pradesh. State government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal told TOI on Wednesday that it might be difficult to manage kanwariyas once they start out, so Uttarakhand is trying to connect with neighbouring states to stop them. “Our priority is to save lives. We are in discussion with neighbouring states to stop the yatra at the source. Looking at the present situation, it is not possible to allow the yatra.” Uniyal added that both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian Medical Association have expressed concern over the possibility of a third wave of Covid-19. “Religion is important, but at the same time we cannot risk lives. Such a decision has been taken in the past and this time as well a lot of consultations were held,” he said.Last year, former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat had barred the yatra. After that the Tirath Singh Rawat government, too, announced its cancellation in June. But soon after Pushkar Singh Dhami took charge as the new chief minister earlier this month, UP CM Yogi Adityanath had a telephonic conversation with him following which the former called a meeting with senior state officers and asked them to look afresh into the possibilities of allowing the pilgrimage. The issue of the yatra was discussed during Dhami’s meeting with Modi and home minister Amit Shah in Delhi on July 10. On Tuesday, Dhami announced that the yatra would not take place in Uttarakhand. Uttarakhand police has now said that state borders would be sealed for kanwariyas. Director general of police (DGP) Ashok Kumar told TOI, “Kanwariyas trying to enter Uttarakhand will be turned back. We are also going to have a round of meetings with officials of the neighbouring states from where kanwariyas come and ask them to publicise that Uttarakhand is not conducting the yatra,” he said. Last year, Uttarakhand police had deployed the Provincial Armed Constabulary to seal its border with UP and stop kanwariyas from trooping in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-to-seal-borders-in-talks-with-other-states-to-stop-yatra-at-source/articleshow/84419748.cms||Kautilya Singh

Several police teams of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan have launched a combing operation to rescue the medical practitioner. No ransom call was made to the family till Wednesday night. Dr Umakant Gupta, 60, owns a hospital in Agra. “He left home on Tuesday evening at 6.45pm in his car, but never returned,” said his wife, Dr Vidya Gupta, who is a gynaecologist. It was then that she approached the police and filed a written complaint. “He took his Baleno car and was carrying a mobile phone. It is switched off now,” she said, adding that the nursing home is just 600metre from their house. Superintendent of police (SP) of Agra Botre Rohan Pramod told TOI, “Five police teams have been formed to work on this case. We are looking into similar cases which took place in the region in the last few years.” A case under section 364 of IPC (kidnapping for ransom) has been registered against unknown persons at Etmauddaula police station of Agra. Police said that the last location of Dr Gupta’s mobile was traced near Saiya village of Agra. “All CCTV footage from the area are being scanned,” a police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agras-senior-surgeon-kidnapped-car-found-in-rajasthans-dholpur/articleshow/84419778.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

On Wednesday, it suspended the licence of 10 lawyers for allegedly submitting fake positive reports. Since the fake cases cropped up during a random scrutiny of 200 applications for funds, the council has now announced in a notice that it will verify all Covid test reports of approximately 4,000 lawyers from the respective testing labs. “It is, therefore, advised to the beneficiaries that in case any of them has submitted a false Covid report, he may voluntarily tender an apology in the form of an affidavit along with a demand draft of the amount already received,” the notice stated. BCD chairman Ramesh Gupta took note of the latest findings and suspended the 10 advocates. A special disciplinary committee has been set up to further probe the allegations. The disciplinary body had on July 9 first suspended a lawyer’s licence to practise for allegedly submitting a fake Covid-positive report. “It is apparent that the Covid report submitted by the said lawyer is fake and claiming financial help on the basis of a fake report not only amounted to misconduct but also forgery and cheating,” the council noted while asking the lawyer to file a response before the special disciplinary committee within seven days of receipt of the notice and appear in person before the panel. The council warned that the opportunity of voluntarily tendering an apology and returning the money would be granted only once and, later on, strict disciplinary action would be taken against all those found involved in the fabrication of the Covid reports for claiming grants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/11-lawyers-licence-suspended-for-fake-covid-reports/articleshow/84422347.cms||Abhinav Garg

The sale proceeds are transferred to Punjab National Bank (PNB) Guruvayur branch on a daily basis. The bank officials come to the Devaswom office and issue a receipt on receiving the money. Devaswom chairman advocate K B Mohandas said PNB officials have informally agreed to make good of the lost amount. He, however, said the entries in the Devaswom account are supposed to be tallied with the bank receipts and that if there are any lapses on the part of Devaswom officials, strict action would be taken against them. PNB officials said they have deputed a team to study what had gone wrong and will resolve the issue after consultations with the temple authorities. “Only after we receive the report, will we be able to decide on the course of action to resolve the issue. We will also have to find out whether there is any collusion between bank and temple staff,’’ Jerome John, PNB’s Ernakulam Circle head said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/guruvayur-audit-finds-funds-missing/articleshow/84422370.cms||T Ramavarman

These schools are from Covid free villages. The education department is scrutinising the applications. The schools have to get a consent letter from the local gram panchayat and from the students’ parents. Some of the schools will start with their offline classes from Monday, said the officials. Mahadev Lohar, the head of the secondary education department, Kolhapur district, said, “We had asked the school authorities to furnish the documents such as consent letters, the RT-PCR test reports and vaccination certificates of teachers and staff. Some schools have furnished the documents and have been asked to go ahead as per the guidelines fixed by the state government. The school administration has to ensure the students follow Covid appropriate behaviour on the school premises.” So far, very few districts have resumed offline classes. The demand is growing among parents due to limitations in online classes. Lohar said the government has not yet issued any directions with respect to resuming offline classes for primary schools and higher education colleges. The administration staff of the schools, that will reopened from Monday, have been given online training regarding sanitising, maintaining social distancing and health screening. The students with Covid related symptoms should not be allowed on the premises, said Lohar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/943-schools-in-kolhapur-ready-to-start-offline-classes/articleshow/84417316.cms||---

The region, where the Covid count since March 2020 has reached 6,07,877, including 14,791 deaths, is currently showing an average mortality rate of 2.43% and a recovery rate of 97%. Speaking on the overall pandemic situation in the district, Beed district health officer Dr Radhakrishna Pawar said the spread of Covid was relatively more uncontained in rural areas than urban areas. “On average, we are carrying out more aggressive Covid testing as compared to other Marathwada districts, which is the main reason behind more Covid cases being detected in Beed. Such a measure is essential to avoid the spread of the disease,” he said. Beed district has Covid positivity rate of 5.4%, which is more than the average positivity rate of other districts from Marathwada. Stating that Covid-related curbs were already in place, Pawar said the public at large should exhibit Covid appropriate behaviour in order to reduce the fresh cases. Among other districts of Marathwada, Hingoli district has the lowest number of active cases (12 ), followed by Jalna (78), Nanded (53), Latur ( 92), Parbhani (101), Aurangabad (391) and Osmanabad (582), show official data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/beed-district-accounts-for-over-50-of-active-cases-in-marathwada-region/articleshow/84417304.cms||---
---||Agra||Saplings of trees planted during Van Mahotsav left ‘unattended’ in Etah||Agra: After the Etah district administration held the 'Van Mahotsav' (afforestation festival) from July 1 to 7 with much fanfare, a large number of the saplings are now left unattended, some dead, others dried up. The entire matter will be investigated, forest department officials said. Official records state that 15,000 trees were planted at Badhua village under the Nidholi Kalan block. Now, hundreds of saplings with their base covered in polythene are still lying on the ground. Villagers recalled senior officials had come for a plantation drive on July 4. Officials took a few photographs and then left, they claimed. The plantation drive took place for half an hour. Most of the saplings have dried up. On an average, Rs 6 were spent by the forest department to prepare saplings for the plantation during the Van Mahotsav. The estimated cost of 15,000 saplings is Rs 90,000. Anil Kumar, a resident of Badhua village, said, “Senior officials of the district administration and forest department had come here for the tree plantation on vacant land in the village. Only a few trees were planted. Most of the saplings are still lying on the ground. A majority of them have dried up. We complained with the local authorities, but no action was taken.” Etah based farmer Satyaveer Singh said, “The plantation campaign in the district largely remained a formality like previous years. Large scale malpractices will come out if the state government conducts a proper investigation."

---||Kolhapur||22% Kolhapur deaths within 48 hours of hospital admission||KOLHAPUR: Of the 190 Covid deaths reported in Kolhapur district during the last week, 42 patients (around 22%) succumbed to the infection within 48 hours of being admitted to the hospital. The district has been recording the highest number of cases in the state and now it is also registering the highest number of Covid deaths. The officials said the district, which has the highest vaccination coverage in the state, also has the highest positivity rate mainly due to the increased number of tests being conducted. On average 13,000 tests are conducted every day, including 8,500 are RT-PCR tests. The experts are worried over the continuous reporting of deaths. In the last week, 190 deaths were recorded. They said the positivity rate should not be a cause of worry as most of the patients as asymptomatic. Anita Saibannavar, the pulmonologist and head of the Covid task force said, “Most of the deaths are due to delay in admission. The patients are brought to the hospital at a later stage of the infection progression. We continue to tell people that if they bring any Covid patient with any type of comorbidity or of any age, we can save him or her. The only condition is that the patient should be brought immediately after they test positive or if they show Covid symptoms.” Currently, the mortality rate of Kolhapur district is 2.90% while the state has a mortality rate of 2.20%. The local bodies took serious efforts for early detection of the Covid patients among the elderly population by holding drives. However, in the last couple of weeks, the drives have been halted as more health staffers are now put in use for vaccination. The Asha workers also held a strike for over a week, which slowed the drive. Of the 190, 115 patients, above the age of 60 years, succumbed to Covid in the last week. S S More, the dean of Chhatrapati Pramila Raje Civil Hospital, said, “The infection currently is at the community level. The vulnerable population must be vaccinated at the earliest to bring down the mortality rate.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/22-kolhapur-deaths-within-48-hrs-of-hospital-admission/articleshow/84417352.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Retirement age of medical officers extended by 2 years||MUMBAI: As the state health services in Maharashtra were hit hard during the Covid pandemic due to shortage of medical and senior officials, the state cabinet on Wednesday gave post-facto sanction to the proposal to increase the retirement age of medical officers and those above them by two years, from 60 to 62 years. The decision will apply to those working under the state health service directorate and Employees State Insurance Scheme (ESIC). However, it will be applicable only up to May 2022. In May 2021, 193 senior officials from Maharashtra medical and health services and ESIC were due to retire at the age of 60 years as per the retirement criteria. An official said considering the pandemic and the projection of a third wave of Covid-19, the state health department decided to extend their service term till May 31, 2022 by issuing a government resolution. Referring to the government resolution (GR) that was issued on May 31, the department on Wednesday put up a detailed note on the shortage of medical officers and proposed to sanction extension of their retirement age for two years. According to the cabinet decision, all officials working as medical officers and above will be retired at the age of 62. The decision will be implemented with retrospective effect from May 31, 2021 to May 2022, said an official. The cabinet also proposed that the finance department make necessary revisions in the Maharashtra Civil Service (retirement) Rules, 1982. Speaking to the media, public health minister Rajesh Tope said that the state government also planned to fill almost 1,000 posts of doctors, medical officers, para-medical staff and specialists and the advertisement will be published soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-retirement-age-of-medical-officers-extended-by-2-yrs/articleshow/84425384.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

During the drive, carried out on Tuesday under the supervision of respective superintendents of police, as many as 22,123 vehicles were checked. Nanded range’s special IG Nisar Tamboli said, “During the special drive in four districts of our range, a total of 9,091 motorists were found violating traffic rules and have been fined accordingly.” In addition, four cases of vehicle theft were also detected during the drive that was aimed at catching the violators by surprise. Nanded superintendent of police Pramodkumar Shewale said the police department had largely been occupied with effective implementation of the lockdown during to the pandemic. “We have now shifted our focus on checking vehicles that are often being used to cause menace — either by rough and negligent driving or by modifying silencers of the vehicles,” he said. Police officers maintained that apart from all the important roads passing throught the districts, crucial commercial locations were also screened for various traffic rule violators. Latur superintendent of police Nikhil Pingale said through this drive, vehicle owners were checked for violation of seat belts, helmets, not carrying driving licence, drunk driving, among others. In addition, the police also used the drive to check if vehicle drivers being stopped for screening were wanted in any of the cases in the four districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/over-9000-fined-during-surprise-check-on-vehicles-in-4-marathwada-districts/articleshow/84417370.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Delhi||Delhi court slams cops, imposes fine for ‘farcical’ riot probe||NEW DELHI: A city court here has come down heavily on Delhi Police for “miserably” failing in conducting a fair investigation on a complaint filed by a man who had received a gunshot injury in his eye during the north-east Delhi riots in February last year. It has imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on the cops. The court was hearing a revision petition filed by the police against a magistrate court’s order of October 21, 2020, directing them to file a separate FIR on the complaint of Mohammad Nasir, a riot victim. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav also lifted the stay on the magistrate court’s order and paved the way for registration of a separate FIR on the complaint. Nasir had alleged in his complaint, filed through advocate Mehmood Pracha, that on February 24, 2020, one Naresh Tyagi had fired at him while he was returning home due to which he had suffered a gunshot injury in his left eye. Nasir said in his complaint that he was taken to a hospital and then discharged on March 12, 2020. After a few days, he made a written complaint to the SHO of Bhajanpura police station, wherein he named Naresh Tyagi, Subhash Tyagi, Uttam Tyagi, Sushil, Naresh Gaur and some other persons as the alleged assailants, but no FIR was registered by the police. He had also written to the DCP (North-East) on July 3 last year, seeking protection under Delhi Witness Protection Scheme but to no avail. In the meantime, one FIR no 64/2020 was registered at the police station on February 25, 2020, about the rioting in the area which stated that seven persons, including the complainant, had received gunshot injuries on the same day. But the place of occurrence mentioned there was different from that of Nasir’s incident. Five accused persons -- Sameer Saifi, Salman, Jubair, Sohail and Mohd Shoaib -- were arrested in this case for allegedly causing damage to life and properties of Hindus. Nasir had approached the court on July 17, 2020, through advocates Pracha, Sanawar Choudhary and Jatin Bhat, seeking registration of a separate FIR in the case. The police then informed the magistrate’s court about FIR no 64/2020 wherein, it claimed, the grievance of the complainant had been suitably addressed and hence there was no need to lodge a separate FIR in the case. The police also submitted that he had been made a witness in the case. The investigating officer had added that the persons named by Nasir in his complaint had been questioned but no evidence had been found against them. After examining the facts and circumstances of the case, ASJ Vinod Yadav said in his order that the investigation in the FIR that had been registered had been carried out in the “most casual, callous and farcical manner”. It said the facts and the case diaries of the registered FIR revealed a “very shocking state of affairs”. It noted that FIR no. 64/2020 was in respect of Mohanpuri and Maujpur and not North Ghonda, which was the place of the incident in Nasir’s complaint. It said though the police knew about seven persons having received gunshot injuries, section 307 (attempt to murder) and sections of the Arms Act were not initially invoked in the FIR for “reasons best known to them”. The court said it had been noted in the case diary recorded on March 14 that the police had been searching for the victims, meaning that they were not aware of the names and addresses of the victims, which was “quite surprising”. Another case diary in the matter was recorded a few days later in which it was stated that two of the accused had caused damage to life and properties of Hindus, but not a single Hindu victim’s name was mentioned, it said. Going by the case diary, it was only in May that a search operation for the victims in the case was launched, noted the court. The court said when two separate complaints disclosing cognizable offences are filed by two different complainants, there is no provision under which the investigating agency can club such complaints and carry out an investigation. It added that it was clearly evident that the defence for the accused persons named in Nasir’s complaint has been sought to be “created by the police”. “Seeing the matter from any angle, I have not been able to persuade myself about the efficacy and fairness of the investigation carried out in the matter,” the judge said. “I do not find any merit in this revision petition. The same accordingly stands dismissed with a cost of Rs.25,000, which shall be deposited with Delhi Legal Services Authority by DCP (North-East) within one week from today and the said amount shall be recovered from the petitioner and his supervising officers, who have miserably failed in their statutory duties in this case after holding a due inquiry in this regard,” he said. Additional public prosecutor Rajeev Krishan Sharma, appearing for the police, had submitted that an FIR need not be an encyclopaedia of all the facts and circumstances of the case on which the prosecution relies and rather it was a piece of evidence which could be used for corroborating the case of the prosecution. Pracha claimed a separate FIR was required to be registered as the so-called unlawful assemblies were different and distinct and had different common objects and the accused persons chargesheeted in the registered case could not have a common object of causing harm to the persons of their own community, particularly in a situation of communal riots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-slams-cops-imposesfine-for-farcical-riot-probe/articleshow/84422492.cms||Usha Das

Contractors allegedly formed a syndicate and did not take part in tenders invited by fisheries commissioner. In the notification, the government fixed the price of fingerlings sized between 35mm and 40mm at 60 paise each and 80mm to 100mm at Rs 1.51 each. Tenders were invited in May/June but contractors are not coming forward. Interestingly, fish fingerling growers and contractors from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have been participating in the tenders for last few years, but this time they are demanding enhancement of procurement prices. Telangana Fish Seed Farmers Association chairman Gurrala Mallesham told TOI that even the price fixed by the National Fisheries Development Board per fingerling is Rs 2.5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-takers-for-fish-fingerlings-contract/articleshow/84424653.cms||Roushan Ali

However, local residents have welcomed the decision, saying it was the right call in the midst of a pandemic. Sunil Sethi, head of a Haridwar traders' union, said, “The government did not support the businessmen of Haridwar who were the most affected due to Covid-19. If the yatra is not allowed, local traders should at least get a relief package. Why only kanwar yatra? Political gatherings and rallies should also be cancelled. The government should reconsider the ban (on kanwarias entering the state).” Meanwhile, residents of the district, which was one of the worst affected during the peak of the second wave right after the Kumbh Mela (April 1-30), are relieved. “Life is more important than business. We saw how people died due to lack of hospitals and ventilators in Haridwar. The government allowed the Kumbh mela after which Covid-19 cases spiraled out of control. Now the government has taken the right decision by choosing to cancel the kanwar mela,” said Sachin Kumar, a local resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-haridwar-locals-welcome-ban-on-kanwarias-traders-miffed/articleshow/84419852.cms||MS Nawaz

Parents association, however, demanded from the state government to ensure that schools will not start charging beyond tuition fee in the name of opening of the campuses.President of MP Parents Association, Kamal Vishwakarma said, “We welcome the decision. Our only concern is that schools should not start demanding fee beyond tuition fee. State government should ensure that schools must not make any such attempt till the Covid ends.”Parents said that schools must also come forward to ensure that they will not use the opening of campuses with any hidden agenda. “We can understand that opening of schools are in favour of students. However, I do not want to see a situation where schools would start demanding extra fee,” said Anand Patel, a parent.Schools ensured that they will make the campus safe for the students. “There was not a single case in any school even during the last time also when classes from 9 to 12 were re-opened after first wave. Let the government issue SOPs. We can ensure that schools will follow every instruction strictly as students’ safety is our priority,” said vice president, Madhya Pradesh Association of Un-aided Private Schools, Vinny Raj Modi.“We have decided to drop the decision to move court against the state government after it has announced to resume classes.

---||Mumbai||Vaccine scam: Arrested Kandivli hospital doctor tests positive, hospitalized||MUMBAI: A key accused held in the fraudulent vaccine scam has tested positive for Covid-19. Dr Shivraj Pataria (61) owns Charkop-based Shivam Hospital which is at the centre of the scam and has been sealed. Pataria has been admitted to a government hospital while his wife, Neeta, remains in Borivali police’s custody. Fourteen people have been held and 12 FIRs registered in connection with the scam. “The police have already seized phones of the Pataria couple, sealed their hospital and frozen their bank accounts. We argued before court on Wednesday that keeping them in police custody further serves no purpose,” said their lawyer Kshitij Mehta. The court sent them to police custody till Saturday. Police have pieced together how the gang got hold of login IDs and passwords of private hospitals for generating vaccine certificates. “One of the accused, Nitin Mode, said he stole the login ID and password of Nanavati Hospital during a genuine vaccination drive at Powai. The employees of a nationalized bank were inoculated at this camp,” said an investigator. Mode allegedly handed over the information to his associate, Chandan Singh, who used it for keying in Aadhaar data of beneficiaries at fraudulent vaccine camps. This is how some of the beneficiaries got certificates with Nanavati Hospital’s name on them. Mode had procured the login ID and password of Lifeline Hospital, which was similarly used for generating certificates. Both men were reportedly paid Rs 40,000 for their role by the alleged mastermind, Mahendra Singh. Police have begun quizzing the firm that was responsible for picking up biomedical waste from Shivam Hospital. Investigators suspect the hospital did not discard some of the used vials while it functioned as a private Covid vaccination centre (PCVC). These vials were later refilled with saline water and used for fraudulent camps. “One of the fake camps at a Borivali-based stocks advisory was organized by two travel agents at the behest of Mahendra. From the money charged from beneficiaries of this camp, the duo handed over Rs 3.8 lakh in cash to Mahendra and transferred Rs 1.8 lakh to the bank account of KCEP Group, a placement institute, on Mahendra’s instructions,” said an investigator. KCEP is run by a key accused, Dr Manish Tripathi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/vax-scam-arrested-kandivli-hosp-doctor-tests-positive-hospitalized/articleshow/84417431.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Malaria & dengue surge in island city, fingers point at Metro digging||MUMBAI: Wards in the island city are reporting a surge in malaria and dengue cases and it seems to be reflected in a corresponding rise in admissions due to vector-borne diseases in south Mumbai hospitals. In times of the pandemic, many people who feared they had contracted Covid after developing fever, cough and headache are finding out it was malaria or dengue. BMC figures show there have been 357 malaria cases in June and 230 in the first 11 days of July. Overall, nearly 2,000 cases have been reported this year. Since June, the city has seen 20 confirmed dengue cases. Most of these cases are being reported from wards such as A (Colaba, Cuffe Parade, Churchgate), E (Mazgaon, Byculla) and G-South (Worli, Lower Parel). A resident of J Tata Road in Churchgate, whose four family members have been affected by dengue, recalled the excavation of a large pit for the Metro just before the monsoon. “Now, the pit is left open with no work going on and rainwater has been collecting there,” he said. Another resident, Lolita Shivdasani, said many of those recently hospitalised due to Covid are worried they might contract malaria of dengue and hospitalised again. Bombay Hospital in Marine Lines has admitted nearly a dozen cases of malaria in the last few weeks. Around seven dengue patients and a few leptospirosis patients are also undergoing treatment. “Malaria cases have increased but we haven’t seen any complication or death,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, physician at the hospital. Dr Samrat Shah, consultant internist at Bhatia Hospital, said in the last 20 days, around 10 patients have been admitted at the Tardeo hospital --- five with falciparum malaria, three with vivax malaria, and three with dengue and vivax malaria. Physician Pratit Samdani is treating six to seven cases of dengue and malaria, mostly from pockets in Khetwadi, Napean Sea road and Parel. “We are seeing both falciparum and vivax,” he said. “A distinct difference between dengue and Covid is that the former comes with high fever, retro-orbital pain and not so much with breathing difficulties,” he said. Rajan Naringrekar, BMC insecticide officer, said they have been told of surges in E and G-South wards, but not so much in Churchgate. “Some of these wards have always seen a higher incidence due to construction projects. Metro work, too, has led to increased breeding in some parts, including the suburbs. But we are regularly treating the breeding spots and destroying them,” he said. Churchgate corporator Harshita Narwekar said many cases are being reported from J Tata road, M K road and areas of Marine Drive. Mumbadevi MLAAmin Patel said B (Dongri) ward saw a rise in malaria cases last month. “There was a problem with the availability of diesel and that had hit fogging, but it has been resolved now. The massive infrastructure projects are providing the perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-malaria-dengue-surge-in-island-city-fingers-point-at-metro-digging/articleshow/84424706.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Dehradun||High court to hear PIL challenging animal slaughter ban in Haridwar on Friday||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) has directed the advocate general (AG) SN Babulkar, to appear before the court on Friday when it will hear a public interest litigation (PIL) challenging the ban on animal slaughter in Haridwar district. The court held that since the PIL has challenged the constitutional validity of the amendment made to the UP Municipalities Act, the AG must be heard in the matter. The bench of chief justice RS Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma was informed by the counsel appearing for petitioners – four Muslim residents of Haridwar district – that Bakr-Eid is scheduled on July 21 and animal sacrifice is an essential religious practice on the day. It added that by prohibiting animal slaughter on the day, the government is violating Article 25 (right to practise one’s religion) of the petitioners. As reported by TOI earlier, the plea argues that even though the functioning of any slaughterhouse in the Haridwar municipal area was already prohibited, the state government issued an order in March cancelling the NOCs for slaughterhouses even in the jurisdictions of smaller urban local bodies in the district. The petition challenges the constitutional validity of section 237-A which was inserted by the state government into the Uttar Pradesh Municipalities Act. The section gives the power to the state government to declare any area under a municipal corporation, council or nagar panchayat as a slaughter-free zone. The petition added that the order is not only arbitrary but even violates Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution by denying hygienic and fresh non-vegetarian food to people of Haridwar, across the limitations of religion and caste.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-to-hear-pil-challenging-animal-slaughter-ban-in-haridwar-on-friday/articleshow/84419878.cms||Prashant Jha

Speaking to TOI on Wednesday, Bhujbal said the Covid situation in Nashik district is under control and the number of active cases has now reduced to 1,612 . “But the district authorities would not take any hasty decision on extending the timings of the shops,” he said. The guardian minister reminded the traders that the administration has already given a relaxation by allowing shops to open from 7am instead of the earlier order of opening time of 10am. “People come to buy in the markets during the time they are allowed. Hence, there is currently no need to increase the timing,” he said. According to him, Nashik will continue to remain under the level 3 category of Covid restrictions unless the state government takes a decision on the issue. “There is projection of the third wave and the vaccination of beneficiaries not picking up fast in Nashik due to the erratic supply of vaccines. The decision to give relaxation can be taken only if the maximum beneficiaries get vaccinated,” said Bhujbal. Moreover, there are projections of Covid-19 and the state government is acting cautiously as it does not want the third wave in Maharashtra to be deadlier than the second wave. The Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture (MACCIA) and Nashik Grain and Grocery Wholesalers Association had sought the government to increase the timing for closing the shops by three hours and also do away with the weekend closure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-traders-seek-time-extension-bhujbal-says-no/articleshow/84417472.cms||Tushar Pawar

While directing the state to provide the complainant with police protection, the HC said that there have been several instances where the prosecutrix have been killed and their family members have been subjected to harassment and pressures. Meanwhile, the court also issued notices to the MLA and two of his associates and have given them four weeks to respond. The bench of chief justice RS Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma said, “Needless to say that it is the foremost duty of the State to protect not only the prosecutrix but also her family members. For, instances are not wanting when the prosecutrix has been killed and her family members have been subjected to harassment and pressures,” read the court order. The court has directed SSP Haridwar and SHO Bahadrabad to immediately provide police protection not only to the woman but even her family members and the properties owned by them. The HC added that if the MLA or his henchmen carry out any threat against the woman or her family, the police are to take action against them in accordance with the law. The orders were issued on Monday after the woman filed a petition before the court alleging that ever since the FIR was registered against the MLA from Haridwar’s Jwalapur constituency, she and her family members have been facing harassment and are being threatened by Rathore and his associates. Interestingly, on the same day, the single judge bench of Justice NS Dhanik heard a plea by Rathore seeking a stay on the FIR and protection from arrest. The bench gave the counsel appearing for the state of Uttarakhand a week to seek instructions from the government on the petition filed by Suresh Rathore, BJP MLA from Haridwar’s Jwalapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-grants-police-protection-to-the-woman-who-accused-bjp-mla-of-rape/articleshow/84419905.cms||Prashant Jha

The administration decided to focus on the vaccination of the elderly population. So far, 78% of the elderly population have received the first dose and around 11.5 lakh citizens above the age of 45 years have received at least the first dose. Now, the priority is administering the second dose to these people. The younger population are irritated over the leaders being congratulated for bringing more doses while they are being denied the vaccine. In the last 10 days, the district received 80,000 doses. Rohit Shinde, a city resident, said, “The administration should reserve some doses for the younger population. I require vaccine as I have to go out every day to earn for my family. Due to a decline in income, we are unable to afford the costly vaccines available in private hospitals. The administration must make priority group among 18 years to 44 years and vaccinate people like us who need the jab.” He said many of his friends had togo to nearby districts to get the free jab. The officials said currently, over 40,000 beneficiaries mostly the elderly, frontline workers are yet to get their second dose. Only 24,000 citizens between the age group of 18 and 44 years have received their first dose, out of the total 18.42 lakh beneficiaries. Acting district collectorKadambari Balkawade said, “We are ensuring around 90% of the doses we get are utilised for those with second dose due. We will open vaccination for other age groups once we get an adequate number of doses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/resume-vax-drive-for-18-44-category-kolhapur-youths/articleshow/84417418.cms||---

A total of 3.69 lakh vaccine doses were administered in the state on Wednesday. The districts where mass vaccination took place include Harda, Hoshangabad, Raisen, Rajgarh, Sehore, Vidisha, Alirajpur, Burhanpur, Indore, Khandwa, Ashok Nagar, Datia, Sheopur, Shivpuri, Gwalior, Dindori, Jabalpur, Sagar, Dewas, Neemuch, Ratlam, Ujjain, Rewa and Shahdol. Sources said, in a bid to boost the vaccination numbers in the districts where there has been less vaccination, mass vaccination was carried out in 24 districts. It also ensures that coverage of Covid-19 vaccination is even across the state. Among the districts where maximum vaccination was reported are Indore (48108 doses), Ujjain (24761 doses), and Ratlam (24633 doses). In state capital Bhopal, merely 2600 doses of vaccines were administered as there was no mass vaccination here, only the available vials were used.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/low-stocks-vac-drive-suffers-setback-in-8-dists/articleshow/84422456.cms||---

According to the data given by the MMC, of the 4.75 lakh estimated beneficiaries above the age of 18 years, only 47,889 have been vaccinated with the first dose so far. Of these, only 16,045 people have taken the second dose. “The vaccination is very low at some centres, while it has picked up pace in other centres. We are taking efforts to cut down this disparity,” said Dr Archana Bhavasar, the reproductive and child health officer of MMC, who is nodal officer for vaccination. There are 18 vaccination centres and the footfall is good at nine of these, where 90 to 150 beneficiaries come per day. The remaining nine get visits from 20 to 70 beneficiaries. The officer said that there were misgivings about the vaccines such as ‘it spreads the infection, it leads to serious ailments in future’. “The commissioner recently reviewed the situation and underlined the need to take help of the elected representatives, the religious leaders and even the Unani doctors. Their photographs and their appeal can be used a message to the people to get vaccinated,” Dr Bhavsar said. Such messages would be carried through hoardings and social media in Urdu language. “Till date, we did not use messages in Urdu. Now, we will have some hoardings and social media messages in the Urdu language,” she said. Municipal commissioner Bhalchandra Gosavi said, “We have been appealing to the people to take the vaccine so that they have safety against the infection. The awareness is growing among the people but the rate is too slow.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/malegaon-to-rope-in-religious-heads-for-a-push-to-vax-drive/articleshow/84417518.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Patna||Bihar: Two SPs removed for nexus with sand mafia||PATNA: The state government on Wednesday removed the SPs of Aurangabad and Bhojpur and half a dozen other officers for their alleged nexus with sand mafia in their respective districts. The action has been taken on the Economic Offences Unit (EoU) report of state police after conducting inquiry into the illegal sand mining in Sone river in Patna, Bhojpur, Saran, Aurangabad, Arwal and Rohtas districts. Aurangabad SP Sudheer Kumar Porika and Bhojpur SP Rakesh Kumar Dubey have been attached to the police headquarters while Bhojpur motor vehicle inspector (MVI) Vinod Kumar has been suspended. Aurangabad district transport officer (DTO) Anil Kumar Sinha, who also had additional charge of Rohtas DTO, Patna DTO Purushottam, Gaya MVI Mrityunjay Kumar Singh, Patna MVI Kumar Vivek and the SDO of Dehri in Rohtas, Sunil Kumar Singh, have been attached to their respective department headquarters in Patna. Apart from Vinod's suspension, no specific reason has been mentioned for removal of the other officials, including the two SPs. Porika is a 2010-batch IPS officer while Dubey was promoted to the IPS cadre from the state police service. Home department sources said the inquiry was conducted after getting nod from CM Nitish Kumar. Sources said the EOU report has been placed before the CM and his nod is awaited to initiate legal action against the officers and others. “The detailed report against all these officers, including to the SPs, are before the CM to seek direction over further action against them,” a senior EoU official said. Mining department principal secretary Harjot Kaur Bamhrah had flagged the issue of rampant illegal sand mining. In her letter to DGP SK Singhal on May 17, she mentioned that illegal mining, storage and transportation of sand could not be possible in the six districts without the connivance of the police personnel concerned. She had asked the DGP to take strict action in this regard. Sand mining is banned from May 1. But videos of illegal sand mining and transportation kept on circulating on social media showing police personnel accepting money from truckers transporting sand in Bhojpur and other districts. A senior bureaucrat said transactions worth several crores in the bank accounts of the officers concerned are under the EOU scanner. He said several SDPOs, circle inspectors, SHOs, mining inspectors, DTOs, MVIs and SDOs are in the line of fire on the basis of the EOU report. Ten SHOs and police officers were transferred recently after repirts of sand mining and transportaion under their respective jurisdictions. Aurangabad, Bhojpur get new SPs The state home department transferred Patna rural SP Kantesh Kumar Mishra to Aurangabad as SP. Danapur SDPO Vineet Kumar will replace Mishra. Patna City SP (central) Vinay Tiwary will be the new Bhojpur SP. Barh SDPO Ambrish Rahul will replace Tiwary.

---||Kolhapur||Nagpur-Ratnagiri highway layout mapped in Kolhapur||KOLHAPUR: Layout mapping of the Nagpur-Ratnagiri National Highway 166 — which is a dream project of road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari — started between Kerle and Shiye villages in the Kolhapur district on Monday. Local opposition to the project has necessitated heavy police deployment. Villagers from Kerle, who are opposing the layout mapping activity, tried to argue with the authorities, but had to step back due to police warnings. Earlier, a separate layout had been proposed for the project. But due to opposition from the villagers, a new 5km bypass has now been finalised. However, the villagers are opposing the layout mapping for the bypass as well. Mahesh Gaikwad, a farmer from Kerle, said, “The current layout affects several acres of farmland and around 50 homes in Kerle village. Due to political interference, the earlier proposed route was changed. However, the new layout mapping is affecting our farmlands and houses. When we tried to oppose the mapping activity, the police threatened to take in custody.” Meanwhile, the villagers in Bhuyewadi are still confused about what is happening. Rohit Patil, a resident of Bhuyewadi, said: “We haven’t received any notice or any intimation. They directly came with the cops and started marking the highway borders. Those who had opposed the highway work in 2017 have been spared in the current layout. It seems like this has been managed with political influence. Around 21 homes and acres of farmland are now coming under the proposed route. It has only been six months since we had constructed a new house on non-agricultural land at Bhuyewadi. Now, authorities have taken our home and also our farm in the new proposed layout. They said that that we will get four times of our land value as per the ready reckoner rate as compensation”. Sardar Patil, from Kushire village, said: “Out of my 100 guntha land, 83 guntha is coming under this proposed layout. What will I do with the remaining land? They didn’t give us any notice nor have they spoken about the compensation. The villagers are still confused.” Vasant Pandarkar, the project director in Kolhapur, said, “The proposed route, as per the layout done in 2017, was opposed by the villagers. Therefore, a new bypass avoiding the Kerle village was proposed and sanctioned. Those who will lose land or residential property will be given compensation according to government norms and by the public works department under district collectors guidance”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/nagpur-ratnagiri-highway-layout-mapped-in-kolhapur/articleshow/84417523.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Sood said he will comply with the order. The BMC’s K-West ward issued a letter to the actor asking him to revert the building status to residential and remove all unauthorised constructions and alterations. The action comes after municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal approved a proposal from Sood’s architects to restore the change of user of the building back to residential, which the actor had allegedly converted into a hotel without necessary permission from BMC. “The deputy chief engineer of the building proposal department, western suburbs, said the municipal commissioner has approved the proposal…the commissioner further said that the assistant municipal commissioner be told to take action against unauthorised constructions, if any. You are instructed to remove the unauthorised work...within 15 days, else this office will take further action without any further intimation,” stated the June 29 letter to Sood and his architects, Paarth Architural Consultants. Sood told TOI, “Our restoration proposal has been approved and we are following all orders...We will continue to follow all rules in the future too. The recent letter is about some structures that do not belong to us in the same building. But if anything has to be done on our end, we will do it as advised.” Activist Ganesh Kusmulu, who had filed a complaint with Lokayukta against Sood, said the police must register an FIR against the actor. “The BMC and police have tried to delay the matter. The illegal construction must be demolished and an FIR filed immediately. I will move the Lokayukta against those who fail to take action if Sood and his architects do not demolish the structures within 15 days as per the letter,” he said.

---||Kolkata||After 61 days, Kolkata metro to resume weekday runs from July 16||KOLKATA: After 61 days, Metro Railway on Friday will resume services on weekdays from 8am to 9pm. While the North-South corridor will run 192 services, East-West Metro or Line 2 will run 48 trains in both the directions. Commuters can board trains using smart cards. No token will be issued. Services will start from Dakshineswar and Kavi Subhas terminals at 8am and end at 8pm. While there will be no train on Sundays, only special services (192) for essential staff of various sectors will run on Saturdays. Those trains will start at 8am and the last trains will leave the terminal stations at 8pm. The carrier put a brake on public services from May 16, as the state government announced Covid-safety restrictions. According to the unlocking guidelines, Metro can operate from Monday to Friday only, with 50% passengers. The North-South Metro, which is the city’s transport lifeline, registered less than 50% of the full-capacity footfall ever since it resumed services in September, last year. In pre-Covid times, Metro registered at least 2,000 passengers a train at a time. As the pandemic struck, the count nosedived to 500 or barely 25% of capacity. In the absence of local trains, the North-South Metro, which runs from Kavi Subhas station or Patuli in the south to Dakshineswar in the north, will now work with 81 services on each direction. As the second wave raged and chief minister Mamata Banerjee announced suspension of local trains from May 6, Metro Railway had to automatically reduce its services from 216 to 192. At that time, Metro GM Manoj Joshi had said, “We have to reduce trains in the absence of local trains. Our staff members will now have to depend on the Eastern Railway and South-Eastern Railway staff specials to report to work. Our operational hours must match with the staff specials.” Though the general public are not allowed on Metro till now, the carrier started operating staff special trains along the 32km North-South corridor. Since last Monday, 104 specials have been available on both directions on the corridor. “This service will be available on Saturdays,” Metro spokesperson Rupayan Mitra said. On Saturdays, essential staff associated with health care service, veterinary service, assembly, law and order, courts, social welfare homes, banks, correctional services, power, drinking water supply, telecom, internet, fire services, disaster management and civil defence, sanitation, NGO and private sector associated with essential services, food and beverages, insurance, press, sewerage and funeral services can board the specials with their ID and Metro smart cards. The GM on Tuesday inspected the under-construction Noapara-Bimanbandar Metro to assess the progress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-61-days-metro-to-resume-weekday-runs-from-july-16/articleshow/84422484.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: It is Eatala Rajender’s self-deception, says TRS president KT Rama Rao||HYDERABAD: TRS working president KT Rama Rao said former minister Eatala Rajender should tell people what injustice was done to him in the TRS. He also said Eatala was resorting to self-deception in the name of self-respect. During an interaction with reporters at Telangana Bhavan on Wednesday, KTR said he had personally tried to convince Eatala to stay in the party, but was helpless after Eatala openly declared that he had no intention to meet TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. He said Eatala should first introspect about his stint in the TRS and the roles bestowed upon him by the party leadership. Reacting for the first time after Eatala quit the party and joined the BJP a month ago, KTR said despite being a minister, Eatala often criticised the cabinet decisions openly. “The former Huzurabad MLA claimed that there was a gap with KCR for the last five years. If that was the case, why did he continue in the party and cabinet all these years. Even after questioning government’s decisions openly, KCR continued him in the cabinet,” KTR said. On the government’s action on Eatala over alleged encroachments of assigned land by the poultry firm owned by his family members, KTR said the CM acted on a complaint along with evidence. “It was not an anonymous letter. In fact, the ex-minister had accepted his mistake. He won’t get public sympathy on his exit and land encroachment allegations.” The municipal administration minister said the erstwhile Kamalapuram constituency (Huzurabad in delimitation) has been a TRS stronghold and the forthcoming bypoll will be a contest among the parties and not among individuals. He attacked BJP Telangana president Bandi Sanjay Kumar on his proposed padayatra. “The BJP president owes an answer to the people on what the Centre had done for the state. While funds are being released to other states under Jal Jeevan mission, Telangana has got nothing,” he said. Ridiculing YSRTP chief YS Sharmila’s one-day fast on unemployment issue, KTR said: “Some people carry out ‘vratams’ every week, this is also one such vratam.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/it-is-eatalas-self-deception-ktr/articleshow/84424735.cms||Koride Mahesh

The central government has made hallmarking of gold jewellery mandatory for jewellers with a turnover of above Rs 40 lakh. There are over 2,000 jewellers in the city with a turnover of Rs 40 lakh who will have to hallmark the gold jewellery. So far, 288 jewellers have enrolled online with the government and the deadline for registration is August 30. Thereafter, jewellers will have to sell only hallmarked jewellery. Chetan Rajapurkar, senior office-bearer of Nashik Jewellers Association, said the hallmarking of gold jewellery has been made mandatory in 256 out of the total 736 districts in the country. In Maharashtra, it has been made mandatory in 22 of the 36 districts. “Jewellers have already started registering their outlets with the government online. Those who have registered their outlets have started hallmarking on the gold jewellery,” he said. Around 60% of the jewellery sold in Nashik is manufactured in Mumbai, while the rest of 40% is made in Nashik itself. The issue of hallmarking is only with the 40% of jewellery is manufactured in Nashik. Rajapurkar, who is also the Maharashtra director of India Bullion & Jewellers Association (IBJA), said there is a need for more hallmarking centres in Nashik. It costs around Rs 1 crore to set up a hallmarking centre. “We have demanded subsidy or incentive from the government for setting up the hallmarking centres, but the government has given incentives to those districts that do not have a single hallmarking centre,” Rajapurkar said. Currently, only one private firm is setting up a new hallmarking centre making it the fifth such centre in Nashik. The number of hallmarking centres will increase if the government gives subsidies to all the districts in a blanket manner, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/5th-gold-hallmarking-centre-to-come-up-in-nashik-city/articleshow/84417602.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Mumbai||'JJ doctors perform record, maximum Covid autopsies'||MUMBAI: During the first wave in Mumbai in 2020, when little was known about Covid -19, doctors in state-run JJ group of hospitals carried out 51 autopsies on victims using minimally invasive techniques instead of cutting open bodies to understand how the SARS2 virus affected various organs. On Wednesday, their findings were published in an indexed medical journal, ‘Surgical and Experimental Pathology’. The study establishes that minimally invasive methods are as effective as open methods to find out the cause of deaths, and showed clots and inflammation in various organs other than the lungs. Of the 51 victims (29 men and 22 women), 43 patients were over 40 years of age and 44 needed ventilator support. Most of them had comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and chronic kidney disease. In 90% (44) of the patients, the study team found lung damage, and evidence of heart muscles being affected by the virus in 39 patients. Covid accelerates disease progression, says studyDoctors in JJ group of hospitals carried out 51 autopsies on Covid-19 victims to understand how the SARS2 virus affected various organs. The virus affected the kidneys of 24 victims, while 29 showed liver changes. “Our series of minimally invasive autopsies on Covid-19 patients is the largest in the world so far,” said the study’s main author, Dr Ajay Bhandarwar, head of JJ Hospital’s general surgery department. When Dr Bhandarwar, along with pathology head Dr Sanjay Bijwe and radiology head Dr Shilpa Domkundwar, started the study in August 2020, only doctors in Italy had carried out similar autopsies and announced that Covid-19 triggers clotting in blood vessels that leads to death. A few autopsies have been done in teaching hospitals in Bhopal, Ahmedabad and New Delhi (the Indian Council for Medical Research advises against open autopsies of Covid victims due to the higher risk). “The pathological involvement of multiple organs on microscopic analysis supports our finding that Covid-19 infection is a multi-organ process that involves the lung, kidneys, liver, heart and spleen, and may, in fact, produce pathological changes in other organ systems which were not examined within our study,” said Dr Bijwe. The team carried out the autopsies in St George’s Hospital, which was a Covid hospital, while the main JJ Hospital in Byculla was a non-Covid hospital. “Within two hours of a death occurring, we had to contact the victim’s family and seek permission for the autopsy,” said one of the authors, Dr Nikhil Dhimole. While the families of victims were initially hesitant, the fact that the body wouldn’t be cut open helped change the minds of 51 families. The autopsy was carried out in a side room of the Covid ward, with doctors from the radiology and surgery departments collecting tissues from various organs using biopsy needles under ultrasound guidance. More important, the study found Covid-19 accelerated disease progression. In four patients who were recently diagnosed with a kidney problem, their autopsies found the Covid-19 infection had worsened their kidney functions. Incidentally, when the study was being carried out between August and November 2020, 38 doctors from the general surgery department were affected by Covid-19. “There is no way to link the autopsies to our contracting the disease as we would work in Covid wards for long hours every day,” said a doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-deaths-study-shows-multi-organ-damage-clots/articleshow/84426551.cms||Malathy Iyer

According to police, Anupam Dubey, is facing at least 41 criminal cases including that of murder and attempt to murder. He has also been booked under Goonda Act, Arms Act, Gangster Act and NDPS Act. Back in 1996, he was booked for the murder of police inspector Ramniwas Yadav on-board a train. Yadav was in-charge of Gurshaiganj police station of Kannauj. Police had filed a charge-sheet against Anupam for the murder in July, 1996. Besides Anupam, his uncle Kaushal Dubey and one Nem Kumar were also named as accused in the case. Kumar was killed in an encounter with police in 2007. Kaushal was allegedly killed by his own nephew, Anupam, in 2005 and an FIR was registered against him in Mainpuri. He was also declared a “history sheeter” by Farrukhabad police in 1999. Superintendent of police (SP) of GRP (Agra), Mohammd Mustaq, told TOI that Anupam had obtained a stay on his arrest in 1997 which expired in 2003. In that year, a railway court issued a non-bailable warrant against Anupam, but he was never arrested. In between, Anupam unsuccessfully contested assembly elections on BSP ticket in 2012 from Farrukhabad and in 2017 from Hardoi. He also managed to get the membership of Farrukhabad Bar Council. A ‘kurki’ order warrant was issued against him in 2008 but he did not appear before the court. And again, on July 4, the railway court issued a non-bailable and ‘kurki’ warrant against him. SP Mustaq said, “The process of attaching Anupam’s property has been stopped after he surrendered in the court. However, he has surrendered in some other murder case which is pending against him." When contacted, senior superintendent of police (SSP) Farrukhabad, Ashok Meena, said, “Property seizure was the joint operation of district police and GRP police.” Meena added, “41 criminal cases have been registered against Anupam in UP’s Mainpuri, Farrukhabad, Kanpur, Fatehgarh and Kannauj.” After surrendering in court, Anupam told the media that only three cases are pending against him. “Fake cases have been registered against me,” said Dubey, adding that it could be a political conspiracy against him by opponents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/on-the-run-for-17-years-for-killing-cop-neta-surrenders-in-up-court/articleshow/84420004.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Delhi government said these institutions are expected to extend maximum support so that maximum students should have access to education by having convenient financial atmosphere through schools. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and justice Jyoti Singh, after hearing arguments for hours, said it would continue hearing the submissions on Thursday. The court was hearing various pleas by Delhi government, students and an NGO challenging a single judge order allowing private unaided schools to collect annual and development charges from students for the period after the lockdown ended in the national capital last year. “Being regulator of the school education, appellant (Delhi government) cannot ignore the acute financial pressure and stress on general public where lot of children have lost their one or both parents or source of earning has depleted or the jobs and businesses have vanished due to lockdown in current pandemic, which is continuing since March 2020,” Delhi government, represented through senior advocate Vikas Singh, said. Singh said therefore, such an attempt of schools to run on commercial lines instead of being charitable in nature to recover amount on the presumption that normal physical functioning has resumed is “improper, harsh and unjustified”. Senior advocate and Delhi government standing counsel Santosh Kumar Tripathi, argued that the single judge gravely erred in passing the directions on the basis of a Supreme Court order relating to collection of school fees. The counsel said the single judge overlooked the fact the Supreme Court judgement pertained to the state of Rajasthan and imposition of tuition fee was for a time when schools had physically reopened there, which is not the case in Delhi.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: ‘Normal market hours to boost supply, cool off prices’||KOLKATA: Markets selling essential items like vegetables, fish and meat heaved a sigh of relief with the government on Wednesday restoring usual operational hours. Malls though may get only an additional hour in the morning. Though the relaxation announced on Wednesday stated malls and shops could function during normal business hours, mall management said the night restrictions between 9pm and 5am meant they would have to shut at 8pm, the closure hour, for people to return home. For other markets though, Wednesday’s relaxations will mean huge relief as they currently operate from 7am to noon, allowing vendors and traders only a five-hour window to conduct business. Till now, the unsold perishables cannot be sold in the evening. “We had to dump the leftover perishable items as they cannot be sold the next morning,” said a vendor at Jadubabu Bazar at Bhowanipore. The resumption of usual operational hours would improve the supply line and help vendors take a good quantity of vegetables to retail markets, said Kamal De, president, Bengal Vendors’ Association. “This will also cool off prices to some extent. The limited window of selling vegetables made them afraid to off-take sufficient vegetables. Thus prices of vegetables were soaring high,” said De. “As our shops are located within the markets, we also had to adhere to the four hours for buying and selling grocery items. It was difficult to stock things up and sell things within those fixed hours,” Biswanbhar Saha, a grocery retailer at Behala Old market. Buyers were also relieved that the timings had been relaxed. “This easing of timing will give me the freedom to go to market at my convenience, when the crowd will be less. The deadline had led to overcrowding,” said Sananda Ghosh, a housewife from Parnashree. Many vendors were disappointed that local trains had not been allowed to run. “Around 70% vegetables are brought to the city by trains. If we spend Rs 100 for transporting goods by train, we pay Rs 1,000-Rs 2,000 to come by road,” said Garia Market Vendors’ Association secretary Ambika Charan Ghosh. Retail markets, where timings have not changed much, hoped for trains to run. “Retail business is affected by lack of manpower,” said Confederation of West Bengal Trade Associations president Sushil Poddar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/normal-market-hours-to-boost-supply-cool-off-prices/articleshow/84422623.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The issue had surfaced after the BJP submitted a plan to the Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority for the construction of its state head office in the Mauja Ladpur area of Doon. “We have included the construction of offices of national political parties in the zoning regulation of the Dehradun Masterplan-2025 on the residential land use. The development authority can now permit construction of offices of the national political parties,” agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said. Besides, the cabinet has cancelled the transfer of 14.5 acres of land of Rajikya Resham Farm and Resham Farm Ambadi to rehabilitate the people affected by the Lakhwar-Vyasi project. Due to the Covid pandemic, recruitment exams organised by the Uttarakhand Subordinate Services Selection Commission in the last 18 months have either been cancelled or postponed. As a result, several aspirants have crossed the maximum age limit. “In view of the pandemic, we have extended a year’s age relaxation to the people appearing for Grade C government jobs,” said Uniyal. Also, the cabinet has approved a total of 501 jobs for three government medical colleges at Srinagar, Haldwani and Dehradun. Among these, 122 posts have been approved for Srinagar, 250 for Dehradun and 129 for Haldwani. Meanwhile, the cabinet has asked the authorities to take a call in the matter concerning the payment of Transport Department employees – which is pending in Court – after consulting the finance department. The cabinet also provided a free-of-cost 40.8 square metre land for the construction of chambers for lawyers at the Bageshwar district court premises. The cabinet also allowed the inclusion of physically challenged persons under the provisions of the National Food Security Act of 2013.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cabinet-brings-construction-of-offices-of-national-political-parties-under-provisions-of-doon-master-plan-2025/articleshow/84419992.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Dehradun||Locals seek cancellation of hydro projects in flash flood-hit Chamoli, Uttarakhand high court fines petitioners Rs 50,000 for ‘motivated plea’||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 each on five petitioners who had filed a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking cancellation of two hydropower projects in upper-Himalayas in Chamoli district, where over 200 people lost their lives in flash floods in February this year. The bench observed that the petition seems to be “highly motivated” and the petitioners were “mere puppets in the hands of an unknown puppeteer”. According to court records, the petition was filed by five people – Sangram Singh, Sohan Singh, Bhawan Rana, Atul Sati and Kamal Raturi – three of whom claimed to be residents of Raini village while the two others said they were from Joshimath. The petition stated they were known social workers and village representatives from the area “who have been raising concerns for protecting the sensitive environment of the region for a long time”. It added that the petitioners were public-spirited persons and the cause they were raising was “for the benefit of the public at large”. The petition demanded cancellation and revocation of forest and environmental clearances given to two hydropower projects – Rishiganga and NTPC’s Tapovan-Vishnugad hydropower project – located in the region. The bench of chief justice RS Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma, however, held that there was “not a shred of evidence produced by the petitioners to establish that they were either social workers or activists and yet they were demanding that the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change should be directed to revoke the environmental clearance given to the projects. While dismissing the PIL, the court said the petition amounted to the misuse of the PIL jurisdiction and that it was not convinced of the petition’s bona fide. The fine obtained from the petitioners should be deposited in the advocates’ welfare fund, the judges ruled. Apart from seeking cancellation of the projects, the petitioner had also demanded disbursal of compensation to families who lost their members during the flash floods, to blacklist NTPC – a PSU and the country’s largest energy conglomerate – and to fix the accountability “for criminal negligence in continuing the unscientific and harmful construction and operation” of the projects. The petitioners had also sought a ban on blasting riverbed mining and stone crushing activities in the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/locals-seek-cancellation-of-hydro-projects-in-flash-flood-hit-chamoli-hc-fines-petitioners-rs-50k-for-motivated-plea/articleshow/84420026.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Aurangabad||In Marathwada, soyabean gains over cotton||AURANGABAD: The area of cotton cultivation in Marathwada has reduced during this kharif season as more farmers have opted for soyabean over the traditional cash crop, implying a gradual shift in the cropping pattern in the region. As per official data, the Aurangabad agricultural division — covering Aurangabad, Jalna and Beed districts — has reported soyabean sowing on 4.03 lakh hectare. This is 123% of the expected soyabean sowing. Latur division, which covers the remaining five districts of Marathwada has also seen soyabean sowing of 105% (13.99 lakh hectare). On the other hand, cotton sowing has taken place only on 67% of the expected area of 6.97 lakh hectare in the Aurangabad division and 65% expected area (3.58 lakh hectare) in the Latur division as per the latest official data till July 5. Aurangabad district agricultural superintendentTukaram Mote said soyabean has been emerging as a preferred crop over cotton in the region. “A range of factors, including lower cultivation cost, shorter harvesting period and resistance to more diseases and pests, has made soyabean an attractive crop for the farmers. Moreover, the unique ability of soyabean to increase soil fertility with nitrogen-fixation and international demand for the oilseed crop as animal and poultry feed also fetches good returns for the farmers,” he said. In addition, soyabean is traditionally supplied to oil mills for production of edible oils and other derivates. This is considered an advantage of soyabean over cotton. Vilas Deshpande, an Aurangabad-based farmer, who has cultivated soyabean on over 2.5 acre during the ongoing kharif season, said the attack of pink bollworm on cotton crops in the recent past was one of the reasons for the shift in cropping pattern. “Also, soyabean reaches the harvesting stage within 100-110 days, whereas cotton requires five months. The reduced harvesting time helps farmers cultivate supplementary crops, like chickpea, boosting the income,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/in-marathwada-soyabean-gains-over-cotton/articleshow/84417700.cms||Prasad Joshi

The nearly 23-km-long extension of the Red Line (Rithala-Shaheed Sthal New Bus Adda) is going to be the first ‘Metrolite’ corridor of the capital, with the trains running on rail-based dedicated corridor on the middle of the road, which will be fenced from both sides. Since this corridor will bring some much-needed public transport connectivity to DDA’s Narela sub-city, it has decided to contribute Rs 1,000 crore for the development of the project. “Joint site inspections have taken place from time to time. We have received a letter from DDA regarding contribution of Rs 1,000 crore in instalment for the corridor,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC. “DMRC has suggested that one single alignment cannot serve the entire area with just one corridor. Therefore, in addition to the original corridor already proposed between Rithala and Narela, a spur of 5.6 km length from Puth Khurd to Holambi Kalan may be planned,” he said.

In a petition filed by first accused S Vijayan and Thampi S Durgadutt, for anticipatory bail, they have demanded that the CBI probe should also include the land deals between CBI DIG Rajendra Nath Kaul and Anjali Srivastava, the wife of former state police chief Raman Srivastava. The petitioners said Narayanan had transferred land at Nanguneri in Tirunelveli to Kaul, who was the investigating officer in the spy case, and to Anjali Srivastava, in 2004. Srivastava was South Zone IG at the time of the spy case and there were allegations against him at the time, the petition said. Further, the petitioners alleged that land was transferred to senior politicians from West Bengal. It is to be probed why Narayanan conducted land transactions with them, the petitioners have demanded. CBI’s counsel submitted that these details cannot be considered by the court in an anticipatory bail plea. Petitioners’ counsel submitted that these records were produced before CBI but the agency did not accept it. The court dismissed pleas filed by Maldivians Mariyam Rasheeda and Fousiya Hassan to join in the case as they had defects. The court scheduled a hearing on July 19 to hear Narayanan’s arguments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/probe-land-deals-involving-scientist/articleshow/84422637.cms||---

Raghubir Gupta has been booked under sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Disaster Management Act and The Epidemic Diseases Act. The tempo was stopped at a nakabandi in Vakola on May 9 last year. The prosecution said they showed a letter of permission to go out of the state taken by one Ajay Gupta. But it was found to be forged. Ajay said Raghubir, who is his maternal uncle, had given it to him. In his plea, Raghubir claimed he was in UP and was not connected to the matter. He denied preparing the fake letter. The court said Ajay had disclosed Raghubir as the creator of the forged letter. “In view of this, even if the present accused was not there when the tempo was intercepted, it is inconsequential,” said the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-pre-arrest-bail-for-travel-in-lockdown-with-forged-letter/articleshow/84424835.cms||Rebecca Samervel

On Wednesday, as per the Cowin portal, the state had administered third highest vaccine doses in the entire country. A total of around 3.69 lakh vaccine doses were administered in the state on Wednesday. Vaccination in the state gained momentum from June 21, when the mega vaccination drive was started. On the very first day, 17 lakh doses were administered. In the first week of the drive from June 21 to June 26, a total of 46.32 lakh doses were administered. However, after the first week, there were several hiccups primarily due to the unavailability of vaccines. Sources said that the condition in the state is such now that if vaccines are available then it is no wonder that more than 20 lakh doses are administered in a day, as more and more people are now rushing to the vaccination centres. But there is always an uncertainty about the availability of vaccines. Vaccination of people aged above 45 years started in the state from March 1 and vaccination of beneficiaries aged above 18 years started in the state on May 5. In the initial days, when the vaccine availability was more limited, state had utilised whatever vaccine was available. The state was also the fastest state to vaccinate more than 50 lakh people in the 18 plus category. Medical education minster Vishwas Sarang said, “We are in constant talks with the union government for vaccines. Union government is ensuring the availability of vaccines, production and supply is also being increased. Compared to June, 2 crore more vaccines will be supplied to state governments by the central government. Things will improve in the next couple of months.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-vax-count-2-45cr-fastest-50l-in-18-group/articleshow/84422639.cms||Amarjeet Singh

Police teams from Mukundwadi and MIDC Cidco managed to nab three accused, while two managed to flee. The arrests were made after the police chased one of the two cars of the accused for several minutes, The accused were caught at a dead-end in the Sindhiban area. The arrested men have been identified Rohitsingh Bahadursingh (29) and Ankush Maurya (22), both from rural areas of Pratapgadh; and Sanjaykumar Pal (21) of Prayagraj, in Uttar Pradesh. Police have also seized a car with registration number UP 70 FC 0387. Aurangabad police commissioner Nikhil Gupta told TOI: “This is a major detection as the accused have confessed to targeting several ATM units not just in Aurangabad, but across Maharashtra.” The officer said the process of verifying their background is underway and help from the Uttar Pradesh Police has been sought for gathering required details. Deputy commissioner of police Deepak Girhe said though an ATM was being targeted within the limits of one police station, the neighbouring police station too pitched in. Soon after receiving the alert, they swung into action and caused the arrests. MIDC Cidco police station’s inspector Vitthal Pote said an offence has been registered. He said that on carrying spot inspection, it was found that the accused had broken the shutter assembly of the ATM unit and stole Rs 13,000 comprising 26 notes of Rs 500 each. “Before they could steal more cash, they were arrested. Their custody will be sought for extracting more details including the ATM units they have targeted in different parts of the state,” said Pote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/alert-citizen-foils-inter-state-gangs-atm-theft-attempt/articleshow/84417753.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Pune||Set time frame, keep plan B ready: Past candidates to Maharashtra Public Service Commission aspirants||PUNE: Candidates who have earlier appeared for the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) have said that aspirants should have a time frame in mind within which they wish to clear the exam and keep a plan B ready in case they fail to succeed. Over 3.6 lakh students appear for the MPSC exam as per a rough estimate of the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) Students Rights organisation, a voluntary group of students working for the cause of candidates preparing for MPSC. The written examination is cleared by around 6,000 students. From them, around 400 make it to the final list. Despite this, students, especially from rural areas, spend 10-15 years of their life preparing for the exam. To provide for the cost of living in cities like Pune, many students are forced to sell farming land etc, building further pressure on them to succeed. TOI spoke to many past aspirants to understand what it takes to pass the exam and the difficulties faced by them. Kiran Nimbhore and Mahesh Bade, who along with some other candidates started the MPSC students’ rights organisation, said that inordinate delay in holding the examination was the biggest problem facing aspirants. “I prepared for the MPSC exams for three years. There were no advertisements in those years. The advertisement for class B and lower classes was announced two years ago but till now exams have not been conducted.. Kiran Nimbore, another MPSC aspirant who is now into business, said that the IAS, IPS and other officers who go to schools and colleges to give inspirational speeches to students and parents also need to give them a reality check as to how tough the competition is and why having a plan B is important. Prerit Kothare from Gadchiroli prepared for three years and even cleared the preliminary exams, but not the next round. “I knew that it was too tough for my intellectual ability because I was poor in English and could not afford the best coaching. I got help from friends who were officers, secured a bank loan and started a hostel. I paid off my loans and started another hostel. Government jobs are not everything. The world is big, and we owe it to ourselves and our families to earn an honest living,” said Kothare. Vijay Mate (30) tried various government examinations thrice before getting out of the rat race before becoming a poultry farmer. “People make fun of you for dreaming high and ending up as a small-time farmer in a remote village. We have started an outlet and branded it Desi Chicken and the business is going good,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/set-time-frame-keep-plan-b-ready-past-candidates-to-mpsc-aspirants/articleshow/84423148.cms||Ardhra Nair

While the daily count has fallen below 1,000 cases, active caseload is at 10,000 cases and 4073 people are still battling for their lives in hospitals. On Wednesday, a dozen hospitals in the city alone said they have a sizable number of patients on oxygen and added that the patient count was rising. “Some hospitals don’t have beds, as we have been waiting for the government to come up with a mutually agreeable tariff rate. But since there is new spike in cases, the beds will begin to fill up and so all issues need to be resolved for the sake of people,” Dr Kishan Rao, president of Telangana Hospitals and Nursing Home Association (THANA) said. The latest hospital occupancy details show that among the major Covid-19 treatment centres in the state, the Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) has all beds in all categories occupied, including 50 oxygen beds. Gandhi Hospital has 30 new patients being treated. “Looking at the spike in cases and admissions, the government has postponed its decision to begin non Covid-19 services in the hospital,” said a health department official. At the Chest Hospital, 14 are admitted in oxygen beds, while at King Koti hospital, 39 persons are taking oxygen treatment. The government-run ESI hospital also has 10 patients on oxygen treatment and there are another half a dozen private hospitals in city with sizeable number patients on oxygen beds. The bed scenario is worrisome, especially in Khammam where all the private hospitals are occupied. Reliable sources informed that more than 100 beds are occupied in Khammam’s government hospital. The occupancy of intensive care unit (ICU) beds has gone up slightly in Nizamabad too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/o2-beds-filling-up-with-covid-cases-health-dept-on-possible-spike-alert/articleshow/84423916.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

It has indeed taught us many lessons,’’ said professor Sher Ali, scientist and former director, Centre for Interdisciplinary Sciences, New Delhi. While delivering an online keynote address at the inaugural session of the two-day conference organised at the School of Sciences, Manuu, professor Ali said the important role of genetics was not being taken into consideration by the doctors. “While doctors generally look at a patient’s history and prescribe medicines through investigations. Genetics, which plays an important role in the spread of diseases, is being cornered,” said professor Ali. He said that only a multidisciplinary scientific approach and the usage of technology effectively will lead to useful and productive results. Meanwhile, professor SM Rahmatullah, vice-chancellor, highlighted how development and promotion of Urdu is being offered by the Urdu University. “Urdu University has offered significant services for the development and promotion of Urdu during the last 20 years. The new education policy also focuses exclusively on research and interdisciplinary education,” he said.

A businessman, who has multiple liquor off-shops in the city, said he was happy with the new timing, as going by the order, the establishment could start from 10am, as per the normal schedule. That meant, he said, the establishments would get an extra hour in the morning from now on. According to the relaxation guidelines issued by the government on Wednesday, all retail shops, including establishments selling non-essential goods, can operate in their normal business hours. But, sources in the excise department pointed out that, given the night restrictions from 9pm to 5am, all shops, including liquor off-shops, would have to shut before 9pm. So, the off-shop owner said, there would not be much business at night, until the establishments were allowed to operate till their usual timing of 11pm. A businessman, who has multiple liquor off-shops in the city, said that country spirits now did good business, along with beer, but the sale of IMFL was still 25%-30% down. “Beer sales would have improved if bars were allowed to operate till 11 at night,” he added. According to him, once the new timings were allowed, the average business at off-shops could rise to about 70%-75% of pre-Covid sales. Off-shops resumed over-the-counter sale from June 1 after over two weeks when Covid-safety restrictons were imposed. As soon as the shops had reopened, long queues of buyers had returned at the off-shops as they had to depend on the home delivery of their favourite spirits those past couple of weeks. Bars (liquor on-shops) in Bengal were shut from May 1 to June 1. To check the surge in Covid cases in the second wave of the pandemic, the state imposed strict restrictions from May 16, under which all liquor shops were closed and the rules were extended till June 15. Later from July 1, operation hours was extended further. There are 350 bars, along with over 1,500 off-shops and country spirit shops (CS shops too now allowed to sell IMFL) in Kolkata only. The total figure in Bengal is be more than 7,000, taking both bars and off-shops together.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/despite-relaxation-night-curbs-will-affect-liquor-biz/articleshow/84422675.cms||Udit Prasanna Mukherji

I can focus on home too,” she said. Divya leaves Godhra every morning and returns in the evening. “We have good employees at the shop who take care of things. In fact, they have taught me a lot and I can rely on them,” she said.

The device was developed by research scholars Madhusudan B Kulkarni, Srashti Goyal, professors Arti Dhar, D Sriram, and Sanket Goel as part of the project funded by the institute’s Center for Human Disease. The research has been published in Institute of Electrical & Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore. “For 30 cycles, it is taking about 26 minutes to get the result using the device we developed,” said Goel, associate professor, electrical and electronics engineering at the institute. While the conventional PCR machines are bulky and cost about Rs 4 lakh to Rs 5 lakh, the device developed by the researchers is compact and costs hardly Rs 2,000. “The device will fit in a palm and can be used anywhere as it is just plug and play. It is a miniaturised version. Further research has brought down cost by 50%, time taken to give a result to 20 minutes,” said Madhusudan, adding that in conventional PCR, it takes at least about 90 minutes to get a result. While the researchers had conducted their study to test tuberculosis, they said the same can be used to test Covid-19 and other diseases. “It can be used at room temperature. It has inbuilt heaters and can easily attain a maximum temperature of 300°C,” said Goel adding that IoT and bluetooth modules provide access to real-time temperature values that can be stored on a smartphone, making the device suitable for point-of care applications. The device has been designed using a carbon dioxide laser for PCR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/new-device-developed-by-bits-reduces-pcr-test-time/articleshow/84424422.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

So what can the state do to develop those skill sets that are useful to our children? One of the most popular things is that it is a tourism destination and we get lot of tourists not only from within the country but around the world.

Authorities have identified 11 areas across the border districts, where a spike has been observed. Health officials have been touring these areas, including Sattupalili and Madira. Local authorities have been told to bring positivity rate below 1 per cent immediately by conducting more tests, enforcing social distancing and early tracing. “It is better to refrain from attending large social gatherings, especially in closed rooms,” said Dr Kiran Madala, an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) certified researcher. Meanwhile, public health expert and assistant professor at UoH’s School of Management Studies, Dr Ranjit Kumar Dehury, said that there was a strong need for putting up social distance protocol regulation mechanism. Telangana health authorities also said they will follow the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) latest guidelines. According to WHO, Covid-19 testing during the non-peak stage should be more focused on conglomeration and identifying new areas of outbreaks while during the peak, every symptomatic person and every person who is a suspect should be tested. “We were asked to regularly monitor the positivity rate and inform the higher-ups,” a district level official said. Covid-19 surveillance has also been re-launched with immediate effect in many areas with potential spikes. In Khammam, over 1,000 people showed fever symptoms within two days. The state health department has blamed large gatherings, non-compliance of Covid-19 protocol and movement across borders as reasons for the spike in cases. At the ongoing Bonalu festivities in the city, 3 lakh people took darshan at Yellamma temple in Balkampet till Monday. Experts warn that though the second wave is waning, large congregations will lead to more infections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/authorities-order-more-testing-surveillance/articleshow/84423970.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Such was these shocked parents living in Parle Point area shocked to unearth that their underage son was smoking cigarettes. On counselling, the class XII student revealed that he started to smoke as an act of rebellion after his mother did not allow him to meet a girl whom he liked in his neighbourhood, nor his friends due to her fear of Covid. Surat counsellors are witnessing many cases of teenagers taking up smoking cigarettes or narcotics, unable to process the new normal of staying cooped up inside homes. “Children are not indulging in much of physical activity due to online classes and they spend most of their time on mobile phones. So occasionally when they are meeting their friends who are already addicted to smoking, they also take it up as an outlet,” said Himani Choksi, a city-based counsellor. She further said that earlier parents would argue when the children were not at home, but in the present circumstances, fights happen in front of them. “And to find ways to divert attention, children resort to experimenting with addictions,” she added. Those who have just gotten into college are going a step further as they find an escape through psychotropic substances. “I have been dealing with at least five kids, who are addicted to marijuana, daily. In the last four months there has been a surge in patients as compared to period since the pandemic struck,” said psychiatrist Mayank Aggarwal. He added that marijuana is easily and cheaply available which lures teens. Police too agree that addiction has increased among the teens and college students as peddlers admit having their large customer base among these groups. “As kids remain hooked to mobile phones without adult supervision, they consume all kinds of contents which influence them to such habits. We have witnessed during our policing activities that such habits have become a fad,” said a police official. Counsellors like child psychologist, Aarti Bundela, feel that while it is difficult to get rid of addiction, younger ones can be easily brought out of it, especially by kind, considerate parents. “Children can be brought out of addiction through proper counselling and support of parents at home. If parents have a transparent dialogue and indulge in constructive activities, kids will not get driven away,” Choksi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/teens-rebel-find-solace-in-drug-addictions/articleshow/84420178.cms||Jay Pachchigar

A team of 40 students has been hired by the university and they are being paid on hourly basis to create awareness about the university on various social media platforms.  The team reports directly to the vice-chancellor KN Chavda and its members are paid Rs 65 to Rs 100 per hour on the basis of their education and work profile. For the first time the university is focusing on building its image on social media since the social media platforms gained prominence.  “The reason behind the initiative is to highlight achievements of the university so that students and citizens can get accurate information. It is an attempt to bridge the communication gap,” said Chavda.  The students carry out the work on social media during their free time while on campus. Interestingly, only a handful of people know the team of students directly and they take orders only from VC to ensure that timely and accurate information is shared through the university handles.  Currently, the university is focusing on popularizing its handles and pages on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and mobile chat applications. “We are strengthening our presence on social media to compete with the private universities,” added Chavda.  The university has also made changes to its website and the updates on social media platforms are reflected on the home page.  Surat city and district has five private universities in competition to almost 60-year-old government universities. VNSGU caters to the biggest tribal region of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/vnsgu-begins-image-makeover-on-social-media/articleshow/84420322.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

I was confident of the Punjab issue being resolved on Wednesday but some minor factors were left (to be addressed) and it will be resolved shortly.” Rawat pointed out that Sidhu has taken a certain stand and has remained firm on a few issues. “At times, words said are taken in a wrong way and there are instances where some words may leave others in an uncomfortable situation. Sidhu is quite straight in expressing his opinion,” he said. Asked about the issues raised by Sidhu, Rawat said, “He wants culprits of the Guru Granth Sahib desecration incident of 2015 to be punished and has claimed that Congress had strongly raised the issue of drugs in the poll campaign and called for more effective measures to curb the menace.” Rawat claimed that in politics, there are many instances when two leaders are not pleased with each other. “But it is all about collective leadership and moving ahead in the right direction. Captain and Sidhu are members of the same party and it is our effort that they work together for the 2022 assembly polls,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/capt-sidhu-tussle-just-needs-few-loose-ends-to-be-fixed-harish-rawat/articleshow/84420125.cms||Kautilya Singh

After clearing Class X and XII, students only think of joining, BA, BSc, BCom, BBA programmes and do not think outside of these courses.

The 119-year-old structure, built by Hyderabad’s sixth Nizam Mahboob Pasha Ali, was barricaded by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation a few years ago following complaints from local residents. It was marked as a dilapidated building. Timber beams have been dangling dangerously from the dilapidated ceilings for years now.

The police suspect that the assailant killed Kadam to rob him of his valuables. Sub-inspector Santosh Kajale of the Bund Garden police has lodged a complaint in this regard. The police said Kadam was working with a hotel in Shirur taluka. He took leave from the hotel and was on his way to Mumbai. He reached Pune city from Shirur on Monday evening, but there was no Mumbai-bound vehicle available for him. “He decided to spend the night at the bus stop on the lane leading to the Sadhu Vaswani Road. He was fast asleep when a man assaulted him on the head with a sharp weapon in order to rob him of his valuables or cash,” the police said. The murder came to light around 8.45am on Monday when passersby informed the police about a person lying on the bus stop with head injuries. The police checked his pockets and found his ID card.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mumbai-resident-found-murdered-at-bus-stop/articleshow/84423191.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Petition in Uttarakhand high court alleges former CM favoured his OSD by sanctioning a bridge & road that had no public use||NAINITAL: A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Uttarakhand high court (HC) has alleged that former chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat extended favours to his Officer on Special Duty (OSD), Rakesh Kumar, by sanctioning the construction of a bridge and road in record time that provided access to his land but had no public use. The bench of chief justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma, however, noted that there were no photographs or maps of the area to substantiate the claims made in the petition. The bench therefore gave the petitioner – Umesh Sharma, owner of a local TV news channel – three weeks to produce the relevant documents. Advocate general (AG) SN Babulkar meanwhile raised questions on whether the PIL should be considered by the court, saying it does not follow the rules formulated by the HC. In response, the court has asked the AG to submit his contentions within three weeks. To recall, Sharma had also claimed last year that the former CM had accepted a bribe in return for appointing a person to head the Jharkhand Gau Seva Ayog in 2016 when he was the state in-charge of BJP’s Jharkhand unit. Sharma alleged that Rawat got the money transferred to the account of his relatives. Thereafter, the Trivendra Singh Rawat government got an FIR registered against Sharma, alleging extortion. Subsequently, Sharma approached the HC seeking quashing of the FIR against him. While hearing the petition, HC had asked the CBI to initiate an inquiry against the former CM. The order, however, was stayed by the Supreme Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/petition-in-hc-alleges-former-cm-favoured-his-osd-by-sanctioning-a-bridge-road-that-had-no-public-use/articleshow/84420248.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Kolkata||Will continue to lose diners due to 8pm deadline: Kolkata Restaurants||Kolkata: Bars and restaurants were disappointed by the new set of restrictions declared on Wednesday. They have been allowed to function during ‘normal hours’ but not beyond 8pm, which, according to restaurant-owners, will not make any significant difference to footfall. So far, they were allowed to stay open between noon and 8pm. “It doesn’t make any great difference for us as we can’t open or serve before noon. But the good thing is the footfall has been high. Kolkatans don’t start dining before 8.30pm but it’s changing. People are dropping in for an early dinner,” said Nitin Kothari, owner of Mocambo and Peter Cat on Park Street. But Hotel and Restaurants’ Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) believes this will not help. “Few restaurants can open before noon and get good business. With the 8pm restrictions on, we have lost the bulk of our customers,” said HRAEI president Sudesh Poddar, who also owns Song-Hai restaurant. But some said tea rooms and confectionaries, like Flury’s, might benefit. “They open early. But there are very few of them,” said a restaurant owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/will-continue-to-lose-diners-due-to-8pm-deadline-restaurants/articleshow/84422738.cms||---

With lockdown, fear of Covid-19 and financial disabilities put people of all ages through a wringer and left them mentally stressed. Chronic stress comes from a long-term unresolved situation and this also induces various types of illnesses. A survey conducted by Saurashtra University (SU)’s psychology department on various age groups of people found 45 percent teenagers victims of ‘chronic stress’, which is highest among all the age groups. A total of 1,080 people of all ages were surveyed by the psychologists. Two students of SU’s psychology department, N R Patel and Kartavi Bhatt, conducted this survey under the guidance of HOD, Yogesh Jogsan. The duo surveyed 243 children aged between 10 and 14 years, 152 teenagers of 14 to 17 years, 234 youth aged between 18 and 45 years, 270 middle-aged people of 46 to 60 years and 180 people aged above 60 years. In their survey, the researchers found 45 percent teenagers, 36 percent children and 36 percent youth victims of this long-term stress. Of the many reasons that afflict teenagers with stress, the foremost is their age which is inter-related to parents’ over controlling them during the pandemic out of fear. Restrictions on outdoor activities, under continuous watch and lack of socializing from school and colleges being closed led to irritation and panic in them. “Chronic stress is a physiological condition which also brings some illnesses. When the stressful situation arises often and it prolongs the normal stress that converts into the chronic one,” said Jogsan. He added that if this chronic stress is not addressed properly, it invites certain illnesses like diabetes, heart attack and other physical and psychological problems in the long run. According to psychologists, stress up to a certain limit is good that keeps people making progress in career and life. This is called positive stress. However, when it crosses the desired limit, stress reduces a person’s capacity to think and then it becomes negative factor leading to serious consequences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/pandemic-times-left-45-teens-suffering-from-chronic-stress-study/articleshow/84420283.cms||---

When the SDO and his team caught Aadil stealing power at his house on June 27, Aadil and two others attacked them, said police, adding that Aadil then opened fire at the SDO with his country-made pistol. After the incident, the UPPCL employees stopped their campaign against power theft, said police. Divulging details, SSP Vijay Dhull said, “We had booked Aadil under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 504 (intentional insult) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Aadil was arrested on June 29 and sent to jail. The incident had created a fear of the accused among the locals. Aadil is a professional criminal and had been to jail many a time.

Patil was speaking in Kolhapur on Wednesday lauding Pankaja’s attempt to calm down angry supporters. Many BJP post-holders resigned in protest for inducting Pritam into cabinet while many others arrived from other parties have recently been given cabinet berth. Patil said that Pankaja showcased immense maturity on Tuesday. “While giving justice to one, injustice happens with others. While Bhagwat Karad was inducted, Pritam was not. Similarly Ranjit Nimbalkar was not inducted by Narayan Rane and was made cabinet minister. Our country is big. Both Narendra Modi and Amit Shah study microscopically and take decision,” said Patil. Patil further said, “Gopinath Munde’s contribution to the party is immense. Pankaja has grown in such family and therefore she will never revolt against the party.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/pankaja-will-never-revolt-against-party/articleshow/84417876.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Rs 170 crore fraud accused paid Rs 7 crore for educational app||MUMBAI: Officials probing the Rs 170-crore cheating case involving a couple, both assistant managers with United India Insurance Company Ltd, have found that Khushal Singh had paid more than Rs 7 crore to a software development firm to create an educational software which he planned to use for business purposes. Police also alleged that he had booked 72 flats and commercial units and paid Rs 100 crore to developers in Gurgaon, Noida, Delhi, Ghaziabad and Jaipur. On June 28, the economic offences wing (EOW) had arrested Khushal (38) and his wife Neelam (33) from Pune. Khushal worked in the accounts department, while his wife was assistant manager in the IT department of the insurance firm. Jaideep Sinha, deputy general manager of United India Insurance, had lodged a complaint against the Singhs and others with Marine Drive police. The case was later transferred to the EOW. Investigators have created an escrow account for recovery of the money that Khushal had transferred to the developers and others. “The recovered money will be returned to the complainant’s firm,” said an officer. Till date, Rs 10 crore has been returned to the escrow account by four Gurgaon developers. Police said it has found more than Rs 11 crore in a single account where Singh had transferred money. “The account has been frozen,” added the officer. Around 70 bank accounts have been frozen so far. While Khushal allegedly booked dozens of properties, Neelam had signed on several property documents. “Khushal was the signatory authority for three accounts of the insurance firm and he allegedly transferred around Rs 170 crore to various accounts. Neelam is one of the beneficiaries,” said a police source. The couple is currently in judicial custody. A police team, headed by joint commissioner of police (EOW) Niket Kaushik and senior inspector Mandar Lad, is probing the case. Advocate Aashutosh Srivastava, lawyer for the Singhs, said, “There are negligible and insignificant allegations against Neelam in the FIR. As Khushal is concerned, the matter is still under investigation and nothing has been proven so far and it seems he has been made a scapegoat. The chances of a conspiracy against him by the higher management cannot be ruled out at this stage considering the fact that all such online money transfers were approved by the two higher authorities after Khushal and he had no such absolute power to transfer funds solely.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rs-170cr-fraud-accused-paid-rs-7cr-for-edu-app/articleshow/84424921.cms||Mateen Hafeez

Ajgaonkar alleged that money power used by the rivals led to the defeat of many a candidate fielded by BJP in Fatorda for the municipal elections. BJP general secretary and former Fatorda MLA Damodar Naik said that though several of BJP-backed candidates from Fatorda lost, it was for the first time that three BJP-backed candidates won from Fatorda. “This is only the beginning. BJP will win Fatorda constituency in the 2022 assembly elections,” he said. State BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said though Digambar Kamat’s alliance with GFP deprived BJP of a victory in the municipal polls, he expressed doubts over the longevity of the coalition. “For how long the coalition lasts, it’s a question mark,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vijai-has-set-fatorda-back-10-years-says-ajgaonkar/articleshow/84425068.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Debris from road construction being dumped in rivers, says plea; Uttarakhand high court issues notices to Centre, state, NHAI, BRO||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday issued notices to the Centre, the state as well as the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) after a petition alleged that debris from road construction work, including the all-weather Char Dham road in the Himalayan region were being dumped in rivers, villages and agriculture land in violation of laws. The bench of chief justice RS Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma has given the respondents four weeks to submit their reply. Notices have also been issued to the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM), principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF), Uttarakhand rural roads development agency, the central and state pollution control boards and the deputy director-general (forests) of the ministry of environment, forests and climate change. The public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Amit Kholia from Haldwani alleged that most of the roads being constructed or widened in the hills of the state were near slopes of forests or rivers and the executing agencies involved were dumping the muck generated directly into rivers, forests or agriculture land. The petition alleged that this was being done to save the transportation cost of carrying the muck and debris to the earmarked dumping sites. The plea said the projects were “using gigantic machines and thereby causing grave threat to the sensitive environment of Uttarakhand and preparing the state for impending disasters”. The petition further said the violations were not limited to the Char Dham all-weather road project but included work being done on state highways, district roads and even roads to villages. The plea added that the “unscientific disposal was not only damaging to the ecology, but was also one of the major reasons that aggravated the damage of the 2013 Kedarnath flash floods and the Chamoli disaster in February this year.” “The practice is in violation of the Environment Protection Act 1986, Waste Management Rules 2016, Hill Road Manual of 1998, as well as previous orders of the HC,” said Dushyant Mainali, counsel for the petitioner. The PIL asked the HC to direct the authorities to ensure compliance of muck disposal plans in a time-bound manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/debris-from-road-construction-being-dumped-in-rivers-says-plea-ukhand-hc-issues-notices-to-centre-state-nhai-bro/articleshow/84420272.cms||Prashant Jha

Defence lawyers Pratap Pardeshi and Kirti Kumar Gujar told the court that there was no evidence against Yemul guruji that he had committed an offence relating to voluntarily causing grievous hurt to the complainant under section 326 (A) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in the FIR and statements of witnesses recorded by the police. The lawyers submitted that Yemul was an astrologer and the Black Magic Act was silent on taking action against people like him. The lawyers argued that the session court had granted ad-interim anticipatory bail to five other suspects in the case and pleaded for release of Yemul on bail and furnished documents to show that he was suffering from medical ailments. The prosecution opposed Yemul’s bail by saying that the court had no jurisdiction to decide the bail plea in which section 326 of the IPC was invoked. The prosecution feared that Yemul may abscond and tamper with evidence if he was released on bail. The court after hearing both sides observed that there were no allegations against Yemul that he had caused hurt or abetted the offence against the complainant. The court upheld arguments of the defence lawyers and granted bail to Yemul.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/court-grants-bail-to-yemul-guruji-in-domestic-violence-case/articleshow/84423212.cms||---

When you have a government, you promise what is deliverable,” said Tanavade, terming Kejirwal’s promise an election gimmick. Kejriwal should not fool the people of Goa with promises that cannot be fulfilled, said Tanavade. “People of Goa have full faith in the BJP. The picture will be clear at the upcoming election. Delhi is Delhi and Goa is Goa....people will not fall for his election gimmick. People have seen what the BJP can do in Goa. They have seen the schemes we have offered like Laadli Laxmi,” the state BJP chief said. Tanavade said that th e Delhi chief minister is attempting to create an imaginary situation of disgruntlement among Goans. “Today he is harping on 10 Congress MLAs joining the BJP in Goa. He should first talk about the four MLAs in Punjab, who were elected on AAP ticket, but three returned to their party. He is trying to create an environment where he is trying to propagate something which is not true. Goans will not fall for these tactics,” said Tanavade. “We are carrying out our work. Many new members are joining the party, seniors in politics as well as youth who are working with social organisations,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-can-afford-to-promise-the-moon/articleshow/84425033.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ED takes possession of Iqbal Mirchi kin’s 2 floors in Ceejay House||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) recently took possession of two floors of Ceejay House at Worli in a money laundering case it is investigating against late drug smuggler Iqbal Mirchi and his family members. Ceejay House was constructed by a company associated with senior NCP leader Praful Patel. Mirchi’s wife Hajra Memon and her two sons, Asif and Junaid, own 14,500 square feet of office space on the third and fourth floors. Earlier, the ED had attached the floors in the case, which was subsequently confirmed by the adjudicating authority. A part of the office space was on rent and the ED had given notice to the tenant to vacate the premises. Last December, the ED had requested the court to declare Hajra and her two sons as fugitive economic offenders and for confiscation of their properties in India and abroad. They mentioned the Mirchi family’s 15 properties for confiscation, including the two floors at Ceejay House. The ED had provisionally attached Mirchi family’s properties worth Rs 798 crore in the country and abroad under PMLA. The ED alleged that Mirchi earned his money through smuggling of narcotics, arms and extortion activities. The ED is investigating a money laundering case where Mirchi allegedly fraudulently freed his three buildings at Worli—Rabia Mansion, Mariam Lodge and Sea View (now all three are demolished)—in 2005 and sold these to a company controlled by DHFL promoters Kapil Wadhawan and his brother Dheeraj Wadhawan aka Baba Dewan. Wadhawan brothers allegedly paid Mirchi for the three buildings through hawala channels. During investigation, the ED began to examine Mirchi’s other deals in India over the past two decades till his death in 2013 in London.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-takes-possession-of-mirchi-kins-2-floors-in-ceejay-house/articleshow/84422746.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh takes fight over Krishna waters with Telangana to Supreme Court||VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh on Wednesday moved the Supreme Court over the ‘unjust usage’ of Krishna river water by upper riparian state of Telangana “in contravention of the directions” of the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB). The AP government also said in its petition that Telangana was ‘violating’ the water allocation by Bachawat Tribunal. With the AP government moving the top court, the dispute between two Telugu states is back to square one. Telangana had agreed to withdraw its plea in the Supreme Court seeking formation of a new tribunal for fresh allocation of water. The Apex Council, which oversees the disputes between Telugu states on sharing of river water, had prevailed upon Telangana to withdraw its petition so that the issue could be solved amicably. Now that AP has preferred to settle the issue in Supreme Court, the efforts by Apex Council thus far may come to nought, experts feel. The AP government sought directions from the Supreme Court for notification of the jurisdiction of the KRMB as stipulated in Andhra Pradesh State Reorganisation Act. A series of meetings took place to decide the jurisdiction of the KRMB but the deliberations did not fructify into a concrete notification even though it is the prerogative of the Union government to take a decision, argued the state government. As the jurisdiction of the KRMB was not notified, Telangana by its “acts of commission is seriously affecting the water supply” to Andhra Pradesh for irrigation and other purposes. As water from Srisailam dam is being used for power generation by Telangana without giving priority to drinking water and irrigation, the water levels had depleted. This is nothing but taking away the rights of people of AP, it argued. Though the KRMB told Telangana to stop power generation at Srisailam, Telangana state government did not heed the instructions and issued GO 34 to continue power generation at full capacity. AP further argued that Telangana ‘violated’ Bachawat Award and utilised water in excess of its allocated quota. In view of the continued dispute between the two states, AP sought directions from the apex court to the Union government to notify the jurisdiction of the KRMB for supervision of irrigation projects on Krishna river. The state government relied on various judgements of the apex court in support of its argument. Andhra Pradesh sought directions to set aside the GO issued by Telangana for power generation and to follow the KRMB directions on drawing water from Krishna river projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-takes-fight-over-krishna-water-with-telangana-to-sc/articleshow/84426699.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Mumbai||In a first, NEET-UG to have optional questions; students seek more clarity||MUMBAI: In a first, the question paper for NEET-UG 2021 for admissions to medical courses will give options to students. Till last year, the paper had 180 compulsory questions. This year, the National Testing Agency (NTA) will give a total of 200 questions, of which 180 will have to be attempted. Each of the four subjects— physics, chemistry, botany and zoology—will be divided into two sections A and B, where A will have 35 compulsory questions and B 15, of which students will have to attempt any 10. While students and parents have welcomed the move, they have called it a last-minute change and have written to NTA to seek more clarity. NEET-UG exam date, September 12, was announced two days ago. The total marks will remain 720 and test duration three hours long. “Reading 20 extra questions to choose the best ones is likely to consume more time,” said Meet Shah, an aspirant from KES College. Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative, said students mark the right answers in the OMR (optical marking recognition) sheets, which had 180 compulsory questions. “Now, with the additional questions, which 10 answers in Section B will be considered for marking if students have attempted all 15?” asked Shenoy. She said most invigilators do not even give the question paper 10 minutes before the exam, which is a rule. For the new pattern, those 10 minutes will be crucial, she added. Students have never practised the new pattern, said Manisha Shetti of Palak Shikshan Sangh. “For two to three years (in case of a second NEET attempt), students have practised by solving 180 questions in 180 minutes. This sudden change will affect their time management,” said Shetti. The organization has written to NTA seeking at least 10 model question papers with OMR sheets to practise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-a-first-neet-ug-to-have-optional-questions-students-seek-more-clarity/articleshow/84417917.cms||Yogita Rao

The ZP has decided to give a grant of Rs 570 for each sapling to the farmers to promote cultivation in the district. The officials claimed that the cultivators could earn Rs 2 -2.5 lakh from one acre, considering the demand and price of bamboo in the retail market. It has also decided to give training to the farmers on cultivation and market opportunities. “Our target is to cultivate bamboo on at least 100 hectares in each tehsil of the district. The maximum cultivation is planned at Bhor, Velhe, Maval and Mulshi. These tehsils have favourable weather conditions and suitable landscape for bamboo cultivation,” said Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO), ZP. Six empanelled companies from northeast and southern states have responded to our expression of interest for supplying tissue / saplings of bamboo, said the Zilla Parishad CEO. “We have shortlisted farmers from each tehsil. With the help of these suppliers, we would be able to cultivate bamboo in a scientific manner,” Prasad added. Regarding failure of previous attempts to get quality products of bamboo and mass cultivation in the district, Prasad clarified that the bamboo needed to be commercially viable to get the desired results. “There are multiple uses of bamboo, so we need to plant varieties accordingly. Now, there is a good demand from furniture-making industry, biodiesel industry and construction. We need to provide as per their requirement. We have studied this in detail to get expected results,” Prasad added. The required moisture in soil is usually available in August for bamboo cultivation, said officials from the agriculture section. “Once we increase the production, the industrial units would automatically come to Pune district. Our first objective is to create enough awareness about bamboo farming and increase its cultivation in the district,” said Anil Deshmukh, head of the agriculture section.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/zp-plans-to-cultivate-bamboo-on-2k-hectares/articleshow/84423225.cms||Sandip Dighe

Ten of them also suffered severe burn injuries and are receiving treatment at the veterinary office. The 33-kv overhead high tension line collapsed following a fault at Mandi Kishandas Sarai under Sadar Kotwali in Sambhal on Tuesday.

According to the notification issued on Monday, businesses or individuals that make donations to the trust in the period between financial year (FY) 2021-22 to 2026-27 can claim tax deduction on their donations. The Haridwar-based foundation, which was set up in 2017, has been notified as a "research association" under the IT Act, which means any business donating to the foundation for research will be eligible to claim tax deduction on the donated amount under section 35 of the Income Tax Act. The move sparked debate on social media, with some users alleging that the timing of the exemption ahead of the state assembly elections could be an attempt to facilitate infusion of funds in an organisation that is considered close to the ruling dispensation. Talking to TOI, Patanjali CEO Acharya Balkrishna dismissed the charges and said the trust was not a “corporate gharana” backing political parties but an organisation working for the health and well-being of the people of the country. “Our research foundation trust has 300 scientists and has published thousands of scientific research works related to yoga and ayurveda till date. Who else is more deserving of this exemption, if not Patanjali Research Foundation? This should have been done long ago,” Balkrishna said. A member of the trust said they had applied for the exemption around 1a year and half ago and the approval has come now. “At present, we don’t have many donors and most of the donations are being made by members of the trust,” Balkrishna said. He added that apart from yoga and ayurveda, the research foundation was now studying organic food, ways to boost soil health as well as mitigate climate change. A statement issued by Patanjali earlier this week said that the group had achieved a turnover of around Rs 30,000 crore in 2020-21 and was aiming to make its companies debt-free in the next 3-4 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/5-yrs-tax-exemption-to-patanjali-trust-sparks-debate/articleshow/84420309.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Hyderabad||L&T seeks Telangana government's bailout as Metro losses mount||HYDERABAD: India’s first public-private partnership (PPP) Metro rail project, Hyderabad Metro, is in the red. L&T Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited (L&THMRL), which operates the Metro, has sought government help to bail it out from the financial crisis. Covid-19-induced restrictions coupled with lack of last mile connectivity, low ridership and increased operational cost have wiped out the gains the Metro operator made in the initial years of operation. The operator has been making Rs 5 crore loss a day, on an average, while its earnings are just Rs 1 crore a day. In the last week of June, L&T Metro rail authorities had met chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and requested for help. The CM asked both Hyderabad Metro Rail (HMR) and chief minister’s office to submit a report on what could be done as per the concessionaire agreement. Sources in the government said L&T submitted their financial details to the government. According to them, the Metro rail operator had registered Rs 400 crore loss alone in the first quarter (between April and June 2021) and is expected to touch Rs 1,500 crore by the end of the fiscal. According to the report, accumulated losses since beginning of the operations had reached about Rs 4,000 crore. In the 2019-2020, the accumulated losses were Rs1,766 crore, which was declared by L&THMRL in its annual report. Officials said the major reasons for losses were Covid-19 and subsequent lockdown during which the Metro services were suspended for several months. Even after reopening services, the ridership (passengers availing Metro) was not encouraging as many companies, especially IT firms, had asked their employees to work from home. The other reason, according to the sources, was that many people have not been preferring Metro due to poor last mile connectivity. There was criticism about the Metro fares too, which are much higher compared to other public transport like RTC buses. “Before Covid-19, the daily average ridership was 3.4 lakh and even it went to a peak of four lakh some days. There were no Metro services for 169 days. Even after Metro services resumed this year, the footfall was around two lakh in February 2021. Later, it fell to half and now has one lakh passengers a day,” a senior CMO official explained. Official sources in municipal administration department said the CM might hold a meeting with L&THMRL officials on the issue and work out on a strategy to save it as Hyderabad Metro is the first public private partnership (PPP) Metro project in the country. Later, Maharashtra too executed a Metro rail project under PPP mode. Maharashtra is planning to take over the operations of the Mumbai Metro One Private Limited from the developer, Reliance Infrastructure Pvt Ltd.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lt-seeks-govt-bailout-as-metro-losses-mount/articleshow/84426705.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Aurangabad||Five minors, including a girl, booked for murder in Aurangabad||AURANGABAD: Based on court directives, the Satara area police station of Aurangabad city registered a case of murder and criminal intimidation against five minors, including a girl, in an August 2020 case of an 11-year-old boy’s drowning. At that time, the police had registered an accidental death case. The deceased, identified as Rohan Shinde, was a resident of the Satara area and was found “dead due to drowning” in a pond near the Water and Land Management Institute. On August 25, a case of accidental death was registered with the police. However, Shinde’s mother was unconvinced. She alleged that the suspects had taken her son to the pond for a swim and had later drowned him by forcing his head under water. She accused four of the suspects of forcing her son to enter the water and the key suspect — who allegedly had some differences with Shinde — of forcing his head under water, causing his death. However, the Satara police, citing findings of the investigation, had then refused to entertain her allegations and complaint against the minors accompanying the deceased. Unhappy with the police investigation, she moved court, which then directed the police to register a murder case against all the accused named by Shinde’s mother. Senior inspector Surendra Malale said: “Our probe has revealed that those involved are minor students. All of them are in the 11-14 years age group. They had gone to the pond to swim.” Despite none of them knowing how to swim, they entered the water, and one of them drowned, the police said. The police said as Shinde’s mother had alleged that all the children accompanying her son were above 18 years old, the court accordingly recorded them as adults and issued directives for the registration of an offence. Police will now be submitting their findings to the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/5-minors-including-a-girl-booked-for-murder/articleshow/84417948.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Tenders have been invited to demolish the structure, which is surrounded by an ecological zone, built during the tenure of Sawai Man Singh II, the last ruler of Jaipur. A JDA official said, “The last date for submission of expression of interest is July 15. The firm winning the contract can take away the materials after dismantling the structure. Soon, the authority will appoint an architectural and engineering consultant based on quality and cost-based selection system (QCBS).” The Gandhi Darshan Museum and the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Governance and Social Sciences project was announced by chief minister Ashok Gehlot in the 2021-2022 Budget on a land situated inside the Central Park. The decision to pull down the heritage property with 40 palatial rooms has not gone well with environmentalists and the Opposition. Rajsamand MP Diya Kumari, who hails from the erstwhile royal family of Jaipur said, “It has come to my knowledge that the state government was planning to demolish the hotel located in Central Park. The building has historic and heritage value. To my mind, such a structure should not be demolished. If a museum or an institute has to be made, it should be done within the same building.” The JDA had taken possession of the hotel, Kanak Bhawan and a horse stable at Central Park spread across nearly 35,000 sqm following a Supreme Court order on May 5, 2017. “The decision to develop a museum was taken as the land has been earmarked as commercial/recreation in Master Plan 2025. The plan for Kanak Bhawan, spread across 3,890sqm, has not been made as it falls in the ecological zone,” sources said. The activists, however, alleged that the JDA is deciding the land-use as per its whims and fancies and the entire area is no-construction zone. Central Park Bachao Sangharsh Samiti president Yogesh Yadav said, “The land was acquired for public utility and not for a multi-crore rupee project. It’s an ecological and no-construction zone and a violation of Supreme Court orders. For the past 20 years, we are fighting to maintain the sanctity of this green zone. The government, however, is coming up with fancy projects to benefit the influential. We will approach the court again.” Under the Rajasthan State Land Acquisition Act, the Urban Improvement Trust (UIT) had acquired 322 bighas in the Rambagh Complex for public utilities in 1973. As per UIT claims, these two prime buildings were part of the ‘acquired’ land, following which possession was taken by the JDA in 2017 after a long legal battle. A senior officer said, “When the BJP government was in power, a proposal was received to dedicate the building for public use and a yoga or wellbeing centre be developed for morning walkers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-to-raze-heritage-hotel-laxmi-vilas-for-building-rs-100-crore-gandhi-museum/articleshow/84425113.cms||Ajay Singh

When Digambar Kamat deserted the party in 2005, it pained Manoharbhai no end. And it was his resolve to defeat Digambar one day. I think the time has now come. In the 2022 assembly elections, BJP workers will work tirelessly to defeat Digambar; of that I am 100 percent confident.” Tanavade said that though BJP failed to hold sway over the Margao Municipal Council (MMC), Tanavade said that the party had aimed to win 10 seats but fell short by just three seats. “BJP had fought against the combined might of Digambar Kamat and (Fatorda MLA) Vijai Sardesai, and nonetheless we got good results. However, for the 2022 assembly elections, BJP will put up a good performance and win the Margao seat,” Tanavade said while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a programme organised to induct new members into the party. Asked if the party would field a new face from Margao for the 2022 polls, Tanavade evaded a direct reply. “New face or old face, no thought has been given to that yet. Irrespective of who the candidate is, defeating Digambar Kamat should be our focus,” he said. Further, reacting to Kamat’s statement that he would move a private members resolution seeking significant changes to the anti-defection law to prevent party-hopping by MLAs, Tanavade accused Kamat of “leaving a stain” on the BJP by becoming its first MLA in the state to resort to defection by joining Congress. “Therefore, it ill behoves him to speak on defection,” he said. Pointing out that when BJP opened its account for the first time in the state in 1994 by winning four assembly seats, Tanavade sought to remind the people that Margao was one among those four. “History will repeat itself in 2022,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-will-fulfil-parrikars-wish-by-ousting-digambar-in-2022-tanavade/articleshow/84425133.cms||---

---||Chennai||When Yashpal and Vishy held court at Chepauk||By Partab Ramchandt was January 14, 1982 and the city was celebrating Pongal. At Chepauk the near capacity crowd had plenty to cheer for as there was a harvest of runs by two Indian players --- Gundappa Viswanath and Yashpal Sharma --- who batted the whole day. It was only the second time a pair of Indian batsmen had achieved the feat, the first during the famous world record first-wicket partnership of 413 runs between Vinoo Mankad and Pankaj Roy also at Madras, but at the old Nehru stadium 26 years previously.It was the second day of the fifth Test between India and England and the home team put in to bat had resumed at 178 for two with Gundappa Viswanath on 64 and Yashpal Sharma on five. The latter had come in at 150 when Dilip Vengsarkar had retired hurt late on the first day after being hit on the back of the head by a ball from Bob Willis. The pair carried on relentlessly braving the heat and negotiating the four-man pace attack of Willis, Graham Dilley, Paul Allott and Ian Botham in addition to the left arm spinners of Derek Underwood with aplomb on a good batting surface which also had a bit of bounce.Yashpal, who passed away on Tuesday following a cardiac arrest, was making a comeback to the side after being dropped following an indifferent tour of Australia and New Zealand the previous season. He was determined to make the most of the opportunity and if he could not match the artistry of Viswanath, he certainly matched him in run production. The two batsmen made an interesting contrast. Viswanath, five-and-a-half years older, had made his Test debut in 1969, Yashpal in 1979. The little man charmed the ball away from the fielders playing the aesthetic strokes that only he could. Yashpal slightly taller, of stocky build and with strong forearms, gave the ball a hearty thump and in their own diverse ways they dominated the bowling. Yashpal might not have been the most attractive batsman to watch but none could \ his value to the side. He overcame any technical limitations with the important qualities of courage, concentration and patience. An ideal man for a crisis he could blunt the edge off any bowling with solid defence. However some of his shots tended to be quite ungainly which led to a couple of English players passing unkind comments on his batting. This made Yashpal never one to take all this lying down even more determined and as Viswanath has recalled in an interview he told him "Vishy bhai, let’s keep going. Let us play out the whole day.’’ According to Viswanath, for him to play out a full day of Test cricket was something he had never expected but thanks to Yashpal goading him on, the two were still together at stumps. Viswanath was on 181 and Yashpal on 102 with India’s score 395 for two. It was only the second time that England had failed to take a wicket during a complete day’s play.Scyld Berry then cricket correspondent of ‘The Observer’ noted that there was a rivalry of sorts between Yashpal and Botham which had actually started when the pugnacious Indian treated the star England allrounder with disdain to pull off a thrilling win in an ODI at Jalandhar the previous month. "Botham bowled frequent bouncers at Yashpal as a follow-up to what happened in Jalandhar. Yashpal tried hooking one of them and sent it for four through the vacant second slip area. Thereafter he did not hook and Botham taunted him for not doing so. With a right handed gesture he indicated his low opinion of Yashpal’s batting. Next day Botham’s common sense had returned to stop him doing it again.’’Yashpal was never one to suffer fools gladly and there was no letting up the following morning as England were properly grilled under the Madras microwave. In fact he became more and more aggressive, the high point being when he took 18 runs from an over from Allott including two successive sixes. The landmarks came up, Viswanath’s 200, the 300 of the partnership and then finally with the score 466 Yashpal was out for 140. The partnership of 316 runs was India’s highest for the third wicket in all Tests and Yashpal had batted a little over eight hours hitting 18 fours besides those two sixes. Shortly afterwards Viswanath was out for 222 at which point Sunil Gavaskar declared at 481 for four. The crowning glory of Yashpal’s career will always be being a prominent member of the 1983 World Cup winning squad but the determination and concentration he displayed at Chepauk from January 13 to 15 in 1982 will rank special for Indian cricket fans. His Madras heroics might well have been a precursor to his matchwinning 61 in the World Cup semifinal a year later, bossing over the likes of Allott, Botham and Willis. Just as it was the apotheosis of his 37-Test career.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: ASI to remove Haldighati plaques claiming ‘retreat’ of Rana Pratap||JAIPUR: The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) will remove its plaques at Rakta Talai in Rajsamand that states Maharana Pratap’s forces retreated from the battle of Haldighati and Badshahi Bagh, which was named after Mughal emperor Akbar. The battle was fought between Pratap and Akbar in 1576. The decision to remove the plaques was taken following demands by Rajput organisations in the state. The ASI has directed its state unit to replace the controversial plaques with an “accurate narrative” of the battle. Rajsamand MP Diya Kumari and Rajsamand MLA Deepti Maheshwari had raised the demand with former Union minister of tourism and culture Prahlad Singh Patel. Union minister of state for culture Arjun Ram Meghwal told TOI, “The order removing the plaques have been issued. It is based on historical facts.” Confirming the development, ASI circle (Jodhpur) superintendent Bipin Chandra Negi said they had received directions to remove the plaques. “The plaques have factual inaccuracies such as wrong date of the battle and some debatable or controversial statements. It will be removed soon,” said Negi. The ASI office has written to the Rajasthan tourism department informing them of the development. Both the sites were under the state government and the plaques were placed by the state tourism department in 1976 during the visit of former PM Indira Gandhi. Later in 2008, the monuments were taken over by the ASI. Negi said they had prepared a note to be inscribed on the plaques and will be sent to the headquarters for approval. “It will include lines such as Pratap fought for his self-respect and his horse Chetak made a supreme sacrifice. The prupose of the fresh plaque is to highlight the importance of the place and event. The controversy has nothing to do with the greatness of Maharana Pratap,” said Negi. NCERT books mention the date of the battle of Haldighati as June 18, 1576, while the date mentioned on the plaques is June 21, 1576. The inscription on the plaque in English and Hindi at Rakta Talai — “Pratap’s forces retreated” and “Pratap ke sena ko peeche hatna pada” — sparked a controversy after an associate professor of history at Meera College, Chandra Shekhar Sharma, raised objections, which was supported by several Rajput organisations. “History stands corrected. It will provide the right picture for the generations to come,” said Sharma over phone from Udaipur. Newly elected Rajsamand MLA Maheshwari during her first official visit to Delhi submitted a memorandum to then culture minister Patel. She said, “I raised the collective emotions and sentiments of the people of Rajasthan backed by history.

Kejriwal said that the Syro-Malabar church was demolished by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), which is under the Centre’s control. However, Congress held AAP liable for the demolition, pointing out that two AAP MLAs are on the DDA board. “The Delhi government has no control over DDA. It comes under the Centre,” Kejriwal said. “I heard about the incident when I came to Goa. I can assure you that justice will be done,” he said.  The DDA is headed by Anil Baijal, the lieutenant governor of Delhi. Congress national spokesperson Shama Mohamed condemned Kejriwal for feigning ignorance about the demolition. “Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal must explain why his two MLAs Dilip Pandey and Somnath Bharti, who are members of DDA, kept quiet on the demolition issue. The lone BJP MLA O P Sharma also remained a silent spectator ,” Mohamed said. Congress said that BJP and AAP are “two sides of the same coin” and both of them spread hatred and encourage communal divide for political gains. Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat also condemned the demolition of the church. Meanwhile, former AAP MLA Alka Lamba is set to visit Goa to “strengthen Congress party” ahead of the 2022 assembly elections. Lamba, who was an AAP member till September 2019, returned to the Congress fold and her visit to Goa comes just after Kejriwal’s two-day visit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kejriwal-denies-role-in-delhi-church-demolition/articleshow/84425149.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra could relax restrictions as daily detection of cases flat since a month, says Rajesh Tope||MUMBAI: Considering that daily Covid-19 detections in Maharashtra have been stagnant for a month now, the state government may relax the second wave-induced restrictions, said health minister Rajesh Tope. Tope was speaking after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday where the state’s Covid-19 situation and unrest among traders and business owners due to the restrictions was discussed. “The growth rate of Covid cases in the state is lower than the national average and daily detection is stagnant between 7,000 and 9,000 since a month. Currently, there are Level Three and above restrictions in the state and there is demand from various sectors to relax these. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is reviewing the situation too and will take an appropriate decision soon,” said Tope. According to the presentation made in Wednesday’s state cabinet meeting, 92% of the 1 lakh active cases in the state are concentrated in 10 districts and the remaining 8% are spread across 26 districts. Senior officials said the state government is working on giving certain relaxations and a decision to the effect will be taken in consultation with the state task force. Tope said there is a demand for extending timings of shops and dine-in at restaurants.  “Traders who are fully vaccinated and have vaccinated their staff have been demanding they be allowed to keep their shops open for longer hours,” said Tope. He added the MVA government is hopeful of getting nearly 4.2 crore doses in August based on the state’s population, as the Centre will get 42 crore doses from manufacturers. “The vaccine supply is still not as adequate as we would like it to be. We are still going 2-3 days without vaccine doses and are underutilizing our capacity,” said Tope, adding he will speak to union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on streamlining it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-could-relax-restrictions-as-daily-detection-of-cases-flat-since-a-mth-says-tope/articleshow/84418118.cms||Bhavika Jain

---||Goa||Cancel sewerage tender or we’ll go to HC, GFP tells govt||Panaji: Insisting that the tender for a parallel sewerage network in the state capital is flawed and will lead to cost overruns, Goa Forward Party (GFP) has written to the state government demanding the cancellation of the tender. GFP has warned that if PWD goes ahead with the sewerage project, it would approach the high court and get it stopped. PWD has tendered three different tenders on behalf of Imagine Panaji Smart City Corporation Ltd (IPSCDL) to lay new sewerage pipelines parallel to the existing network in parts of Panaji. However, the tenders have been floated without any detailed plans of the existing network, which TOI had reported in June. “We request PWD to cancel the tenders and we also request PWD to prepare a detailed sewerage and storm water drainage masterplan for all CCP wards, including EDC Patto and Ribandar area,” said Durgadas Kamat, GFP vice-president. GFP alleged that to maximise profit margins, contractors will haphazardly execute the project, which will only lead to a flawed sewerage network, cost overruns by as much as 70%, and delay in completion of the sewerage network. “If PWD decides to go ahead with the above-tendered sewerage project with the current tender, we will be forced to seek legal action in that matter and approach the court and the concerned EEs, AEs and JEs and all those dealing in the above-mentioned sewerage works will have to face the consequences,” said Kamat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cancel-sewerage-tender-or-well-go-to-hc-gfp-tells-govt/articleshow/84425164.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Agra doctor abducted, Rajasthan & Uttar Pradesh cops search Chambal ravines, cross river on foot||AGRA/JAIPUR/ALWAR: A senior surgeon of Agra went mysteriously missing and his car was found over 70km away in Dholpur district of neighbouring Rajasthan a day later on Wednesday, prompting police teams from both the states to launch a combing operation in Chambal ravines. No ransom call was made to the family till Wednesday night. Dr Umakant Gupta, 60, owns a hospital in Agra. “He left home on Tuesday evening at 6:45pm in his car, but never returned,” said his wife, Dr Vidya Gupta, who is a gynaecologist. It was then that she approached the police and filed a written complaint. “He took his Baleno car and was carrying a mobile phone. It is switched off now,” she said, adding that the nursing home is just 600-metre from their house. Superintendent of police (SP) of Agra Botre Rohan Pramod told TOI, “Five police teams have been formed to work on this case. We are looking into similar cases which took place in the region in the last few years.” A case under section 364 of IPC (kidnapping for ransom) has been registered against unknown persons at Etmauddaula police station of Agra. Police said that the last location of Dr Gupta’s mobile was traced near Saiya village of Agra. “All CCTV footage from the area are being scanned,” a police officer said. The abduction led to a dawn-to-dusk search operation deep in the ravines of Chambal, in Dholpur district, where heavily armed Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh police teams crossed the river and searched over a dozen villages on Wednesday. Dholpur SP Keshar Singh Shekhawat told TOI that a search operation to find Dr Gupta was underway in the ravines, which cut across three states -- Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. This is probably the first time in recent memory, following the lull in dacoity cases in eastern Rajasthan, that police parties had to cross the gharial-infested Chambal river for a combing operation. “A head constable of Dholpur police late on Tuesday night had intercepted a suspicious car that was zipping in and out of small lanes to avoid police checkpoints,” SP Shekhawat told TOI. “Our teams followed the car and arrested the driver, who admitted to have abducted Dr Gupta with the latter’s car from Agra,” Shekhawat said, adding that he quickly relayed the news of the doctor’s abduction to his Agra counterpart. “During interrogation, the driver revealed that a woman of their gang had honey-trapped the doctor for the abduction. The doctor was present in the car with the woman when the accused barged in, took him into the ravines and, after dropping him there, fled in the same car,” Shekhawat said. The Dholpur police’s interrogation continued well into the early hours of Wednesday when a police force from neighbouring UP arrived. “We learned that the doctor had been moved into the Chambal valley. We crossed the river on foot and searched multiple hamlets for suspects,” he said. The Rajasthan Police had also alerted the MP Police that an incident redolent of the dacoity era has been reported. Police said the Chambal ravines are difficult to navigate, but the combing operation is currently underway.

It was decided to make the library at the building functional utilising funds from the central government. The library was shut owing to the dilapidated condition of the building. Opposition councillors pointed out to chairperson Shubhangi Vaingankar and Mapusa MLA Joshua D’Souza that the library would also be beneficial for students as they have to travel to the Central Library at Panaji for books. The chairperson agreed to the suggestion and assured to take up the project after holding discussions with officials of Goa State Urban Development Agency , director of municipal administration, chief officer, and also with the support of urban development minister Milind Naik. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/facelift-for-old-mapusa-civic-bldg/articleshow/84425210.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Finally, Metro Gets Nod To Pass Via Ridge||New Delhi: Delhi Metro’s Aerocity-Tughlaqabad corridor under phase-IV got approval from Ridge Management Board (RMB) on Wednesday to pass through the parts of Delhi Ridge. A total of 5.2 km of the corridor will fall under the ridge area and 1,072 trees will be affected in the project. A forest official who attended the meeting of RMB said, “RMB has given clearance to DMRC for Aerocity-Tughlaqabad corridor under phase-IV.” Of the total 1,072 trees proposed to be felled for the project, 466 trees are situated in Southern Ridge, 455 in South Central Ridge and 151 trees in Morphological Ridge. The proposed corridor will pass through Mahipalpur, Kishangarh, Chhattarpur, IGNOU and Anandmayee Marg T Junction. Of the total 5.2 km corridor falling in the ridge area, about 1.7 km is in Southern Ridge, 1.2 km in South Central Ridge and 2.3 km in Morphological Ridge. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation had sought permission from the forest department to take ridge land for the Aerocity-Tughlaqabad corridor of phase-IV for construction of stations, tunnels and utility buildings. In the previous meeting of RMB, which was held in June, the board had directed the forest department and DMRC to thoroughly explore all the alternative alignments for the MRTS corridor and overlay all those alternate alignments on a map of Ridge/ Morphological Ridge to give a clear picture. “Delhi Metro presented alternative alignments but after consideration, the original alignment was approved,” said a forest official. Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, DMRC said, “DMRC has taken a lot of efforts to minimise the impact of the construction of this line on the ridge areas. An area of 31 hectare with approx 8,000 trees was earmarked in the ridge area at Rangpuri Pahadi for the train depot of this line. But now, this depot had been dropped and DMRC is augmenting capacities in the Sarita Vihar and Ajronda depots and extending this line beyond Tughlaqabad up to Sarita Vihar Depot to cater to this new line.” Dayal added, “DMRC has saved over 350 trees involved in station construction on the section in the ridge area. We appreciate the decision by Ridge Management Board to approve the alignment on the Aerocity-Tughlaqabad corridor of phase-IV. This will help us in taking the project forward.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/finally-metro-gets-nod-to-pass-via-ridge/articleshow/84423011.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan govt schools lag behind in infrastructure||JAIPUR: Though Rajasthan spends around 6% of the total budget on education, yet it still lags behind in terms of infrastructure development in government schools, according to the recent report of Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE). In 32% of the government schools, there is no power connection with children having to study in extreme heat conditions. According to sources in the education department, 70% primary government schools are functioning without electricity. Similarly, 9% schools do not have functional drinking water facilities on their premises. Around 9% government schools do not have boys’ toilet and 10% do not have girls’ toilet. Commenting on the ground reality in government schools, Vipin Sharma, vice-president of Rajasthan Primary and Secondary School Teachers’ Association said, “If you go to many government schools in Jaipur city, there is no drinking water facility. Many primary government schools have no electricity or toilets. The government needs to focus on more on infrastructure.” According to the report, around 74% schools have a library, however, teachers claim that those are just a small room with 100 odd books. The concept of developing a spacious library in government schools hasn’t been implemented. The situation is even worse when it comes to computer facilities. Only 30% schools in the state have computer facilities, out of which only 24% have functional Internet. Narayan Lal Sisodia, spokesperson of Rajasthan Shikshak Evam Panchayati Raj Karamchari Sangh said, “There is an urgent need to focus on infrastructure development in rural areas as majority of children are studying in those schools. We do spend a lot of the state budget on education. Now, the time has come to develop better infrastructure for them.” According to the Right to Education Act, every school has to be disabled friendly. However, only 7.75% have functional toilets and 45% have functional ramps with hand-railing for Children with Special Needs (CWSN) in the state. Experts believe that as compared to last year, there has been an improvement in the condition of education in state, but a lot has to be done if we want to touch even the national average.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-govt-schools-lag-behind-in-infra/articleshow/84425232.cms||---
---||Goa||BJP scouts for robust challenger against Kamat||Margao: With an eye on the 2022 assembly elections, BJP was determined to post a robust performance in the recent Margao civic polls. However, having failed to wrest control of the civic body, BJP’s task of hunting for a robust challenger for Margao MLA Digambar Kamat in the assembly polls has turned out to be a daunting task for the party leadership. BJP general secretary and party spokesperson Damodar Naik, however, sounded sanguine over the issue. “There are still eight months to go for the assembly elections. The right candidate will emerge from among the capable ones in due course of time, and will be announced at the appropriate time,” Naik said. Nevertheless, party insiders say that though BJP has been scouting for a new face to take over Kamat since long, the exercise hasn’t yielded the desired results yet. State BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade almost acknowledged that the task was uphill when he told reporters on Wednesday that what important for the party was the “focus” to win and not the “face.” “New face or old face, no thought has been given to that yet. However, I have told the party workers to work tirelessly keeping the party symbol in mind; face is not important. Irrespective of who the candidate is, defeating Digambar Kamat should be our focus,” he said. Party functionaries hope that the goodwill generated by the BJP on account of the “untiring and relentless” efforts put in by the karyakartas in reaching out to the needy during the time of pandemic would pay them the dividends in the assembly elections. “BJP karyakartas were on the field during the peak of the second wave when Congress was nowhere to be seen,” Navin Pai Raikar, a senior party functionary said. “Party workers were right there on the ground where it mattered the most - helping the sick get admitted in hospitals, delivering medicine kits to those testing positive, helping the sick and the elderly get to the vaccination centers and take the jab, even visiting Covid wards when required. We are sure people will remember this when they vote to elect their next representative of Margao.” Kamat had won the 2017 assembly elections from Margao with a margin of over 4,000 votes, thereby registering a consecutive win in seven elections. He defeated BJP’s Sharmad Raiturcar, whom he had trounced on two earlier elections too. Once considered to be the bastion of BJP with Kamat having got elected on the saffron ticket from Margao for three consecutive terms since 1994, the party’s fortunes slid dramatically after Kamat switched over to Congress in 2005. Since then, BJP has failed to wrest the Margao seat from Congress. Political observers haven’t been able to decipher BJP’s sustained failure in wresting the seat from Kamat, despite having a robust organizational set-up. “There are many factors at play here,” a political commentator explained. “Caste equations, factions within the BJP in Margao, and above all Kamat’s personal appeal and popularity add to the matrix. Margao assembly constituency has a sizeable number of BJP votes too, as is evident from Loksabha election results. However, in the last few assembly elections, a sizeable chunk of these otherwise BJP votes have ended up into Kamat’s kitty thereby evading the BJP an electoral victory.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-scouts-for-robust-challenger-against-kamat/articleshow/84425233.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

The girl said in the complaint that the accused, Ravi Dhandhas, filmed the first rape and threatened to make the video viral if she did not have sex with him whenever he demanded. The complaint was filed on Tuesday. According to the girl’s complaint, she had come to Gandhinagar for a training programme of Sports Authority of India (SAI) between August 2019 and January 2021. During the programme, the complainant befriended a girl from Haryana. Her friend fell ill during the programme and was admitted to Civil Hospital in Asarwa. The complainant tended to her friend and their bond got stronger, said the FIR. The complainant said that her friend introduced her to Dhandhas who sought the complainant’s number and they began talking over the phone. The complainant said that in January, she was unsuccessful in booking a train ticket to her native place. “Dhandhas told me to stay at a hotel in Sector 16 in Gandhinagar for two days,” the complainant said. “He assured me that he would help me get a train ticket. He also told me that he would pay for the hotel rooms.” On January 10, Dhandhas came to the hotel room where the complainant was staying with her friend. “Dhandhas told my friend to go to another room and after she left, he locked the room and raped me,” the complainant said. She said that she eventually went to her native place but Dhandhas continued to call her and press her to meet him. “He was threatening to make my videos viral,” she said. Due to the intense pressure from Dhandhas, she returned to Gandhinagar in March. She said that he took her to the same hotel and raped her again. The complainant said that Dhandhas continued to threaten her after the second assault. She finally revealed her ordeal to her parents who filed an application of complaint with Amravati Police. The case was later transferred to Gandhinagar Police. Sector 21 police of Gandhinagar have registered a complaint of rape and have invoked the provisions of the POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act as well.

Records show that a few months after becoming PM, Modi had visited Kyoto in Japan in August 2014 when a Kashi-Kyoto partnership agreement aimed at retaining Varanasi’s ancient heritage was signed. After PM’s Kyoto visit in August 2014, then Japanese PM Shinzo Abe had a first-hand experience of Varanasi's illustrious glory in December 2015. On September 15, 2017 JICA signed a grant agreement for the construction of ICC. Later, CPWD was engaged to handle the project, which was executed by a Japanese company. The Varanasi Municipal Corporation (VMC) spared its Tilak auditorium building, which also had the house of elected mayor and corporators as well as a parking zone for solid waste management fleet of garbage carriers, to provide space for the ICC. “Built in a shape of ‘Shivlinga’, this world class auditorium has advance light and sound systems and 1,200 seating capacity, where mega literary, cultural events including music concerts, exhibition and conventions will be hosted,” said Smart City Varanasi Limited chairman and divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal. SCVL chief executive officer Gaurang Rathi said, “The main hall has a seating capacity of 1,200 people and it can be divided into two parts according to the number of people. Built in 2.87 hectares of land, this fully air-conditioned ICC is equipped with modern building management systems. In addition to the large hall, a meeting hall with a capacity of 150 people has also been created, which can also be conveniently divided into two parts.” He added, “Apart from this, a VIP room, four green rooms have been constructed here. Requirements for people with disabilities and all the criteria like ramps, wheelchairs have also been fulfilled.” “Rudraksh also has Japanese-style garden and landscaping,” said Rathi adding, “A parking facility for 120 vehicles has also been arranged in the basement.” “The entire campus is under CCTV surveillance. Along with conventional electricity, solar power has also been arranged to meet power supply requirements. The environment-friendly building is fit for Level 3 of Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA),” he added. The Rudraksh ICC had been formally taken over by SCVL from CPWD on May 31, said Arawal adding that modalities to run it were also finalised by roping in a company, Indian Sanitization Ward Boy and Horticulture Contractor (ISWHC) for its operations and maintenance for 10 years through a tender process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/modi-to-open-icc-todayplant-a-rudraskh-sapling/articleshow/84420481.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

According to the FIR filed with B division traffic police, Jalu Desai, was a newspaper vendor from the Cheharnagar locality near Chanakyapuri in Ghatlodia. He was run over when he went out on his scooter to distribute newspapers. “Desai was going towards Shastrinagar when the speeding BRTS bus, before it entered the dedicated track, hit him and ran him over,” said inspector Narendra Parmar of B division traffic police. The driver, Shankar Dayma, 35, who was driving an electric bus, climbed on to the roof of the bus as a crowd began rushing towards the bus. He then jumped off and fled to avoid the angry public, said a police officer. Locals called an ambulance and before it arrived a nursing student tried to resuscitate Desai but failed. By the time, the ambulance arrived, Desai was dead. Family members of the victim and other locals sat on protest and shouted slogans against the BRTS at the site of the accident and refused to take custody of the body. Later, senior police officers counselled them, and they agreed to take the body. “We have filed a complaint of causing death by negligent driving against Dayma on a complaint filed by Jalu Desai’s brother, Dhiru Desai,” said Parmar. He said that the driver was detained and sent for a Covid-19 test. Jalu Desai, apart from distributing newspapers, did daily wage labour, he said, adding that he had a wife and two children who were dependent on him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/40-year-old-scooterist-killed-by-speeding-brt-bus/articleshow/84423260.cms||---

In the video, a man in his 20s, wearing a t-shirt, black trousers and yellow shoes, is seen standing behind a woman shopping from a hawker in a crowded area. While she is busy talking to the vendor, the man can be seen groping her repeatedly. When she turns back to check for the molester, he looks away, pretending to be a passer-by. The video shows the man indecently touching other women before walking away from there. The clip sparked outrage among local shopkeepers and hawkers at the market, which is one of the oldest in the city. A shopkeeper, refusing to be named, said, “ This shows that miscreants have no fear of law. If such incidents continue to happen, women will not feel safe to walk down the road. They will avoid visiting the market, too.” Karanj inspector D V Tadvi was not available for his comments over the issue. In December 2015, a similar incident was reported after a policeman was filmed molesting various women at the Kankaria carnival.

People will now be able to plan their journeys to the minute,” transport minister Kailash Gahlot said. “I hope this collaboration will encourage several other transit apps to tap into the open data portal of the transport department and create innovative solutions to make Delhi’s public transport system the default choice for everyone,” he added. Once the project kicks off, static and dynamic location data of Delhi buses will be available for passengers in real time, apart from information of all routes and bus stops, arrival and departure times. There will also be updates on any delays, which will reduce waiting time and crowding at bus stops, along with increased accountability of public buses, Delhi government said. This feature is also available in Hindi on Google Maps app on Android and iOS devices. After entering their destination, commuters will be able to tap the “transit” icon to view times, bus numbers, routes and real-time arrival information highlighted in green or red. Tapping a recommended route will let them view more information on its stops. On tapping a bus stop, commuters will be able to see a listing of all arriving buses, with real-time information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-bus-information-to-soon-be-available-on-google-maps-gahlot/articleshow/84423078.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Locals and the driver of the car alleged that the man who was driving the police vehicle was drunk.

In the video, the driver of the police vehicle was seen pleading before a woman and a man to hear him out. Another man, who is seen in the video, repeatedly told the woman who was driving the car which got damaged, to call up police control room. Later, another policeman approached the driver and made him sit inside the police vehicle. Both of them were not wearing masks. The woman also said that the police driver drove with negligence and if someone had sat on the backseat, he or she would have been killed due to impact of the accident. Deputy commissioner of police, traffic, said, “I have also seen the accident video but we have not taken any legal steps as no FIR was filed in the case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/police-vehicle-rams-into-car-no-action-taken/articleshow/84423267.cms||---

---||Delhi||Chadha drops by for a surprise inspection at DJB helpline centre||New Delhi: Delhi Jal Board vice-chairman Raghav Chadha made a surprise visit to the control room for the online tanker management system and grievance redressal helpline at the DJB headquarters on Wednesday and directed officers to ensure that no citizen was discomforted. Chadha instructed officers to cross-verify on the ground redressal of grievances by randomly calling up complainants for proper feedback. He asked them to be present at the control room to ensure timely despatch of water tankers and undertook a first-hand assessment of the tanker management and grievance redressal system. While assessing the system, the vice-chairman anonymously called up complainants to understand their problems and instructed officials to plug all possible loopholes. He assured the complainants of prompt service. Informing him about the GPS-enabled live tanker tracking system, DJB officials said the target time for a tanker to reach a complainant’s location was 40 to 45 minutes from the time of registration of a complaint. “It is important to ensure delivery of water tankers to the citizens in minimum time. No call or message should be left unattended,” said Chadha. “Make sure that citizens are completely satisfied with the service,” he told officials. DJB monitors tankers through Water Tanker Distribution Management System (WTDMS), which works real-time through GPS-based tracking. The WTDMS application tracks the tanker movement every 10 seconds and derives a report for each trip between the filling point location and the associated delivery point. It makes available the data on the movement of a tanker on any given day along with a trip and duty-performance report. Referring to the recent water crisis, he said it “should hopefully be resolved in a few days now that Haryana has released water towards Delhi”. After the visit, the vice-chairman tweeted, “Took stock of @DelhiJalBoard’s Online Tanker Management System & DJB Grievance Redressal Helpline to ensure that no complaint goes unattended during this crucial period till the time Haryana’s discharge of 16,000 cusec reaches Delhi and normal supply of piped water is restored.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/chadha-drops-by-for-a-surprise-inspection-at-djb-helpline-centre/articleshow/84423134.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

An FIR relating to cheating has been registered under sections 419 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code. “During the lockdown, I started helping out my wife’s jewellery selling business. We came across the profile of the suspect, who was also into the same business. We contacted him and obtained his business details,” the techie Yogesh Thakur told TOI. Thakur said, “After initial communication, the suspect sent us photos of gold ornaments and we placed an order for 245 nose rings of one gram each. Taking due diligence, we collected all his details — full name, shop name, residence and shop addresses, Goods and Service Tax number, his Aadhaar card and a valid bill. Once we were convinced of him being a genuine vendor, we transferred Rs1,22,836 to his account via net banking.” “The suspect told us that he will send the consignment in a day, but we did not receive a delivery. He later kept delaying the dispatch of the delivery and blocked my phone number. At that point I realised that I was duped,” Thakur said. Thakur said when he visited the addresses provided by the suspect, he found out that the suspect has duped few other people as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cyber-crook-dupes-it-professional-of-rs1-22l/articleshow/84423085.cms||Asseem Shaikh

The HC was the first court to livestream proceedings before the bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath. It has been going on since October 26, 2020 after the courtrooms were closed and hearings started taking place virtually on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. The HC administration on Wednesday said that thanks to the success of the live streaming experiment of the CJ’s court, “to take forward the implementation of this initiative for the rest of the willing benches of the high court, live streaming rules were framed and approved by the full court on June 20, 2021”. The rules will be implemented, and livestreaming will take place after the inaugural function on July 17. The HC administration has claimed that the pilot exercise has successfully continued for more than eight months with more than 65,000 subscribers and 41 lakh views received by its official YouTube channel. In its decision to livestream proceedings of other willing benches, the HC has also cited an order passed by the Supreme Court with regard to public access to court proceedings on the concept of open courts. The HC switched over to the virtual hearing mode in April last year and physical hearing has not resumed since then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-to-livestream-all-willing-benches/articleshow/84423248.cms||---
---||Delhi||Students in any class can move to govt schools without TC||New Delhi: Students studying in private schools can now shift to government schools without the transfer certificate (TC) in any class. After the admission, the directorate of education will procure the certificate directly from the previous schools. Announcing the decision on Thursday, education minister Manish Sisodia said many parents who had lost their jobs during the pandemic and could not pay the fees had approached him. To give relief to thousands of such parents, the government has taken the decision, the deputy chief minister said. “If any child wants to leave a private school and take admission in a government school, he/she will not be denied admission due to lack of a TC. Some private schools are holding back transfer certificates and asking parents to deposit the full fees first,” said Sisodia. Till now, the no-TC admission were possible in government schools up to Class VIII. It has now been extended to classes IX and above. The parents will have to submit the other documents. “For the past few years, Delhi government has been ensuring that the fees in private schools are not increased. But as the private schools moved court, they were given respite and also allowed to collect the other charges. Still, with the best lawyers, we are fighting in court to provide respite to parents,” said Sisodia. The private schools questioned the intent of the government, saying smaller schools would be the worst affected. Chandrakant Singh, national secretary of Private Land Public School Trust — an association of budget private schools, said, “Delhi School Education Act 1973 states that as long as the parents do not file an application for a TC, they will have to pay the fees. Does the government want to close down private schools?” Another association cited a Punjab and Haryana High Court order that had stayed a similar decision. R C Jain of Delhi State Public School Management Association said, “If the government doesn’t withdraw this order, we will be forced to hold a protest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/students-in-any-class-can-move-to-govt-schools-without-tc/articleshow/84455631.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Rape survivor gets court nod for abortion||AHMEDABAD: A city sessions court on Wednesday permitted a 21-year-old rape survivor to terminate her 18-week pregnancy under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act after she complained that she had been impregnated by her father-in-law. The woman had approached the city sessions court last week and requested the court to permit her to abort her fetus because she did not want to keep the pregnancy. She told the court that she was impregnated by her father-in-law and it is not socially and religiously permissible to her to deliver such a child. Moreover, her financial condition also does not permit her to bear the cost involved in raising the child, if allowed to be born. The public prosecutor Sudhir Brahmbhatt subscribed to the rape survivor’s arguments and submitted that considering the peculiar facts of the case, it is not possible for the woman to deliver the child and therefore she was required to be permitted to terminate her pregnancy. After hearing the case, the court had sent the woman to the Civil Hospital for medical examination by two gynaecologists and sought their report. After perusal of the report, the court observed that the rape survivor is an adult woman and since the pregnancy is not beyond 20 weeks, the bar of the MTP Act would not cause hindrance in allowing her to abort. The court permitted the woman to end her pregnancy with observation that when protector has become predator, termination of pregnancy is definitely in the welfare of the victim. The court ordered termination of pregnancy before it advances beyond 20 weeks. It also ordered to preserve tissues of fetus so that it could be sent to the forensic science laboratory for DNA testing in order to nail the accused in criminal investigation. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rape-survivor-gets-court-nod-for-abortion/articleshow/84423242.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab announces Rs 590 crore debt waiver for farm labourers, landless farmers||CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday announced a loan waiver of Rs 590 crore under the farm debt waiver scheme for labourers and landless farmers. The cheques would be issued at a state-level function on August 20, said an official spokesperson after a meeting held on Tuesday. The Punjab government will pay off loans to the tune of Rs 590 crore of 2,85,325 members of the primary agricultural cooperative societies (Pacs), thus ensuring a relief of Rs 20,000 per member, said the chief minister. He directed the finance and cooperation departments to kick off the process for effective implementation of the decision on the ground. Loan waiver for Dalit landless farm labourers was also one of the 18 public welfare schemes that the three-member AICC panel had conveyed to the chief minister during his meeting last month. The Punjab government has formulated a Debt Relief Scheme for Farm Labourers and Landless Farming Members of Pacs-2019, which will cover only consumption loan to members of the Pacs advanced by District Central Cooperative Banks in the state of Punjab through Pacs. The announcements follow the waiver of loans for farmers under the chief minister’s flagship ‘Debt Waiver Scheme’. So far, loans worth Rs 4,624 crore have been waived for as many as 5.64 lakh farmers under the scheme, which was announced as part of the 2017 poll promises by the Punjab Congress, said the spokesperson. Loans of SC and BC categories have been written off up to the amount of Rs 50,000 each, including waiver up to Rs 58.39 crore of 6,405 beneficiaries by the SC corporation and Rs 20.71 crore of 1,225 beneficiaries by the BC corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-announces-rs-590cr-debt-waiver-for-farm-labourers-landless-farmers/articleshow/84423176.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune zilla parishad tests 20,925 people in 109 ‘hotspot villages’, finds 422 Covid cases||PUNE: Altogether 422 people have so far tested Covid positive during a special drive conducted in 109 ‘hotspot villages’ across 13 tehsils of the district on Tuesday and Wednesday. “All these people are asymptomatic and they have been admitted to Covid care centres of the respective tehsils. If we had not conducted the tests, these people would have mingled with other villagers. This would have resulted in a surge of cases,” said Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer of the Pune zilla parishad (ZP) “Though the positivity rate is low, we can’t rule out the spread of the virus. We have now decided to continue with the mass-scale Covid testing in the district,” he added. The ZP tested 20,925 people during the two-day drive in the “hotspot villages”. The district administration earmarks a village with 10 or more active Covid cases as a “hotspot village”. The maximum number of positive cases was found in Ambegaon and Junnar tehsils. “Collectively, 107 positive cases have been found in the two tehsils during the two days. Mobility of farmers in these tehsils is more. They go to different vegetable markets to sell their harvest. This could be one of the main reasons behind the scenario,” Prasad said. This was the first time the ZP has adopted the mass-level testing strategy. Earlier, it had only conducted door-to-door surveys of the symptomatic and asymptomatic people in villages. Prasad said the drive would be gradually intensified . “Our aim is to make more villages Covid-free. The mass-scale testing strategy will make it possible,” he said. District health officer Dr Bhagwan Pawar said, “We conducted both the RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests during the drive. In case of a person testing positive, we carried out RT-PCR test of his or her family members, close contacts and acquaintances,” he said. Velha is the only tehsil in the district not reporting any Covid positive case. “The overall positivity rate of this tehsil is very low. Limited people from this tehsil commute to other areas and cities. As a result, the spread of Covid has been under control. It had only two ‘hotspot villages” said Dr Ambadas Devkar, tehsil health officer of Velhe. Over 2,500 teams, consisting of doctors, nurses and health workers, were involved in the drive by the zilla parishad. Rural Pune’s Covid positivity rate has been over 7% for the past four weeks. It is still under the Level 4 restrictions. All tourist spots and destinations are still closed for people. Hotels, restaurants and eateries are not permitted to dine in rural Pune that covers 13 tehsils and 14 municipal councils.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/zp-tests-21k-people-in-109-hotspot-villages-finds-422-covid-cases/articleshow/84423237.cms||Sandip Dighe

After a strong 2020-21, April had a weak start in terms of the fresh net additions, thanks to the second wave of Covid19 infections due to which new connections could not be serviced. The number of total mobile subscribers in Gujarat stood at 6.97 crore in April up from 6.94 crore in March this year. Even pan India, the net additions remained muted due to the second wave of Covid infections and lockdowns and other locally imposed restrictions. New user addition slowed as fresh connections could not be serviced due to restrictions, according to telecom industry sources. The demand for new connections has been sustained since the pandemic as people are opting for multiple connections to ensure uninterrupted internet connectivity for work from home and online education, said telecom industry sources. As per data released by TRAI, Bharti Airtel added some 72,536 new subscribers whereas Reliance Jio added some 3.6 lakh new subscribers.  On the other hand, state-owned telecom operator, BSNL lost some 10,592 subscribers whereas Vi (Vodafone-Idea) lost some 81,610 subscribers in April alone.

A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh issued notice, asking Delhi government, DMC and Khan to reply to the petition which has claimed that the new chairman is closely aligned with Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and has been actively involved in taking part in party rallies in announcing the policies and promulgating its agenda. The plea filed by Delhi resident Abdul Amir Amiro said Zakir Khan, who had won from Badarpur municipal ward on Congress ticket in 2012 and had joined AAP in 2017, replaced former DMC chairman Zafarul Islam Khan last year. Citing the relevant service (conduct) rules, the petition said chairman and other members of DMC authorised by the commission to perform functions under the DMC Act are deemed to be public servants and they cannot get associated with a political party or organisation and cannot join any association whose objects or activities are prejudicial to the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India, public order and morality. “Khan knowingly misused his power and position for promoting a political party. He had knowingly misused his power and position to influence others by placing the photographs on public platform, that is, on Facebook,” the plea said, seeking immediate removal of Khan from the post and a direction to the authorities to withdraw all facilities given to him and to stop his remuneration. The petitioner said he made a representation to the Delhi government, ministry of minority affairs and lieutenant governor in March regarding the acts of Khan but no action was taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-seeks-response-to-plea-for-dmc-chiefs-ouster/articleshow/84423253.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In their petition, H Raja and V Suryanarayanan, news editor of RSS South Union stated that they have not committed any offence as alleged by the police and they have been falsely implicated in this case due to political motive. The Thirumayam judicial magistrate court which had taken cognizance of the final report in the case, had issued summons to them to appear before the court on July 23. The petitioners further stated that their reputation would be affected if they are arrested. Stating that they were willing to abide by any conditions imposed by the court, the petitioners sought anticipatory bail. Since the government advocate sought time to file a counter and as another counsel sought permission to file an intervening petition, justice G Chandrasekharan adjourned the case to July 16. The case of the prosecution is that petitioners and others by violating the orders of the court proceeded to set up a stage for a meeting as part of the Vinayaka Chaturthi celebration at Pudukkottai district on September 15, 2018. When the police officials attempted to stop them, Raja picked up an argument in which he passed derogatory comments about the judiciary. Following this incident, the Thirumayam police registered a case against petitioners and several others. After completing the investigation, police filed the final report before the Thirumayam judicial magistrate court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/h-raja-seeks-advance-bail-says-reputation-at-stake-if-held/articleshow/84423232.cms||---

Durgesh Kumar Gupta didn’t have to work too hard as he escaped from the police station located in the old city and fled in an auto-rickshaw. The cops learnt about his escape after some time and swung into action. The incident occurred at around 5 pm. Gupta, who was in the lock-up, requested the police to allow him to use the washroom. He was taken to the washroom that had a small window. Gupta managed to remove a few bricks from the window and sneaked out of it. He then strolled across the road and hired an auto-rickshaw. The cops later scanned the CCTV footage and tracked down the vehicle he had boarded. The driver told the cops that Gupta got down at a bus depot in Sayajigunj. Further investigations revealed that he boarded a bus to Ahmedabad. Senior police officials have ordered an inquiry into the security lapse. Gupta is an accused in a cheating case wherein three men duped a woman and stole her gold bangles some days ago. He was arrested by the police on July 7 but he tested positive for Covid.

A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi also directed the authorities to disconnect the electricity supply and water supply to the unit. The judges ordered notice and adjourned the case to a further date for hearing. The court passed the order while hearing a public interest litigation filed by F Anderson Xavier, a resident of Poothurai village in the district. The petitioner stated that the unit is functioning in his village without obtaining proper permission. He stated that water from the unit is being let into open places along the seashore and also in the sea. This poses a threat to the environment. He further stated that people at the locality were also facing difficulties due to the bad odour emanating from the unit. Though the officials after an inspection found out that the unit was functioning without any proper permission, the owner and the workers of the unit prevented them from sealing the premises.

The court hoped that the state would take earnest steps for acquisition of land for the extension of the runway. A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that the Centre in a counter to make the Madurai airport an international airport had stated that the decision has to be taken by the cabinet and matters are yet to proceed in those directions. The judges said that the Centre submitted that there is a proposal for extension of the runway from 2,286m to 3,810m. However, as pointed out by Madurai airport director, the extension would be feasible only if the state government is able to acquire the land. Centre also submitted that the state government should re-align the state highway which would be affected if the runway extension has to take place. The judges observed that the first step which has to be taken is with regard to extension of the runway. If it is done it would pave the way for handling larger aircrafts and heavier traffic. Once this is implemented, then the next step that can be taken is to declare Madurai airport as an international airport. The judges observed that the Centre submitted that a plant protection officer has been posted during December 2020 exclusively for Madurai airport. It is not clear as to whether the assistant plant protection officer is a certifying authority or not. If he is not, then the concerned department can examine whether such power can be delegated to the said officer or else an officer who has powers to certify the cargo needs to be posted in order to avoid keeping the cargo in the cold storage facility for a number of days. The court made these observations while disposing of a batch of PILs filed by N Jegatheesan, president of TNCCI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/centre-tells-hc-plan-on-for-runway-extn-at-madurai-airport/articleshow/84423238.cms||---

Cyber Crime police station sources said victim Arbaz Rana (25), a resident of Nanpura, alleged that he saw an advertisement on a website that offered Rs four crore for a kidney. Rana told police that due to the financial crisis he decided to sell his kidney and make money to repay debt. Trusting the website, Rana contacted the number given through WhatsApp in September 2020. The woman on the other end introduced herself as Dr Shilpa Kumari of Manipal Hospital in Bengaluru. Police claimed that it was a fake identity given by the woman. Later, Rana was contacted by different people on phone and email. The miscreants created an email ID that looked similar to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).  They convinced Rana that he will get Rs two crore before kidney donation and the remaining amount later. They demanded payment of various charges and believing them, Rana paid money in multiple transactions through online payment. The accused continued demanding money after which Rana realized that he had been cheated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/textile-broker-offers-to-sell-kidney-to-offset-losses/articleshow/84420393.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Four panchayats in Pratapgarh attain 100% vaccination target||JAIPUR: Four gram panchayats in Pratapgarh–Kesunda, Jaloda Jagir, Basedi and Gamena—is leading with an example by attaining 100% vaccinations for the 18 and above age group while countering the vaccine hesitancy. All four GPs has 12,274 persons above the age of 18 plus as per the district figure. Of the total, 11,465 persons have been vaccinated by June 9. The remaining 508 persons are left out due to valid reasons listed in the rules. It wasn’t easy for the district which had faced severe opposition to the vaccination drive in the rural areas. Till June, several vaccination camps in rural areas have had under 10 vaccinations. The local administration has held a special drive from reaching out to elected representatives and influencers to make this feat possible. Pratapgarh collector Renu Jaipal said, “Initially, it was a challenge, but we designed several tailor-made initiatives derived from the state rules which has motivated the rural vaccination drive.” Jaipal has followed the pattern of the election voter list and carried out a survey in villages to figure out how many persons above the age of 18 are available. “The data has given the exact picture of how many beneficiaries are available for vaccines and in what all means of livelihood they are engaged. One thing was clear that flexibility of time is key in achieving any target. The camps at several places ran for 18 hours a day allowing the beneficiaries to vaccinate according to their convenient time,” said Jaipal. Once the vaccination is done, the team took the follow up of the villagers to cross-check if anyone eligible is not left behind. Thereafter the villages are declared vaccinated at least one to every resident. The administration is promoting these villages as a role models before other villages and gram panchayats to motivate them for vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/4-panchayats-in-pratapgarh-attain-100-vaccination-target/articleshow/84423280.cms||Shoeb Khan

---||Delhi||Was told DDA razed church, Delhi govt has no control over it: CM||Panaji: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday assured justice in a matter related to the demolition of a church in the national capital, saying that the action was taken by Delhi Development Authority (DDA), which comes under the central government. The south Delhi district administration on July 12 razed a church built upon “encroached” land during a demolition drive in Chhatarpur. However, the church members termed the action “illegal”, claiming that a notice was not served to vacate the premises. “I was initially told that the demolition was carried out by the Delhi Development Authority. DDA comes under the central government. The Delhi government has no control over it,” Kejriwal told reporters in Panaji during his visit. “The DDA perhaps approached the high court, which gave the order and DDA took the action,” he said, responding to a query on the issue. The AAP national convener also said that the local MLA of his party is with the church and providing all the help. “If there was a stay order by the high court, the demolition of the portion would not have happened. I don’t know the legal part of the matter. When I arrived here yesterday, I was told that such action had been taken,” he said. Kejriwal said he will go back to Delhi and study the matter. “I can only assure you that justice will be done and whatever is right will be upheld,” he added. However, the Congress hit out at Kejriwal and accused him of lying on the church demolition issue. Addressing the media in Goa, Congress national spokesperson, Shama Mohamed, alleged that both AAP and the BJP were behind the demolition of the church, which she said was razed even without serving a notice to its management. She said BJP and AAP are two sides of the same coin as both “spread hatred and encourage communal divide for their selfish political gains”. pti||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/was-told-dda-razed-church-delhi-govt-has-no-control-over-it-cm/articleshow/84423447.cms||---

All the dogs are Labradors, which were born in 2011 within months of each other. They underwent training at dog training centres in couple of locations of paramilitary forces though the new batches of the canines have graduated from CISF dog training centre in Ranchi. While Army gives rank to their canine colleagues, the CISF does not at present.

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Schools to restart today in Covid-free villages||PUNE: Some schools in the rural parts of Maharashtra, where Covid cases are low or absent, are set to reopen from Thursday. These schools, including some in Pune district, will resume classes 8 to 12 for a start. The reopening decision comes after the setting of standard operating procedures (SOPs) for schools by the state government, permission from the gram panchayats and orientation with parents regarding sending their children to school. School representatives said the orientation dwelt on safety measures that would be adopted. Velhe-based teacher Santosh Ghuge said, “We discussed the nitty-gritty of reopening schools during our meeting with the education officers, who told us of the guidelines to follow. We later spoke to the parents about the rules. We got a positive response from them and are hoping for good attendance.” Schools to restart today in Covid-free villagesLast week, the education department issued a notification stating that while it continued to promote remote learning, it was also working on restarting classroom education in villages where there were no Covid cases. Among the important guidelines for reopening is that the school staff should be vaccinated on priority before classes begin. The sarpanch of each village will head an eight-member committee to monitor the implementation of the Covid safety guidelines in the schools. The chief executive officer of the local zilla parishad (ZP) will supervise the operations and review the situation on a regular basis. The committee will include the collector, school principals and health officials. The schools will have to follow all SOPs and conduct timely temperature checks of students inside the campus. Schools are also instructed to monitor the proper implementation of social distancing norms, including allowing just 15-20 students per classroom. Senior ZP school teacher Arvind Jagtap said, “All our staff members have been fully vaccinated. We are ready to reopen our school from Thursday and have received permission from the gram panchayat.” Sushma Ghuge from Indapur taluka, mother of a class 10 student, said, “Since it is a crucial year for my daughter, I feel she should attend classroom sessions rather than take online lessons. There are many problems learning online as we have just one cellphone at home. It becomes difficult to give our daughter the phone for 5-6 hours daily. Besides, classroom teaching is always effective.” Class 10 student Avinash Raut from Maval taluka said, “My school has told us that they are still waiting for some permissions from the gram panchayats to reopen. But we have been asked to be ready for classroom teaching and should be able to attend school within a week. I am happy as I have to clear a lot of doubts that I find in my textbooks.” Pune ZP chief executive officer Ayush Prasad said, “There are around 1,000 villages in Pune district that can reopen schools and a majority of them will start classes from Thursday. By next week, almost all of them will start functioning.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/classroom-edu-to-resume-today-in-states-covid-free-villages/articleshow/84423341.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: ‘Enrolment ratio for higher classes better than national average’||JAIPUR: Rajasthan has made significant gains in the gross enrolment ratio (GER) by recording 58.8% enrolments in classes 11 and 12, while the national average in the category is just 51.4%. The GER in school education is defined as the percentage of population in the age group of 6-17 enrolled in classes XI-XII. The Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) report 2019-20 further says GER at the primary level was 106, the additional 6% is due to the migrant population admitting their wards in the state. The state stood 10th in GER with 54.2% in the Scheduled Tribe category in the higher secondary classes, while the national average was 42.9%. Similarly, the state has a lead in all other categories like primary, upper primary, secondary and higher secondary classes than the national average. “The fairly high GER among tribals of the state by the report is one side of the coin. The GER in Tribal Sub Plan areas like Dungarpur, Banswara and Pratapgarh have poor GER, while those living in the eastern side — Karauli, Dausa and Sawai Madhopur — has higher GER among the tribal populace,” said Vela Ram Ghogra, state president of Bharatiya Tribal Party. The state is fast attaining a gender balance in the number of teachers with 4.63 lakh male teachers against 3.10 lakh female teachers. A total of 7,74,021 teachers were placed in schools in 2019-20. In government schools, the gender divide is much steeper with 1,31,107 female teachers against 2,64,040 male teachers. Nationally, male teachers accounted for about 27.97 lakh while female teachers were close to 21.41 lakh. “Going by any calculation, the gender balance in the state government schools is not even close to the national average. Secondly, it is seen that female teachers have a great impact on girl students. The participation of female teachers has to be increase,” said K B Kothari, an educationist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/enrolment-ratio-for-higher-classes-better-than-national-average/articleshow/84425509.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Two lakh autos on roads, but income still below 40% in Mumbai: Unions||MUMBAI: The number of autorickshaws on city roads crossed the two lakh mark this week but daily earnings of drivers remained under 40% of the income in pre-lockdown days, said union leaders on Wednesday. The city has 2.32 lakh autos registered with the state transport department. The jump in the number of autos on the roads has been 300% from the 50,000 eight months ago and 33% from the 1.5 lakh four months ago, said the unions. “The drivers are plying autos to make ends meet. The daily earnings have dropped from Rs 1,000 to Rs 500-600. With overhead costs and inflation, they are finding it difficult to run families,” Shashank Rao, leader of the Mumbai Autorickshawmen’s Union, said. He said that autorickshaws were more visible on the roads these days but the riders were comparatively low in number. He attributed it to the Covid-19 restrictions, suburban trains not carrying all passengers and share auto services not being allowed to function. “In the past, the majority of riders would alight from trains and board autos on feeder routes,” the leader of the largest union of autorickshaw drivers said. Another reason why commuters were opting out of autos and taxis for short-distance travel was the latest increase in fares by Rs 3. “Several people are affected by the pandemic and do not have the money to spend on autos and taxis and if it is a short distance, they prefer to walk it down,” Thampy Kurien, leader of another union, said. Kurien said that over two lakh autos may be on roads, but these were facing a major parking issue. “The traffic police catch them for parking on road or in no-parking zones. We are meeting transport minister Anil Parab with a petition to demand parking slots for autos in the suburbs,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/unions-2-lakh-autos-on-rds-but-income-still-below-40-in-mumbai/articleshow/84425564.cms||Somit Sen

This rate will be valid from July 1. Despite difficult circumstances arising out of Covid situation, the state government will spend about Rs 4,000 crore annually on this to support the employees,” Gehlot tweeted. Around 15 lakh employees and pensioners in the state will be benefitted by this decision. In addition to government employees, work-charged employees, panchayat samiti and zila parishad employees will also get the benefit of hiked DA. The Centre on Wednesday approved an increase in Dearness Allowance (DA) and Dearness Relief (DR) given to central government employees and pensioners from 17% to 28%. The hike will be applicable from July 1, 2021 and it will directly benefit around 48.34 lakh central government employees and 65.26 lakh pensioners, Union minister of information and broadcasting Anurag Thakur said. In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Centre had frozen the three additional instalments of the DA and DR which were due from January 1, 2020, July 1, 2020 and January 1, 2021. The increase in the DA and DR will impose an additional annual burden of Rs 34,401 crore on the exchequer, Thakur said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/da-for-state-govt-employees-and-pensioners-hiked-to-28/articleshow/84423315.cms||---

Babu, who took charge as head of police force a couple of weeks back, made his first visit to Madurai as DGP. All higher police officials in the southern districts took part in the meeting held at the Madurai city police commissioner’s office. He instructed the officials to effectively use Goondas Act to detain rowdies inside prisons to curb their movement. He wanted old pending cases against rowdies to be speeded up and ensure that they get maximum punishment in those cases. He also wanted the activities like ganja smuggling, usury and khap panchayats to be dealt with utmost severity. Babu felicitated police constables Marimuthu, Kakkaramuthu, Senthil, Venkatesh Babu, Sundaramoorthi and Kannadasan with cash rewards of Rs 5,000 each. Similarly, Selvakumar, a constable from Madurai city police’s special team was given a cash reward for chasing and catching a notorious accused involved in a series of burglary cases in the city.

We should be able to launch the system within a month and while the mode of fare payment via cash will remain for now, it will be stopped in phases as people become more comfortable with the cashless form of fare payment,” Laxminarayan Mishra, chairman-cum-managing director, PMPML, said on Wednesday during his first interaction with the media after resuming office. “The PMPML has an application (PMP e-connect), which presently has become inactive. The same will be activated again and features, including live and real-time tracking of buses, live display of routes, bus schedule etc, will be available for commuters,” the official added. Mishra said that it was a challenge to get more people to travel on PMPML buses. “We are looking at ways to increase ridership and one option will be to introduce free Wi-fi services on buses to attract more commuters. There is a problem when it comes to buses not arriving on time and that, too, will be taken care of using the live bus tracking system,” the CMD said. He added that a system will be developed to do away with conductors on buses. “In developed countries like Singapore, for instance, public buses don’t have conductors and the entire system is state-of-the-art and electronic. We will be looking at a system in which recruitment of conductors after retirement will be limited and stopped eventually and the buses will not need any conductors,” the official said. Presently, the PMPML runs around 1,000 buses on different routes. “The rural routes started by us recently have been doing exceptionally well. The PMC and the PCMC pay the transport body each month at a ratio of 60:40. If more rural routes are introduced, the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) needs to pay us also. We have written a letter to the PMRDA on the issue and awaiting their answer,” PMPML joint managing director Chetna Kerure said. Free rides for ladies on anvil The CMD said that they were planning a system in which ladies travelling in buses will not be charged. “In cities like Delhi, the system has already been introduced. We do plan to do the same here on our all-women Tejaswini buses. However, we need to study our business condition and decide accordingly. Due to Covid, the revenue of the PMPML has reduced by almost 60% in the last financial year,” the CMD said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-pmpml-cmd-prioritises-contactless-ticketing-system-in-times-of-pandemic/articleshow/84423325.cms||Joy Sengupta

A few thousand students had appeared for the exams conducted for the first time through online mode in December. They were asked to upload their answer sheets online before a stipulated time and also to send the hard copies through courier. However, only those who submitted through online mode were evaluated. An MA English student said she appeared for six papers including two arrear papers. In one subject she scored only 4 marks. “I wrote over 30 pages and I am confident that I will pass the paper convincingly. But it was a rude shock when I learnt that I had scored less than 5 marks.,” she said. The university administration had announced that there is no revaluation option available. An assistant professor of the distance education department said they were only asked to evaluate papers submitted through online mode. They came across a few papers which had only a few sheets. They had no option but to provide marks only for pages available online. MKU vice-chancellor M Krishnan told TOI that a sizeable number of candidates who appeared for the exam have faced similar issue. It is due to technical glitches. “I have given instruction to list out such cases and do evaluation in the off-line mode for them. Students do not need to apply for revaluation,” he said. An official of the distance education department said since the deadline for applying for the next exam is approaching, they are not sure if they can complete revaluation. They are likely to provide a day’s extension for applying while they try to complete the revaluation in the mean time, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/vc-orders-offline-evaluation-to-check-single-digit-scores/articleshow/84423339.cms||V Devanathan
---||Chandigarh||Jathedar of Akal Takht Giani Harpreet Singh says Dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim let off, SIT rejects claim||AMRITSAR: Officiating jathedar of Akal Takht Giani Harpreet Singh has alleged that the name of Dera Sacha Sauda (DSS) chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim, currently in jail, has been deleted from the FIR number 128 registered in case of desecration of Guru Granth Sahib, by the newly constituted Special Investigation Team (SIT) while presenting the challan in a Faridkot court. Harpreet Singh on Wednesday said the previous SIT had registered an FIR number 63 about the saroop of Guru Granth Sahib which was taken away by the mischievous elements from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala wherein Ram Rahim was nominated. Another FIR number 128 was registered in which Ram Rahim was nominated again. FIR number 128 was registered under Sections 295, 295 A, 153-A, 201, 120 B of the IPC at Bajakhana police station on the statement of the manager of Gurdwara Sahib Bargari on October 12, 2015. “Despite the high court saying that both cases are co-related, the new SIT has deleted the name of Gurmeet from the FIR number 128,” alleged the officiating jathedar, adding that he smelt of a political conspiracy behind taking mileage from the sacrilege case during ensuing 2022 assembly elections. The SIT had on July 9 filed a challan before a Faridkot court in Bargari sacrilege case against six alleged accused sans Gurmeet Ram Rahim in case of desecration of Guru Granth Sahib in Bargari on October 12, 2015. “The incidents of sacrileges are a very sensitive issue for Sikhs and any kind of politics on the issue should be avoided and instead the culprits should be exposed and put behind the bars,” said Harpreet Singh. When contacted, SIT chief S P S Parmar said CBI had not nominated even a single person in a case filed under FIR number 128, leave alone the name of DSS chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim. “It is our achievement that we have arrested six persons and presented their challan in the court. These six persons have named another three persons who are core committee members of the Dera Sacha Sauda and are yet to be arrested. If they will name Gurmeet Ram Rahim, then we will interrogate him too,” said Parmar. About FIR number 63, the SIT chief said Gurmeet was nominated in the FIR, but CBI had instead filed a cancellation report. However, the Dera Sacha Sauda chief was still nominated in the case. He said primarily their focus was on FIR numbers 128 and 117, following which they would investigate the case filed under FIR number 63. Officiating jathedar of Akal Takht who also holds the charge of jathedar of Takht Damdama Sahib said he had convened a meeting of Sikh bodies at Takht Damdama Sahib on Friday. “As many as 100 Sikh organizations from across the world will participate in the meeting to discuss the sacrilege issues,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/jathedar-says-dera-chief-let-off-sit-rejects-claim/articleshow/84423329.cms||Yudhvir Rana

On Wednesday following a review meeting regarding the auction of shops, buildings and plots under various schemes of the LDA it was decided to determine the plot size based on demand so that the LDA can sell them quickly and increase its revenue. “During the auction of plots on Tuesday it was found that buyers were not showing much interest in putting their money in large plots. Total eight properties were sold for Rs 101.3 crore in Gomtinagar Extension. Therefore, it’s necessary that large plots should be re-planned and the size should be decided according to the demand of buyers by conducting a survey. I have directed officers concerned to complete the process and submit the report within three days,” said vice-chairperson, LDA, Abhishek Prakash.

---||Lucknow||LUTA rejects CMS, says move will subvert univ’s autonomy||Lucknow: The Lucknow University Teachers’ Association (LUTA) on Wednesday said any attempt to impose the Common Minimum Syllabus (CMS) drafted by the higher education department will subvert the autonomy of state universities, and if the state government wants to implement CMS, it should do so at its level by amending the UP State Universities Act. “If the government wants to implement CMS, it may do so but it should not make universities a partner to the disastrous move which will be detrimental to the interests of the students. However, it should be kept in mind that universities, not governments, draft syllabus in all democracies across the world,” LUTA president Vineet Kumar Verma and general secretary Rajendra Kumar Verma said in a statement issued on the behalf of teachers. The move came a day after the higher education department sent another order asking state universities to include 70% CMS in their respective syllabus for implementation from the next academic session. A similar order was issued in April claiming that CMS has been drafted as per the New Education Policy (NEP) 2020. “After thorough discussions, LU teachers had earlier rejected the CMS. Subsequently, as per the orders of the vice-chancellor, departments adopted the four-year undergraduate course structure as recommended in the NEP. Further, since NEP advocates autonomy for academic institutions, teachers went ahead to draft the syllabus, which will be tabled before the Academic Council for approval on July 17. The syllabus was drafted while keeping in mind the Prime Minister’s speech delivered at the centenray celebrations in which he said that every university should cater to the local needs,” it said. “However, it seems that the government wants to subvert the autonomy of the universities by imposing the CMS. By doing so, it is violating the spirit of NEP and going against the PM’s wish. Every university is free to draft its own syllabus as per the local demographic, geographic and social needs. A common syllabus in all universities will put an end to special status of the universities and degrade them to ‘inter college level’,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/luta-rejects-cms-says-move-will-subvert-univs-autonomy/articleshow/84425541.cms||---

S Thirupathy, a civil engineer from Karaikudi in Sivaganga district, has been working in Dubai for the past three years. He had come to his hometown during the first Covid lockdown and returned a few months later. On his return to Dubai, he found that there were no more job opportunities for him and decided to return. As he did not have enough money, he approached his employer Thava Selvam, who told him that he would get a commission of Rs 1.2 lakh if he took some goods to India. Thava Selvam introduced him to Sadam, a broker in Dubai, who handed over three balls of gold each weighing 180 grams. In his complaint, Thirupathy said he returned to India through the Chennai airport on July 2 and had brought all three balls of gold by concealing them in his anal cavity. He stated that he handed over one of the gold balls to his cousin Naganathan and another to the people sent by his employer Thava Selvam. The third he kept to himself and brought to Karaikudi. Thirupathy said a gang arrived in Karaikudi on July 3 and threatened his father Soundarapandian with dire consequences if his son did not hand over all the three balls of solid gold to them. Soundarapandian filed a complaint with Karaikudi North police station stating that there was threat to his life and sought police protection. A case was filed under section 506(1) of IPC for criminal intimidation and he was also given police protection. When contacted, superintendent of police T Senthil Kumar said the matter was under investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/karaikudi-man-who-smuggled-in-gold-faces-threat-given-police-protection/articleshow/84423376.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||No crunch; Shiromani Akali Dal spreading lies, says Punjab industry and commerce minister Sunder Sham Arora||CHANDIGARH: Punjab industry and commerce minister Sunder Sham Arora on Wednesday defended the state government over the recent power crisis in the state, claiming that the state government was supplying 24-hour electricity to industry at Rs 5 per unit and has given a subsidy of Rs 3,669 crore to the sector from 2018 to 2021. Terming opposition’s statements about power shortage for industry in the state as baseless, Arora said the state government ensured a conducive environment for industry and there was no power crisis at all in the state. Opposition party Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), however, rubbished Arora’s claim. It said he was spreading lies. SAD trade and industry wing president and Dera Bassi MLA N K Sharma asked the industry minister if he was not aware of power restrictions imposed on industry. He said Punjab industrialists were a harassed lot and they were looking for alternatives to Punjab only to save their business. Arora also hit out at Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s claim of a power shortage, saying that it was politically motivated. The industry minister said Adityanath was always in a hurry to give a statement without knowing facts. He said the UP CM’s comments about Malerkotla district in the past had also been criticised. SAD, however, asked the minister to first tell people why industrialists from Punjab had to meet Adityanath. Arora targetted the previous SAD-BJP government over power-purchase agreements (PPAs) signed during its term. He said leaders who had taken anti-Punjab decisions, had no right to make any statement regarding the power sector. The minister said industrial policy of Punjab was the best in the country due to which the state had witnessed investment worth Rs 91,000 crore in the last four years. He claimed that Punjab had been a favourite destination for industrialists and of the 2,900 investment proposals, 51% had already started their businesses, including 20 foreign firms. Arora said the state government had come up with the Right to Business Act and single-window system to ensure solution of all issues under one roof.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/minister-no-crunch-sad-spreading-lies/articleshow/84423415.cms||---

The police on Tuesday registered a case of house trespass and assault against the duo. The elderly woman on Tuesday morning lodged a complaint with the Uttamnagar police station. Senior police inspector Vaishali Chandgude of the Uttamnagar police station said, “The elderly woman has two sons. One stays with her and the other stays on another residential premises in Uttamnagar. Both her sons are married.” “The wife of the son, who stays separately, wants a share in the flat where the elderly woman stays. She also wants the possession of the flat. The elderly woman’s husband passed away a few years back,” Chandgude said. On Monday evening, the elderly woman’s daughter-in-law and grandson went to the flat when the former was alone. Both the women had an argument over the flat’s possession, she said. “The daughter-in-law then approached the police and lodged a non-cognisable offence against her mother-in-law”, Chandgude said. “After registering the non-recognisable offense, the elderly woman’s daughter-in-law and grandson went to the former’s flat with a hammer and long rod. The elderly woman refused to open the door, following which the duo broke it open using the hammer and rod,” Chandgude added. After barging into the flat, the duo slapped and punched the elderly woman and forcibly evicted her, she said. “Her son, who had gone out, returned home and the duo beat him up as well,” she added. The elderly woman suffered injuries on her hands and back. “She then then approached us. We went to the spot and shifted the woman to her flat,” she said. “The elderly woman and the daughter-in-law were fighting for the ownership of the flat. It is a civil case, but the elderly woman’s daughter-in-law decided to take the possession of the flat forcibly,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/elderly-woman-beaten-up-by-grandson-daughter-in-law/articleshow/84423355.cms||---

A total of 700 kg of stale fish and those laced with formalin were seized by them. Food safety officials said the chemical, which is used to preserve dead bodies, can cause diarrhoea if consumed and if taken for a long period, can lead to serious health problems including cancer. Designated officer for food safety Dr Jayarama Pandian said that they initially conducted a check in the retail fish stalls in Karimedu area, where they found that formalin was used to preserve fish. A total of 630 kg of stale and formalin-laced fishes were seized. “We detected the presence of the chemical by conducting spot tests using a strip available with us. Once the strip comes in contact with the fish, it will change colour in a few seconds if formalin is present. The chemical was not directly applied on fishes, but mixed with the ice used to preserve them,” he said. Following this, the team conducted a check at the wholesale fish market functioning at Mattuthavani and found about 70 kg of stale fish. Pandian said that since they conducted a check at Karimedu, the traders at Mattuthavani got alerted and shifted the consignments. He said they let off the traders with a strong warning since it was the first time they were caught indulging in the practice. They will see action like closing down of shops if they repeat the mistake. “We will keep a close watch on the sea food sales in the city and rural areas in the days to come. Surprise checks will be carried out to catch wrongdoers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/formalin-laced-fish-seized-in-madurai/articleshow/84423357.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Two in Special Operations Group net for printing fake notes in Jaipur||JAIPUR: The Special Operations Group (SOG) of Rajasthan police arrested two members of a gang involved in printing fake Indian currency notes (FICN) from a house in the city Wednesday. The SOG seized Rs 5,80,900 FICN from the two accused identified as Brajesh Maurya (28) and Pratham Sharma (19). DIG (SOG) Sharat Kaviraj said that the fake currency recovered from the accused is of high quality, despite the fact that the notes were printed from a normal inkjet printer. This is probably one of the first incidents that a city-based gang was found to be printing and circulating high-quality FICN because in most of the past incidents, the police found that the currency notes were forged at different parts of the country, including in Malda in West Bengal and brought here for circulation. The SOG also seized printers, scanning and lamination machines, and papers that were used by the gang to print out fake currency. Talking to TOI, Kaviraj said that at the first glance, the FICN seized from the gang may look indistinguishable from the original currency notes. He advised people to take due caution before accepting cash. “The bleed line on a fake Rs 500 note looks akin to the one found on the original currency notes. However, if one were to scratch over the line, it may come off easily,” he said. Similarly, the bleed line on the original notes is embedded, while the gang had put it separately pasted it above the forged notes. “Though the notes were produced from a simple printer, the gang managed to mimic several key features of the original notes. Therefore, I advise people to pay more attention to the quality of the notes,” Kaviraj said. The Rajasthan police are now working to track down other suspected members of the gang.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/two-in-sog-net-for-printing-fake-notes-in-city/articleshow/84423358.cms||---

In the absence of identity from the employers, they are deprived of social security such as medical facilities, insurance, maternity benefits, education, pension, etc. Before the state assembly elections, the Congress had in its manifesto announced a mining workers welfare board. But more than two-and-a-half years have passed, the board was yet to see light of the day. On Monday, Mine Labour Protection Campaign (MLPC) submitted representations to state labour minister Tikaram Jully, health minister Raghu Sharma and revenue minister Harish Chaudhary to fulfill the promise made in the manifesto. “Occupational health hazards are the prime concerns for mine workers. Today, because they do not have any identity records, they are exploited and do not get any compensation or assistance. A welfare board will address the spectrum of problems they are facing,” said Rana Sengupta of MLPC.

President of the Ramanathapuram Archaeological Research Foundation, V Rajaguru said the inscription was found on an unorganised rock, in the premises of the Nambu Easwarar temple in Nambuthalai. The inscriptions are seen on three sides of the stone. He estampaged the stone inscription and examined it. It begins with the word “Swastishri” and has a total of 61 lines of letters. Most of the letters in the inscription are erased due to weathering. The name of the king is also not mentioned anywhere. It is mentioned that it is the royal decree of Konerinmai Kondan. Though the temple is situated in Nambuthalai, the inscription says that the temple is situated in Thondi Pavithramanicka Pattinam. From the font of letters the period of this inscription is determined as the 13th century AD. It states that according to the government order, Gangai Narayana Chakravarthi and Veerasiga Devan, would donate their “Antharayam” (local tax), “Kadamai” (tax to be paid to the king based on yield), and “Viniyogam” (tax for public expenditure) to the deity of the temple Kulasekhara Pandeeswarmudaiyar. There was also another mention of a donation by Savasignana Thevar for administering the monastery. It states that the boundary of the donated land ends at the Ra Ra Peruvazhi (highway). Ra Ra Peruvazhi, is the name of the east coast highway laid during the period of Rajaraja Cholan. He said though the deity is referred to as Nambu Easwaran, the temple was constructed in the name of Kulasekhara Pandian. As the name of Gangai Narayana Chakaravarthi appears in the inscriptions in Thirupulani temples, Thalirmarungoor, Melanettoor and Aruvimalai temples in the region, Rajavelu said he may have been a chieftain of the region who executed the orders of the King.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/800-year-old-chola-dynasty-stone-inscription-found-near-thondi/articleshow/84423428.cms||---

The financial sanction of the buildings that were inaugurated by Gehlot were given in previous Vasundhara Raje government or before 2017.  None of the college buildings are for newly opened colleges by this government who are still functioning in two rooms in government schools or community centres. Sushil Bissu, general secretary of RUCTA (Rashtriya), said, “Almost all the college buildings were from previous government but the inauguration was done today. Most of the newly opened colleges are functioning in small rooms of government schools without any faculty. Government must focus on those aspects.” CM Gehlot lays foundation stone of government colleges on WednesdayRecently, according to the recommendations made by the finance department government is planning to run 35 newly opened colleges through society that will be responsible to manage their finances including recruitment. In the past such attempts have been made but due to low fees in government colleges, all those were failed. Bissu said that they do not want these colleges to be run by a society but government should make their own arrangements for appointment of faculty and buildings. Around Rs 45 crore have been spent on the 11 colleges and Rs 12 crore has been sanctioned for the colleges whose foundation stone was laid down.

MPs were informed that the whip had been issued in accordance with long established constitutional right of citizens to bring any matter of general public interest relating to the work of the Union government before Parliament. Thus, MPs will be asked to heed and act upon the whip, treating it as a direct instruction of the constituents who have elected them as MPs and to whom they are constitutionally accountable. SKM said the demands of farmers included the repeal of the three farm laws enacted during Covid times and to enact a law that gave a legal guarantee of MSP on all crops to all farmers. The MPs were also directed not to walk out of the Houses which enabled the ruling party to do their business unhindered and even if the MPs were suspended by the speaker/chairman of the Houses, they should again go to the houses to oppose the Union government, said SKM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farm-front-issues-peoples-whip-to-oppn-mps-to-fight-it-out-in-parliament/articleshow/84423475.cms||---

Associate professor and lab incharge Dr C Sugumari said the lab with a staff of about 100 people, including 65 doctors and paramedics besides 45 data entry operators, had been working round-the-clock since March 25, 2020. While they had done over 17 lakh tests in the last one year and three months, the government medical college laboratories in Chennai, including KMC, MMC, Stanley Medical College and Omandurar Medical college, put together tested around that many. With nine RT-PCR testing machines and five RNA extractors, the fully automated laboratory was able to undertake about 12,000 to 15,000 tests daily. During the first wave, they had done about 8,000 tests a day, which was the highest, but in the second wave the sample load gradually increased from 11,000 to as many as 15,801 a day in June. The staff of the medical college had also designed a tray like Elisa tray, which was sturdier than the cardboard trays, which could be loaded with 96 samples at a time and the laboratory was able to roll out the results of 1,000 samples an hour. Results of the tests were sent through SMS to the people within 24 hours, and they also had the facility to download certificates from the websites. Dr Sugumari said the staff continued to work in three shifts, and the lab had not shut down since March 25, 2020, with the staff celebrating festivals in the laboratory while serving the people. Faster results meant early isolation and disruption of the chain of transmission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/with-17-7l-tests-mmc-virology-lab-tops-tn-in-rt-pcr-testing/articleshow/84423461.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow Municipal Corporation to stem the rot, close 73 open dumping points soon||LUCKNOW: As many as 73 open dumping points in the city will be closed by the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) this month, bringing relief to residents who have been complaining about problems due to the rotting pileups for long. These sites are in several areas, including New Hyderabad, Aliganj, Jankipuram, Raqabganj, Aashiana, Aishbagh, Nishatganj and Chowk. The directives to shut these dumping points have been issued by city mayor Sanyukta Bhatia. Till now the practice was that after collecting door-to-door garbage from a locality, workers used to dump the waste at a point designated by the LMC. Later, trucks used to shift garbage to the solid waste treatment plant at Shiviri. Now, officials said the garbage will be dumped directly on trucks mounted with compactors. A truck each has been allotted for a site. These compactors will crush the garbage to accommodate maximum possible in a single load and then transfer it to the treatment plant, they added. “Earlier, garbage used to lie in the open for some time at the dumping sites before being picked by the trucks. But now it will be directly loaded on the truck, hence the problem of garbage rotting in open and creating problems for people will not arise,” said an officer. Such a garbage disposal system is currently being followed in Pune and Indore. There are around 179 such dumping points in the city. Around 1,600 metric tonnes of garbage is collected at these points daily. “Our goal is to make the city free of all the open garbage dumping sites,” said the mayor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lmc-to-stem-the-rot-close-73-open-dumping-points-soon/articleshow/84425571.cms||Pranchal Srivastava

A vial contains 11 doses but is officially counted as 10. The manufacturer gives an additional dose considering that one will go waste. But in Rajasthan, the nurses made use of the extra dose, which led to the state ultimately administering1.8% more doses. “WHO has praised Covid vaccination in the state. The WHO report has data of vaccination from May 1 to June 29, which shows the state has administered 1.8% more doses which were allocated to the state,” said health minister Raghu Sharma said. The state has so far recieved 2.67 crore doses, but administered 2.73 crore doses. Though the state has performed well in preventing wastage of doses, it has alleged discrimination, saying that a few other states were getting vaccines on demand, but this facility was not available for the state. Sharma said the Centre had allocated 65 lakh doses for July, but the requirement was much more. For vaccination of second dose, the state requires 75 lakh doses in July, which is why the state government was demanding 1.5 crore doses this month. Health department officials said several districts have shortage of vaccines. “We had 8.36 lakh doses two days ago and out of those, 95% have been administered to beneficiaries. Now, most of the districts do not have vaccines available,” said Siddharth Mahajan, secretary (health). Till 6pm on Wednesday, 3,15,792 doses were administered in the state out of which 1,81,586 were first doses and 1,34,206 second. After Wednesday’s vaccination, the state is left with handful of doses. In this regard, the state government has written to the Centre demanding urgent supply of doses to keep vaccination drive moving.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/who-praises-raj-on-preventing-wastage-of-covid-19-vaccines/articleshow/84423463.cms||---

---||Delhi||Tenders floated to empanel vendors for EV chargers||New Delhi: In a step that would make it easier for group housing societies, apartments, malls, hospitals, etc to install slow and fast electric vehicle chargers within their premises through a single-window process, tenders were floated on Wednesday for empanelment of vendors. Power discom BSES Rajdhani floated a request for selection for empanelment of charging infrastructure providers with BSES Yamuna and Tata Power. The purchase and installation of EV chargers would be provided under two options, outright purchase and on a monthly subscription basis, a statement from Delhi government mentioned. The empanelment would be accompanied by the rollout of a single-window facility for installation of EV chargers in private and semi-public spaces, including residential spaces, institutional buildings like hospitals, and commercial spaces like malls and theatres. After the rollout, consumers would be able to compare costs and features of different chargers on discom websites, order and schedule installation. Jasmine Shah, vice-chairperson of Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi said under this programme, discoms would empanel vendors at the lowest cost in India for installation of two slow and one fast chargers. They would create a coordinated process to provide subsidy granted by Delhi government to consumers and install meters based on the EV tariff. “In line with CM Arvind Kejriwal’s mission of making Delhi the EV capital of India, this will be the only city where anyone can get a charger installed net of the government subsidy by making a single phone call or applying online,” added Shah. Mentioning that this was a crucial step by Delhi government in developing an innovative, single-window process for quick and efficient installation of EV chargers, Shah said, “This is in response to requests received by us since the government’s Switch Delhi campaign, especially from apartments, societies, RWAs, mall owners, etc.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tenders-floated-to-empanel-vendors-for-ev-chargers/articleshow/84423496.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Kappa variant cases will be under observation||JAIPUR: A day after the state health department confirmed 11 cases of Kappa variant in Rajasthan, officials on Wednesday said all the cases were at least a month old. The department will, however, keep monitoring the health of the patients as Kappa is a ‘variant of interest’. “Finding cases of new variant has increased chances of rapid spread of infection,” said health minister Raghu Sharma. He warned if people do not follow Covid appropriate behavior, this variant may become dangerous. However, he said Kappa was not that aggressive compared to Delta and Delta+. Delta and Delta + are variants of concern but Kappa is a variant of interest. “Since Kappa is a variant of interest, we will keep those patients who were infected with Covid a month ago under observation. Their samples were taken for genome sequencing at the time when they were infected with Covid,” said a senior health department official. Four samples each tested positive for Kappa variant from Jaipur and Alwar, two from Barmer and one from Bhilwara. However, local health authorities in Jaipur said they had not yet received details of patients who had tested positive for Kappa variant. “We need details of patients for tracing them,” said a senior health department official in Jaipur. Experts claimed that the amount of damage Kappa variant can do was yet to be ascertained.“Cases of Kappa variant have been found but it was yet to be discovered how much aggressive and virulent it is,” said Dr Virendra Singh, member of state’s advisory committee on Covid. The Kappa variant, which is a double mutant strain of Covid, is also known as B.1.167.1 and was first reported in the country in October 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/kappa-variant-cases-will-be-under-observation/articleshow/84423456.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: ‘Chunav Pathshalas’ to track missing voters in rural areas||JAIPUR: The state’s election department has started an initiative to establish ‘Chunav Pathshalas’ in all the 52,009 polling booths. Under this initiative which is part of its SWEEP activities, the department will focus on tracking missing names from the voters’ list in villages, tehsils and towns. “In the villages, gram sevaks and patwaris will be responsible for creating awareness among people about voting, the facilities that are given during elections, voter registration, online registration facilities and facilities available for specially abled persons as part of Chunav Pathshalas. Most importantly, they will focus on tracking missing names (deleted, left out, removed) from the voters’ list – including aged people, persons with disabilities (PwDs) and others,” said state’s chief electoral officer Praveen Gupta. “The booth level officer (BLO) is the coordinator for each chunav pathshala and they are required to register these with the state’s election department. Later, the registered pathshalas are uploaded on the department’s portal. The BLO will form a team in each polling booth. This is a new concept. Earlier, we were concentrating on colleges and schools, now we’ll be focusing on this (pathshalas every polling booth). So far, over 24,000 chunav pathshalas have been registered with the department. During a state steering committee meeting on accessible elections recently, Gupta had suggested that, “The list of PwD electors may be read out verbatim during the meetings of these Chunav Pathshalas so that any missing names may be tracked. The pre-poll activities should integrate orientation about braille and the training of special educators for these.” Organise camps to add names of PwDs: collector District collector Antar Singh Nehra on Wednesday said that the names of the specially-abled persons, who have not been added or have been left out of the voters’ list, should be registered by organizing special camps as per the directions of the election department. The names of the new voters can be registered through the NVSP portal and ‘Helping App’. Additional District Collector (II) Jagjit Singh Monga said the data received from social justice and empowerment department and commission for specially-abled persons is being regularly marked on the voter list at the ERO’s level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/chunav-pathshalas-to-track-missing-voters-in-rural-areas/articleshow/84425598.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Conditions favourable, dry spell may end by weekend||LUCKNOW: Even as the rain deficit in the city has been recorded at 17% below normal due to deficient rainfall for the past three weeks, the Met department on Wednesday said the dry spell may end by this weekend as conditions are getting favourable for widespread rainfall across the state. “As the monsoon trough line has shifted over north UP, we expect rainfall in most parts of the state on Saturday and Sunday. Some areas may get rain on Friday as well. The city is also expected to receive light to moderate rain during this period,” state Met director JP Gupta said. In Lucknow, Wednesday was hot and sultry as it has been for the last three weeks. The maximum temperature was 37.5 degrees Celsius, 3.6 units above normal, and the minimum temperature was 28.2 degrees Celsius, 2.2 notches above normal. Relative humidity was also high (between 54%-85%). The city had received good rainfall in the first half of June. As a result, from June 1 to June 18, total rainfall was 269% above normal. However, limited rain thereafter led to a drastic drop in the score. By July 7, the rain deficit increased to 22% below normal and stood at 17% below normal as on Wednesday. Monsoon arrived in UP on June 13, five days ahead of the schedule, but to insufficient rain thereafter. Rainfall in 55 districts in the state has been below normal since June 1. Experts said the Bay of Bengal stream moved rapidly this year due to the cyclonic storm in the first week of June. However, the advancement of Arabian Sea stream was slow in the absence of favourable conditions. After initial showers, monsoon remained subdued in many parts of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/conditions-favourable-dry-spell-may-end-by-weekend/articleshow/84425602.cms||---

According to the metrological department, it rained 94.2 mm till 5:30 pm in Meerut on Wednesday. Bijnor, however, recorded 70 mm of rainfall in the last 24 hours. The rains also brought down the temperature. In Meerut, on Wednesday, the maximum was recorded at 29.6 degrees Celsius, almost 4 degrees less than Tuesday, while the minimum settled at 25 degrees. Heavy rains, however, exposed the ill-preparedness of the civic authorities with several places witnessing waterlogging and traffic jams. Commuters could be seen struggling with their vehicles while wading through the submerged roads. Chocked drains caused massive waterlogging at several places in the city. Prominent markets such as Lalkurti, Hapur Adda and several others saw vehicles half-submerged into the rainwater. Shopkeepers, too, were a harried lot due to waterlogging. “The civic authorities failed to clean the biggest nullah, Aabu Ka Nala, which is chocked by silt and polythene. If heavy rain continues for two more days, the entire market area will be submerged,” said Vimal Kumar from Lal Kurti. In Hapur Adda, too, sewage water flooded the markets. The situation of the railway station road and several other city areas were no different. Heavy rains brought relief in Muzaffarnagar district, but miseries came along, too. The city witnessed massive traffic snarls that continued for hours on Tuesday and Wednesday as the roads and markets were flooded with water. “Three feet of water in the market is raising a question mark on the preparedness of Muzaffarnagar local body,” said Shaukat Ali, a resident. According to farmers, the rain will be beneficial to the standing sugarcane crop. “If this continues for a few more days, there will be a bumper sugarcane crop in the region,” said Naveen Bagga, a farmer from Muzaffarnagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/monsoon-arrives-in-ups-sugar-belt-brings-relief-from-intense-heat/articleshow/84418662.cms||---

Har Lal Krantikari, who is a resident of Hattupura village in Dudu tehsil, said, “I have come here (Delhi) to support the farmers’ agitation. The government of India should revoke the farm laws for the welfare of the farmers. The farmers are suffering as they are selling their produce at Rs 20 or 30 per kilo.” “Why isn’t the government increasing their income? How will farmers survive with such a low income? We cast votes to form a government and if they don’t look after us, then we will launch a countrywide agitation. The centre should pass a law ensuring legal guarantee on minimum support price (for agricultural produce). They should put a stamp on it and implement it,” he added. “It was Atalji’s (former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee) government which decided that depot should be opened in every village and farmer’s produce should be lifted at a government rate.” Jat has been protesting at Jantar Mantar for the past nine days demanding withdrawal of the three farm laws. “Our Satyagraha at Jantar Mantar has been continuing since July 5. On July 6, we were stopped at Patel Chowk metro station and we were brought to Sansad Marg police station. So, every day as we reach Jantar Mantar, we are brought to the police station. We sit at the station till 6-7 pm before we are released,” said Jat. “We have been demanding for the past eight months that there should be a legal guarantee on MSP and the three farm laws should be withdrawn. Our Satyagraha will continue for an indefinite period,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/87-yr-old-dudu-farmer-joins-raj-leaders-protest-in-delhi/articleshow/84425631.cms||---
---||Delhi||Decks cleared for 360 view of Delhi from Signature Bridge||NEW DELHI: More than two and a half years after it opened to the public, Delhiites may finally enjoy a 360-degree panoramic view of the capital from an observation deck on the top of the pylon of Signature Bridge. With a height of 154 metres, more than twice the height of Qutub Minar, the steel and glass deck was completed much after the bridge itself was opened to traffic. Due to various issues, with its unique inclined elevators meant to take visitors atop the pylon primary among them, the deck couldn’t be opened. “There are a total of four lifts that are absolutely ready, but the permission is needed for allowing tourists to use the lift to reach the observation deck. The first set is the first oblique lifts in the country at 60 degrees,” an official said. As the pylon is shaped like a boomerang and is bent midway, the elevators on the two oblique legs of the pylon are also oblique but with a levelled flooring. The pylon has been divided into four levels “A permission is required from the labour department’s inspector of lifts. Since this is the first of its kind oblique lift in the country, we have been unable to get the permission till now,” he said. Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation (DTTDC), a Delhi government body that executed the project, has again written to the departmentfor the permission as similar lifts are operational in other countries. “We have made the elevators more user friendly and some modifications were also carried out. There were some issues at the point where the visitors would change over from the oblique elevator to the vertical one, but the experience is much more seamless now,” he said. The entry to the deck will be ticketed. The glass of the deck is laminated and toughened and can withstand wind speed of up to 86 miles per hour. Apart from being an important link between northeast Delhi and the rest of the city since November 2018, Signature Bridge has also become a favourite place for Delhiites to click selfies. A dedicated ramp that will ferry tourists from the approach part to the main deck, without disrupting the traffic on the bridge, is almost ready and there will also be a small parking, cafe and a toilet near the approach area. The ramp, coming up along the bridge, veers towards the other side from below the bridge. Near the pylon, DTTDC is creating “selfie points” in a small enclosed area and these facilities are expected to become operational very soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/decks-cleared-for-360-view-of-city-from-signature-bridge/articleshow/84456018.cms||Sidharatha Roy

An official said, “Due to strengthening of the monsoon current and formation of a low pressure area over Saurashtra, IMD has predicted increased rainfall activity over the west coast and neighbourhood of peninsular India. In Mumbai, a watch has to be kept for a possible urban flooding situation. Due to the forecast of heavy to very heavy rainfall in Konkan and South Gujarat, rivers between Tapi and Tadri in some districts in Gujarat, Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli as well as in Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts are likely to rise.” The official said that a close watch has to be maintained for a rise in these rivers in small catchments in the Western Ghats. He said that River Bav in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra was already flowing in above normal flood situation on Wednesday, but with a falling trend. Palghar, Thane and Mumbai have a heavy rain at isolated places forecast for Thursday, while heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places is expected in Raigad and Sindhudurg.

---||Hyderabad||Maoist leader Ramanna’s son Ravula Ranjith surrenders before Telangana police||HYDERABAD: A Maoist allegedly involved in the Jeeram attack in Chhattisgarh which killed 26 security personnel died in April 2021, surrendered before Telangana police brass here on Wednesday. Addressing a press conference, director-general of police (DGP) M Mahendar Reddy said Ravula Ranjith, 23, was involved in several incidents, including the Jeeram attack in which 26 security personnel died in April. Ranjith will be given Rs 4 lakh for surrendering and a token amount of Rs 5,000 was given to him on Wednesday by police. Ranjith, who is a second generation Maoist as his parents too were involved in the left-wing movement, decided to quit the Maoist party as he was reportedly humiliated after the death of his father Ramanna alias Ravula Srinivas, a former central committee member and secretary of Dandakaranya special zonal committee. Though Ranjith’s family is from Warangal district, he spent most of his life in Chhattisgarh. “He participated in four brutal attacks on security forces and one ambush in addition to several other incidents during his underground life,” DGP Mahendar said. Police claimed though Ranjith did not tell them the exact number of Maoists suffering with Covid-19, he confirmed that several cadre were afflicted with the virus. The DGP said Haribushan’s death was confirmed by Ranjith too. When asked about the contradictory statements of Telangana police and CPI Maoists on the death of Sharada, wife of Haribushan, Mahendar Reddy clarified that she was still alive. Of the 25 central committee members, 11 were from Telangana and three from Andhra Pradesh. As of now, there are 120 Telangana Maoist state committee members, but they had no information on the appointment of a new state secretary in place of Haribushan. “As of now, Damodar is incharge secretary,’’ the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/maoist-leader-ramannas-son-ranjith-surrenders-before-telangana-police/articleshow/84423488.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Now, private schools under RTI ambit||LUCKNOW: Students and their parents running from pillar to post for getting information from unaided privately managed schools have a reason to cheer as the State Information Commission (SIC) has ruled that all private schools are now under the ambit of Right to Information Act (RTI). Consequently, state information commissioner Pramod Kumar Tiwari in his order sought appointment of public information officers in private schools. That unaided private schools should be under the purview of RTI Act had been a matter of debate for quite some time. Following an appeal filed by one Sanjay Sharma in respect to two reputed private schools of Lucknow, the SIC asked the chief secretary to instruct private school administrators to appoint officers to facilitate people to get information under the RTI Act, 2005. Private schools did not provide information under RTI on the grounds that they were not funded by the state and were outside the purview of the Act. However, the Supreme Court had ruled that if the development authority of a city provides land to a private school at concessional rates, the school will be considered adequately funded by the state. The SIC also propounded that the district education officer is bound to give all the information mentioned in the form to the petitioner on demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/now-pvt-schools-under-rti-ambit/articleshow/84425665.cms||---

Speaking at a FICCI event, labour secretary Neeraj K Pawan said Rajasthan Skills and Livelihoods Development Corporation (RSLDC) was in the process of appointing training partners for this project. If each one panchayat samiti trains 200-300 youths, the target of providing training to 1 lakh youths can be easily achieved, he said. RSLDC has already trained around 4 lakh students and interns and out of this, more than 2 lakh have been placed in the industry, said Pawan. Pawan also said they will undertake a demand mapping exercise to identify which area needs what kinds of skills depending on the profile of the samiti so that right kind of skills are imparted to the youths. He said they have already started skilling people on delivery of healthcare services which is in high demand because of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/panchayat-samitis-in-state-to-get-skill-development-centres/articleshow/84425648.cms||---
---||Pune||PMRDA to draft development plan for 23 villages merged with Pune Municipal Corporation||PUNE: The Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) would draft the development plan for 23 villages recently merged with the PMC, a notification issued by the state government on Wednesday stated. The government said the PMRDA would work as a special planning authority for the development plan (DP). The BJP, which is running the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), has, however, criticised the state government’s decision. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said the government’s decision “appeared to be politically motivated”. The PMC would explore legal options for retaining its rights of drafting the development plan for the 23 villages, he said. “Once the villages have been merged into PMC limits, the powers to take decisions about the developments there are vested with the civic body. The powers include the one to draft the development plan,” Mohol said. “The government’s move to divert the PMC’s powers to the PMRDA is illegal,” the mayor said, adding that the civic body has convened a special general body meeting on Thursday to discuss the development plan. The state government’s notification stated that the order had been issued under sections 40 (1) and 40(1)(D) of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act. The order stated that the roads in these villages were developed as per land availability and with no planned alignments. The order added that the width of the roads was not as per the requirement and the public amenities had not been developed. “The area of the 23 villages is of ‘undeveloped’ nature and development is of ‘unplanned’ and ‘uncontrolled’ manner,” stated the order issued by joint secretary, state government, Noreshwar Shende. Leader of the house in PMC Ganesh Bidkar the state government’s stand on the issue was incorrect, as the 23 villages were developed. “If the PMRDA has already worked on the development plan of these villages, those details should be shared with the PMC. The PMC will use the details for drafting the DP. The document can be jointly prepared by the PMC and PMRDA. But formation of a seperate planning authority, excluding PMC, for the DP is wrong,” he said. The opposition parties in the PMC have welcomed the government notification. “The PMRDA has prepared the development plan for these villages. A lot of time and money has been utilised for finalizing this document. Instead of the PMC starting the process all over again, the document prepared by the PMRDA should be carried forward,” said Ulhas (Aba) Bagul, leader of the Congress in the civic body. The urban planners are in favour of continuing the work on the development plan initiated by the PMRDA. “There is no point in repeating the work already carried out by PMRDA. The PMC and PMRDA can join hands and complete the development plan for the merged villages. It will save time, money and resources,” senior urban planner Ramchandra Gohad said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmrda-to-draft-dp-for-23-villages-merged-with-pmc/articleshow/84423511.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

The accommodation barge had sunk in the Arabian Sea during cyclone Tautkae on May 17. While 186 crewmembers were rescued, 71 died and eight are still missing. “Initially many bodies were claimed by their family members. However, some bodies which were not identifiable were kept at the JJ Hospital’s mortuary and we collected the blood samples of 24 relatives. Some bodies’ DNA did not match the samples of families. So blood samples of parents and children were collected. So far 68 bodies have been handed over to the families. However, the DNA samples of three bodies have still not matched,” said an officer. Besides this, eight bodies were brought in by the Raigad police. These bodies are also kept at the JJ Hospital. “Police teams will go to Bhopal, Kolkata, Valsad and Uttarakhand to collect the blood samples of some relatives to match them with the bodies kept at the JJ hospital,” said the officer. The police had arrested three persons in the case. The accused are now in judicial custody. A director of another private firm connected to Paapa Shipping and a director of Paapa Shipping have now applied for anticipatory bail. Paapa Shipping’s 23 crewmembers were on P305 when the mishap took place. While five died, 18 were rescued by navy warships. Paapa Shipping was started at the Saikrupa Chawl Welfare Society in Ketkipada, Dahisar, in 2018 and later shifted its office to Vile Parle. “The Paapa Shipping is connected to another firm, Ocean Diving Center. We are also probing a director of Ocean Diving, who is an ex-lieutenant commander in the navy,” the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cops-to-get-blood-samples-of-kin-of-missing-p305-crew-from-four-states/articleshow/84425684.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh Board school students to take quarterly tests too; marks to be uploaded on portal||LUCKNOW: Owing to disruption and continued uncertainty in regular school, students of classes 9 to 12 in government schools will take more tests in the coming session. The UP government has decided to hold quarterly tests, apart from monthly and half-yearly examinations in schools recognised by the UP Secondary Education Board. The quarterly test, as per the 2021-22 academic calendar, is scheduled for the second half of September. In another move, for the first time, the secondary education department has asked all schools to feed marks obtained by students in each test, right from monthly to quarterly, internal assessments, pre-boards, and annual, on the board’s online portal. The data feeding exercise will begin from class 9 itself. Till now, no marks of class 9 and pre-board examinations of class 10 and 12 were kept with the schools. The new arrangement, said officials, will help in the timely declaration of results. “In an unprecedented situation such as Covid-19 which forced cancellation of board exams, we have to rely on secondary data to devise a marking formula. The data collection exercise is time-taking. Now, the board will have marks of students in all examinations they had appeared in,” said an official. Schools have been instructed to upload the marks for the quarterly test by October second week. For classes 9 and 10, internal tests of 10 marks each will be held in August, October, and January. All schools have to upload the assessment marks by month-end. Half-yearly examinations are to be held in mid-December, and marks are to be uploaded in January. Pre-boards will be held in the first half of February and annual examinations for classes 9 and 11 in the second half of February. All these will be part of the assessment model in the absence of board examinations. However, marks for monthly tests will not be added to the final result. Bringing in changes in examination pattern for class 9, the board has divided the question paper into two parts: multiple-choice questions and descriptive. “Till now, there were no sections. There were short and long answer types carrying different marks,” said SL Mishra, principal, Aminabad Inter College, Lucknow. Like the previous year, the board has reduced the syllabus by 30%. The department has also fixed dates for completing the syllabus. For classes 10 and 12, the teaching has to end by January 15 while for classes 9 and 11, the syllabus should be completed by January 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-board-school-students-to-take-quarterly-tests-too-marks-to-be-uploaded-on-portal/articleshow/84434409.cms||Isha Jain

According to the petitioners, the CM had announced in a tweet on July 12, 2020, that the age of candidates for recruitment of sub inspectors (SIs) in Punjab Police would be increased from 28 years to 32. However, the age limit has not been increased in advertisement issued on July 6, 2021, for the recruitment of 560 SIs and the upper age limit has been kept 28, they stated. Taking cognisance of the petition, Justice Girish Agnihotri has issued notice to the Punjab home secretary and the DGP, seeking their response on the contentions raised by the petitioners. The petition has been filed by Navdeep Brar, a resident of Bharu village in Gidderbaha tehsil of Muktsar district, and 55 other youths from Punjab. They have sought directions to the state to give them age relaxation since they were deprived of their right to apply against the said posts since no recruitment of SIs was made in the last five years. The matter has now been fixed for August 16 for further hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-notice-to-punjab-over-upper-age-limit-for-police-job/articleshow/84423589.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Covid bed reservation down from 80% to 50% at private hubs||PUNE: Despite the decline in cases, the district administration is treading cautiously before releasing the Covid-reserved beds for non-Covid care at private hospitals in Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR). The administration has reduced reservation of 80% beds at private hospitals to 50% that, too, on condition that the hospitals will scale up the bed-reservation within 72 hours, if there is a surge in Covid cases. Private hospitals, however, have criticized the move, describing it “uncalled for” as they cannot deny admission to non-Covid patients. “Currently, we have only 30 Covid patients in the 831-bed hospital. Over 90% of patients are currently approaching hospitals for elective surgeries and treatment of various other non-Covid ailments. The bed reservation should be need-based. We cannot deny admission to non-Covid patients,” said Bharati hospital's deputy medical director Jitendra Oswal. Agreeing, Vinod Sawantwadkar, chief executive officer (CEO), Jehangir hospital said, “It is appropriate on the part of the administration to de-escalate bed reservation cautiously. But we cannot deny admission to non-Covid patients. Currently over 90% of our medical work is about treating and attending non-Covid patients.” “The small hospitals find the current 50% bed reservation for Covid uncalled for as we have to treat every single patient irrespective of whether s/heis Covid or non-Covid," said Sanjay Patil, chairman, Indian Medical Association's Hospital Board of India. Sanjay Deshmukh, deputy director, health services (Pune region), said, “The 50% bed reservation for Covid even when the cases have considerably gone down is a precautionary step. It is a way of ensuring preparedness in case of third wave.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-bed-reservation-down-from-80-to-50-at-private-hubs/articleshow/84423558.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Meerut||Haridwar closed for kanwar yatra, UP looks at new routes, destinations||Meerut: The tiny town of Garh Mukteswar in Hapur district, about 119-km from Delhi, is likely to host lakhs of kanwar pilgrims if the UP government comes good on its promise to allow the yatra. With Haridwar out of bounds after the Uttarakhand administration called off the pilgrimage for this year citing threat from the pandemic, Garh Mukteswar is slowly emerging as an alternative destination for the Shiva devotees. The UP government, which had earlier requested Uttarakhand to let the pilgrims pass en route for Haridwar, from where they collect water from the Ganga, has sked all those participating in the yatra to carry a Covid-19 negative certificate. The yatra is likely to begin from July 25 unless there is a change of plans. Apart from UP, kanwariyas from Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and even Himachal take part in the yatra. The administration, after mulling several alternatives, has zeroed in on the ancient Garh Mukteswar town which hosts pilgrims throughout the year but not on a large scale. The Ganga river and NH-24 criss-cross the town. Divisional commissioner of Meerut, Surender Singh, told TOI, “We are ready for the yatra and have already started preparations for the security and overall management. Now that Uttarakhand has cancelled it, we have to find another destination from where kanwar pilgrims can fetch Ganga water. For instance, devotees in eastern UP bring the holy water from Prayagraj and Varanasi. In the western region, one such site could be Garh Mukteshwar in Hapur. But our options are open and we are working in this direction.” District magistrate of Hapur, Anuj Singh, said that the administration will be able to hold the kanwar yatra in the town as the numbers will be less this time due to the Covid-19 situation. “The possibility of using Garh Mukteshwar ghats for the kanwar pilgrimage is being explored as religious fairs take place throughout the year here. One to two lakh pilgrims routinely visit the town during various melas. It is right that kanwar yatra is a big event, but due to the pandemic we don’t expect large gatherings," the DM said. Asked about the steps which will be taken to ensure that pilgrims follow pandemic protocols, especially in the face of a looming third wave, commissioner Singh said, “The health department will have a major role to play in this. Directions have been given to strictly observe Covid-19 protocols. They will put up help desks on the kanwar route and at temples. These desks will be equipped with sanitizers, masks, thermal screening facility and Covid-19 testing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/haridwar-closed-for-kanwar-yatra-up-looks-at-new-routes-destinations/articleshow/84418754.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Pune||Maharashtra task force now recommends ‘vaccination bubble’ for restaurants||PUNE: The state task force has recommended that restaurants — in districts showing test positivity rates of less than 5% for 2 weeks — can be allowed to run till 10pm, as long as staff and, preferably customers too, are fully vaccinated. Currently, restaurants can run dine-in services only for limited hours. In Pune district, for example, which is in level 3, restaurants can have customers over till 4pm on weekdays. During the weekends, only home deliveries are permitted. But the task force and the state’s technical advisor on Covid, Dr Subhash Salunke, have recommended that the hospitality industry, which has been under stress due to curbs, should be allowed to open with the right precautions in place, including having fully vaccinated staff and customers. “However, the most important protocol is that even those who are fully vaccinated should follow all the Covid-appropriate behaviours, including masking,” Dr Salunke said. He said, “If a restaurant does not have proper air circulation, it should not be allowed to function. We recommended open-air dining or keeping doors and windows open even if the air-conditioning was on,” he said. He added that the system should work if restaurants also allowed only those customers with proof of full vaccination (two doses). “This system could be one of the ways to ensure transmission is reduced and the economy does not suffer. Till the state’s vaccine coverage reaches 70-80%, these measures could be adopted to start opening slowly,” he said. Dr Salunke said fully vaccinated persons, even if they contract Covid, are likely to have less viral loads, leading to reduced virus transmission. A member of the state task force said, “The group suggested several things besides full vaccination, such as allowing open-air dining and no air-conditioning with open windows in enclosed settings. Preferably, customers too should carry final vaccination certificates.” Another member of the task force said, “Suggestions on a host of similar relaxations for workplaces, gyms etc (except recreational activities) have been made for districts with test positivity (via RT-PCR) of less than 5% for over 2 weeks. At least, 70% of people in such spaces should be vaccinated. Those who are fully vaccinated may be allowed to work from these spaces. Others can work from home.” Work shelters, for people to rotate in biosecure bubbles, was also suggested by the task force, apart from emphasis on home testing with rapid antigen kits. “In a nutshell, suggestions included heavy fines for violations, swift vaccination coverage and encouraging activities (except recreational) at open spaces in regions that have fully vaccinated at least 70% of its target population,” the task force member said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/task-force-now-recommends-vax-bubble-for-restaurants/articleshow/84423535.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Hyderabad||Telangana high court refuses stay on Kokapet, Khanamet land auction||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Wednesday refused to stay Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority’s (HMDA) land auction at Kokapet and Khanamet in Greater Hyderabad area. The state government is hoping to raise around Rs 3,000 crore from the auction, to be held on Thursday. The judges will, however, examine the legal validity of the policy of the state to earmark 1,000 acres of land in each district as land bank for auctioning. The bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy said this while hearing a petition filed by former MP Vijayasanthi which questioned the state policy. Stating that this is not a new policy, Telangana advocate general B S Prasad said that these GOs were challenged in the past and a division bench of the high court had upheld them. “The state is empowered under Article 298 of the Constitution to sell its assets and thus can monetise the assets for public purpose,” he said. Appearing for HMDA, senior counsel S Niranjan Reddy said that though certain amendments were made to the rules to prevent sale of urban land parcels, these do not take away the power of the state to auction vacant land. This was especially true if the lands were slipping into the hands of encroachers and if it was difficult to protect them. Vijayasanthi’s counsel T Rajasekhar said that the state expressing inability to protect its own land was unacceptable. “How can the state inspire confidence if it cannot protect its own land?” he asked. “The state on one hand is saying that it will only sell those parcels that are difficult to protect and on the other, asking its officials to create a land bank of thousand acres in each district for the purpose of getting revenue.” The bench issued notices to the state, HMDA and GHMC and said it will not allow such sale notifications. However, the GOs pertaining to the auction of land were not stayed. “This is limited extent and we do not intend to stay it,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-refuses-stay-on-kokapet-khanamet-land-auction/articleshow/84423620.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

---||Pune||Enhanced property tax, few civic amenities worry residents of newly merged villages||Pune: A significant hike in the property tax with no better civic amenities remains a prime cause for concern among residents of 23 villages that have been merged in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits. Already, residents have been citing the bad state of civic amenities at 11 villages, which were merged in the PMC limits in 2017. Though the inclusion of villages in PMC limits has come as good news for residents, they pointed out that owners of properties registered with the gram panchayat were paying three- to four-times less tax as compared to those in municipal areas. After the merger, even property owners in villages will have to pay higher tax. The tax amount will increase at least by three to five times, they shared. Along with residential properties, even commercial establishments will have to pay additional tax. Residents of the merged villages are apprehensive about the payment of increased property tax since they will not get better civic amenities immediately. Residents of newly merged areas such as Pisoli and Wadachiwadi are apprehensive about facing the same experience as that of residents in Undri, which was the last area to be merged with PMC. Swapnil Jadhav, a businessman from Wadachiwadi, said, “Undri has become a part of the PMC but there hasn’t been much change in the residents’ lives. The area still does not get water supply from PMC, but they must pay the water tax. Besides, there’s a huge disparity in terms of property tax, different housing societies in the area are in different tax slabs.” A resident, who has been living in Undri for generations, said that the area has become a sort of ‘no man’s land’ following the merger. “When Undri was with the gram panchayat, the main road had lights up to Mantarwadi but now the lights are missing, and no one seems bothered. Even so, the residents are heavily taxed.” A PMC official said property taxes differed based on the completion date of the buildings. “For example, if the completion year of a building is 2017, when the area was under the gram panchayat, the property tax was lower. However, if a building with a completion year of 2018 or 2019, the property tax is higher. The civic body imposes taxes strictly based on the ready reckoner rate.” “PMC’s general body will take a call on imposing the property tax in these villages. The amount will be decided by the civic body. The increase in property tax depends on the size and type of the property and date of construction. The hike will be higher for commercial properties,” said Vilas Kanade, head of PMC’s property tax department. “Why should the citizens pay additional tax, if they are not getting any additional facilities? Even basic amenities, like water are a luxury for many areas in the 11 villages,” said Ganesh Dhore, an elected member representing the 11 villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/enhanced-property-tax-few-civic-amenities-worry-residents-of-newly-merged-villages/articleshow/84423611.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt gives ACB nod for open probe against ex-CP||MUMBAI: The state government has given the state Anti-Corruption Bureau the go-ahead to initiate an open inquiry against former city police commissioner Param Bir Singh on charges of corruption levelled by police inspector Anup Dange. Dange, who was suspended by Singh, had filed a complaint to the home department seeking an inquiry into Singh’s alleged links to criminal elements and had alleged that a person claiming to be Singh’s relative demanded Rs 2 crore to reinstate him. The ACB, which was conducting two discreet inquiries against Singh on complaints by inspector Dange and another by inspector Bhimrao Gadge, had completed one inquiry on Dange’s allegations and had sought permission from the home department to proceed with an open inquiry. “As Param Bir Singh is a class one rank officer of the ACB, officials had to seek permission from government, which has been granted,” said an official. A discreet enquiry is a preliminary probe, in which ACB attempts to corroborate the complaint received against the public servant. Reports of these enquiries are then forwarded to the concerned department where the public servant works, seeking a sanction to further proceed from inquiries into investigations. Sources in the ACB said that during the preliminary inquiries of corruption charges levelled by Dange, prima facie it transpired there was some substance in the allegations. Now the ACB wants to conduct an open inquiry wherein even Singh will be provided an opportunity to defend himself. And if the open inquiries disclose the corruption charges, the ACB will register a disproportionate assets case. Dange was attached to DB Marg police station and on November 2019, he went to check pubs operating in Akruti building at Breach Candy, when a pub owner tried to pressurise him to operate beyond the stipulated deadline, claiming he had close connections with Singh, who was then DG, ACB. Later, a scuffle broke out outside the pub and the grandson of film producer Bharat Shah was arrested for allegedly assaulting a cop. The pub-bar owner was also booked in the case. Dange has alleged Singh suspended him and ordered a departmental inquiry against him in 2020 to shield a pub owner in a criminal case. Dange was suspended on July 18, 2020. He alleged a person claiming to be a cousin of Singh got in touch with him. He later agreed to bring down the amount to Rs 1 crore on behalf of Singh. Another police inspector, Bhimrao Ghadge of Kalyan police, in March lodged an FIR against Singh and 32 other officers alleging that while he was probing a cheating case pertaining to KDMC officials, Singh misused his official position and submitted a closure report despite there being strong documentary evidence. Ghadge also alleged Singh, as Thane city police chief, has amassed assets by settling several financial and land disputes and extracted money from various builders and transport lobbies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-gives-acb-nod-for-open-probe-against-ex-cp/articleshow/84425744.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Pune||Pune Municipal Corporation: Youths from underprivileged areas given vaccine jabs||PUNE: As many as 2,558 youngsters associated with skill and vocational training centers, popularly known as Light House, received the vaccine as part of a three-day endeavor undertaken by health officials of the Pune Municipal Corporation. The centres are jointly run by the civic body along with NGO Pune City Connect. In addition to vaccinating the youngsters, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials are also gearing up to reach out and vaccinate over 4.5 lakh residents of 390 slum pockets spread across the city. The special drive is likely to begin this week. “Of the 13,000 youths attached with Light House, 2,558 were vaccinated over the last three days. In addition to covering the remaining youngsters, we also aim to conduct vaccination of other residents living in slum pockets within the city limits this week,” said PMC’s immunization officer Suryakant Deokar. Atul Mane, coordinator at Pune City Connect, said, “The youths were vaccinated at our centres located within or outside the slum pockets. Their family members were also vaccinated during the special drive conducted at Hadapsar and Bhawani Peth on July 5, 10 and 13.” The Pune Municipal Corporation staff has also started vaccinating ‘super-spreaders’ by setting up centers at public places, after receiving permission from the state government. Super-spreaders is a term used to describe persons, who seem to be able to infect large numbers of people with minimal contact, much more than the average person. “We are conducting special drives for people coming into contact with a large number of citizens by setting up centers at public places, following permission from the state government. In total, 10,000 individuals, including traders, shopkeepers, vegetable vendors, fuel pump attendants, courier and food-delivery agents, among others. We aim to vaccinate another 30,000 such individuals in the next two months,” Deokar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/youths-from-underprivileged-areas-given-vaccine-jabs/articleshow/84423583.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Doctors’ strike hits services for third day||CHANDIGARH: Medical services in Punjab remained disrupted for the third consecutive day on Wednesday as state government doctors continued their strike over a disagreement regarding a component of their salary. On a call by the joint government doctors coordination committee (JGDCC), doctors and veterinarians across the state boycotted all services, except for emergency, Covid and medico/vetro-legal cases. Rallies and marches were staged to pressure the government to restore non-practicing allowance (NPA). Agitating doctors received support from the Teachers Association of Guru Angad Dev Veterinary University (GADVASU), Ludhiana; Veterinary College Rampura Phool, KVK; and RRTC, Kaljharani, who boycotted examinations, teaching and agricultural services in support of doctors demands. Dr Manohar Singh, general secretary of coordination committee, said the struggle of doctors had become a common movement of all fields of doctors of the state. Committee convener Dr Inderveer Singh Gill demanded immediate withdrawal of the letter issued by the government, seeking option from employees to give salary as per the report of the Sixth Pay Commission. He said their protest was needed to save the public healthcare system. “We will oppose any move by the government directed to destroy it,” he said. Dr Sarabdeep Singh, media incharge of the coordination committee, said all doctors of the state would boycott government OPDs and the committee would start OPDs on its own on the hospital premises from Thursday. He said the government had been making doctors work day and night in challenging and difficult conditions, but was still taking away their perks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/docs-strike-hits-services-for-3rd-day/articleshow/84423661.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune Municipal Corporation seeks exemption of negative report for travellers||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had last week sought exemption for fully vaccinated domestic travellers arriving at the Pune airport from presenting RT-PCR negative report, a senior official of the civic body said. With the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) chief Iqbal Singh Chahal wrote a letter to the chief secretary regarding the same on Tuesday, PMC’s additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal, who was transferred in the late evening on Tuesday as the commissioner of Integrated Child Development Services, Navi Mumbai, told TOI that a request from the corporation had already been given to the deputy CM Ajit Pawar and then the chief secretary, last week. “I have already placed a request pertaining to the same to the deputy CM in the review meeting last week, following which I sent the same to the chief secretary. For now, there are no exemptions and passengers arriving at the Pune airport from anywhere in the country should have an RT-PCR negative report, not older than 48 hours, even if they are fully vaccinated,” Agarwal said. Sources in the Pune airport said that until now, they had not received anything official on the proposed relaxations. “We have heard about it but are yet to receive anything official from the state government. Until that happens, the current restrictions will continue,” an airport official said. At present, around 3,000 to 5,000 travellers arrive at the Pune airport via different flights daily. From Friday, five new flights will start to and from Pune, which will increase the daily passenger traffic. The airport officials said with the civil aviation ministry increasing the capacity of domestic flights from 50% to 65%, more flights were expected to begin soon. Pranav Pawar, a frequent flyer from Pune to Delhi and back, said RT-PCR reports were a hassle for regular flyers such as him. “As a regular traveller, especially to Delhi, I am facing a lot of hurdles to cope with the demand of RT-PCR negative report within 48 hours. If I’m travelling only for a day or two, then it’s almost a waste of time to manage separate RT-PCR reports. I have taken both doses, so I expect an exemption from the RT-PCR reports to fly hassle-free,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-seeks-exemption-of-negative-report-for-travellers/articleshow/84423632.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Delhi||This might bite: No study to identify dengue strain in Delhi yet||NEW DELHI: The rains have arrived in Delhi and the threat of mosquito-borne diseases looms large but the annual study for determining the prevalent dengue strain has not yet been carried out. This despite the fact that the number of dengue cases in 2021 has remained higher than in the past three years. Thirty-eight dengue cases have been registered compared with 22 cases in the corresponding period last year. Municipal health officials have written to AIIMS and National Centre for Disease Control to expedite the sero-typing of the dengue strain this year. According to the officials, out of the four dengue strains, two cause more damage. “There are four dengue strains—type-I, type-II, type-III and type-IV. AIIMS’ virology laboratory of the microbiology department isolates dengue viruses to find the circulating strains. Dengue type-2 and type-4 are more virulent strains while type-1 and type-3 are milder strains. Identification of strain helps in formulating public health response,” said an official. Type-I causes classic dengue fever, type-II leads to haemorrhagic fever with shock, type-III causes fever without shock and type-IV causes fever without shock or profound shock. Since the 1960s, type-1 and type-3 strains have been common strains in Delhi, while during the 1992 outbreak, type-2 strain was identified to be the most common strain. In the 2015 outbreak, both type-2 and type-4 were in common circulation in Delhi. Even before the arrival of monsoon, when the number of mosquito-borne diseases soars, Delhi witnessed a high number of dengue cases this year. As against 38 dengue cases reported till July 10 in 2021, 22 and 27 dengue cases were registered in the corresponding period in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Apart from these 38 registered dengue cases, another 36 cases have been registered as “infections acquired from other states” and in four cases, the address of the patient could not be traced. If all these cases are considered, 78 dengue cases have been registered in Delhi this year. Another official said they were still waiting for the report from AIIMS or NCDC. The delay might be because of the health staff being busy in tackling Covid-19, he guessed. An analysis of mosquito breeding data from three civic bodies of the capital shows that peri-domestic containers, such as money plant, vase, flower pots, bird pots, tin, tyre, fountain water, etc, account for the largest chunk of mosquito breeding sites cases (38%). Domestic water storage containers, desert air coolers and overhead tanks are other places where maximum mosquito breeding takes place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/this-might-bite-no-study-to-identify-dengue-strain-yet/articleshow/84423679.cms||Paras Singh

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Officials zero in on 56,900 vacant posts in government departments||HYDERABAD: After an elaborate exercise on vacancies in various government departments, senior officials have reportedly identified 56,975 posts which are lying vacant in 28 departments. Of these posts, 44,022 vacancies are in government departments, 12,957 posts are in government grant-in-aid institutions and various corporations. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had earlier directed the secretaries of various departments to submit a list of vacancies in their respective departments. The government is planning to fill up 50,000 posts in the first phase soon. The secretaries of all the departments submitted details of the employees in their departments and vacant posts to the state cabinet, which met here on Wednesday. The officials also provided total sanctioned posts, vacancies in different sections and contract and outsourcing employees working in those departments. The CM asked the officials to come up with some more details on vacancies within five days. While the CMO has not provided number of vacancy posts, sources said the home department has the highest number of posts vacant at 21,500, followed by 10,000 posts in health and medical department, 3,800 posts in BC welfare and another 3,500 vacancies in higher education department. The cabinet instructed the officials to categorise employees based on the new zonal system and new districts and identify vacant posts district and zone-wise and also to take measures to fill the vacant posts created due to promotions. “Strength of present employees and information on vacant posts should be sent from all the departments to the government within five days,” KCR said. The CM said there is a need to create new and modern jobs and at the same time, some posts such as telephone operators are irrelevant. “The administrative setup should update itself regularly and offer better service to the people and measures should be taken in this direction,” the CM said. The cabinet said that the division of employees between Telangana and AP had been completed and the remaining 200 to 300 Telangana employees in AP would be brought back. The cabinet also instructed that all the properties of the government organisations and institutions should be recorded and compiled department-wise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/officials-zero-in-on-56900-vacant-posts-in-govt-depts/articleshow/84423664.cms||Koride Mahesh

Officials said that in April this year Bhoir, who was dismissed from service by the then police commissioner Sanjay Barve in 2019, had filed an appeal before the minister of state for home for his reinstatement. In May the MoS for home accepted his plea and reinstated him in the force. He was posted at the control room in the east region. “We have taken serious note of the corruption case against Bhoir and are in the process of dismissing him again from service,” a home department official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-tainted-cop-likely-to-be-sacked-after-toi-expos/articleshow/84425884.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Lucknow||BJP executive meet to signal political spadework for 2022||Lucknow: With UP BJP all set to convene its much-awaited state executive meet on Friday, all eyes will be on the party’s resolutions that could mark the beginning of the political spadework to take on a belligerent opposition in the run-up to the high-pitched assembly elections next year. While the final blueprint of the resolution will be hammered out after a high-level meeting of the state BJP brass on Thursday, party sources indicated development with focus on ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’, Covid management in anticipation of a third wave, farmers’ issues and concerns related to youth may prominently figure in the state executive, which is scheduled to be virtually addressed by BJP national president JP Nadda. Covid management has been a key agenda of BJP, which has been rolling out its machinery to shoulder government efforts to mitigate the crisis under its flagship slogan — ‘Sewa Hi Sangathan’. It has been a worrying factor too with the opposition, mainly the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party, unleashing a frontal attack on the state government, accusing it of mishandling the second Covid wave. The farmers’ issue too, holds much political relevance in the wake of protests by the agrarian community against the Centre’s new farm laws. The BJP, sources said, would attempt to neutralise the unrest in the agriculturally rich west UP region, which comprises 125 assembly seats. The saffron party, sources said, would escalate its farmers’ outreach to counter an aggressive Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait, who has been aligning with the opposition to dent BJP’s prospects of returning to office after 2022 assembly elections. Hailing from Muzzaffarnagar in west UP region, Tikait has been rolling up his sleeves to spearhead the farmers’ stir against new farm laws while positioning himself squarely against BJP-ruled states. Last month, Tikait had signalled a strong message to the BJP brass by meeting West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee to congratulate her on her party’s win against BJP in the recently held state elections. Party sources said, the meet is likely to take up pro-farmer measures initiated by the Narendra Modi government at the Centre and Yogi Adityanath-led UP government. Focus is likely to be on the recent increase in minimum support price (MSP) for wheat and significant clearance of cane dues in last four years of BJP rule. The executive meet is also expected to brainstorm on employment opportunities for youth who have been hit by the pandemic. The BJP government in UP, as a matter of fact, has been drumming up its initiatives to generate employment, including in the government sector. The BJP executive meeting comes days after BJP swept zila panchayat and block level chairperson elections to cement its footprint in rural swathes which hold the key to 2022 polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-executive-meet-to-signal-political-spadework-for-2022/articleshow/84425778.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Pune||Under Apartment Act, maintenance charges as per flat area: Maharashtra department order||PUNE: Maintenance charges are applicable according to the area of a flat under the Maharashtra Apartment Ownership Act but not to one registered under the Cooperative Societies Act. The state department of cooperation’s recent order related to a society in south Pune had caused confusion among cooperative housing societies with members seeking a clarification from the department. Buildings are governed by the Apartments Act 1970 or the Cooperative Societies Act 1960. Digvijay Rathod, deputy registrar of cooperative societies, Pune city zone, had passed the order for Treasure Park apartment at Aranyeshwar. The order is expected to benefit over 10,000 buildings under the Apartment Act in the city and close to 50,000 in the state. But it is not applicable to the 1.2 lakh cooperative housing societies in the state, Suhas Patwardhan, chairman of the Pune District Cooperative Housing Societies and Apartment Federation, told TOI. The residents of Treasure Park had approached the district deputy registrar after the state government allowed housing societies to seek redressal instead of going to court. The society has 356 flats, of which 180 are 2BHKS, 24 are 4 BHKs and the remaining 3 BHKs. The order passed in their favour says maintenance has to be taken as per the area of each flat. “From 2015, all owners were charged the same maintenance. We approached the department many times and finally registered a complaint on December 7, 2020. The hearing was completed on June 22 this year and the order was issued on July 8. The central committee of Treasure Park has to implement the order with immediate effect,” said committee member Nilam Bhaskar Patil. Under the Apartment Act, one has to pay maintenance as per the percentage of ownership in proportion to the common areas and pay as per square feet. In cooperative housing societies, the land and building are owned by the society, not by individuals, and most of the maintenance charges are divided equally, irrespective of the area. These charges include sinking fund, repairs and maintenance fund as per cost. It is as per the model bye-laws of cooperative housing societies, Patwardhan said. However, some citizens covered under the Apartment Act have sought a revision. Consumer rights activist Ravindra Sinha said clause 10 of the Act covers equal expenses and profits as per area of the flat, but clause 3, under the definition of expenses, mentions expenses as agreed upon by the association. “The association can independently frame byelaws and decide which expenses are service charges to be shared equally and which other expenses like sinking fund, repairs and maintenance fund and water charges can be charged on the area of the flat. Cooperative housing societies use this calculation which can be emulated by apartments owners too,” Sinha said. The recent order will create more discontent for apartment owners. There is already a growing demand to amend clause 10 of the Apartment Act and make it similar to the cooperative housing society rules, he said. Hari Sundaresh, an apartment owner from Pashan, said they have 351 units and have decided to continue charging equal amount per unit especially for maintenance of the common area facilities and amenities. They will create a repairs and maintenance fund which is calculated in proportion to the area of the flat. “Our members are comfortable with the equal distribution of charges,” a former chairman of the society said. Yuvraj Pawar, chairman of Dear Society Welfare Association, said there were constant issues among the owners. Their society would file a PIL to make amendments in the Apartment Act related to provisions on election, audit, maintenance rules, appointment of administrator and nomination. Under the Apartment Act, residents paying more maintenance will seek more benefits, said Rajendra Chuttar, resident of Padmavilas Apartments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/order-confirms-maintenance-under-apartment-act-as-per-area-of-flat/articleshow/84423694.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Slow private sector coverage a worry: Health ministry||PUNE: The slow pace of Covid vaccination at private centres in 15 states, including Maharashtra, is now a cause of “serious worry”, the health ministry has said. The concern was relayed during a review on Wednesday of vaccination progress in the 15 states and UTs. All of them have now been told to hold daily reviews of progress and to ensure the gap between quantity demanded by the private sector and payment is brought down to zero. Central officials said, in many cases, they noticed that private units had not completed the payment for the volume of doses they had asked for. According to revised rules, states have to inform the Centre about the vaccine demand from private sites through CoWIN. “We want the 15 states to carry out proper vaccination by fully utilising the doses already available with the private sector,” said Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan. A key concern that was raised during Wednesday's meeting was that private hospitals had not placed any indent for the earmarked quantum of Covid vaccines. “State governments need to facilitate vaccine procurement by these centres. States need to review the status on a daily basis and ensure that the indents for the earmarked quantum are quickly placed with the private vaccine manufacturers,” Bhushan said. The ministry also said that in some cases, states and private vaccination centres were yet to collect or physically lift the volume of doses they had paid for. Such states were asked to immediately ensure the dispatched doses were lifted and administered on time. Those in the private sector said their drives have been impacted by slow supply and availability of free jabs at government-run sites. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the IMA’s Hospital Board of India, said private vaccination centres are currently facing major challenges. He said, "We are tired of frequently changing policies by the central government, which have become an impediment. Small and medium-sized private hospitals are located in almost all corners of the city, but they are finding it difficult to get doses because their procurement volumes are low.” He added that while approving sites, no care is being taken to ensure equitable distribution of private and government sites in an area. If private and public vaccination centres are located close to each other, beneficiaries will prefer free jabs if there’s no rush at the public sites, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/slow-pvt-sector-coverage-a-worry-health-ministry/articleshow/84423666.cms||Nisha Nambiar

And that they were arrested just before they were about to carry out the attack. Saraswati took to Twitter to claim: “Due to police’s alertness, a foreign national among three Muslims who had come to assassinate me have now been arrested.” Bulandshahr Police, however, have now clarified that the men who were detained had no connection with the priest. Saraswati was in Bulandshahr on Tuesday to attend a function. The three men -- Venkateshwar, Sayyed Sameer and Tanveer Pasha-- were briefly detained near the venue on the basis of suspicion. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Santosh Kumar Singh said, “The three men were detained. But no connection with Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati’s function was established. They deal in sale and purchase of old cars and were going to Bengaluru from Moradabad. However, they lost their way and were passing through the same road in Ramghat area where Saraswati was to spend the night and take part in a function the next day. “We could not find any evidence to prove that they were planning something wrong. They had all the identification papers,” the SSP said. Saraswati had hit headlines for justifying the alleged thrashing of a Muslim boy, 14, who had entered the Dasna temple premises to drink water from a tap there. Recently he made controversial remarks against RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat for saying all Indians carry the same DNA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/dasna-priest-claims-murder-plot-by-3-men-cops-trash-it-say-trio-are-traders/articleshow/84418844.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Delhi||Delhi: Customised walk plans for Lajpat, INA markets||NEW DELHI: Busy city places such as the ITO junction or popular shopping zones like Lajpat Nagar and INA Market are all set to become pedestrian-friendly. Customised walk plans for seven locations were approved on Thursday. Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal chaired the 63rd governing council meeting of Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning and Engineering) Centre (UTTIPEC) on Thursday, which was attended by the vice-chairman of Delhi Development Authority and other officials of various departments. In a statement, the LG’s Office said that after detailed deliberations, the proposals for walk plans for INA Market/metro station, ITO junction, Hauz Khas-IIT Delhi, Delhi University’s North and South Campuses, Kamla Nagar and Lajpat Nagar were approved. ‘These plans aim to improve the walking infrastructure and customise them to specific needs of the respective areas,’ the statement said. Apart from the walk plans, the multi-modal integration plans at Delhi Metro’s Nawada station, Uttam Nagar West station and Janakpuri East stations were also approved. The status of other projects approved earlier by the governing council were also reviewed and the officials of various agencies and departments advised to ensure time-bound completion as per the scheduled timelines, the statement said. According to an official, Public Works Department has several joint projects with UTTIPEC, among them the walk plans, their aim of which is to strengthen the existing pedestrian infrastructure in areas where it is ill-maintained or inadequate and develop them in places where it is not currently available. In case of the IIT Delhi-Hauz Khas project, the plan is to ensure uniform level and width of the footpath from the intersection of Aurobindo Marg and Outer Ring Road to the main gate of IIT-D, with the shifting of dhalaos, dustbins, poles, etc. In DU’s North Campus, the walkability project focuses on creating seamless movement of pedestrians. "It has been observed that there is a lack of enforcement of traffic laws in the area and this needs to be addressed by the traffic police by imposing hefty fines on unauthorised parking," an official said. In February this year, DU representatives requested the study of the area for the walkability project should be expanded to covering the entire campus. In the case of South campus, the improvement of walkability infrastructure requires shifting of the boundary wall of the railway land along San Martin Road to provide uniform width of footpath. PWD has taken this up with Northern Railways. “The consultant creating the plan also raised the issue of crossing of Ring Road during off-hours and suggested a separate landing and sharing of a foot overbridge by pedestrians,” the official said. The aim at ITO is to make the junction safe for pedestrians. “There are many offices in the area, as well as two metro stations — ITO and Pragati Maidan — that see heavy footfall throughout the day. The official said, “Apart from these, there are several bus stands on this stretch, making it all the more important to ensure that the area is safe for walkers and well connected too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/customised-walk-plans-for-lajpat-ina-markets/articleshow/84456209.cms||---

PNB has sought the properties to be released to the liquidator of Modi owned Firestar Diamond International Private Limited, the Resolution Professional of Firestar International Limited and Recovery Officer. The court has directed the ED to submit its replies to the pleas. Last year, under the Fugitive Economic Offenders (FEO) Act, a special court directed that properties of Modi — declared FEO earlier — be attached by the ED. However, it exempted from the list, properties secured to PNB and a consortium of banks either through mortgage, hypothecation or personal guarantee. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had accused Modi of fraudulently obtaining letters of undertaking (LoUs) of over Rs 7,000 crore, in a criminal conspiracy with several bank officials. The ED too registered a money laundering case. Modi left India in January 2018 and is currently in a UK jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pnb-moves-3-pleas-before-pmla-for-release-of-ed-attached-assets-in-nimo-case/articleshow/84423703.cms||---

In another five months, after the approach roads are developed, this key infrastructure project will act as a main link between west and central Delhi, further decongesting areas like Sadar Bazar, Rohtak Road, Walled City extensions, Azad market and nearby areas. A civic body official said the installation work for inserting concrete boxes under railway lines was now over and tenders had been issued to create six lanes of 125-150m long approach roads. “The Northern Railway will soon transfer the maintenance of underpass to the north corporation. We had arranged the funds for this infrastructure project from the urban development ministry, which were provided to the railways. The approach roads for entry and exit to the underpass is likely to be thrown open for traffic by December,” the official said. Under the project, four underpass points were to be developed near Banda Bairagi Marg (Rambagh road), Indrelok near Kishanganj, Shasti Nagar, Pratap Nagar to Azad market. One of the four points was inaugurated by Union minister Dr Harshwardhan in December 2018. “The other three underpasses are now ready, and the project is in its final phase,” the official said. The primary beneficiaries of the project will be the people living in Sarai Rohila, Kishanganj, Padam Nagar, Pratap Nagar, Gulabi Bagh, Tri Nagar, Inderlok, Shanti Nagar and Rampura and nearby areas. The Kishanganj project is one of the most delayed — the initial proposal for which was made in 1998. The construction work finally started on 30 June 2008. Several revisions and re-revisions of schemes have taken place since. The corporation official said issues like land acquisitions, shifting utilities, the existing shops and religious structures were main reasons behind the delay. “Around 200 shops of L&DO and DDA was shifted, while two transformers sub-stations and five religious structures from the work site to MCD staff quarters complex at Model Town were also moved,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/underpass-of-deadlines-much-closer-to-reality/articleshow/84423728.cms||Paras Singh

The protesters were marching towards Raj Bhawan before they were stopped by the police force. Later, the agitators decided to sit near the police barricading as a mark of protest. Pradeep Kukreti, district president of one of the main state agitator associations, said that despite several requests made to seek an appointment with the governor, the agitators haven’t been given an appointment for the past three years. Kukreti further said that this has never happened with the agitators in the past 21 years of the state’s history. Later, the state Congress president, Pritam Singh, and other Congress members also extended their support to the agitators’ protest. Notably, the agitators want “The Uttarakhand Reservation in Government Services for the Marked Andolankari of Uttarakhand Movement and Their Dependents Act, 2015” to be implemented but for the past six years, the Act hasn’t got the nod from the governor house. The Act provides a 10% horizontal reservation in the Uttarakhand government services to the selected agitators and their dependents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-state-agitators-hold-a-march-in-protest-against-the-government-over-reservations/articleshow/84421156.cms||Mohammad Anab

---||Delhi||Subsidised thali plan to be back in a new avatar in south Delhi||NEW DELHI: The subsidised thali scheme under Atal Aahar Yojna will be relaunched in south Delhi with an expanded menu and more number of sites. South Delhi Municipal Corporation will now allow private operators to use the food van for commercial purposes in the ‘non-scheme hours.’ They will be allowed to carry out the sale of confectionery items, packaged food and other food items. The operators will also be allowed to display advertisements on 50sqm area on the kiosk. Officials say that the scope of the scheme is being increased by adding more sale points and remodelling the entire scheme. The subsidised Rs 10 meal scheme was first started in December 2017 and the city’s municipal corporations had then roped in mid-day meal agencies to run these vans, but the scheme had to be discontinued because of the Covid outbreak and closing down of schools. According to the new rules framed by the civic body, breakfast will cost Rs 10 per plate, while lunch will be offered for Rs 15 per plate. The timings for breakfast will be 8-11 am during which five pooris or two stuffed parathas with sabzi and pickle will be provided. The lunch timings will be from 12 noon to 3 pm during which four rotis or two paranthas, rice, dal, sabzi and raita will be served for Rs 15. The weight of the lunch thali will be around 450 grams. A senior official said that a major portion of Delhi’s population was in the low income group and due to financial constraints, these people were forced to eat unhygienic food. The new model will help in making hygienic food more accessible while also providing employment opportunities to operators. “Operators will not need to take separate trade licences. Initially, 10 kiosks will be opened in each of the four zones,” the official said. Private operators will have to bid for the contract and the minimum reserve price has been fixed at Rs 1,000. “We will allocate the kiosks as per the bids of the monthly licence fee. The operator will be allowed an incubation period of 60 days,” the official said. The size of the food kiosks has been fixed at 16.5 sqm and the design will be prepared with the help of students from School of Planning and Architecture. “We will hold a competition among SPA students to finalise the design of these booths.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/subsidised-thali-plan-to-be-back-in-a-new-avatar/articleshow/84456306.cms||Paras Singh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra private hospitals use 75% doses, Delhi seeks report on slow pace||MUMBAI: Private hospitals in Maharashtra procured 61 lakh doses of Covid vaccine in May and June but have managed to administer only 46 lakh, a little over 75%. The Centre on Wednesday called the slow pace of private vaccination a matter of “serious concern” and asked states to review the procurement and use of vaccines daily. Around 300 private hospitals are a part of the vaccine drive in Maharashtra. Figures show private hospitals from the state have ordered the maximum doses of Covid vaccine compared to any other state, though they have not managed to utilise it all. The question of hoarding has been whispered, more so on days when public vaccination centres have not been able to immunise at all due to shortage. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan chaired a high-level meeting with senior immunisation officials of 15 states, including Maharashtra, where it was pointed out that many private centres have not placed any orders, while some haven’t completed payments. In some states, vaccines paid for has not been picked up, and in some, the actual administration of doses is lesser than doses ordered. Dr Dilip Patil, head of immunisation for Maharashtra, insisted there was no hoarding of vaccines in Maharashtra. “Of the 3.7 crore doses administered in the state, around 46 lakh have been at the private sector. For July, private hospitals have already demanded 50 lakh doses, of which 28 lakh has been indented,” he said. In Mumbai, private vaccination accounts for more than 42% of nearly 62 lakh doses administered. From July 1, the Centre allowed private hospitals to directly place orders through CoWin. Depending on the quantity ordered, the hospitals can either get it directly from the manufacturer or get it delivered at the state-owned depots. A senior official from Pune believes that private hospitals are sitting on thousands of doses and hence are not placing fresh orders. A few private hospitals, however, told TOI of a sharp drop in demand for paid vaccination and slowdown of camps due to multiple scams. “We have seen a dramatic drop in footfall since the Centre announced that states would be flush with doses from July,” said the CEO of a south Mumbai hospital. “We see a huge rush now only when the public centres are out of doses,” said another private chain head. A crucial reason for the slowdown, feels another hospital head, is that the population willing to pay is vaccinated already. Yet, hospitals are hopeful that demand will soar from July 24 when the 18-44 group become eligible for the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-pvt-hosps-use-75-doses-delhi-seeks-report-on-slow-pace/articleshow/84423818.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The AAP member claimed that the shopkeepers in markets had a lot of resentment against BJP ahead of the 2020 municipal elections. “They are admitting that BJP is looting as much money as it can because the party is aware that it might lose the next municipal elections,” Bharadwaj claimed. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the AAP member was lying and that BJP was aware of the problems traders were facing due to rise in some civic charges. “We will address their issues soon,” he added. Meanwhile, many BJP and Congress functionaries joined AAP on Wednesday after being influenced by the development model being implemented by the Arvind Kejriwal government. “The historic work done by AAP in education, health, water, electricity and roads is influencing people to join the party,” Bharadwaj said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/1l-signatures-against-tax-hike-by-bjp-led-corpns-aap/articleshow/84423784.cms||---

Ceejay House was constructed by a company associated with senior NCP leader Praful Patel. Mirchi’s wife Hajra Memon and her two sons, Asif and Junaid, own 14,500 square feet of office space on the third and fourth floors. Earlier, the ED had attached the floors in the case, which was subsequently confirmed by the adjudicating authority. A part of the office space was on rent and the ED had given notice to the tenant to vacate the premises. Last December, the ED had requested the court to declare Hajra and her two sons as fugitive economic offenders for confiscation of their properties in India and abroad. They mentioned the Mirchi family’s 15 properties for confiscation, including the two floors at Ceejay House. The ED had provisionally attached Mirchi family’s properties worth Rs 798 crore in the country and abroad under PMLA. The ED alleged that Mirchi earned his money through smuggling of narcotics, arms and extortion activities. The ED is investigating a money laundering case where Mirchi allegedly fraudulently freed his three buildings at Worli—Rabia Mansion, Mariam Lodge and Sea View (now all three are demolished)—in 2005 and sold these to a company controlled by DHFL promoters Kapil Wadhawan and his brother Dheeraj Wadhawan aka Baba Dewan. Wadhawan brothers allegedly paid Mirchi for the three buildings through hawala channels. During investigation, the ED began to examine Mirchi’s other deals in India over the past two decades till his death in 2013 in London.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ed-takes-possession-of-mirchi-kins-2-floors-in-ceejay-house/articleshow/84421300.cms||Vijay V Singh

The first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy made the observation as the Centre informed the court that a petition has been filed in the SC to transfer similar petitions pending before various high courts challenging the rules. “There is no stay on the proceedings. We can go ahead with the matter and decide. The SC will have the benefit of the opinion of the high court,” the bench said, refusing to defer the hearing. The court then directed the Centre to file its counter affidavit in three weeks and adjourned the hearing to August 11. The bench made the observations on a plea moved by Digital News Publishers Association, challenging the rules. The association sought an interim order restraining the Centre from taking any action under the rules. It cited issues with provisions including Rule 16, which gave power to the secretary of the Union ministry of information and broadcasting to block public access to any digital information. Carnatic singer T M Krishna’s plea, that the rules offend his right as an artist and a cultural/political commentator by imposing a chilling effect on free speech, is also pending before the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-sc-stay-so-wont-stop-hearing-pleas-on-it-rules-madras-hc/articleshow/84427742.cms||---
---||Ranchi||One lakh beneficiaries to be vaccinated every day in July||RANCHI: The state is set to receive over 17.5 lakh doses in the next 15 days, which will be delivered in seven portions. This comes after the state health department urged the Centre to allocate more doses for Jharkhand as it is running short of vaccines. Talking to TOI, additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh said: “I have been following up with the Union health secretary on a daily basis as we were facing a scarcity of vaccines. I also assured them that Jharkhand has been meticulously planning and distributing the vaccines to all the districts as per priority and the respective district’s demand which is leading to its effective coverage with the available doses. I am thankful that our daily persuasion with the Centre has paid off and we will now be able to vaccinate around one lakh people on a daily basis.” As per the delivery schedule of the vaccinses, Jharkhand will receive 17,89,140 doses between July 13 and August 4, of which 14,66,300 Covishield vials and 3,22,840 Covaxin. On Tuesday, the state received 40,000 Covaxin doses. According to health department sources, the state now plans to improve the average vaccination coverage on a daily basis and a senior official said, “As soon as we received the Covaxin doses, we directed all the districts to chalk out their plans to improve the vaccination coverage and have also asked them to ensure that session sites are ready to vaccinate maximum number of beneficiaries. Earlier, say, if we were left with 40,000 doses, we used only 20,000 doses on one day and the rest the following day. But now we are planning to take it to around one lakh doses per day till July 31 as we have more than 17 lakh vaccines for administering in the next fortnight.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/1l-beneficiaries-to-be-vaccinated-every-day-in-july/articleshow/84423889.cms||---
