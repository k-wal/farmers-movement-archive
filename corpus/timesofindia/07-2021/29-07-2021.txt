Three weeks later that sense of victory is evaporating in the face of a resurgent pandemic. The US now faces a surge in cases fueled by vaccine holdouts and the highly transmissible delta variant, prompting the federal government and companies on Tuesday to weigh mandatory vaccinations of workers and a return to widespread mask wearing. That reversal of fortune could bring back restrictions many Americans had hoped were gone for good -- a bitter setback for Biden, who has counted on defeating the pandemic as a cornerstone of the nation’s economic recovery. As the seven-day rolling average of new infections approached 52,000 on Tuesday, more than four times the level just three weeks ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance recommending Americans resume wearing masks in indoor public places in many parts of the country -- regardless of whether they’re vaccinated. Just two months ago, the agency said vaccinated Americans could safely remove their masks everywhere. Read more: Delta Variant Spills Out of Midwest Tourist Hub-Turned-Incubator The rapidly rising case count is prompting concern about the safety of schools, which are poised to begin reopening for the fall in less than a month, and whether the economy will suffer another blow should Americans resume social distancing practices. Virus fears could keep Americans away from restaurants, hotels and bars, especially in areas with high transmission, and cause them to reconsider reporting to their jobs or traveling. The apprehension was evident on Tuesday at the White House. Press Secretary Jen Psaki spent much of her daily briefing jousting with reporters over the new CDC guidance. Since May, virtually all White House staff and reporters at the complex had gone without face coverings. But on Tuesday, even before the CDC formally announced its new recommendations, a handful of reporters and photographers donned masks at Psaki’s briefing. Vice President Kamala Harris put one on during a meeting with Native American leaders, and reporters accompanying her were abruptly instructed to wear masks by press aides, who said the level of virus transmission in Washington had been upgraded by the CDC to "substantial." At 5 p.m., White House staff received an email directing them to wear masks while indoors at the White House even if they’re fully vaccinated. The White House Correspondents’ Association sent a similar message to the hundreds of journalists credentialed to be in the complex. Staff and journalists quickly followed suit, digging masks out of bags and desk drawers. And Congress' doctor on Tuesday night reimposed a mask-wearing requirement for lawmakers and all others while they are on the House floor, and in hallways and offices. After months of resisting vaccine mandates, Biden told reporters earlier Tuesday that he was considering forcing federal employees to get shots. While there have been so-called breakthrough cases among the vaccinated, Biden said the delta variant is primarily circulating among those who aren’t inoculated. "If you’re not vaccinated, you’re not nearly as smart as I thought you were," Biden said during a visit to Tuesday to the headquarters of the Director of National Intelligence in Virginia. Some major employers are implementing similar policies. The Washington Post announced Tuesday it would require employees to show proof of vaccination, joining the ranks of companies mandating workers get their shots. Ford Motor Co. reinstated masking requirements for workers at facilities in Missouri and Florida, after General Motors Co. did the same at a Missouri factory. The president faces significant political risks if rising case levels once again disrupt everyday life in the US He has touted progress against the virus as his most significant achievement and Americans have given him high marks for his handling of the pandemic thus far. Almost two-thirds of Americans approved of his approach to the virus, according to a CBS News/YouGov poll released last week. The CDC’s reversal on masks could make it more difficult to convince Americans to adhere to the new policy, according to Leana Wen, a former Baltimore health commissioner. “The CDC made a critical mistake back in May. By issuing guidance that led to the end of indoor mask mandates prematurely, they gave the impression that the pandemic was over. It’s very hard to walk this back,” she said. But Peter Hotez of the Baylor College of Medicine says he believes the CDC made the correct decision in easing masking rules in May and again on Tuesday, given how high viral loads are for people with the delta variant. “They’re following the evidence, following the science,” he said. “The problem is it’s not a 30-second Unicef commercial, it takes nuance and time to explain” why the policy reversal makes sense. Biden missed his July 4 target of 70% of US adults receiving at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and the holdouts -- particularly in parts of the country that are heavily Republican, such as the Deep South -- have left the country vulnerable. More than two weeks past that deadline, 69% of adults have had at least one inoculation, according to the CDC. Republicans, many of whom have only recently begun to urge their constituents to get vaccinated, have indicated they don’t plan to offer Biden help in getting them to follow the CDC’s suddenly stricter mask guidance. Former President Donald Trump, in a statement on Tuesday night, belittled the new concerns: “We won’t go back. We won’t mask our children.” And Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said, “today’s decision, sadly, was driven by politics, not science. Let me be clear: There should be no more Covid mandates, no mask mandates, no vaccine mandates, no vaccine passports, no lockdowns, and no school closures. Enough is enough.” Delta’s spread has touched all corners of the country -- from Cruz’s home state, which posted its biggest daily jump in new infections in five months, to New York and Los Angeles, which have joined rural states among places where the new mask guidance applies. But the White House has some reason to hope that the latest surge will not lead to the type of widespread turmoil and death that occurred last year. The UK recently went through a spike in infections driven by the delta variant, despite having fully vaccinated 56% of its population, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. Cases there topped 50,000 a day, close to the level of the country’s winter surge. But unlike the winter peak, there has been little corresponding rise in hospitalizations or deaths, a sign that the wide use of vaccines has prevented infections from becoming severe. Yet in the US, where case counts are following a similar trajectory, the outcome is less certain. Parts of the country, in particular the East and West Coasts, have vaccination levels in line with the UK. But in the central and southern parts of the US, the share of people getting shots has lagged badly and hospitalization rates are rising. In Missouri and Arkansas, two of the states with the worst ongoing outbreaks, hospitalizations are at levels not seen since January. In younger age groups, such as those ages 30-59, new hospitalizations have already passed the US winter peak and continue to rise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/bidens-summer-of-joy-turns-grim-as-delta-infections-skyrocket/articleshow/84837626.cms||---

The searches were conducted on the premises of the then officials of Eastern Coalfield Limited (ECL), including two former general managers (one serving and one retired), manager (security), inspector (security) and colliery agent among others. Cash of nearly Rs 20 lakh, jewellery and property documents were recovered from the premises of the incumbent general manager. “Property documents, locker key and incriminating documents were recovered from the possession of other accused,” read a CBI statement. The CBI registered a case on November 27, 2020, against six accused and unknown persons on the allegations of illegal mining and theft of coal in the leasehold areas of ECL, Asansol and its adjoining private land, the statement added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/cbi-conducts-raids-in-coal-scam-case/articleshow/84838720.cms||---

All of the former officials were part of the government of ex-President Mauricio Funes. Sanchez Ceren served as his vice president before going on to win the presidency. The court also indicated it would work with Interpol to seek the arrest of Sanchez Ceren and four others not in custody. Funes, who is not one of those named in the case, but faces charges in other cases, lives in Nicaragua where he received political asylum. Current President Nayib Bukele has pursued corrupt officials in previous governments. The hugely popular president not only swept the parties that had ruled El Salvador for much of the past three decades from power, but has pledged to punish acts of corruption. He has been criticized for not pursuing alleged corruption within his own administration with the same vigor. Those targeted in this case include government ministers and deputy ministers from Funes' cabinet. Funes and Sanchez Ceren were the last two presidents of the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the same party that Bukele came up in before being ejected for criticizing its leaders prior to his run for president. Bukele has said that records indicate Sanchez Ceren left the country in El Salvador and has not returned. The attorney general's office alleges that the former officials illegally received $2.6 million.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/el-salvador-court-orders-pre-trial-detention-of-ex-officials/articleshow/84838967.cms||---

The Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) had recently discovered an ancient temple dating back to the 6th-7th century CE at Birapurusottampur village in Pipli Tehsil of Puri district while conducting a survey of Ratnachira Valley and its monuments. The INTACH members claimed that this temple, made of square Khandolite stone blocks, belongs to the post-Gupta era. This temple is locally revered as Swapneswar Mahadev and dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple is damaged due to growth of thick vegetation over the temple top. “Estimated to be 1300-1400 years old, this temple is one of the best-preserved examples of early Kalingan architecture in the region. However, I am distressed to learn that the temples structure is in a precarious state and in need of immediate preservation measures,” read Pradhan’s letter. He said Ratnachira Valley is a gold mine of ancient Kalingan monuments, most of which were undocumented until recently. Keeping the immense historical, spiritual and socio-cultural importance of the temple and heritage monuments in Ratnachira Valley in mind, Pradhan requested Reddy’s personal intervention to undertake all possible measures for preservation of this ancient temple and documentation and conservation of other heritage monuments in Ratnachira Valley. After the discovery of this ancient temple, Odisha tourism and culture minister Jyoti Prakash Panigrahi announced that the state government will fund the restoration of the temple.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/dharmendra-urges-centre-to-preserve-1400-yr-old-temple/articleshow/84839750.cms||Hemanta Pradhan

Only four cyber police stations, one each in Bhubaneswar, Sambalpur, Berhampur, and Rourkela are currently operational in the state. “We have sent the proposal to the government to set up 25 new cyber police stations. Since cybercrimes are on the rise and many people are falling prey to cyber frauds, we need one cyber police station in each district to effectively handle the digital offence,” additional director general (Crime Branch) Sanjeeb Panda told TOI. At least 779 cybercrime cases have been registered from January 1 till May 31 this year. Cybercrime offences increased by an alarming 31% in Odisha in 2020 as compared to 2019. Odisha Police statistics revealed that 1931 cybercrime cases were registered last year as against 1475 in 2019. Police said most of the cybercrime cases were reported during the Covid-induced lockdown when people relied more on online payment and UPI transactions. A few offences were reported following circulation of false video/audio clips related to Covid outbreak on social media. “We found most cases of fraud related to transactions through net banking, debit/credit cards and UPI payments. Lockdown had prompted people to stay indoors and increased their dependency on online banking. Restriction on movement of people, apprehension of virus infection through cash and availability of commodities through online platforms made people vulnerable to cyber frauds,” a senior police officer said. Police sources said almost all the victims found money withdrawn fraudulently from their accounts after they had clicked on phishing and suspicious mails or links related to cashback offers. In some cases the victims, who were not conversant with online transactions, shared their passwords after being tricked by the cyber crooks. The state police headquarters recently asked the police personnel to incorporate the concept of golden hour while probing cyber crimes. Cops were asked to effectively utilise the crucial golden hour — the time between occurrence of the crime and response after registration of the case.

There are chances of heavy rainfall at isolated places in select districts, but in most it won’t be as heavy as initially predicted. H R Biswas, director of regional IMD centre, said rainfall would reduce by Saturday. Sarat Chandra Sahu, director of Centre for Environment and Climate at SOA deemed to be university, said the system would not give much rain as expected. The state government, however, continued to monitor the rainfall pattern so as to prevent any untoward incident. The IMD’s rainfall report recorded on Wednesday morning said Tensa in Sundergarh district recorded the highest 82.8 mm rainfall in the last 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/rain-likely-over-next-two-days/articleshow/84839779.cms||---

Police said the gunmen were wearing face masks, while the Chinese nationals were travelling without escort. Javed Akbar Riaz, a senior Karachi-based police officer, said the motive behind the attack was not immediately clear. He, however, claimed that police were investigating. "The victim and another Chinese national were being driven to Karachi’s industrial area when they came under attack," Riaz said. The latest assault on Chinese nationals is particularly significant since it took place in Karachi, the commercial capital of Pakistan, rather than in the remote parts of the country where militants are based. Karachi is also home to several Chinese-funded construction projects. Speaking in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian described the incident as an "isolated" case. "We have full confidence in the Pakistan side’s protection of Chinese citizens and property in Pakistan," he told a regular news briefing. The attack took place weeks after a terrorist attack on a bus carrying Pakistani and Chinese workers in Kohistan, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan’s northwest, killing nine Chinese and four Pakistanis. Pakistan initially said it was only a road accident, but later investigators concluded that the bus driver had lost control after a suicide car bomber set off his explosives prematurely nearby. China has poured billions of dollars into Pakistan, and thousands of Chinese nationals visit the country to work on China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects or other business ventures. The attacks on Chinese in Pakistan has been a matter of serious concern for authorities in Islamabad who have described Beijing’s funding as a "game-changer".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/gunmen-shoot-injure-chinese-national-in-karachi/articleshow/84836224.cms||---

On his first visit to India, the US top diplomat met PM Modi, foreign minister S Jaishankar and NSA Ajit Doval, with Afghanistan, Covid and Quad topping the agenda in all discussions. While many were looking for details in terms of specific outcomes, the meetings were along broad strategic lines, aligning the outlook of both countries on issues like Quad and Indo-Pacific, deepening cooperation and synergies.

The Taliban say they seek international recognition, that they want international support for Afghanistan. … the taking over the country by force and abusing the rights of own people is not the path to achieve those objectives.” The convergence could be seen in Modi’s tweet after meeting Blinken: “I welcome President Biden’s strong commitment to strengthen the India-US strategic partnership, which is anchored in our shared democratic values and is a force for global good.” Read AlsoUS, India avoid stumble on rights issue even as Blinken sends message to China by meeting Dalai Lama's aideWhile the US and India avoided a stumble on human rights issues on Wednesday, visiting secretary of state Antony Blinken sent a strong message to China by meeting representative of the Dalai Lama and separately meeting an official in the Tibetan government in exile.After his meeting with Jaishankar, Blinken tweeted, “Thanks to @DrSJaishankar for a collaborative discussion today on many areas of cooperation, including efforts to support peace and stability in Afghanistan. India is one of our most valued partners, and the US welcomes India's emergence as a leading global power.” His remarks constitute a shift in US policy, bringing it much closer to the Indian position that a power grab in Afghanistan by the Taliban would lack legitimacy. Blinken added, “We’ve also seen these reports of atrocities committed by the Taliban in areas that it’s taken over that are deeply, deeply troubling…” The India-US discussions on the current security challenge can be seem as a culmination of a series of recent regional parleys, as the Taliban have advanced militarily in many districts. It would be a setback to Pakistan which has supported Taliban on the battlefield against an increasingly embattled Afghan government. Jaishankar put forth the Indian case, saying, “The gains to Afghan civil society, especially on the rights of women, minorities, and on social freedoms over the last two decades, are self-evident. We must collectively work to preserve them. Afghanistan must neither be home to terrorism nor a source of refugees.” Covid and the global recovery featured even as the US gave $25 million to India to speed up its vaccination efforts. Expressing appreciation, Jaishankar said, “the openness with which the Biden administration has kept these supply chains open, which has enabled us today to really scale up the vaccine numbers. But this is also a work in progress.” India is likely to open up supplies of vaccines to other countries by early 2022. Addressing a joint press conference, Blinken and Jaishankar dwelt on progress on the Quad and growing convergences in the Indo-Pacific. Jaishankar issued a full-throated endorsement of the Quad, saying, “opportunities for further collaboration on all these issues but also the importance of observing international law and rules and norms, including UNCLOS. Our ability to work more closely bilaterally in the Quad and elsewhere benefits the international community as a whole.” Blinken stressed on the need for "cooperation among countries than ever before". "There isn't a challenge that doesn't have impact on the lives of our citizens whether it's Covid, disruptive impact of emerging technologies, that can be addressed by any one of us acting alone." The Quad, Blinken said, “is not a military alliance.” It would deal with “COVID-19, on advancing the climate agenda, on dealing with emerging technologies.” Nearly all of these would be in exclusion of and counter to China’s efforts. Blinken’s first meeting was with NSA Ajit Doval where the two sides discussed regional security, focusing on the situation in Afghanistan.

The remote village is a three-hour walk from the nearest road, but rescue teams from the Army, police and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) swung into action and reached the spot in time to save many lives. Officials said the cloudburst struck Honzar village in Dacchan tehsil around 4.30am. Seventeen people injured in the incident were rescued while over 20 people are still missing, Kishtwar district development commissioner Ashok Kumar Sharma said. Referring to similar incidents in other parts of the district, Sharma said two cloudbursts struck the remote Lambard area the previous night, but no loss of life was reported. He said 60 families were evacuated from the Paddar area in the wake of incessant rain, which posed a threat to their homes. Flash floods were reported in Machail, Paddar and Bunjwah in Kishtwar district. Commandant general V K Singh of the SDRF said, “One of our SDRF teams from Kishtwar has reached the affected village and two more teams are on their way from Doda and Udhampur districts. Two SDRF teams are waiting for the weather to improve to be airlifted from Jammu and Srinagar to join the rescue mission.” He added that a NDRF team from Ludhiana in Punjab is also on the way to Kishtwar. Jammu-based defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said, "Two Army columns have been mobilised to assist the civil administration in the rescue operations. While the first Army column was mobilised early this morning and joined the rescue operation, the second column will be reaching shortly." Union minister and local MP Jitendra Singh said he had spoken to the district magistrate and Air Force authorities and asked them to airlift the injured as and when required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/seven-dead-several-missing-in-jk-cloudburst/articleshow/84840004.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||Food running out in Ethiopia's Tigray: UN||NAIROBI: The United Nations called Wednesday for the opening of critical aid routes in Ethiopia's war-torn Tigray, warning that the region - already threatened with famine - risked running out of food supplies. Access into the region was cut off last week after the only available route for aid delivery was made inaccessible following an attack on a World Food Programme convoy. About 150 trucks with food and other supplies are being held in Semera "pending security clearances", while another 44 left for Tigray on Wednesday, the UN's humanitarian agency OCHA said in a statement. Semera is the capital of Afar region, which borders Tigray to the east and had become key after two bridges along other routes were destroyed in late June. The last convoy reached the Tigrayan capital Mekele on July 12 and current food rations could only last up to Friday, the OCHA warned. "Nutrition partners will also soon run out of the essential ready to use formula to treat an estimated 4,000 severely malnourished children every month," it added. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed sent troops into Tigray last November to detain and disarm leaders of the region's then-ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). He said the move came in response to TPLF attacks on federal army camps. The 2019 Nobel Peace laureate declared victory in late November after government forces took Mekele, but TPLF leaders remained on the run and fighting continued. Last month the war took a stunning turn when pro-TPLF forces retook Mekele, Abiy declared a unilateral ceasefire and the army mostly pulled out of Tigray. But after rebel leaders launched a new offensive intended to regain control of western and southern Tigray - contested areas occupied by fighters from the Amhara region, which borders Tigray to the south - Abiy vowed to "repel" them. The government has since mobilised forces from regions previously untouched by the conflict, including Oromia. The fighting has heightened the humanitarian crisis in the region, where the UN has already warned that 400,000 people have been pushed into famine. "A lack of supplies, fuel and communication equipment is expected to effectively halt humanitarian response in two weeks," the OCHA said, adding that an estimated 600 trucks of relief items were needed every week. "Fuel shortages have particularly affected health assistance, including vaccinations and other life-saving services, and risk disrupting access to safe water for up to 450,000 people." The agency called for the restoration of basic services so as to provide life-saving services, including vaccinations, and urged the warring parties to protect civilians and humanitarian workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/food-running-out-in-ethiopias-tigray-un/articleshow/84840085.cms||---
---||World||Police: Indianapolis FedEx shooter not racially motivated||INDIANAPOLIS: The former employee who shot and killed eight people at an Indianapolis FedEx warehouse in April acted alone and was not racially or ethnically motivated, authorities said Wednesday.  Brandon Scott Hole, 19, used the April 15 attack as an act of "suicidal murder" and believed he would "demonstrate his masculinity and capability" while fulfilling a final desire to experience killing people, Indianapolis police and federal authorities said during a news conference.  Eight employees, including four members of the city's Sikh community, were killed in the attack and five others were injured, police said.  Police said Hole considered other locations for the shooting but chose the FedEx building because it was familiar to him. He also believed the site would give him access to a large number of vulnerable victims.  Paul Keenan, special agent in charge of the FBI's Indianapolis field office, declined to disclose other potential targets.  "He knew the location well," Keenan said. "He knew there would be a large group of people there that he would consider targets."  Hole had suicidal thoughts "almost daily" in the months prior to the attack and attempted suicide on "more than one occasion," Keenan said. Although Hole had struggled with mental health stressors "throughout his life," he had no previously diagnosed mental illness, and he did not share his plans for the FedEx shooting with family or friends.  Hole was able to legally purchase the two rifles used in the shooting, even after his mother called police last year to say her son might undertake "suicide by cop."  Police seized a pump-action shotgun from Hole, then 18, in March 2020 after they received the call from his mother. One of the responding officers also witnessed "white supremist websites" on Hole's computer after the teen asked officers to cut the power to his computer, according to a police probable cause narrative from the incident.  Keenan said Wednesday an investigation by the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit determined that Hole was viewing "World War II, Nazi-like propaganda" on the computer, but he did not appear to have been motivated by a bias or desire to advance an ideology.  "It was an extremely small percentage ... but there were some mainly German military and Nazi things, but there was no indication that there was any animosity towards the Sikh community, or any other group for that matter," Keenan said.  Members of the Indianapolis Sikh community pressed local and federal law enforcement for months for an investigation into the shooter's motive, emphasizing concern that Hole chose a place known for hiring people of color, specifically a Punjabi Sikh-majority.  Sikh Coalition Legal Director Amrith Kaur said that while "it's impossible" to know Hole's thinking, she was disappointed police did not release additional details about how they ruled out bias as a possible motive.  "It is important to recognize that bias can be a factor in addition to these other issues," Kaur said in a statement Wednesday. "Though law enforcement has said this investigation is over, for all the families who lost loved ones, the survivors, the Sikh community, and anyone else impacted by hate violence, these questions will remain forever."  Police said Hole entered the FedEx building shortly before 11 p.m. and spoke with security, then returned to his vehicle in the parking lot to retrieve the two guns used in the shooting.  Hole walked back to the employee entrance of the building, killing one FedEx employee outside. He entered the facility for a second time, firing his weapons at employees inside the entry area. Hole was unable to go further into the building but fired "several shots" at victims beyond the security gate, police said.  "He was very indiscriminate in his selection of his targets," said Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department Deputy Chief Craig McCartt.  As Hole left the FedEx building a second time, he continued shooting in the parking lot, striking several more victims. An unidentified employee was able to recover a personal firearm from his vehicle and fired a round at Hole in the parking lot. Hole was not struck by the round, and the employee then fled the area to call 911.  When Hole entered the building a third and final time, he used guns to kill himself. Hole was onsite just over 10 minutes. The shooting lasted less than four minutes.  Hole was a former employee of FedEx and last worked for the company in 2020. McCartt said police found no indication that Hole had any animosity towards FedEx, specifically: "He had never had any kind of issue there. He simply stopped showing up to work."  Preparation for the attack likely started in July 2020, McCartt continued. That's when Hole purchased an HM Defense HM15F, just months after police had seized the pump-action shotgun. He later purchased a Ruger AR-556 in September, which was also used during the shooting. Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears has since faced sharp criticism for choosing not to pursue court hearings that could have prevented Hole from accessing the guns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/police-indianapolis-fedex-shooter-not-racially-motivated/articleshow/84840434.cms||---

Spikes in infections due to a Delta variant of the virus have ramped up concerns about returning to offices, prompting Google to extend its global work-from-home option through October 18, according to chief executive Sundar Pichai. "Anyone coming to work on our campuses will need to be vaccinated," Pichai said in a blog post. "We're rolling this policy out in the United States in the coming weeks and will expand to other regions in the coming months." Implementation of the policy will be adapted to local conditions, including vaccine availability, according to the Silicon Valley based tech titan. "I hope these steps will give everyone greater peace of mind as offices reopen," Pichai said. "Seeing Googlers together in the offices these past few weeks filled me with optimism, and I'm looking forward to brighter days ahead." Google was among the tech companies that abandoned campuses early last year, letting people work remotely rather than risk exposure to Covid-19 in offices. Google has been paying the salaries of campus workers unable to do their jobs because of closed offices, and helping employees get access to vaccines, according to Pichai "Even as the virus continues to surge in many parts of the world, it's encouraging to see very high vaccination rates for our Google community in areas where vaccines are widely available," Pichai said. "This is a big reason why we felt comfortable opening some of our offices to employees who wanted to return early."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/google-requires-employee-vaccinations-pushes-back-reopening/articleshow/84840625.cms||---

Chandrayaan-3 is a lander-and-rover-specific mission that will land on the lunar surface as the orbiter of Chandrayaan-2 is already functional and taking images 100km from Moon’s orbit. In a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha, Jitendra Singh said the realisation of Chandrayaan-3 was in progress as the work was earlier hampered due to the pandemic. “However, all works that were possible in work from home mode were taken up even during lockdown periods. Chandrayaan-3 realisation resumed after commencement of unlock period and is in a matured stage of realisation,” Singh said in his reply to the LS. The minister said the realisation of Chandrayaan-3 involves various processes, including finalisation of configuration, subsystems realisation, integration, spacecraft-level detailed testing and a number of special tests to evaluate the system performance on Earth. Chandrayaan-3 mission, which is critical for Isro as it will demonstrate India's capabilities to make landings for further interplanetary missions, was earlier scheduled for launch last year. However, the lockdown-triggered Covid restrictions in Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, where the key Isro centres are situated, delayed the mission by a year. Now, the lunar mission launch, scheduled for this year, is deferred again till next year. Chandrayaan-2, aimed at landing a rover on the unchartered south pole of Moon, was launched on July 22, 2019. However, lander Vikram hard-landed on September 7, 2019, crashing India's dream to become the first nation to successfully land on the lunar surface in its maiden attempt. Learning from its past mistakes, Isro now plans to achieve its lunar landing dream with Chandrayaan-3 mission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-curbs-delay-chandrayaan-3-mission-by-one-more-year-launch-likely-during-third-quarter-of-2022-minister/articleshow/84840833.cms||Surendra Singh
---||India||Withdrawal of 'general consent' can't stop CBI graft probe against central staffers: HC||KOLKATA: Withdrawing "general consent" by states to CBI can’t deter the agency from probing corruption charges against central government officers, the Calcutta high court held on Wednesday. Justice Tirthankar Ghosh, in his 30-page order, said “offenders under the Prevention of Corruption Act are to be dealt with equally”. The HC said central officers may be posted in different states and they cannot be “distinguished and/or discriminated” because their offices are in different states. The court further said they must be “hauled up for corruption in similar manner uniformly throughout the country”. On Wednesday, the HC refused to “interfere” with the CBI probe in the illegal coal mining and cattle smuggling cases, in which Vinay Mishra — a former TMC youth leader — has been implicated, saying there was no “illegality committed” by the CBI probe. The court turned down Bengal’s plea, saying the September 2020 FIR lodged by CBI — two years after the state withdrew consent for all CBI probes in Bengal — isn’t applicable in this case as the officers implicated in the FIR are all central officers. The CBI FIR in these cases were against BSF and customs officials. The HC said withdrawal of consent may be applicable to “cases where exclusively the officers belonging to the state government are involved”. The court also held that the central government’s area of operation can’t be curtailed by any central or state legislation. Mishra, now a citizen of Vanuatu, is likely to move the Supreme Court. The judge said if the central government or CBI is probing “acts and omissions” of its own officers (in relation to illegal coal mining and cattle smuggling cases), it can’t be interfered with by the state even if the offences were committed within its territory. Mishra’s counsels Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Ayan Bhattacharjee had argued that CBI did not have jurisdiction to investigate and initiate any case within Bengal after the latter withdrew consent. The state had earlier revoked general consent through a gazette notification of November 16, 2018. Bengal AG Kishore Datta argued that CBI registered the FIR last November and that it was “in excess of its jurisdiction and authority”. It was argued that while the alleged illegal mining was taking place in areas outside “railway siding area”, the place of recovery for “coal theft” was at Pandabeswar railway siding. YJ Dastoor and Phiroze Edulji, appearing for CBI, argued that if the state has withdrawn consent for investigation of cases, it cannot be withdrawn for railway areas where the alleged coal theft took place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/withdrawal-of-general-consent-cant-stop-cbi-graft-probe-against-central-staffers-hc/articleshow/84840587.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||India||18 migrants dead as truck collides with stranded bus in UP||LUCKNOW: At least 18 migrant laborers were crushed to death while they slept while 25 were critically injured, when a speeding truck rammed into a stationary double-decker bus in Ramsanehi Ghat area of Barabanki, a few hours after Tuesday midnight. The bus, stuffed with 140 laborers, was on its way from Ludhiana to Bihar when it broke down in the dead of night on NH-28 on the Barabanki-Ayodhya stretch. With the air-conditioning not working and windows sealed, many passengers got off the stranded bus and dozed off on the road while the driver scrambled to fix a broken axle. An hour later, a truck moving at high speed collided head-on with the bus, crushing passengers asleep on the road and leaving the vehicle in a mangled heap. The Bihar-bound laborers were employed in factories in Ludhiana, Punjab, and in Hisar, Haryana. While 11 died on the spot, seven were declared dead at the district hospital. The identities of two are yet to be ascertained. Eleven of the injured were taken to the Trauma Centre, Lucknow, Barabanki SP Yamuna Prasad said. President Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar expressed grief at the loss of life. The PM announced Rupees 2 lakh compensation for the kin of the deceased and Rupees 50,000 for the injured. Modi also called Adityanath to enquire about relief operations. The CM directed cabinet ministers to reach the hospital and oversee medical aid. Nitish Kumar condoled the deaths and announced Rupees 2 lakh ex-gratia for the kin of each of the deceased. Police said the drivers of the bus and truck were on the run. "The owner and the manager of Rishabh Travels, which runs the air-conditioned bus, and the drivers of both vehicles have been booked for death by negligence, rash driving, and under sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act and Disaster Management Act," said SP Barabanki. Mishri Lal (50), who survived the crash, told reporters he was asleep inside the bus when the accident happened. "I woke up to see passengers tossed onto the bus floor. When we managed to extricate ourselves from the wreckage, we saw dismembered bodies strewn along the road and the injured crying in pain. We tried to stop passing vehicles, but to no avail. Then we blocked the highway with bodies, triggering a gridlock. It was then that a passerby called police," he said. The complainant in the case, passenger Falgun Sahni (30) of Sitamarhi, said the bus was overloaded and the driver had sought money from the passengers for the repair of the axle. After police received the SOS, senior police and district officials rushed to the spot to launch rescue operations. Barabanki DM Adarsh Singh supervised the rescue operation and arranged buses to Bihar for the other passengers. "We formed a panel of doctors to conduct autopsies and simultaneously send the bodies to Bihar," he said. BSP supremo Mayawati asked the government to provide free treatment to the injured and send the bodies home at government expense. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, too, appealed to the government to ensure treatment of the injured and sent party functionaries to visit them in hospital. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi urged party workers to provide aid to the accident victims. Eyewitness accountNeeraj Kumar (18) of Sitamarhi said he and his friends got on the bus in Ludhiana, but when it reached Hisar, the conductor stopped the vehicle midway and forced us into the ill-fated double decker bus standing nearby. Another injured person, Shambhu (29) of Madhubani, said passengers were forced to spread sheets and sleep on the road as it was stifling inside the bus with the windows sealed. "When it began raining, some of them took shelter under the bus," he said. Helpline numberBarabanki police has issued a helpline number — 9454417464 — for any queries about the dead and injured. The deceased who were identified include Suresh Yadav (35) of Madhepura, Indal Mahato (25), Gagandev (35), Rajdev Mahato (60), Monu Sahni (30), Jagdish (40), Naresh (37), Shanishchar (50) and Mastram Mandal (60) from Sitamarhi, Sikandar Mukhiya (40) and Akhilesh Mukhiya (30) of Saharsa, Jai Bahadur (40), Baijnath Ram (55) and Balram Mandal (55) from Supaul, and Santosh Singh (30) and Bauwa (30) from Araria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/18-migrants-dead-as-truck-collides-with-stranded-bus-in-up/articleshow/84841239.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

The PhD scholar is covering a distance of over 200km on foot to reach the apex court with a petition to “reclaim his honour” after his name figured, inaccurately, on a list of thousand people allegedly converted to Islam by two Delhi-based Muslim clerics. While Kumar was given a clean chit by the UP ATS last month, those in his village were relentless in their persecution of the distraught man. The self-proclaimed “Hindu nationalist” who has written books on PM Modi and UP CM Yogi Adityanath has been facing social boycott and constant threats. “I want the country to know what I am going through,” he told TOI on Wednesday, days after he woke up to find “terrorist” written on his door. On Tuesday, Kumar embarked on his “protest march” with a backpack. By Wednesday evening, he had walked 32km and reached Muzaffarnagar. He will spend the night at a railway station before starting again at dawn. The 32-year-old hopes to complete his journey in 11 days. The ATS had knocked on Kumar’s door on June 23, looking for ‘Abdul Samad’ after the leaked list of alleged converts had a certificate with Kumar’s picture and information on it. It said that Kumar had converted to Islam and was now Samad. The case being pursued is against the chairperson of Islamic Da’wah Centre (IDC) Mufti Kazi Jahangir Qasmi and Mohammed Umar Gautam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/man-walks-200km-to-supreme-court-to-prove-he-hasnt-converted/articleshow/84840959.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||India||To speed up justice, Supreme Court fixes strict time limits for arguments||NEW DELHI: The decades-long exasperating wait for commoners in labyrinthine queues for justice forced the Supreme Court on Wednesday to take the first step towards allocating strict time schedule, as practiced by the supreme courts of the US and the UK, with a warning that violation of time limits would result in automatic indefinite adjournment of hearing. A bench of Justices Sanjay K Kaul and R S Reddy allotted 30 minutes each to senior advocates A M Singhvi and Arvind Datar appearing for petitioner Yatin Oza, one hour to Gujarat HC counsel Nikhil Goel and 15 minutes to a intervenor represented by senior advocate C S Sundaram. Oza has challenged a Gujarat HC decision to strip him of senior advocate designation finding him repeatedly making vituperative comments against judges and the judiciary, The case has been pending for nearly a year before the SC and has reached a stalemate with the HC refusing to reconsider — even with the SC’s prodding — its decision to strip Oza of the senior advocate designation. The HC conveyed to the SC that in its June 20 Full Court meeting it has reiterated its decision, refusing to show leniency to Oza. Preparing the case for final hearing, the bench said it would not permit the counsel for parties to go on arguing for days. “How do we justify the pendency of decades old cases and then devoting hours and hours together to hear arguments from senior advocates in current cases? Even in the UK or the US Supreme Courts, we do not think there is any system which permits lawyers to argue for hours together”. Justice Kaul said, “In the US Supreme Court, the counsel are permitted only to cite judgments and not read it. But, here the advocates cite 20 judgments for each proposition and try to make good their argument by reading all 20 judgments”. The bench told the counsel that they must choose the best of the judgments suiting their propositions and cite one judgment per proposition. There is a common trend in the SC where the lawyers tell the judges that he would take 10 seconds by the clock in putting a submission. However, more often than not the 10 seconds stretch to 10 minutes. Singhvi said, “For nine months he has been stripped off the senior designation, which itself is an adequate punishment for the misdemeanour. The petitioner has learnt a permanent lesson.” The bench said that it would consider his petition whether the HC imposed punishment was appropriate or not.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/to-seep-up-justice-supreme-court-fixes-strict-time-limits-for-arguments/articleshow/84841391.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Authorities say there is no known motive for the violence and that the shooting Monday appeared to be "an unprovoked attack."  The teens were found by theater workers cleaning up after the 9:35 pm showing of the violent horror movie at The Crossings mall in Corona, southeast of Los Angeles. Rylee Goodrich was fatally shot, and Anthony Barajas remained on life support Wednesday. Barajas, known online as itsanthonymichael, has nearly a million followers on TikTok and more on other platforms.  The suspect, 20-year-old Joseph Jimenez, was booked Tuesday night on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and robbery. He is being held on $2 million bail.  A firearm that matched the caliber of the weapon used in the shooting was found at his home. It was not immediately clear if he had an attorney who could speak on his behalf.  Investigators say there was the small audience for that showing of the movie.  "I'm being told right now there were six tickets purchased for that movie showing," Officer Tobias Kouroubacalis told KABC-TV.  "We're asking for anyone who might have been inside that movie, or a theater adjacent to that, for any information at all," Kouroubacalis said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/1-arrested-in-shooting-that-wounded-tiktok-star-killed-teen/articleshow/84841950.cms||---
---||India||Mamata Banerjee meets Sonia Gandhi, pitches for unified opposition to take on BJP||NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee met Congress president Sonia Gandhi at her residence on Wednesday, for the first time since the two parties fought as rivals in the assembly elections, as the Trinamool chief said there will be efforts for unified opposition to take on BJP. The meeting between the two leaders is a part of Banerjee’s series of outreach meetings in the national capital, including those with Congress leaders Kamal Nath, Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Anand Sharma a day before. “It was a very good meeting,” Banerjee said after the visit to 10 Janpath. Opposition leaders were likely to meet after Parliament’s monsoon session, she said, hoping for “a positive outcome”. The comments are significant as Mamata’s ties with Sonia have been frosty for long, with the CM often accusing Congress of acting in a provocative manner. Ahead of the 2019 election, she had said as much to Sonia during a chance meeting in the Central Hall of Parliament. Congress sources said Sonia and Mamata had “free and fair discussions” on all issues in the country and issues inside Parliament. They also discussed how institutions were under attack under the Modi government. Sources said the two leaders share personal equations and this resulted in a meeting where no decisions were taken. “I am not a political astrologer,” the Bengal CM said when asked whether she would lead a coalition of opposition parties. “It depends on the situation, structure. I have no problem if someone else leads (it). I can’t impose (my will),” she added. “I have a sweet home in Bengal. I will stay there and do not plan to shift to Delhi now,” Banerjee said adding: “I am nothing alone, everyone has to unite. I am not a leader but a cadre… a person on the street”. Rahul Gandhi was also present at the meeting at 10, Janpath. Describing the meeting as “very positive”, Banerjee said she discussed the present political situation in the country, the Covid situation as well as opposition unity with the Congress leadership. Banerjee said she met Sonia Gandhi because she had invited her for tea at her residence. “Rahul Ji was also there during the meeting. We discussed the country’s political situation in general.” On the Pegasus snooping issue, she said, “The snooping controversy and the Covid situation also came up for discussion with Sonia Gandhi. The government should reply on this issue in Parliament.” Asked about PM Narendra Modi’s allegation that opposition parties were not allowing Parliament to function, Banerjee said, “Why does the government not answer our question on the Pegasus controversy? If debates and discussions won’t happen in Parliament, then where would they take place?” She said “Khela Hobey”, the TMC campaign line used in the Bengal polls, will now go national and “the game is still on”. “Khela hobey, aaj Parliament mein… phir pura desh mein khela hobey,” she said. Challenging the PM and BJP, Banerjee said the 2024 Lok Sabha elections will see Modi pitted against the entire country. Asked whether opposition parties will campaign together for the coming round of assembly polls, she said the strategy would be chalked after the monsoon session. On how the opposition will counter PM Modi’s popularity, Banerjee said, “There were days when Modi was popular, you will see today if there is a survey it is not the same. Bodies have been floating in Ganga… no last rites were performed we believe in the dignity of the dead as much as dignity in life. you think those who were affected by this will vote for him?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//web-stories/india/mamata-meets-sonia-pitches-for-unified-opposition-to-take-on-bjp/articleshow/84841672.cms||Mohua Chatterjee

Healthcare experts feel that containing the breakthrough (infection of vaccinated people) infection, strengthening of enforcement activities, checking cluster spread through micro containment and protecting the 0-18 age group of people are ways forward to reduce the impact of the second wave and rule out the possibility of a third one. Throughout July, the city has been adding more than 300 cases daily. On Wednesday, however, it reported 182 new infections against 175 recoveries. This took the active cases to 2,062. The city accounts for close to half of Khurda’s 4500 active cases. “We need to ensure that the floating population of the city doesn’t spread the infection. Most importantly, the fully vaccinated people should not lower their guard,” Ajay Parida, director, Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), said. On Wednesday, the state added 1703 new Covid cases registering a test positivity rate of 2.16, down from 2.59% a day earlier. The government also confirmed 69 more Covid deaths taking the toll to 5,703.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/high-daily-cases-worry-capital-despite-72-popn-vaccinated/articleshow/84841059.cms||---

Floor leaders of 14 opposition parties in both Houses met under the chairmanship of Mallikarjun Kharge and reiterated their demand. They also stood by Rahul Gandhi in a joint press briefing to send out a signal of unity which the Congress leader said “was not going anywhere”. “Pegasus is about nationalism, about treason. For me, it (snooping) is not an issue of privacy. It is an anti-national act. Modi and Shah attacked the soul of democracy of India. That is why we will not discuss anything before Pegasus.” BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra immediately hit out at the Congress leader. “You (Rahul Gandhi) are saying that a doctored motive (Pegasus) is important for us, not Covid. You are playing with the lives of people. You are suppressing the voices of people,” the BJP leader said. The Opposition was unfazed about prospect of the session being washed out. Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut said washout of a parliamentary session was nothing new and his party was with BJP when it blocked Parliament, in a reference to the demand for JPC over 2G scam – a point Trinamool Congress had highlighted on Tuesday. The heightened tempers put a serious cloud over the monsoon session which has in its first week been a non-starter over Pegasus as well as farmers’ protest. Briefing reporters after the meeting, Rahul Gandhi said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah needed to respond if they ordered Pegasus. “It’s a weapon which should be used against terrorists and anti-nationals. We ask Modi and Shah why did you use this weapon against the democratic institutions of India. That is the question,” he said. Reacting to Rahul Gandhi’s claim that a “weapon” has been inserted in his phone, Patra asked why the Congress leader was not filing an FIR. “There is no substance in his claim. Rather, Congress is using a hypothetical issue as a weapon to stall Parliament,” Patra said. “Anyone who tries to prevent such a debate is striking a blow to the country... It is anti-national to not discuss the issue on the floor of Parliament,” he said. Patra mocked at claims of opposition unity, saying, “Rahul Gandhi is saying that the opposition is united. A similar picture came out before 2019 Lok sabha polls, but everyone knows the outcome of the alliance. All parties in the alliance think about their own families… their only motive is survival of their own families.” The BJP spokesperson said Akhilesh Yadav, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra never want a “golden phase” in India. “All of them want their children to be settled in politics whereas our Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to lead India to the path of development,” he said. TR Baalu, Kanimozhi (DMK), Manoj Jha (RJD), Praful Patel, Supriya Sule (NCP), Ram Gopal Yadav (SP), NK Premachandran (RSP), Binoy Viswam, ET Basheer, Sanjay Singh (AAP), Jairam Ramesh, Anand Sharma, Manickam Tagore (Congress) were among those who attended the meeting. TMC did not attend the deliberations. Jairam Ramesh said it was because TMC MPs were preoccupied with a meeting called by party chief Mamata Banerjee and had informed about it. While Baalu said “democracy is in peril”, the bloc slammed the government for “malicious propaganda” that opposition was not allowing discussion in Parliament, saying it was the government which was running away from debate on Pegasus. Rahul said “people will have to understand” that if the opposition agreed to start discussion on any other issue, “Pegasus would be over”. He said, “I ask the youth, Modi has put a weapon in your telephones. This weapon was used against me, against the Supreme Court, other leaders, journalists, activists, it has been used against India. Why should it not be discussed in Parliament?” Sena’s Raut said, “We have been stabbed in the back.” Sule said, “They compromised national security, and they did not spare the wife and children of their own ministers. I condemn them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/opposition-insists-on-pegasus-debate-bjp-decries-manufactured-matters/articleshow/84842020.cms||---

Reflecting the growing consensus, both in the Supreme Court and Parliament, that acts of destruction of public and private property in the name of protests should not be tolerated, a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah firmly rejected the Kerala government's decision to approve an application by the Thiruvananthapuram public prosecutor to withdraw a 2015 case registered against a few MLAs belonging to the Left parties who, while in the opposition, had damaged public property inside the House during a protest against the presentation of the budget by the UDF government. On March 13, 2015, when the state finance minister was presenting the annual budget, the MLAs in question damaged furniture and articles, including the speaker’s chair, computer, mic, emergency lamp and an electric panel, amounting to a loss of Rs 2,20,093. Following this, and at the behest of the legislative secretary of the assembly, police had registered cases against the MLAs for various offences under sections of the IPC and under the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984. Police filed a chargesheet and the chief judicial magistrate took cognisance of it. However, after the victory of LDF in the next elections, the Pinarayi Vijayan government called for withdrawal of prosecution citing privilege and immunity of MLAs. Upholding the decisions of the trial court and the Kerala High Court to reject plea for withdrawal of prosecution, the SC bench said , "Privileges and immunities are not gateways (for MPs/MLAs) to claim exemptions from the general law of the land, particularly as in this case, the criminal law which governs the action of every citizen. To claim an exemption from the application of criminal law would be to betray the trust which is impressed on the character of elected representatives as the makers and enactors of the law." Times ViewMPs and MLAs represent the people and have every right to be heard in a democracy. But rowdy and unruly behaviour is itself undemocratic in nature and often stalls the democratic process. People’s representatives are not above the people and shouldn't get a free pass to indulge in unacceptable behaviour inside the House. This is a welcome decision.Writing the 74-page judgment, Justice Chandrachud said, "The entire foundation upon which the application for withdrawal under Section 321 was moved by the public prosecutor is based on a fundamental misconception of the constitutional provisions contained in Article 194. The public prosecutor seems to have been impressed by the existence of privileges and immunities which would stand in the way of the prosecution. Such an understanding betrays the constitutional provision and proceeds on a misconception that elected members of the legislature stand above the general application of criminal law." The bench analysed the object and purpose behind "privileges, immunity and free speech" conferred on MPs and MLAs and said, "The purpose of bestowing privileges and immunities to elected members of the legislature is to enable them to perform their functions without hindrance, fear or favour... It is to create an environment in which they can perform their functions and discharge their duties freely that the Constitution recognises privileges and immunities. These privileges bear a functional relationship to the discharge of the functions of a legislator." Read AlsoPrivileges bestowed upon elected members of legislature not mark of status: SCPrivileges bestowed upon elected members of the legislature are not a “mark of status” which makes them stand on an unequal pedestal, the Supreme Court said on Wednesday."In the same manner as any other citizen, they (the MPs/MLAs) are subject to the boundaries of lawful behaviour set by criminal law. No member of an elected legislature can claim either a privilege or an immunity to stand above the sanctions of the criminal law, which applies equally to all citizens. The purpose and object of the Prevention of Damage to Public Properties Act, 1984 was to curb acts of vandalism and damage to public property including (but not limited to) destruction and damage caused during riots and public protests", it elaborated. It agreed that the right to freedom of speech and expression of elected representatives inside the House, included their right to protest, but said it did not extend to destruction of property. "Committing acts of destruction of public property cannot be equated with either the freedom of speech in the legislature or with forms of protest legitimately available to the members of the opposition." On the Kerala case, the bench said allowing withdrawal of prosecution against the MLAs after chargesheet had been filed and had been taken cognisance of by the court "would amount to an interference with the normal course of justice for illegitimate reasons. Such an action is clearly extraneous to the vindication of the law to which all organs of the executive are bound." Read AlsoSupreme Court adopts UK view to loosen privileges and immunity of MPs, MLAsThe Supreme Court took a leaf out of the experience of House of Commons in the UK and the non-enactment of law defining the contours of privileges and immunities to open a chink in the constitutional shield from prosecution for MPs and MLAs for criminal acts inside the House."The members of the state legislature have in their character as elected representatives a public trust impressed upon the discharge of their duties. Allowing the prosecution to be withdrawn would only result in a singular result, which is that the elected representatives are exempt from the mandate of criminal law. This cannot be countenanced as being in aid of the broad ends of public justice," it said. Justices Chandrachud and Shah said acts of vandalism cannot be said to be manifestations of the freedom of speech and be termed as "proceedings" of the assembly. "It was not the intention of the drafters of the Constitution to extend the interpretation of ‘freedom of speech’ to include criminal acts by placing them under a veil of protest. Hence, the Constitution only grants the members the freedom of speech that is necessary for their active participation in meaningful deliberation without any fear of prosecution," they added. Immunities and privileges conferred constitutionally on elected representatives are not marks of status for MPs and MLAs to make them stand on an unequal pedestal, said the bench. "The recognition that there shall be freedom of speech in Parliament and the state legislatures underlines the need to ensure the existence of conditions in which elected representatives can perform their duties and functions effectively. Those duties and functions are as much a matter of duty and trust as they are of a right inhering in the representatives who are chosen by the people. We miss the wood for the trees if we focus on rights without the corresponding duties cast upon elected public representatives," it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/privileges-and-immunity-no-shield-for-criminal-acts-in-house-says-supreme-court/articleshow/84841962.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The signal came even as Blinken said diversity fuels US and India’s national strength and Indian democracy is powered by its free thinking citizens after a meeting with his counterpart S Jaishankar. At a roundtable with civil society, Blinken said both India and the US democracies were works in progress and that successful democracies include thriving civil societies. “That’s how citizens become more fully engaged in the life of their communities.

Singh, who was showcaused by Congress the previous night, expressed regret over his statements, and Singhdeo returned to the assembly. With this, the storm in Chhattisgarh Congress seems to have blown over. Last Sunday, Singh had alleged a threat to his life and demanded Singh Deo’s removal as minister after some youths intercepted a vehicle in his convoy, smashed its windscreen and abused security personnel. BJP benches brought the assembly to a standstill for two days, demanding a probe by a House committee. Amid the bedlam, Singhdeo had walked out of the assembly on Tuesday, saying it wouldn’t be “justified to be present in this House until the government gives a clear reply on the issue”. When the House convened on Wednesday, Brihaspati Singh said his remarks were “an emotional outburst”, and that he “expressed regret if his statement had hurt anyone”. Home minister Sahu then said Singh’s allegations against the health minister were baseless. Singhdeo had no involvement in the incident where a youth abused security personnel of a legislator at Ambikapur town on Saturday, he said. It was only after Singh’s regret and Sahu’s clarification that Singhdeo returned to the house on Wednesday afternoon, ending the stalemate in the monsoon session.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/singh-deo-returns-to-house-after-mlas-regret-home-min-reply/articleshow/84832280.cms||---

In Himachal, nine people died while several were reported missing following flash floods in Kullu, Lahaul-Spiti and Chamba districts on Tuesday night and early Wednesday. The remote village of Honzar in Kishtwar is a three-hour walk from the nearest road, but rescue teams from the Army, police and SDRF swung into action and reached the spot in time to save many lives. Officials said the cloudburst struck Honzar village around 4.30 am. Seventeen people injured in the incident were rescued while over 20 people are still missing, Kishtwar district development commissioner Ashok Kumar Sharma said. Referring to similar incidents in other parts of the district, Sharma said two cloudbursts struck the remote Lambard area the previous night, but no loss of life was reported. He said 60 families were evacuated from the Paddar area in the wake of incessant rain. Flash floods were reported in Machail, Paddar and Bunjwah in Kishtwar. Commandant General V K Singh of the SDRF said, “One of our SDRF teams from Kishtwar has reached the affected village and two more teams are on their way from Doda and Udhampur districts. Two SDRF teams are waiting for the weather to improve to be airlifted from Jammu and Srinagar to join the rescue mission.” He said an NDRF team from Ludhiana is also on the way to Kishtwar. Jammu-based defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said, “Two Army columns have been mobilised to assist the civil administration in the rescue operations.” Union minister and local MP Jitendra Singh said he had spoken to the DM and Air Force authorities and asked them to airlift the injured as and when required. In Himachal’s Lahaul, ten people, including four BRO employees, were washed away following a flash flood in Tozing nullah on Tuesday night. Seven bodies have been recovered while three are still missing. Four persons, including one tourist from Ghaziabad, were reportedly swept away in the flash flood in Brahmaganga rivulet in Kullu’s Manikaran valley. All are still missing. One JCB helper too was washed away in the Chamba district and another person fell off a cliff. They were identified as Sunil Kumar and Nikku, residents of Chamba. According to officials, a cloudburst in Tozing nullah in Lahaul washed away two tents of labourers and three vehicles — one was a BRO JCB trying to pull out the vehicles. “Two people were injured and one of them was referred to Kullu hospital. Seven bodies were recovered from the debris. We had sought help from NDRF, while our disaster management, BRO, police and ITBP teams are already engaged in the rescue operation,” Lahaul-Spiti deputy commissioner Neeraj Kumar said. The deceased were all from the Mandi district. One body is still unidentified while part of a body has been recovered from the debris. Another cloudburst in Brahmaganga rivulet near Manikaran in Kullu district wreaked havoc on Wednesday early morning, with floodwater entering residences. Heavy rains triggered flash floods and landslides, blocking a large number of roads in the state. The Manali-Leh highway was blocked in many places. So was Keylong-Kishtwar road, Chandigarh-Manali national highway, Mandi-Kullu bypass road and the Manali-Rohtang highway. In Kullu, three vehicles got hit by debris as torrential rains triggered flooding of the local nullah in Loran. In Lahaul-Spiti district, a major bridge at Jahlma village in Lahaul has washed away and most of the nullahs were in spate. Many roads, including Gramphu-Kaza and Darcha-Shinkula stretches, were blocked due to landslides at multiple places. A landslide at Karting village trapped nearly 50 vehicles. Another was reported from Hawai Mod on Tandi-Udaipur road. Jahalma nullah, Shaks nullah, Changut and Udgos nullah and Mooning nullahs witnessed flash floods that washed away vehicles, roads and agricultural land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/7-killed-in-jk-cloudburst-several-missing-9-die-in-hp-flash-floods/articleshow/84842239.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||Infrastructure talks leave Biden’s entire agenda at risk||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden’s latest leap into the Senate’s up-and-down efforts to clinch a bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure deal comes with even more at stake than his coveted plans for boosting road, rail and other public works projects. The outcome of the infrastructure bargaining, which for weeks has encountered one snag after another, will affect what could be the crown jewel of his legacy. That would be his hopes for a subsequent $3.5 trillion federal infusion for families’ education and health care costs, a Medicare expansion and efforts to curb climate change. Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., will need support from every Democratic moderate and progressive to push the $3.5 trillion bill through the 50-50 Senate, with Vice President Kamala Harris’ tiebreaking vote. If the infrastructure talks implode, it may be harder for moderates — who rank its projects as their top priority — to back the follow-up $3.5 trillion plan, which is already making them wince because of its price tag and likely tax boosts on the wealthy and corporations. “I would say that if the bipartisan infrastructure bill falls apart, everything falls apart,” West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, one of his chamber’s most conservative Democrats, warned reporters this week. That could well prove an overstatement, since moderates like him will face enormous pressure from Biden, Schumer and others to back the $3.5 trillion package, whatever the bipartisan plan’s fate. But it illustrates a balancing act between centrists and progressives that top Democrats must confront. “If infrastructure collapses, which I hope it does not, you’d have the difficulty of holding some of the Democrats” to back the $3.5 trillion bill, No. 2 House leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said Tuesday in a brief interview. Party leaders will be able to lose no more than three Democrats to prevail in the 435-member House. Bargainers narrowed enough differences that senators expected to vote as early as Wednesday evening to start debating the infrastructure measure, lawmakers from both sides said. There were still loose ends, though, and final action on the legislation is likely days away. Biden met at the White House on Tuesday with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, a leader of moderate Democrats who have been laboring to strike an infrastructure deal with GOP senators. The president also used several tweets to prod lawmakers, including one saying, “There are no Democratic roads or Republican bridges — infrastructure impacts us all and I believe we’ve got to come together to find solutions.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden and Sinema “are very much aligned on the path forward” and expressed optimism, but also said the president was “not setting new deadlines” for a deal. Several target dates for reaching an agreement have come and gone, though Schumer wants a Senate vote on a package before sending lawmakers home for an August recess. Sinema is a centrist who’s alienated some Democrats who consider her unpredictable. Illustrating that, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., told House Democrats privately Tuesday that the infrastructure accord senators are trying to complete is “crap,” according to two people who attended the session and described it on condition of anonymity. He also said the measure was being crafted by “three Republicans,” pointedly naming Sens. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sinema, they said. Moderate Democrats have long made an infrastructure deal their top priority. The bipartisanship such an accord would display plus the meat-and-potatoes spending it would bring back home have made that their goal over the separate $3.5 trillion measure for family and environmental programs. If the infrastructure talks fail, it would deprive moderates of a victory that might leave them more open to making concessions on the $3.5 trillion measure. A collapse could also trigger fresh internal Democratic fighting over how much of the infrastructure spending would be transferred to the huge domestic spending plan, and how that would affect its overall price tag. Even Republicans are divided over the infrastructure measure and what a failure of the bipartisan talks would mean as both parties eye 2022 elections in which House and Senate control are in play. Some Republicans worry that approval of a bipartisan infrastructure plan would help Democrats pass their $3.5 trillion measure by making moderate Democrats more prone to cooperate with their colleagues on that subsequent, costlier legislation. They also say supporting the infrastructure measure would let Democrats rope the GOP into sharing the blame if inflation or other economic problems take hold amid massive federal spending programs. But others say that since Republicans won’t be able to stop Democrats from passing their $3.5 trillion bill, the GOP might as well back an infrastructure agreement. That would let Republicans haul a share of its $1 trillion in popular projects back to their home states. Democrats plan to use special budget rules that would prevent Republicans from using a filibuster — a delay that takes 60 Senate votes to halt — to derail the $3.5 trillion measure. These Republicans also say passage of the infrastructure measure would make it harder for Manchin and Sinema — and moderate Democrats facing reelection in swing states, like New Hampshire’s Maggie Hassan and Arizona’s Mark Kelly — to vote for an even larger $3.5 trillion plan. “I think it puts their members more on the defensive and having to defend very, in my view, indefensible spending and taxing,” said No. 2 Senate GOP leader John Thune of South Dakota.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/infrastructure-talks-leave-bidens-entire-agenda-at-risk/articleshow/84842580.cms||---

Four others managed to escape when the aggressive pachyderm chased them. According to information, the incident took place at Dandkesra village when six persons were out for cattle grazing and while returning they encountered the giant on the way. The moment the elephant saw them, it chased down two persons and one by one and rolled them in its trunk and threw them on the ground before crushing their bones. The horrific scene left the passersby in shock. The two deceased were identified as Rambali and Lakshman. Remaining four ran for live and managed to escape. They have sustained minor injuries and were provided treatment at the hospital. The elephant also killed a buffalo calf, that was part of the livestock of these people. Forest officials said that the elephant had separated from the herd of ten pachyderms and has been frequenting in the region aggressively. Though alert was sounded among villagers not to venture out in forest, mainly after dusk, such incidents take place. The forest department team visited the spot of incident and have paid immediate relief compensation of Rs 25000 to the kin of deceased. While Raigarh has been one of the worst-affected areas with human-animal conflict, besides Korba, Jashpur, Surajpur and Koriya districts, presently there are about 35 elephants venturing in the region, making it a sensitive place for villagers to go out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/elephant-tramples-two-to-death/articleshow/84832665.cms||---

Excerpts from the interview:Where are we on the Quad? what have we accomplished with working groups?Well, first, we had the first ever leaders level meeting of the quad. That was in and of itself, very significant, because it just underscored the importance that the four countries India, the United States, Japan, and Australia attach to the quad. And what we've achieved already is bringing together four like-minded democracies in common purpose to deal with some of the most important problems and challenges facing our countries and in fact, facing the region, and even the world, starting with Covid-19. And a commitment to work together to finance, produce and distribute millions of vaccines. Has there been any progress on the vaccine front?Yeah, I think we're making we're making progress, and when the leaders get together next they'll be able to assess that. Of course, Covid-19 remains a huge challenge for for all of us. Since the first virtual leaders meeting, the second wave hit India. I'm proud that the United States was able to come to India assistance as India came to our assistance early during the pandemic, when we had real challenges. We’ve seen reports of the US proposing a digital services agreement among countries. Could you tell us a little more about it?We’re doing work in a wide variety of areas to include not just Covid-19, on the climate crisis, on infrastructure, on maritime security, as well as on emerging technologies. And that includes the digital space.

Indians have shed blood so we see it in a certain way. Can you describe the China challenge in the way you see it?For the United States, in a way as for India, it's both one of the most consequential and most complicated relationships that we have. I think we've seen unfortunately, the government in Beijing act more repressively at home and more aggressively abroad. In recent years, that posed a challenge for all of us. We see a relationship that is in parts adversarial, in parts competitive and also in parts cooperative. I think what we found is that the best, most effective way to engage China is working with other countries that are similarly situated, and that face similar challenges. India, of course, is a strong partner for the United States in this respect. US secretary of state Antony Blinken sat down for a conversation with Indrani Bagchi Do you think the era of cooperation with China is over?No. I think the relationship has different elements in it. Cooperation remains one of them, because on some issues, it's profoundly in our mutual interest to to cooperate — climate may be the best example. That's an issue that is important to all of us. As you withdraw from Afghanistan, do you think it affects the US credibility as a as a partner? Second, for 20 years, women have had a good run in Afghanistan. Do you think we are sort of leaving them to the wolves?It's been 20 years, we have to remember why we went to Afghanistan in the first place. It was because we were attacked on 9/11. We went to do justice to those who attacked us and to try to make sure that it couldn't happen again. And we've largely succeeded in that effort. Osama bin Laden was brought to justice 10 years ago, and Al Qaeda in terms of its capacity to do that again, from Afghanistan, that's been vastly diminished. It's now 20 years, a trillion dollars later and more than 4500 American soldiers who have lost their lives. Afghanistan ultimately has to be able to shape its own future. But with our support. Even as we withdraw our forces, we are staying very much engaged in Afghanistan, with a strong embassy, with programs to support women and girls, economic development, humanitarian assistance, and the security forces. We’re remaining very much engaged also, with our diplomacy, because the only resolution to the conflict in Afghanistan is at the negotiating table, not on the battlefield. Pakistan continues to support the Taliban. Are we seeing the same effect in Afghanistan today that we saw for the last 20 years?Pakistan has a vital role to play in using its influence with the Taliban, to do whatever it can to make sure that the Taliban does not seek to take the country by force. What are your priority areas with India? When do we expect a presidential visit?I can't put a date on it. But I know that President Biden will very much look forward to visiting India, and similarly to having Prime Minister Modi in the United States. But no date yet. In terms of priorities, the relationship is both so wide and so deep. There are, as we discussed today, for several hours with foreign minister Jaishankar, a multiplicity of places where we're working together. But I would say, again, we're focused on Covid. Together, we're focused on climate, on the role of emerging technologies. But also on strengthening our trade and investment relationship, bringing our scientists and technologists and innovators together, strengthening people-to-people ties. We look forward to welcoming nearly 70,000 Indian students to the United States for this next semester. So it's incredibly broad. And what we've seen over the last 20-25 years, through different administrations in both countries, is a relationship that's only gotten stronger and deeper, especially in last one year. India will probably take delivery of S-400 from Russia later this year. How would that impact US-India relations?Well, we have our laws, we will apply our laws, we shared our concerns with India, about this. But I'm not going to get ahead of myself. We'll see how things evolve in the coming months.

Are we seeing the same effect in Afghanistan today that we saw for the last 20 years?Pakistan has a vital role to play in using its influence with the Taliban, to do whatever it can to make sure that the Taliban does not seek to take the country by force. What are your priority areas with India? When do we expect a presidential visit?I can't put a date on it. But I know that President Biden will very much look forward to visiting India, and similarly to having Prime Minister Modi in the United States. But no date yet. In terms of priorities, the relationship is both so wide and so deep. There are, as we discussed today, for several hours with foreign minister Jaishankar, a multiplicity of places where we're working together. But I would say, again, we're focused on Covid. Together, we're focused on climate, on the role of emerging technologies. But also on strengthening our trade and investment relationship, bringing our scientists and technologists and innovators together, strengthening people-to-people ties. We look forward to welcoming nearly 70,000 Indian students to the United States for this next semester. So it's incredibly broad. And what we've seen over the last 20-25 years, through different administrations in both countries, is a relationship that's only gotten stronger and deeper, especially in last one year. India will probably take delivery of S-400 from Russia later this year. How would that impact US-India relations?Well, we have our laws, we will apply our laws, we shared our concerns with India, about this. But I'm not going to get ahead of myself. We'll see how things evolve in the coming months.

On July 27, TOI reported about a Mumbai doctor who had tested RT-PCR positive three times and, like the Delhi doctor, twice after being fully vaccinated. However, as reinfections can only be established through whole genome sequencing and the Mumbai doctor’s samples are still under study, the unnamed Delhi doctor becomes the first proven case. The study by Kasturba Hospital and Delhi’s CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, was on Wednesday accepted for publication the peer-reviewed medical journal ‘Frontiers in Medicine’. One of the co-authors, Dr Swapneil Parikh, said the team has coined the term “breakthrough reinfection” to mark the case. While it describes an infection that occurs roughly 15 days after taking a vaccine for it, ‘breakthrough reinfections’ highlights the Delhi doctor’s two infections — or reinfections — after full vaccination. The US centers for diseases control states the average time between reinfections is between 45 and 90 days. ICMR’s timeframe is 104 days. “However, our study established that the doctor got reinfections in 19 days,” said Dr Shastri. The doctor-patient was first infected in August 2020 and she took her vaccine shots on February 1 and March 15. The doctor-patient needed hospitalisation during her third infection, which dragged on for over 45 days. She is doing well at present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delhi-doctor-first-proven-case-to-suffer-3-covid-infections/articleshow/84842458.cms||Malathy Iyer

When the incident came to light late Tuesday night, hundreds of people stormed the houses of the accused and thrashed them before police intervened and arrested them. A police officer said the accused have been charged with sexually assaulting the girl under Indian Penal Code and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences. Police will subject the two to medical examination before taking them to court. The minor boy is said to be a relative of the assaulted girl. Sources said the child lives with her mother and paternal grandmother, and her father works in the food industry in Dubai. Since the girl’s mother was busy taking her mother-in-law to hospital in the past three weeks, she would leave the child at home or in the trusted care of neighbours. According to police, the accused who used to play in an open ground near the house saw the girl alone and sexually assaulted her over the past 10 days. The incident came to light when the child complained of pain in her private parts. Her mother took her to a hospital where investigations confirmed the assault. When the girl’s mother confronted the duo on Tuesday evening, neighbours rushed in and started attacking the accused. Acting on information, a team of police officers, including one from the women’s police station, arrived in the area and took both into custody. Jurisdictional police inspector Prabhakar Daramatti confirmed the incident and said the outcome of the medical examination of the accused will decide the next course of action. Shops and commercial establishments voluntarily downed shutters on Tuesday evening and Wednesday. Social organisations submitted a petition to the police on Wednesday, seeking “swift and quick justice” to the girl and her family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/minor-youth-held-for-sexually-assaulting-3-yr-old-girl/articleshow/84842428.cms||---

But not much progress has been made in projects listed under the plan. In December 2020, Yediyurappa announced faster Metro completion, bus priority lanes expansion, operationalisation of suburban rail to ease traffic and promotion of shared electric vehicle mobility as part of the plan. Sources said Namma Metro connectivity to Electronics City and Whitefield was planned to be achieved by December 2021 and ORR-Airport Metro by June 2024. However, the revised deadline for Whitefield Metro and Electronics City Metro is now December 2022. The deadlines for ORR Metro and KIA Metro are June 2025 and September 2025, respectively. The 7.3km Mysuru Road-Kengeri Metro, which was supposed to be completed by December 2018, is yet to be commissioned. Yediyurappa could not open this section during his tenure. At present, only 48km of Metro is operational. Yediyurappa had said the government’s target is to have 75km of the network ready by 2022 to mark the 75th Independence Day. However, this is unlikely to be achieved due to the slow pace of work. In fact, he failed to set up a war room to expedite Metro construction and improve coordination between multiple departments to reduce delays. Similarly, bus priority lanes on all 12 high-traffic density corridors were also announced. At present, such a lane is operational only between KR Puram and Silk Board on Outer Ring Road. But a formal inauguration is yet to be done. Metro work on ORR is likely to affect the bus lane on some sections since BMRCL requires 4.5m width on both sides of the median. Provision of bus lanes on major routes will reduce journey time of BMTC buses and also help maintain punctuality. This is expected to encourage more people to shift to public transport. The government, however, has not taken any steps to extend the bus lane concept to other stretches. In October 2020, the Centre cleared the Rs 15,657 crore Bengaluru suburban rail project. However, work is yet to begin on the ground. Last month, Yediyurappa said the prime minister will lay the foundation stone for the project in three months. The PM is yet to inaugurate the city’s third coaching terminal (Sir M Visvesvaraya Terminal at Byappanahalli). To promote shared electric-vehicle mobility, the government recently allowed electric bike taxis. However, it is yet to issue licences to firms. Meanwhile, other proposals like establishment of Bengaluru Mobility Management Authority (BMMA) and operation of 6,000 new BMTC buses on lease from manufacturers remain on paper. RK Misra, advisor to the government on infrastructure issues, said: “The next CM should ensure projects under the plan get completed within the stipulated deadlines. Some have been delayed because of Covid and others due to PILs. Bus lanes will be provided on roads with six or more lanes. Metro work won’t affect bus lanes on ORR, but we will allow mixed traffic in some sections where road width is less.” Sanjeev Dyamannavar, a commuter rail activist, said: “Yediyurappa made efforts to get the Centre’s approval for the Bengaluru suburban rail project and also sanctioned funds for the doubling of Yeshwantpur-Channasandra and Byappanahalli-Hosur lines. The next CM should focus on timely completion of these projects by releasing adequate funds and clearing land acquisition issues.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/smart-mobility-plan-on-slow-track-as-projects-miss-deadline/articleshow/84843313.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

The transmission rate was up from 63.4percent as of Tuesday. In total, 49.9percent of US counties have high Covid-19 community transmission rates and 16.7 percent have substantial rates, the CDC said. The CDC reversed its mask guidance policy for vaccinated Americans on Tuesday. Substantial transmission means at least 50 new cases per 100,000 people in the last seven days, while high transmission is more than 100 cases per 100,000 people over the last week. In a toughening of guidance issued earlier this month, the CDC also recommended all students, teachers and staff at schools for kindergarten through 12th grade wear masks regardless of whether they were vaccinated. US coronavirus cases have been rising due to the highly contagious Delta variant, which was first detected in India but has quickly spread and now accounts for more than 80 percent of US coronavirus cases. However, the new CDC recommendations are not binding and many Americans, especially in Republican-leaning states, may choose not to follow them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/cdc-says-nearly-67-of-us-counties-have-substantial-high-covid-19-transmission/articleshow/84843403.cms||---

He was handling the territory dispute discussions from the Mizoram side. “I was telling him we should settle things peacefully. Suddenly, a shot went off from the Assam side. Since I was on the Assam side, there was no way my men could have fired first. But when they came under fire, they replied. That is what happened.” Six Assam cops died in the firing and about 80 others were injured at the border between Vairengte in Mizoram and Lailapur in Assam that day. The area had been witnessing sporadic clashes, the last in October last year. At the end of June this year, Mizoram said Assam was encroaching on its territory in Vairengte and set up a police check post there. On Monday, that was where the conflict began. “From the other side, more than 200 Assam police personnel came to our police camp in Vairengte. We had only 20 men there. The Assam cops overpowered them, pushed them out and occupied our camp,” Ralte said. Ralte did not say if it was Mizoram police firing which killed the Assam cops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/i-was-on-assam-side-we-could-not-have-fired-1st-mizoram-sp/articleshow/84843573.cms||Chandrima Banerjee
---||India||Covid-19: Reopen schools, say academics, doctors, lawyers and parents||MUMBAI: Over 50 academicians, including professors from IIT-Bombay, IIT-Delhi and Delhi University, doctors, lawyers and parents from Maharashtra, Delhi and Karnataka, have written an open letter to CMs of their respective states, presenting a case to reopen schools. The petitioners have said there may never be a “zero-case scenario” as Covid-19 is here to stay. They have also said in addition to learning loss, children are facing mental distress, reduced social skills and losing confidence. Schools in the country have largely remained closed for 16 months, even as scientific evidence is in favour of reopening schools with all safety protocols in place, they said. Bhaskaran Raman, professor at computer science and engineering department, IIT-Bombay, said one whole academic year has been a washout for most students and if this continues for a second year, it will be a major disservice to the coming generations. Times ViewFrom all accounts, the pandemic isn’t going to disappear in the near future. Senior academics and other experts have raised significant points about reopening of schools which need to be carefully looked into by authorities.“We are already witnessing extreme dropout rates in several states. As a country, this break from schools would push us back by decades. Not just the rural and urban poor who are at loss, children from wealthy families are facing serious mental health issues too.” The signatories have suggested a plan to reopen schools in a staggered manner, starting with regions where the positivity is low. “Explore opening of pre-primary and primary sections before secondary schools, offer vaccines on priority to school staff, starting with smaller groups of students to attend once or twice a week, ensure proper ventilation,” they suggested. Meanwhile, Vijay Yewale, a member of the state’s paediatric Covid task force, told TOI one cannot compare India with other countries. A majority of the population in countries such as the UK have already developed herd immunity, he said. “While we agree with all the academic and developmental loss students are facing currently, reopening schools is a tough call to take even for the government. The task force has given all the guidelines as to how schools can be reopened, but the final decision is that of the state and the school education department,” he said. Yewale said the state is at a crucial juncture and Covid is under control, but how the third wave will turn out is unpredictable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/reopen-schools-say-academics-doctors-lawyers-and-parents/articleshow/84843133.cms||Yogita Rao

Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla met Assam chief secretary Jishnu Baruah and DGP Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta and their respective Mizoram counterparts Lalnunmawia Chuaungo and SBK Singh in the capital to review the situation in the wake of the border violence in which five Assam police personnel were shot dead. A sixth cop died of his injuries earlier in the day. The meeting was part of the Centre’s efforts to de-escalate the border conflict, first by persuading the chief ministers of the two states, who had been sparring on Twitter, to talk directly to one another and amicably resolve the dispute. The second objective was to get CMs Himanta Biswa Sarma and Zoramthanga to order their state forces to step back from the disputed stretch of the border. Sources in Assam police told TOI late Wednesday that Mizoram police were yet to vacate the area. As per the agreement supposedly reached at the meeting chaired by the home secretary, both states consented to CAPF deployment along the disturbed inter-state border and NH 306, a home ministry official said. Both state governments are required to work out an arrangement in coordination with the Union home ministry within a reasonable timeframe. The home secretary also conveyed to the Assam and Mizoram delegations that the two governments should continue talking to each other to resolve the decades-old border dispute in an amicable manner, the officials said. Assam police, meanwhile, registered a case under various sections of the Arms Act and Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984, in connection with the killing of five cops and announced a reward of Rs 5 lakh for information leading to the arrest of each of those responsible for the deaths. The police brass also flagged Mizoram Rajya Sabha MP K Vanlalvena's alleged remark in Delhi that "they are lucky we didn't kill them all". "An Assam police team, including officers of the CID, are leaving for Delhi to take lawful action relating to the conspiracy behind the incident in the light of a media interview by Rajya Sabha MP Shri K Vanlalvena, indicative of his active role in the conspiracy," said the official statement. "Assam police have already prepared a picture gallery, which is being further updated, of Mizoram police personnel and civilian miscreants who fired at them. They would be brought to law."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mizoram-police-yet-to-vacate-border-despite-delhi-meeting/articleshow/84843855.cms||Bharti Jain

Many of them lost their jobs due to the lockdown and opted to become fruit and vegetable vendors. Initially many started their new business in front of their houses, and some chose to use goods autos or pushcarts. Now, many have set up shops on pavements. They set up temporary stalls in residential areas on Gokul road, Manjunath Nagar, Deshpande Nagar, Keshwapur among others during the lockdown. Now most of these stalls are slowly becoming permanent fixtures. Farooq Shaikh, a fruit vendor in Deshpande Nagar said, “During lockdown we used to take fruits on pushcarts to many areas and people were not letting us stay in one place. But now, it has been almost two years since we started and people are not only recognising us, but also relying on us. This prompted us to setup a stall on the roadside.” Basavaraj Bendigeri, a vegetable vendor said, “I was working at clothes shop for over a decade. Post lockdown the shop owner removed me, after which I jumped into vegetable business and set up a small shop in the house. People used to buy vegetables from the house, later many suggested me to open a shop on the roadside. Since then, I am running my business in Anand Nagar.” Shakuntla Tai, a resident of Deshpande Nagar said, “Earlier we were scared of buying fruits and vegetables due to Covid-19. Gradually we started buying vegetables and fruits from the street vendors.” Construction activities According to sources, the number of street vendors in residential areas has increased recently because of construction work at Janata Bazaar. Some vendors are reluctant to go to places where authorities have set up a temporary market and this is also a reason for the increase in street vendors. HDMC commissioner Suresh Itnal said, “We know that vendors have increased at many residential areas. Officials will visit such places and allow vendors to continue their business if the roads are wide and pedestrians can walk freely. If the roads are narrow and vendors are blocking movement of pedestrians and vehicles, such stalls will be removed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/post-covid-jobless-turn-vendors/articleshow/84867470.cms||J Abbas Mulla

Brian Williams was ordered held without bond Wednesday during his initial hearing in Clark County Circuit Court at which a not guilty plea was entered on his behalf. The Clarksville man is charged with murder, arson and misdemeanor theft in connection with the death of Melody Gambetty, 67.  A judge appointed a public defender for Williams, 36, at Wednesday's hearing, but a spokeswoman for the Clark County public defender's office said Williams had not yet been assigned an attorney.  Investigators said a fire crew responding Tuesday morning to a fire at Gambetty's apartment at a Clarksville apartment complex entered and found her body on the floor. She had been decapitated and other body parts had been removed.  Those body parts were found later Tuesday in a suitcase at Williams' home, where police also discovered her identification card, credit and debit cards, according to court records, the News and Tribune reported.  Clarksville Police Chief Mark Palmer said that in his 32 years as a police officer, he had "never seen anything like this."  An autopsy will determine Gambetty's official cause of death, but police said she appears to have had stab wounds.  Investigators believe Gambetty was killed Monday and that Williams returned to her apartment Tuesday and started a fire to cover evidence.  Police said surveillance footage shows Williams entering the apartment building Monday afternoon before leaving about three hours later with two suitcases he placed in her car before driving away.  Witnesses at the apartment complex reported that a young, suspicious but polite man was going door-to-door Monday attempting to solicit "community service work," according to court records.  Clarksville is located along the Ohio River just north of Louisville, Kentucky.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/indiana-man-charged-after-womans-decapitated-body-found/articleshow/84843971.cms||---
---||India||Senior cop seeks VRS to serve Lord Krishna||GURGAON: Senior IPS officer Bharti Arora, who headed the special investigation team (SIT) into the 2007 Samjhauta Express blast and served as joint commissioner in Gurgaon before being transferred following a public spat with the then police chief in 2015, has sought voluntary retirement so that she can fully devote herself to “the devotional service of Lord Krishna”. A letter sent by Bharti, a 1998-batch IPS officer and currently posted as inspector general in Ambala, to chief secretary Vijai Vardhan and director general of police Manoj Yadava says, “My service has been my pride and passion… Now I wish to achieve the ultimate goal of life. I yearn to traverse the path shown by the holy saints like Guru Nanak Dev, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Kabirdas, Tulsidas, Surdas, Meerabai, the Sufi saints and dedicate the rest of my life in loving devotional service of Lord Shri Krishna.” Bharti (50) has requested for relief from service from August 1 under All India Service (DCRB) Rules, 1958, and a relaxation of her three-month notice period. Speaking to TOI on Wednesday, Bharti said, “I have been thinking of quitting the service for a few years and taking the spiritual route. I will work towards self-realisation and God realisation.” She insisted she had no plan to join politics and her inclination towards spirituality was the sole motive of her decision. Her husband Vikas Arora is also an IPS officer from the same batch and is posted as IG Rewari (south range). Bharti was SP (railways) when the SIT was formed to probe the February 2007 Samjhauta Express bombing in which 68 people, mostly Pakistanis, were killed near Panipat. Known as a tough cop, Bharti had both a successful and controversial stint in Gurgaon after she took charge as joint CP in 2013, winning accolades for her measures on traffic management within the city and on the expressway but also getting embroiled in a bitter faceoff with police commissioner Navdeep Singh Virk, who she accused of falsely implicating a family in a rape case and spying on her. Virk had denied the allegations. Arora was subsequently moved out of Gurgaon in 2015 and transferred thrice in a year, first as DIG (welfare and training) Panchkula and then as principal of Sports College in Sonipat before being brought back to Gurgaon as IG (state crime branch). In 2016, she was also appointed first nodal officer of the task force for cow protection that the Haryana government had set up. Her file seeking a VRS will, ironically, will be cleared by Haryana home minister Anil Vij, who in 2009 was MLA of Ambala when Bharti had ordered his arrest over a protest against the Congress government then in office for blocking a road. Vij told TOI the file is likely to be put before him shortly and a decision will be taken accordingly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/senior-cop-seeks-vrs-to-serve-lord-krishna/articleshow/84843961.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

On Tuesday, Santosh Kumari, 22, marched into the Mandawar police station with a complaint. She had driven from Sarai Kale Khan with her friends, looking for Ajmal Ahmed, 25, her partner. The two had met in Delhi at a salon where Ajmal is a hairdresser. They got close and moved in together at a house in Sarai Kale Khan. “Days ago, Ajmal left Delhi and came home. Here, he was getting married to another woman,” Mandawar SHO Manoj Kumar told TOI on Wednesday. Santosh wanted the police to help her get him back. And they did. A team of cops accompanied her as she stormed the nikah venue in the afternoon. The wedding ceremony stopped and Ajmal was brought to the police station. A group of VHP members, meanwhile, heard of the ruckus and landed at the police station. They wanted to “protect” the Hindu woman, they said.

---||India||Speaker's sanction not needed to prosecute MLAs for criminal acts: SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday erased the Speaker's discretion, often guided by party affiliation, to accord or refuse sanction for prosecution of an elected member accused of committing an offence within the House by ruling that police do not need Speaker's sanction to register FIRs for alleged criminal actions of MPs or MLAs. This ruling was given by a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah while tossing out the Kerala government's plea that without prior sanction from the Speaker, the police could not have lodged the FIR for offences under various sections of IPC and Prevention of Damage to Public Properties Act against left party MLAs in 2015 for damaging furniture and equipments during a protest against presentation of the budget by then finance minister. Scrutinising the acceptability of the Kerala government's plea, the SC distinguished its Wednesday ruling from the 1998 judgment in JMM MPs Bribery case titled 'P V Narasimha Rao Vs CBI', where it had said the Speaker's sanction was needed for prosecution of MPs for offences under Prevention of Corruption Act. In Rao's case, the SC had ruled MPs and MLAs to be public servants. The bench said sanction is required when the alleged acts of commission or omission were committed by a public servant in the course of discharge of his duties. "Moreover, even in such a case sanction is necessary when the act was while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of official duties. When no provisions warranting the sanction of the Speaker, either specific to the offence (such as the PC Act)... are enacted, the argument of the Kerala government stands on fragile grounds. For the above-mentioned reasons, the contention that the prosecution against the respondent-accused (MLAs) is vitiated for want of sanction of the Speaker is rejected," it said. Writing the judgment, Justice Chandrachud said, "The observations of the Constitution Bench (of the SC in Rao's case) regarding prior sanction were made with specific reference to Section 19 of the PC Act and cannot be construed to imply a broader proposition of law that sanction is a prerequisite for initiating a prosecution against the members of the House, in this case of the Kerala Legislative Assembly for any offences committed within the House." "The appellants (the government of Kerala and accused MLAs) have relied on P V Narasimha Rao (case judgment) to argue that the prior sanction of the Speaker, as the presiding officer of the House, is necessary to initiate a prosecution against the members of the House for the commission of an offence inside the House. We are unable to accept this submission," it said. Relying on two earlier judgments of the SC, Justice Chandrachud-led bench said, "In both these cases the Court limited its power to review so as to not interfere in the ordinary functioning and conduct of the House in pursuance of Article 122(2) which states that the Speaker’s power to regulate the proceedings and conduct of business is final and binding. It would be a stretch, however, to argue that these observations of the Court grant the Speaker a carte blanche to decide if and when criminal proceedings should be initiated against MLAs." The Kerala government also unsuccessfully attempted to premise its stand on the mandate of Section 197(1) of the CrPC to argue that the Speaker's prior sanction was essentiality for prosecuting MLAs/MPs for offences committed within the House. Section 197(1) of the CrPC states that cognizance cannot be taken for an offence allegedly committed by a public servant, who is removable with the sanction of the Government unless the sanction of the Government is received. The bench's analysis of the judgements and provisions of CrPC yielded a principle diametrically opposite to what was canvassed by the Kerala government. "A plain reading of Section 197 of the CrPC clarifies that it applies only if the public servant can be removed from office by or with the sanction of the government. However, MLAs cannot be removed by the sanction of the government, as they are elected representatives of the people of India. They can be removed from office, for instance, when disqualified under the Xth Schedule of the Constitution for which the sanction of the government is not required. Further, sanction under Section 197 is only required before cognizance is taken by a court, and not for the initiation of the prosecution," it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/speakers-sanction-not-needed-to-prosecute-mlas-for-criminal-acts-sc/articleshow/84844011.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah examined a host of judgments, including the one that questioned the withdrawal of prosecution in an Emergency-era case against then opposition politician George Fernandes, and culled out the essence of the rulings to ink a checklist. The bench said: “PP’s decision to withdraw a case required consent of the court; PP can’t withdraw a case merely on the ground of paucity of evidence, he must keep in mind the broad ends of public justice; PP must formulate an independent opinion before seeking the consent of the court to withdraw from the prosecution; initiation of withdrawal at the behest of the government would not vitiate the decision if the court is satisfied that the PP has independently applied mind on the necessity of making the application.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//web-stories/india/sc-lays-down-rules-for-public-prosecutors-to-withdraw-cases/articleshow/84844038.cms||---
---||India||Supreme Court adopts UK view to loosen privileges and immunity of MPs, MLAs||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court took a leaf out of the experience of House of Commons in the UK and the non-enactment of law defining the contours of privileges and immunities to open a chink in the constitutional shield from prosecution for MPs and MLAs for criminal acts inside the House. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said, “Since Parliament is yet to enact a law on the subject of parliamentary privileges, according to Article 194(3) of the Constitution, the MLAs shall possess privileges that the members of the House of Commons possessed at the time of enactment of the Constitution. It is thus imperative that we refer to judgments of the UK on whether criminal offences committed within the precincts of the House of Commons are covered under ‘parliamentary privileges’, receiving immunity from prosecution.” Referring to three UK judgments on criminal acts by members of the House of Commons, the bench said: “From these cases it is evident that a person committing a criminal offence within the precincts of the House does not hold an absolute privilege. Instead, he would possess a qualified privilege, and would receive the immunity only if the action bears nexus to the effective participation of the member in the House.” Articles 105 and 194 of the Constitution provide in similar terms for the privileges and immunities of Members of Parliament and MLAs respectively. Article 194(2) states: “No member of the Legislature of a State shall be liable to any proceedings in any court in respect of anything said or any vote given by him in the Legislature or any committee thereof, and no person shall be so liable in respect of the publication by or under the authority of a House of such a Legislature of any report, paper, votes or proceedings.” The bench said Article 194(2) enunciates a rule of immunity which protects a member of the legislature from a proceeding in any court “in respect of anything said or a vote given” in the legislature or in any committee of the legislature. Moreover it provides a shield against any liability for a publication of a report, paper, votes or proceedings by or under the authority of the House, it said. Kerala government argued that the 2015 incident of vandalism by MLAs occurred on the floor of the House, and hence, was a ‘proceeding’ of the House. "According to Article 194(2), no legal proceedings can be initiated against any member in respect of the publication, by or under the authority of the House, of any report, paper, votes or proceedings. Based on this, the video which recorded the incident is a publication of the proceedings of the House and no MLA can face legal action for these proceedings," it said justifying withdrawal of prosecution against accused MLAs. Moreover the Pinarayi Vijayan government argued that the video recording of the incident belongs to the House and a copy of the video footage could not have been obtained without the sanction of the Speaker, who is the custodian of the House. "In addition, the video recording lacked certification under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act 1872. Without the video recording, there is insufficient evidence available with the prosecution to succeed in a trial against the respondent accused," it said. The SC said when the Constitution was enacted, the phrase ‘publication’ was intended to mean the publication of proceedings in the printed format. "Though the video recording of the incident that was broadcast in the local and national news channels would fall within the purview of the word ‘publication’, it did not have the authority of the House to be recorded, and thus the members cannot be granted immunity," it said rejecting the state's arguments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-adopts-uk-view-to-loosen-privileges-and-immunity-of-mps/mlas/articleshow/84844035.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||World||Covid-19 rates a worry as 1 million head for Iowa State Fair||DES MOINES: With coronavirus cases rising throughout Iowa and around the nation, health experts are becoming increasingly worried about next month's Iowa State Fair, which will bring more than 1 million people to Des Moines from around the state, including many from counties with low vaccination rates and increasing prevalence of the disease.  Iowa's biggest annual event comes at a time when giant summer events will draw crowds throughout the nation, including in states that are experiencing more virus infections due to low vaccination rates and growth of the Delta variant. They range from the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota to the Minnesota State Fair, which typically draws more than 2 million people.  In Iowa, officials have encouraged people to get vaccinated, but the state's Republican-majority legislature and governor have blocked local governments from imposing vaccination or mask requirements, so there will be no limits on who can attend the fair when the event begins its 11-day run on Aug. 12.  "Unfortunately our current leadership has turned their back on science and turned their back on what's available to us to fight this pandemic and leaving Iowans struggling against what could be prevented," said Dr. Megan Srinivas, an Iowa-based infectious disease physician nationally recognized for her research, which includes COVID-19.  She said people have the misconception that being outdoors ensures safety, when the virus actually can spread in large dense crowds such as state fairs and large concert venues.  "Anytime we see a large congregation of people especially with the mixed vaccination status, we're going to see high risk for transmission and increases in transmission," she said.  In addition, the Delta variant is two to three times more transmissible than prior virus strains, creating an additional risk among fairgoers as they stand in line for food, share condiment dispensers and hop into carnival rides, Srinivas said.  The Iowa State Fair will be in Polk County, where health department spokeswoman Nola Aigner Davis expressed concern about the state's virus trends and a reluctance to get vaccinated or wear masks.  "We know what the numbers say. We know that our cases are going up. We know trends are going up. What is the safe thing to do when people can't get vaccinated? They need to wear a mask," Davis said.  Asked Wednesday if she was concerned about infections at the Iowa State Fair, Gov. Kim Reynolds didn't directly answer but advised potential fairgoers to get vaccinated and noted most people hospitalized with COVID-19 have not been vaccinated.  "So it's a decision that they've made," she said. "They've made the calculation on whether to do it or not and so I don't feel that we should punish everybody because some have made the decision not to."  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday that 49% of Iowans were fully vaccinated, ranking the state 21st in the nation. In at least 18 of Iowa's 99 counties, fewer than 40% of the population is vaccinated, and CDC data shows 35 counties with a high rate of spread and 12 counties with substantial spread of the virus.  Iowa also has the sixth-lowest testing rates in the nation among states reporting the data, which could make it difficult to pinpoint an outbreak if one occurs.  Srinivas said she's also concerned by RAGBRAI, an annual week-long bike ride across Iowa that continues through Friday, drawing about 15,000 cyclists from around the country to small towns in counties with some of the state's lowest vaccination rates.  She called it the "perfect environment for outbreaks to occur."  In South Dakota, the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally is expected to attract over 700,000 people. The event went forward last year amid the pandemic, leading to 463 infections traced among rallygoers. Many health experts labeled the event "a superspreader." Cell phone data shows that, for two weeks in August, the rally turns the normally-sleepy city of Sturgis into a travel hub comparable to a major U.S. city.  "It's sort of the perfect storm for pandemic spread," said Dr. Doug Lehmann, a doctor who runs a health clinic in Rapid City.  While South Dakota this summer has seen significantly lower case rates compared to last year, local doctors are still worried the massive crowds could lead to a fresh surge.  "This year, there's a lot of forces that are coming together to make it potentially worse (than last year)," said Dr. Jim Buchanan, a retired physician.  Only about 37% of people in Meade County -- where the rally will be held -- have been fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  In Chicago, the city's top public health officials said Tuesday that she's still comfortable with the four-day Lollapalooza music festival set to begin Thursday. Organizers are requiring attendees to show proof of full vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result, Dr. Allison Arwady said Tuesday. People attending all four days will have to be tested at least twice.  The festival - the city's largest music event - is expected to draw 100,000 people each day to Chicago's Grant Park. Those who are not fully vaccinated must wear face masks when they are attending the festival.  The Minnesota State Fair will be back starting Aug. 26 after a one-year hiatus due to the pandemic. It typically draws more than 2 million visitors during its 12-day run, which ends on Labor Day.  Nearly all of Minnesota's pandemic restrictions have been lifted, so fair officials don't anticipate daily attendance limits. As things currently stand, masks will not be required for guests but are "strongly encouraged" for anyone not fully vaccinated. Proof of vaccination will not be required. Hand sanitizer will be provided at locations throughout the 322-acre fairgrounds in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights.  Garth Brooks fans will have a chance to be vaccinated against Covid-19 when the country music star performs at Arrowhead Stadium on Aug. 7. Chiefs president Mark Donovan said Monday the team plans to take every opportunity to offer vaccinations at Arrowhead, The Kansas City Star reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/covid-19-rates-a-worry-as-1-million-head-for-iowa-state-fair/articleshow/84844110.cms||---

Lalbiaksangi said the Silchar-Aizawl stretch of NH-306, which is the lifeline of Mizoram, had been blocked by people on the Assam side at Kabuganj in the Barak Valley. She said rail tracks had been damaged at Mohammadpur and Ramnathpur stations in Assam’s Hailakandi district, cutting off the lone railroad link to Mizoram’s Bairabi. Read AlsoAssam, Mizoram CMs in heated Twitter exchange as border tensions flare upNEW DELHI: Tensions at the Assam-Mizoram border flared up on Monday with locals from Mizoram clashing with security officials from the neighbouring state. Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga shared a video on Twitter showing locals brandishing sticks in a heated standoff with the police officials. InThe landlocked state, the smallest one in the Northeast, is already facing a scarcity of essential items such as oil and rice due to the blockade. Lalbiaksangi accused Assam, which had clamped a similar economic blockade from October 17 to November 11 last year, of “taking advantage” of the fact that all routes for supply of essential commodities to Mizoram pass through that state. The Mizoram home secretary's letter to the Centre contrasted with CM Zoramthanga's appeal to rebuild the broken bridges of communication with Assam that have created multiple border flashpoints since the first failed dialogue in 1995. Posting a video on Twitter showing three Bengali-speaking youths from the Barak Valley saying how they felt safe and comfortable in Mizoram, Zoramthanga wrote, “Our Assam brethren receiving their Covid vaccines at a Local Church hall in Aizawl.

In Assam, Mizo missionaries working at Gharmurra in Hailakandi district were allegedly forced to leave the mission compound and flee to Mizoram.

Addressing the SCO defence ministers’ meet at Dushanbe, Singh said that the eight-member grouping (India, Russia, China, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan) has a “collective stake” in ensuring peace and prosperity in the region, which is threatened by “instability and violent extremism” all over again. “It is in the same spirit that India helps the people of Afghanistan, which is facing violence and devastation over decades. So far, India has completed 500 projects in Afghanistan and is continuing with some more, with a total development aid of $ 3 billion,” he said. “Peace and prosperity cannot co-exist with terrorism. Any act of terror and support to such acts, including cross border terrorism, committed by whomsoever, wherever and for whatever motives, is a crime against humanity. India reaffirms its resolve to fight terrorism in all its forms.” He reiterated the resolve of India, which with its geostrategic location is both a Eurasian land power as well as a stakeholder in the Indo-Pacific, to work within the SCO framework for the overall benefit of the region. “Our intent and aspirations are focused on the prosperity and development of the entire region. We affirm this intent through our national policy of Security and Growth for All in the Region, commonly known by the acronym ‘Sagar’,” he said. Security and stability are the most essential components to create a conducive environment for the growth and economic development of the region. India accords high priority to the consolidation of trust in the security domain within SCO as well as strengthening ties with SCO partners on the basis of equality, mutual respect and understanding, said, Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sco-must-work-for-stable-safe-region-help-afghanistan-rajnath-singh/articleshow/84844131.cms||---

State home secretary Pi Lalbiaksangi told the Union home ministry’s additional secretary (northeast) that the volatile situation could have been averted had the CRPF, a “neutral force” deployed on the border, properly performed its duties. She said the CRPF personnel deployed there “allowed” the movement of a large contingent of armed Assam police personnel “without challenging or questioning” why they were crossing the duty post towards Mizoram. Lalbiaksangi wrote that about 200 Assam police personnel, led by IGP Anurag Agarwal, reached the Mizoram police’s post at Vairengte after crossing the camp of the CRPF’s 225 battalion, located close to the site, on Monday. “They tried to forcefully occupy the duty post, stating that it is an encroachment of a forest reserve,” she said. The Assam police contingent refused to engage with the SP of Mizoram’s Kolasib district, the bureaucrat said. The team allegedly came with tents and other materials to build a camp and the convoy comprised around 20 vehicles, including ambulances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-the-aggressor-mizoram-home-secy/articleshow/84844054.cms||HC Vanlalruata

A day earlier, TMC will be sending two of its senior MPs, Derek O’Brien and Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, to the northeastern state. Bengal ministers Moloy Ghatak and Bratya Basu, along with former MP Ritabrata Banerjee, reached Agartala on Wednesday and questioned the Tripura government for the continued detention of the 23 I-PAC members. Police have slapped cases under IPC and disaster act against the I-PAC members and they are not allowed to leave their hotel. Ghatak sao9d the I-PAC members were charged with fabricated cases. “They were detained though they had tested negative for Covid-19. Now they are charged with violating the Disaster Management Act and under IPC Section 188. BJP should know that by lodging false cases, they cannot intimidate Trinamool.” Trinamool’s forays into Tripura curiously coincided with former CM Manik Sarkar, a senior CPM leader, questioning the Biplab Deb government on the detention of the I-PAC members, saying “jungle law” had replaced “rule of law” in the state and alleging that the state government was gripped by “fear psychosis”. CM Mamata Banerjee, who is now in Delhi, too questioned the continued detention of I-PAC members. “We sent some people to Tripura. They are house-arrested. If a journalist goes there, they are being threatened like this,” she said. “A team is already there. When they revert, I will send Abhishek, Derek and others,” she told reporters in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tripura-detains-23-members-of-prashant-kishors-team-tmc-says-cases-false/articleshow/84844174.cms||Debasis Konar

State police headquarters sources said central and state police forces have been deployed at strategic locations so that they can swing into action in case any Maoists’ movement is observed anywhere in the state. Sources said a banner was recovered at Lutua and a pamphlet at Madanpur, both in Aurangabad district on Tuesday, glorifying the Maoist commanders who were dead or neutralised by the security forces in the past. Surveillance around vital government installations like those of railways has been increased to repel any attempt to attack or destroy them. When asked, state police ADG (operation) Sushil Mansingh Khopde said they are monitoring the sensitive areas. “We have received some inputs about meetings being organised by the Maoists at Chakarbandha hills in Gaya,” he said. Khopde said that forces have been put on alert. The ADG said in such scenarios, the general pattern observed is that Maoists plan attack or violence towards the end of their any such week. Meanwhile, the government rail police and the railway protection force have been alerted to intensify their surveillance and patrolling on trains, especially those passing through any Maoist-affected district or area. A senior police officer said extra surveillance is in districts like Gaya, Aurangabad, Jamui and Lakhisarai. “All ten Maoist-affected districts have been alerted. We are continuously gathering intelligence inputs on their movements and activities. Each and every armed dasta of the Maoists is under surveillance. We are also alert in the six districts which were removed from the LWE list by the MHA recently,” he said. He said intelligence inputs collected are shared with Jharkhand police as well. The officer said force mobilisation took place in the Maoist-affected districts and pockets more than a fortnight back in view of their martyrs’ week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/security-forces-on-alert-as-reds-observe-martyrs-week/articleshow/84836206.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Patna district recorded 69.4mm rainfall till 5.30pm, closely followed by 59.2mm in Gaya. Light to moderate rain occurred at many places over south-central parts and at a few places over rest of Bihar. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast heavy rainfall during the next 48 hours because of the well-marked low-pressure area over south Bangladesh and adjoining north Bay of Bengal moving westwards across West Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar. It is expected that the associated cyclonic circulation extends up to mid-tropospheric levels. Sanjay Kumar, a weather scientist at Patna meteorological office, said due to the formation of low-pressure area, the southern parts of Bihar would receive heavy rainfall during the next 48-hours. “As the cyclonic circulation may advance westward, the northern parts of Jharkhand and southern parts of Bihar are likely to receive good rainfall,” he said. According to him, Bihar has recorded 17% surplus rainfall since June 1 when the monsoon reached the state. “Between June 1 and July 28, the state received 564.9mm rainfall against the normal 484.6mm. In June, the state recorded 354.3mm rainfall, registering an excess of 111%,” Sanjay said. He added: “According to the July statistics, Bihar receives near to normal rainfall but registered 210mm rainfall so far against the normal 216.1mm. In the next two days, Bihar would receive heavy rain as the southwest monsoon has become well-marked over the state.” As per the Skymet weather bulletin, the monsoon trough was running along the foothills of Bihar, resulting in isolated heavy showers in parts of the state, including Forbesganj, which recorded the maximum 277mm rainfall in the last 24 hours. Motihari recorded 70mm and Supaul 32mm rainfall during this period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/heavy-rain-likely-to-lash-bihar-during-next-2-days/articleshow/84835855.cms||Faryal Rumi

Krishna district SP Siddharth Kaushal said around 1,000 cadre from both parties were at the clash site at around 9 pm. “Prima facie evidence suggests there was provocation from the former minister and his cadre, which led to clashes. Before the situation could get out of control, police intervened and ensured the clashes stopped,” Kaushal said. Police sources say illegal mining in the forest area used to take place back in 2018 and 2019. Two forest officials were also suspended for irregularities pertaining to the alleged illegal mining. On Tuesday night, YSRC cadres came face to face with TDP workers while attending a funeral, and as tensions flared after both sides started raising slogans, the stone-pelting and clashes started. Police have booked the former minister as the main accused along with 17 others on charges of rioting, criminal conspiracy, attempt to murder and other charges, including relevant sections of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. Uma and three others were produced before the court which sent them to Rajahmundry central jail on 14-day judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/former-min-devineni-uma-17-others-arrested/articleshow/84836953.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Vijayawada||Vijayawada: Amid protests at VMC meet, tax bill approved||VIJAYAWADA: Amid high drama, the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation’s (VMC) council on Wednesday approved new tax reforms proposed by the state government. The municipal council held a short discussion on GO No. 198 at a special council meeting and stated the new order would improve the financial situation of urban local bodies. YSRC floor leader Venkata Satyanarayana proposed the bill and explained the pros of the capital value system. VMC commissioner V Prasanna Venkatesh gave a presentation on the GO and explained the procedure of calculating property tax based on the capital value. He said the GO would help in uniform taxation and reduce the burden on people residing in small houses. In his presentation, Venkatesh explained that there would be no exorbitant hike in property taxes as the new GO recommends only a limited hike every year. The TDP and CPI strongly opposed the proposal and demanded the council reject the bill. TDP floor leader N Bala Swamy and corporator Kesineni Swetha alleged that YSRC failed to fulfill its promise made during the municipal elections. Mayor Rayana Bhagya Lakshmi called for a voice vote and approved the bill. CPI(M) corporator Satya Babu started a hunger strike outside the council hall as a protest. Meanwhile, tension prevailed at the VMC office following protests by Left parties. Activists of CPI tried to block the main entry to the office. Police arrested CPI city secretary Donepudi Shankar, CPI(M) state secretariat member Ch Babu Rao and other key leaders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/amid-protests-at-vmc-meet-tax-bill-approved/articleshow/84836990.cms||Venu Lanka

These vehicles were seized recently because they were carrying illegally mined sand in violation of the state government’s rules. JPU registrar Professor R P Bablu wrote a letter to Saran DM on Tuesday, informing him about the sand-laden vehicles parked there, which has not only narrowed the main entrance of the administrative block, but create nuisance as those looking after their vehicles usually play filthy songs on the musical systems, disturbing the atmosphere. The registrar has requested the DM to make necessary arrangements to shift these parked vehicles to any other place and get the peaceful atmosphere on the university campus restored. It may be recalled that during a meeting of university officials with the local police, the registrar had suggested shifting of these vehicles behind the administrative block of the university. But no action has been taken in this regard till date, the registrar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/seized-vehicles-parked-at-jpu-create-nuisance/articleshow/84836014.cms||H K Verma

Under the Smart Meter National Programme (SMNP), 76,000 smart prepaid meters have already been installed across the city. Dilip Kumar Singh, the general manager-cum-chief engineer of the Patna Electric Supply Undertaking (PESU), which undertakes power supply work in Patna and some peripheral areas, told this newspaper on Wednesday that smart meters were being installed in a phased manner. “People, who are applying for a new power connection, are getting smart prepaid meters. Damaged meters are also being replaced with smart ones,” the PESU GM said, adding that prepaid meters were initially installed in all the apartments. Another PESU official claimed that nearly 5.2 lakh households would be covered under the SMNP by July 2022. “The work on installation of smart meters was hampered due to the Covid-19 pandemic. But now we are back on track,” he added. A prepaid electricity meter is similar to a prepaid mobile card facility where a customer buys certain units of power by making advance payment. It is also effective in reducing line loss. “Customers under the Patliputra division can register their complaints related to prepaid meters and get their queries answered on PESU’s helpline number (9264454456) from 10am to 5pm on all working days. Others can also raise complaints on the number 1912,” the official said. According to sources, as many as 23.4 lakh smart prepaid meters will be installed in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/old-meters-to-be-replaced-with-smart-ones-in-a-year/articleshow/84835675.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Business||IDBI Bank recovers Rs 733 crore dues from Kingfisher Airlines||TNN Mumbai: IDBI Bank on Wednesday said that it has recovered Rs 733 crore of dues pertaining to Kingfisher Airlines, which helped the lender report a 318% jump in net profit for the quarter ended June 2021. Announcing the first-quarter results, Rakesh Sharma, MD & CEO, said that the bank recovered Rs 278 crore by way of principal and Rs 455 crore by way of interest income aggregating to Rs 733 crore in June 2021. TOI had earlier reported that the Debt Recovery Tribunal on behalf of SBI-led consortium of banks sold shares worth Rs 792 belonging to Vijay Mallya that were confiscated by the Enforcement Directorate. This was after the consortium of lenders to Kingfisher Airlines recovered Rs 5,824 crore and Rs 1,357 crore in two different occasions by selling Mallya’s shares, which was a significant chunk of their total claim of Rs 9,900 crore from Mallya. IDBI Bank reported a net profit of Rs 603 crore for the quarter ended June 2021 as against a net profit of Rs 144 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. Sharma said that the bank expected to bring down its gross non-performing assets to below 15% by recovery, growing its loan book and by selling around Rs 11,000 crore of loans in default to the National Asset Reconstruction Company promoted by banks. The rise in profits was driven by treasury gains, recoveries, an increase in forex earnings and dividends from a subsidiary. “We expect to grow by 10% as a universal bank. We expect that the present 60:40 ratio of retail and corporate business will continue,” said Sharma. IDBI Bank is classified as a private lender after the Life Insurance Corporation acquired a stake from the government. The government and LIC propose to sell their stake in the bank to private investors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/idbi-bank-recovers-rs-733-crore-dues-from-kingfisher-airlines/articleshow/84840545.cms||---

Revealing this figure on the occasion of World Hepatitis Day on Wednesday, Dr Dineshwar Prasad, the principal of Government Ayurvedic College and Hospital (GACH), claimed that 5 out of every 100 people suffered from the disease in Bihar. “Hepatitis, which may happen due to consumption of alcohol, epilepsy drugs, and AIDS or TB medicines, can be deadly in case of late detection. It has four types — hepatitis A, B, C and E,” Dr Dineshwar said and added, “This year’s theme is ‘Hepatitis can’t wait’, which conveys the urgency of efforts needed to eliminate hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030.” Dr Santosh Kumar Vishwakarma, Dr Sunita Pandey and Dr Punam Kumari of GACH laid stress on conducting intensive tests on pregnant women for detecting hepatitis and inoculating newborns on time. “There are certain Ayurvedic medicines, which can safely treat a hepatitis patient. They purify the blood and strengthen the liver,” they suggested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-has-over-50l-hepatitis-patients/articleshow/84836209.cms||B K Mishra

JSW Cement is 100% owned by industrialist Sajjan Jindal and the unit is headed by his son Parth Jindal. The two managers will subscribe to JSW Cement’s compulsorily convertible preference shares (CCPS) worth Rs 750 crore each and will gain a 19% stake in the company after the conversion of CCPS into common equity. The conversion will be linked to JSW Cement’s future performance and valuation determined at the time of its initial public offering, which is expected in the next 12 to 18 months. The proposed transaction has been approved by India’s antitrust body. While Apollo strengthens its relationship with Sajjan Jindal through this deal, it will be Synergy Metals’s first investment in a JSW group company. Apollo along with JSW Group had acquired steel manufacturer Monnet Ispat through the bankruptcy route. Synergy Metals is founded by a former ArcelorMittal executive Sudhir Maheshwari and it mainly invests in industrial, metal and power sectors. The two PE managers will get a seat each on the board of the investee company. JSW Cement, established in 2009, will use the private equity money to ramp up capacity to 25 million tons annually from the current 14 million tons. “This is a critical time for the company in our quest to be amongst the top five cement companies in India,” said its MD Parth Jindal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/jsw-cement-raises-rs-1-5k-cr-from-pes/articleshow/84840657.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Even before the circular was issued on Wednesday, most CVCs had started offering the Bharat Biotech jab to only second-dose recipients. “The state has been receiving modest quantities of Covaxin for the past few weeks, which has led to a huge backlog of recipients whose second dose due. In view of the current stock of Covaxin in the state, you are to ensure that Covaxin is administered only to people whose second dose is due until further order,” said the circular. The Covaxin crisis had forced many KMC-run CVCs to stay shut for about four days last week while hospitals, like SSKM that inoculates 1,500 people daily, had been able to offer only about 40 Coxavin jabs a day. According to health department officials, Bengal was supposed to get about 3 lakh doses of Covaxin last week and was given the schedule of July 21, and then 23. But the vials were not delivered on both occasions. “Three days ago, the number of recipients due for Covaxin’s second dose was about 2.5 lakh across the state. After that we have received 3 lakh doses of the vaccine, which have been sent to various cold-chain points,” said a health official. The health department has also asked all its CVCs to ensure zero wastage and administer 11 doses wherever possible in case of Covishield. Government CVCs have also been asked to follow an SOP that will reduce risk of vaccine pilferage. A healthcare worker was arrested from Sonarpur last week after he allegedly stole Covishield vials from a primary health unit in Diamond Harbour to give jabs to people and charged between Rs 200 and Rs 500. In the third week of May, too, police had arrested two ASHA workers allegedly attached with KMC for pilfering vaccine from government stock and offering the jab for a price to some residents in Beliaghata. The health department has asked all government CVCs to return the used, as well as unused, vials of the vaccine to the cold-chain point (CCP) after the vaccination sessions end for the day. Cold-chain handlers (CCH) at such CCPs have been told to verify the physical stock daily. “Some lapses have been observed in following vaccination guidelines. Such lapses can lead to the risk of fraudulence and misuse of the vaccines. All CVCs need to be more stringent in observing the SOPs,” said a source at Swasthya Bhawan. Presence of at least three members of the vaccination team of each CVC at the beginning of the day’s drive has been mandated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covaxin-jab-only-for-2nd-dose-recipients/articleshow/84840474.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Private hospitals in Kolkata defer purchase of vaccine after demand dips||KOLKATA: Several private hospitals in Kolkata are deferring their vaccine requisition for August as most are left with enough stock to last a fortnight or more. Even as queues keep getting longer at government-run CVCs, the number of recipients has dropped by almost 40%-50% across Kolkata’s private hospitals over the last week. The latter had seen a consistent rush since the onset of the second wave in April. While some hospitals have seen a marginal rise in the number of Covid admissions, it has so far been an inconsistent trend, they said. While three units of AMRI administered nearly 1,800 doses a day till the third week of July, it’s now down to 1,000. AMRI CEO Rupak Barua said, “The government has been operating more CVCs where vaccines are available free and, with the Covid numbers sliding, many are deferring their first dose.” He added the hospital has around 10 days’ stock, which may last longer due to the reduced demand. “We may requisition a smaller number this time, depending on the demand over the next week,” he said. Peerless Hospital saw its number of recipients drop to 288 on Monday from 598 last Saturday. “The rush has now shifted to government-run CVCs where inoculation is free,” said CEO Sudipta Mitra, adding that numbers may not pick up till it’s time for a second dose for the 18-44 age group, which may not happen before September-October. “So, we may stagger our requisition,” he said. “In the last few days, the numbers have come down to 600 per day from 1,000, a 40% drop. With more government-run centres opening up, the load has been distributed,” said RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences zonal head R Venkatesh. At CMRI Hospital, the number of recipients has been restricted to 80-90 a day over the last week though the hospital can inoculate more than 250. “With government CVCs offering free jabs, the crowd has been diverted,” said CMRI COO Simmardeep Gill. P Tondon, CEO of Belle Vue Clinic, said they have seen a drop in jabs from 500 per day till last week to around 250 this week. “We did 2,000 vaccinations per day in June whereas we are doing 1,200 a day in July,” said Woodlands Hospital MD Rupali Basu. Queues may lengthen around late-August when it’s time for a second dose for the below-45 group, felt Barua. Some, like Peerless, have seen a rise in Covid patients this week. It now has 17 admitted while it was just five last week. At AMRI, 22 are admitted across its three units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pvt-hosps-defer-purchase-of-vax-after-demand-dips/articleshow/84840547.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

There was discontent in the Sikh community after a video showing school children and women performing folk dance for the CM in the gurdwara’s courtyard surfaced. It has been alleged that Gurbani at the gurdwara was briefly stopped during the CM’s visit on Saturday and pro-BJP slogans were also raised. Following the incident, several Sikh organisations expressed their displeasure and termed it an affront to the sanctity of the gurdwara. Many Sangats from across the hill state and from neighbouring Uttar Pradesh descended to Nanakmatta on Tuesday in protest. Subsequently, a three-member committee was sent to the area by Akal Takht, Amritsar, to resolve the matter. The committee held meetings with the officials of the Nanakmatta Sahib. Thereafter, the resignations of the officials of the gurdwara management were sought. All four officials of the gurdwara management agreed to the decision of the committee. Meanwhile, officials for the new management team were appointed through a lucky draw. This interim-management committee will be responsible for all the affairs of the gurdwara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/gurdwara-officials-resign-after-controversy-over-events-held-during-cm-dhamis-visit/articleshow/84836202.cms||Prashant Jha

Dr Mandal told this newspaper that children, who had not been vaccinated yet, were prone to getting infected during the third Covid wave. “Since keeping children confined to a hospital bed can be difficult, we decided to develop a ward along the lines of a play school. The walls painted with cartoon characters like Chhota Bheem, Doraemon, Goofy and Mickey Mouse will divert their attention,” he added. While 30 beds in the ward are reserved for Covid patients, the remaining will be used for treating children suffering for other diseases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/new-60-bed-kids-ward-inaugurated-at-igims/articleshow/84835926.cms||VK Tripathi

The proposal to open about 300 liquor stores at tourist places has been approved and preparations are on to open these shops under the control of tourism department by the end of July or first week of August. However, officials said the prohibition policy stands good and by 2024 all liquor shops will be closed in the state. Apart from opening new liquor stores, the government obtained loans to the tune of Rs 20,000 crore from financial institutions by giving a guarantee on excise revenue through an escrow account. All these decisions are contrary to the YSRC’s government’s policy of implementing complete prohibition in a phased manner. The initial plan was to reduce the number of liquor outlets by 20% every year. Later, it was decided to implement the plan in three phases by reducing 33% of shops — from 4,380 to 2,934. The reduction is supposed to be effected every second year, so that by 2024 all liquor shops would be closed, said a senior excise department official. “As we reduced the number of liquor shops by 33% in May 2020, the next round of reduction is due in May 2022. So far reduction in number of liquor shops is on track. The decision to open liquor stores at tourism places lies completely with the tourism department,” he said. Apart from opening liquor shops at tourism locations, the government has decided to relocate shops recording poor sales. Shops with less than Rs 10 lakh sales per month will be relocated to more crowded places. The tourism department has identified 174 spots to set up liquor stores along with the existing 147 locations. Bapu museum and Gunadala church in Vijayawada, Pankala Narasimha Swamy temple in Mangalagiri, Kotappakonda temple at Narasaraopet in Guntur district, and many places of worship in other districts have been included in the newly identified tourism places. The government has decided to open minimum 155 shops at the 174 locations identified. AP Tourism Authority CEO S Satyanarayana said the decision to open liquor stores was taken based on demand from tourists. “The practice has been there in the past and it is being continued as an ongoing policy,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-plans-155-liquor-shops-points-to-tourism-demand/articleshow/84837529.cms||Srikanth Aluri

He asked listed companies to adhere to better corporate governance standards through disclosures. Tyagi also highlighted the changing nature of fund raising through IPOs while speaking at industry trade body FICCI’s annual capital market summit. About the ongoing current rally in the stock market in India, Tyagi said that there was no irrational exuberance as markets were forward looking in nature. He, however, said that the market would probably be impacted once interest rates are raised, the current liquidity conditions are tightened or both. “As compared to other emerging economies, India is doing much better. For the time being it is going to sustain. For IPOs this is an opportunity to raise capital,” the Sebi chief said. He asked companies not to treat its disclosure rules as a ‘check-box exercise’. Listed companies are required to make two sets of disclosures. One, periodic disclosures, as prescribed by the regulator. Second, disclosures of material events, which could impact the stock price, should be reported. Under the second set, the company and its board are also required to disclose if they consider any event to be material. “On both these aspects, I must say, disclosures by many companies are lacking. On periodic disclosures, such as annual reports, while all the fields are being filled in, in many cases, they appear more like a check-box exercise. This is not acceptable,” Tyagi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/no-irrational-exuberance-in-mkt-says-sebi-chief/articleshow/84840757.cms||---

The incident came to light on Wednesday after Vijayawada police managed to arrest the accused with the help of their Kotwal counterparts. Two Town police said the woman, identified as Fatima (21), was reportedly struggling with psychological issues. Her father Nazeer Ahmed, who works as an imam at a local masjid, called upon the service of Vasif (25), a self-proclaimed exorcist from Sharanpur, fearing his daughter was possessed by a ghost. On July 10, Vasif proposed to Fatima that she should elope with him. The woman took around 15 sovereigns of gold from her house and fled with him, initially to Delhi and later to Sharanpur. Her father lodged a complaint with Two Town police on the same day and a missing case was registered. After his arrest, Vasif has reportedly confessed to cops that he pushed the girl into the river after taking the jewellery. As the crime happened in Uttar Pradesh, the case would be transferred to Kotwal police station for further investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/missing-woman-feared-dead-accused-arrested/articleshow/84837456.cms||---

The decision was taken following the instructions of chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy. After a survey across the state, the education department identified zilla parishad high schools that can accommodate junior colleges with immediate effect. With the chief minister keen on launching junior colleges without any delay, the education department has decided to bring them into operation from the coming academic year. New junior colleges are expected to help several students realise their dreams of pursuing higher education. A majority of the poor students from rural areas were unable to continue higher studies after the SSC due to the absence of government junior colleges in their vicinity. Many students, particularly girls, discontinue studies after the high-school level since their families cannot afford to pay the fees of private colleges. The decision of the education department to focus only on rural areas by ignoring the urban poor has come under criticism. None of the urban local bodies got an opportunity to open new junior colleges despite the presence of many slums with large populations. The children from economically weaker sections from urban slums have been the worst victims of private educational institutions due to the high free structures. With educational institutions in urban areas managed by the municipal administration department, the education department has readied the blueprint of new junior colleges by confining itself to rural areas. “It is going to be an injustice to the urban poor as 80% of the SC, ST, BC and minority community children in urban areas are living in slums with meager family incomes. There is an urgent need to open new junior colleges, at least one each, in municipal corporation cities and towns,” said S Ramakrishna, president of the Municipal Teachers Federation (MTF). He said that private colleges in urban areas were pushing the urban poor who wanted to their children to continue studies into debt traps with high fee structures. He urged the chief minister to hold a meeting on the educational needs of the urban poor and grant new colleges. Sources said the new colleges were sanctioned ensuring that at least one was allotted per mandal and thus urban areas have also been covered under the mandal criteria. But while rural mandals have a population of around 50,000, corporation cities have a population between two to 10 lakh and hence the criteria of mandal population is unscientific, said a headmaster at a municipal school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/rural-areas-to-get-323-govt-junior-colleges/articleshow/84836887.cms||Samdani MN

Madhepura SP Yogendra Kumar said police recovered a bike, one countrymade pistol and three empty cartridges from their possession. The bike-borne criminals had shot at businessman Baidhynath Jhanwar (33) at his shop on the southern outskirts of Murliganj market five days back. Jhanwar was taken to the local primary health centre where a doctor declared him brought dead. The local chamber of commerce took the matter seriously and its members staged a protest to demand immediate arrest of the criminals involved in the incident. Their protest continued even on Tuesday. The police swung into action and set up a team under SDPO Ajay Narayan Yadav. The police team carried out a raid at the house of Badal Kumar, the son of one Kailash Yadav in Panchgachhiya village and arrested him. Badal, during the course of interrogation, revealed the names of other accomplices involved in the crime. Police then arrested Paras Kumar from his Kanp-Golma village under Saharsa district.

---||Kolkata||Take your vaccine shot as soon as possible, advise doctors amid antibody debate||KOLKATA: Doctors and researchers in Kolkata refused to fully accept the findings of a study on people vaccinated with Pfizer and AstraZeneca (Covishield in India), which said antibodies start depleting six weeks after immunization. They pointed out that though antibody levels are bound to wane with time, once vaccinated, the immune system invests in generation of memory B cells and can readily start producing antibodies on a repeat encounter with the virus. So, the efficacy remains. The study published in Lancet said the antibody count can reduce by more than 50% over 10 weeks. Rather than worrying about the longevity of antibodies, everyone should go for vaccines, doctors advised. “The level of antibodies circulating in the blood (that we measure while testing) is bound to fall with time, as in the absence of any threat it is wasteful for B cells to keep producing antibodies at a high level that can be detected,” said immunologist Dipyaman Ganguly, a scientist at Indian Institute of Chemical Biology. “But there are T cells educated to recognize viruses in circulation, as well as part of a memory T cell pool similarly generated. So, fall in circulating antibodies is not a tell-tale sign of waning immunity that needs a booster. The key sign of an end to the duration of post-vaccination immunity is registering statistically significant numbers of reinfections with symptomatic disease,” he said. Many agreed the Covid vaccines are new and though their efficacy to protect people from getting severe disease and reduce mortality has been proved, many facets, including duration of protection, are uncertain. “But it’s proven that they offer good protection. Let us not worry about the length of their efficacy as long as we have proof they work. Let us also not attach too much importance to studies at this stage since there’s another recent finding that claims Covishield may provide life-long immunity,” said CMRI director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. In India, the inoculation drive was launched on January 16 with Covishield. Indian’s home-grown Covaxin was introduced about three weeks later. Now, Russian-made Sputnik V is also being administered in India. Some health experts feel that 600 is not a good sample size to draw a definite conclusion and are hopeful of more such studies to throw light on the issue. But they said a booster dose could be required in future to counter the waning immunity. So far, no pharma has come up with any booster dose. “This is a concerning finding, especially when we think about healthcare workers immunized against Covid early in 2021. I feel there is a need for a booster dose, especially for the healthcare workers of our country,” said Peerless Hospital clinical research and academics director Subhrojyoti Bhowmick.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/take-your-vax-shot-as-soon-as-possible-advise-doctors-amid-antibody-debate/articleshow/84840500.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

He told the officials to set up oxygen plants at primary health centres across the state, to meet the increasing demand for oxygen due to Covid-19. The chief minister held a review meeting with the officials on Covid-19 at his Tadepalli camp office on Wednesday. He asked the officials to pay special attention to the maintenance of equipment procured as a part of Covid-19 containment measures and appoint special staff as per requirement. He said that the staff should be recruited based on the area of the district and the number of hospitals. He also told them to train the staff to maintain oxygen plants and other equipment. He told them to introduce new courses on this subject in polytechnic colleges. The chief minister told the officials to identify 100-bed hospitals in the private sector and establish oxygen generation plants. He said the state government was providing 30% subsidy for setting up oxygen plants and lower power tariff. Referring to the vaccination drive, the chief minister told the officials to give priority to teachers as schools are set to reopen on August 16. He expressed displeasure over the pace of vaccination drive in private hospitals. He said that the Union government had allocated 43,38,000 doses of vaccine to private hospitals from May to July of which only 5,24,347 doses have been used. He said he would write to the Centre again seeking diversion of vaccine doses given to private hospitals to government hospitals. On new medical colleges, the chief minister told the officials to complete land acquisition and start construction work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-to-create-new-wing-for-oxygen-plants/articleshow/84836833.cms||Gopi Dara

Owners of coaching institutes, however, are hopeful that the government would soon allow them to hold offline classes. Nikhil Raj, owner of a Rajiv Nagar-based coaching institute, said he is getting positive responses from the students and guardians. “In comparison to last year, there is an increase in number of admissions. Parents are also ready to let their wards attend offline classes. The government should, therefore, take a call on the matter at the earliest,” he added. Faiyaz Alam, owner of a Jagdeopath-based coaching centre, however, is quite apprehensive as old students might not return to the institute. “When I tried reaching out to the students who were in my institute before lockdown, only 25% of them responded positively. The Covid pandemic has scared students and they have started enjoying online studies. This is not good as physical learning has no alternative,” Alam said. Rhythm Bhambri, teacher at a Kankarbagh-based coaching institute, is hopeful that the offline classes would begin soon. “All arrangements have been made at our centre to ensure safety of the students. Even if the government permits coaching centres to hold offline classes with 100% attendance, we will allow only 50% students and hold classes on alternate days for them. We just can’t compromise with the well-being of the students,” Bhambri added. Varoopee, one of the students, said she is excited to attend offline classes. “I badly want the coaching institutes to reopen. I am fully vaccinated and will definitely follow all precautions. Online classes can never be a substitute for physical learning,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/coaching-centres-await-govt-nod-to-hold-offline-classes/articleshow/84835882.cms||---

Now, only 10 districts are considered Maoist-affected, ADG (operation) Sushil Mansingh Khopde tells TOI’s Debashish Karmakar in an interview. Excerpts: What is the present situation of Maoists in Bihar? They are fighting for their existence, as per their communications intercepted by the security forces. They talk about attacking forces or government installations only to prove their presence felt among the villagers. How is the situation in Bihar compared to other states like Jharkhand? It is more peaceful than in other states, including Jharkhand. The incidents of Maoist violence prove it. Only five such incidents have been reported till July 23 this year. Now only 10 Bihar districts are on the LWE-affected list. Unlike Jharkhand, Bihar’s topography is unsuitable for Maoist activities. We conducted three successful ‘bloodless’ election in 2015, 2019 and 2020. They had planned to attack polling parties an security forces, but failed. Which areas in Bihar have high Maoist concentration? Armed Maoist cadres are only concentrated on the hills of Chakarbandha on Gaya-Aurangabad border near Jharkhand and in the hilly areas of Jamui and Lakhisarai-Munger. Their strength is around 100 only. Central forces and Special Task Force (STF) teams have confined them there. Earlier, there was an armed cadre in Bagaha, which was exterminated in July last year. There are a few districts with ‘soft Maoism’, which were earlier violence-affected. Forces keep vigil on those who try to reorganise, demand levy or commit other crimes. Do they still get villagers’ support? There is no more Maoist ideology. Instead, their activities are confined to crime like collecting levy/extortion. Now villagers also know this. We get 80% of information regarding their activities from villagers. Their commanders have been exposed by the Enforcement Directorate. The agency has confiscated the assets of many Maoist leaders. Till now, properties worth several crores belonging to 13 Maoists leaders in Bihar have been attached. Their children were found studying in private institutions where admission was secured by paying donations. What kind of developmental works are being done in the Maoist-hit areas? Now there is electricity and roads almost everywhere. Some roads have been constructed deep inside the Maoist-affected areas, resulting in easy movement of forces. The district headquarters have 24 hours power supply. One example is Salaiyya (Gaya) where the government has constructed a road deep inside where security forces have set up camps. Panchayat elections with reserve seats for the deprived sections have changed the scenario. Earlier, villagers used to approach Maoists for any help. Some special educational institution like ‘Eklavya school’ would come up in those areas soon for educating the poor children. The central and state’s welfare schemes run continuously in such areas. What are future plans against Maoists in hills? Surrender policy is going to be upgraded at central and state level soon so that more Maoists join the mainstream. We expect top Maoist leaders carrying big cash rewards to surrender in future. We are simultaneously working to counter pressure mines planted in the hills by the Maoists. These mines are the biggest hurdles for forces. Once we overcome this issue, we will flush them out. Two CRPF battalions involved in anti-Maoist operations were moved out of state last year? Is there more such plans? We resisted the move for two years. Looking at the reduced violence scenario, the MHA finally relocated them. We filled up the vacant areas by relocating available central and state police forces. There is no further such probability of relocating central forces from the state. In fact, we need them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/maoists-exposed-confined-to-a-few-areas-only/articleshow/84836096.cms||Debashish Karmakar

In a clear reference to the BSP, Maurya, without naming any party or person said that "even people who used to turn away their faces at the mere sight of temples are now visiting the temples and claiming to be priests. Only the coming days will tell what all is to unfold." The deputy CM further added that the people of the state were well aware of the activities taken up by the rival camps ahead of assembly polls next year and that the people would be giving them a befitting reply in the 2022 state elections. He reiterated that the BJP believes in 'Sabka saath, sabka vikas and sabka vishwas', highlighting the importance of BJP's election mantra and war cry in the upcoming state polls. Maurya was at the circuit house on Wednesday to interact with people and hear their grievances. Referring to the Arial ghat incident where BSP national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra, who is also at the forefront of the Brahmin Sammelans to win over the Brahmin voters in the state, was seen seated on a chair during the Ganga aarti two days back in Sangam city and a few sadhus and purohits questioning Mishra's behaviour, the deputy CM said, “Sometimes, when we visit a religious place and are ignorant about the rituals there, it is better to act as per the instructions of the priests who are there to guide." Maurya, meanwhile, expressed anguish over the Barabanki road mishap in which at least 18 people were killed and said that Barabanki district authorities have been asked to ensure timely and proper medical care to all the injured persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/those-who-ignored-temples-acting-as-priests-now-mauryas-jibe-at-bsp/articleshow/84841747.cms||---

Opening up the centralised payment systems for non-banks, the RBI said that white-label ATM operators and card networks can also access the RTGS. What this means is that these entities will now get separate Indian Financial System Codes (IFSC) and will get to open a current account with the central bank. The move will bring down the cost of routing payments for non-banks. It will also reduce the risk of failure or delay in the execution of fund transfers as they no longer have to rely on banks. The RBI said that direct access was being provided so that customers of non-banks do not face the risk of bank failure. “Banks have been providing the services to non-banks for their payment and settlement needs. However, if the bank, which provides payment services to non-banks, is impacted, it can cause business disruption to the non-banks also,” the RBI said. It added that even if the disruption were to be temporary, it could cause and spread instability in the system. The RBI had announced its intent to open up the payment system to non-banks in its monetary policy in April 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-opens-up-payments-systems-to-non-banks/articleshow/84840425.cms||---

It has now come out with an extensive diet chart for children admitted in its hospitals during the third wave. Two diet charts have been prepared — for the 1-5 age group and the 6-12 group. All government-run Covid facilities have been told the chart is valid with immediate effect. The menu is almost the same for both, with the only difference being the quantity and the addition of curd for the 5-plus category. “A nutritional diet is important for children, more so when they are ill. It is a laudable effort by the government,”said senior paediatrician Apurba Ghosh, director, Institute of Child Health. “Adequate nutrition and fluid intake are an important part of management of children suffering from Covid. This is a very good step. The calorie value and protein content of the meal will ensure all-round nutrition,” said assistant professor of paediatrics at Medical College Hospital Kolkata Dibyendu Raychaudhuri, who is also the paediatric dialysis unit in-charge. “We have prepared 25 PICU and five NICU. This protein-rich diet will help,” said paediatrician Raj Shekhar Maity, nodal person for Covid care at Diamond Harbour Medical College. For children above 12, the diet for adult Covid patients — which the health department had notified in September 2020 — will be served. Caretakers of children in general Covid wards will get food non-Covid patients get.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/govt-prepares-diet-chart-for-cov-kids-in-hospital/articleshow/84840519.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Both institutes will sign a MoU on July 29, Thursday, in pursuance of the mutual desire for cooperation and collaboration aimed at the realisation of objects of common interest through joint endeavour, in larger public interest. The National Centre for Good Governance is an autonomous institute of the department of administrative reforms and public grievances (DAR&PG) under the Union government. In an interview to TOI, additional secretary, DAR&PG, who is also director general of the NCGG, V Srinivas, said IIM-V is the first IIM in the country with which NCGG is signing a formal MoU. “NCGG offers training for about 2,500 international civil servants from various countries such as Bangladesh, Maldives and several African countries every year. Modern day governance requires a lot of managerial principles, managerial excellence and ethical leadership. We are looking at some of these best managerial practices to incorporate into government. NCGG today is one of the largest capacity building programmes for international civil servants. A lot of countries are looking at India for capacity building needs. Apart from training international civil servants, we have major programmes with several state governments like Odisha and Jammu and Kashmir,” said Srinivas. When asked about the collaboration with IIM-Vizag, the additional secretary said that there are many features in terms of management that collaboration with IIM-Vizag can give NCGG. “We will incorporate the best talents that are available at IIM-Vizag into some of our faculty sessions and add certain subjects to our training curriculum. Even though we have close association with other IIMs, this is first formal agreement with any IIM. When you bring in management experts into the system, the formulation of case studies and evidence-based policy making will be very significant,” said Srinivas. “NCGG wants to look at leadership, ethics, documentation of success stories and strengthening our own faculty for international capacity building programmes. The MoU would be mutually beneficial for NCGG and IIM-Vizag as it would add to the repertoire of our subject experts,” said Srinivas. Director, IIIM-V, Prof M Chandrasekhar, said the MoU will facilitate joint programmes, including academic title granting programmes. “The institutes will collaborate on resource-sharing, including faculty experts participating in joint consulting and research projects. It will encourage exchange of academic faculty and researchers,” said Prof Chandrasekhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/iim-v-to-tie-up-with-ncgg-for-joint-research/articleshow/84837188.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The court was hearing a quo warranto petition, filed by one Regu Maheswara Rao from Vizianagaram, challenging Sawhney’s appointment as it was made in contrary to Supreme Court guidelines. Rao, in his petition, said the SEC should be an independent person while Sawhney was working as advisor to the government immediately after her retirement as chief secretary, and resigned as advisor only to be appointed as SEC. He further contended that the appointment was made on the recommendation of the chief minister, which is against the rules as it has to be made by the governor with his discretionary powers. Arguing on behalf of the secretary to the governor, senior counsel C V Mohan Reddy said the petition is not maintainable as there was no procedural violation in Sawhney’s appointment. The chief minister sent three names and the governor is not bound to consider those names and can take an independent decision. He further stated that 11 names were considered by the governor before zeroing in on Sawhney. Her appointment was made purely based on her credentials and administrative experience. The apprehension of the petitioner that she worked as an advisor to the government cannot be a basis for rejection of her appointment as SEC, Reddy added. Considering the arguments, Justice Battu Devanand asked all records pertaining to the appointment of Sawhney be placed before the court and posted the matter for hearing to August 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-seeks-all-records-on-sec-appointment/articleshow/84837258.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The remaining oxygen plants will be set up by August-end, said health minister Mangal Pandey. He also said 36 district hospitals and 54 sub-divisional hospitals would have at least one such oxygen generation plant. “Two oxygen concentrators are being provided to each additional primary health centre in the state,” he said. Two more PSA plants will be installed at IGIMS premises by August 31. Each would have the capacity to produce 1,000 litres of oxygen per minute. “One oxygen generation plant having the capacity to produce 233 litres of oxygen per minute was already functional at the institute. Besides, two cryogenic liquid medical oxygen tanks (each of 20KL) will also be set up. One such tank was already installed,” its medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said. PMCH principal Dr Vidyapati Choudhary said oxygen generation plant has the capacity to fill about 50 D-type cylinders with natural oxygen per day. “It can provide uninterrupted oxygen supply to 50 beds in the hospital in a day,” he told this newspaper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/19-oxygen-plants-set-up-at-various-hosps-medical-facilities-in-bihar/articleshow/84836060.cms||Faryal Rumi

It is permitted and guarded,” asserted special secretary to the chief minister (finance and economic affairs), Krishna Duvvuri. Speaking to media persons here on Wednesday, Krishna discounted the campaign against the state government’s borrowings by the opposition and a section of media. He said borrowings in the state were well within the limit of the Union government. Stating that the borrowing by any state is fixed every year by the Union finance minister on the advice of the Finance Commission, he said, “No state can go beyond the permitted level.” Adding that “through a misinformation campaign”, “attempts are being made” “to tarnish the image of the state” “to reap political gains”. He blamed the bifurcation of the state which “resulted in economic deprivation” and the government between 2014 and 2019 which had “endured the burden of many more additional liabilities”. He said the present regime was facing the fiscal challenge due to “misgovernance during 2014-19”. Krishna said at the time of bifurcation in 2014, the debt of the combined state assigned to Andhra Pradesh was Rs 97,123 crore. The addition of the public account share added to this took the total debt to Rs 1,20,556 crore. During 2014-19, the debt went up to Rs 2,68,225 crore, he added. Even off-budget borrowings in 2014-19 went up to Rs 58,000 crore against Rs 4,028 crore at the time of bifurcation, he said. The special secretary said the former TDP government between 2014-19 also increased debts in the power sector, from Rs 33,587.98 crore in 2014 to Rs 70,254 crore in 2019. Dues from discoms to the power sector also increased from Rs 2,893.23 crore in 2014 to Rs 21,540.96 crore by 2019, he said. While admitting the Centre had proposed to reduce the state’s borrowings by Rs 17,983 crore, Krishna said “Rs 16,418 crore pertains to the period of TDP government”. He said the present government in the state, that at the Centre and those across the world were facing a financial crisis on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. Governments across the globe were going in for borrowings to keep their economies active and sustainable, he said, adding, “The entire world was faced with a scenario of steep fall in revenues coupled with the urgent need to step up public expenditure.” Krishna said the state lost Rs 7,780 crore from its share of central taxes and another Rs 7,000 crore of its own tax revenue due to the pandemic. In addition, the state had to spend another Rs 8,000 crore on Covid-19 mitigation. He also presented statistics on how the Centre had gone in for borrowing to mitigate the Covid-19 crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/covid-induced-financial-crisis-called-for-borrowing-govt/articleshow/84837352.cms||Gopi Dara

According to the central bank, the RBI-DPI stood at 270.6 as of March 2021 compared to 207.8 a year ago. This 30% jump in the index over a period of one year shows that there has been a sharp increase in digital transactions coupled with an improvement in the digital payments infrastructure. In March 2020, the digital index had risen 35% over the previous year. One of the reasons for the increase in digital payments was the surge in use of Unified Payments Interface and the increase in merchant acquisition by banks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-starts-publishing-digital-payments-index/articleshow/84840151.cms||---

Prasad, who also holds the urban development and housing department portfolio, was replying to a starred question by BJP MLC Sanjay Prakash alias Sanjay Mayukh regarding waterlogging problems in all the district headquarters as well as in Patna. Prasad said the construction of storm water drainage system was in progress to tackle the waterlogging situation in Patna as well as other urban areas. He said stress this year was on cleaning of drains and that is why rainwater from the roads gets drained out fast. Prasad further said those places facing waterlogging have been identified and drains will be made on priority basis under the ‘Saat Nischay’ programmes. Prasad further said he had himself been reviewing and monitoring the waterlogging problem and sump houses were made functional even at night to drain out water. However, Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra interrupted and asked the government to give a tentative time to solve the problem. “For the past 13 years, surveys of drains are being done and meetings are being held. Just tell us when the problem will be resolved,” Mishra asked. JD(U) MLC Lallan Kumar Sarraf raised the issue of wastage of electricity because of high-mast street lights, which remain on even during the daytime. Other MLCs, including Nawal Kishore Yadav and Kedar Nath Pandey, also seconded Sarraf and asked the state government to immediately resolve the issue. RJD’s Ram Chandra Purbey raised the problems faced by people residing in the slum area. Purbey said there were 110 slum areas in Patna and people residing there were deprived of basic amenities like pucca house, drinking water, toilets, medical facilities and education for their children. He asked the minister to get a proper study done in such localities and prepare a plan accordingly. Prasad agreed and said he will get the survey of such localities done by an agency. Arjun Sahni raised the issue of GI tag to be given to Makhana (fox nuts). Agriculture minister Amrendra Prasad Singh said the government was trying to get GI tag for Mithila Makhana and very soon this will be achieved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/agencies-not-repairing-roads-after-work-to-be-punished-bihar-deputy-cm/articleshow/84836265.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The opposition led by RJD’s Tejashwi Prasad Yadav had been demanding a discussion along with the government’s reply on the March 23 incidents from the first day of the monsoon session on July 26. On Tuesday, Tejashwi even announced that the opposition MLAs will boycott the proceedings, as they were not getting any hearing from the Speaker, nor were they allowed to speak. Participating in the discussion, parliamentary affairs minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary reiterated that the government had nothing to do with whatever happened on that day, including the requisitioning of police. Whatever had transpired was in the jurisdiction of the assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha, who was the custodian of the House. “It is one unique situation in which the government had no role to play. Right from running the House to requisitioning the police had to be the decision of the Speaker, and it was precisely so,” Choudhary told the House. “Whether the democracy was shamed or if it was murdered, as the leader of opposition in the House Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has maintained, the responsibility to uphold the dignity of the House also lay with the opposition MLAs, since they had obstructed the House proceedings that day and also subjected the Speaker to a kind of treatment that had not been seen before,” Choudhary said. Echoing the sentiments of the treasury benches, including former minister and BJP member Nand Kishore Yadav, Choudhary also said there was no justification for holding the House discussion on the March 23 incidents, as the administrative committee comprising additional chief secretary of the home department and state DGP, as well as the Ethics Committee of the House, have been probing the matter and they had not yet submitted their complete reports. Earlier, Tejashwi, initiating the discussion, put the state government in the dock, saying the Speaker, even if he had called in the police, “could not have ordered that the opposition MLAs be beaten up, kicked around with boots, and even be flung out of the House on the road. The fact is that those who are in power (read CM Nitish Kumar) have this complex that they have formed the government through the backdoor, which we have been maintaining. It is they whose hands are there in the beating and manhandling of the MLAs.” Tejashwi further said, “It is the officers who gave the orders to the police to treat the MLAs in the manner they did. The Speaker would not have asked the officers to do it.” Tejashwi also said he had not sat on the Chair of the Speaker that day. “I had only climbed up the steps leading to the Chair to prevent the manhandling and disrobing of the two women MLAs that was being done by the police there,” he said. Among the other speakers were former CM and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) leader Jitan Ram Manjhi, Ajeet Sharma from the Congress, Mahboob Alam from the CPI(ML), Akhtarul Iman from the AIMIM, Ajay Kumar from the CPM and Ram Ratan Singh from the CPI and Swarna Singh from the VIP. Manjhi surprised the House by claiming that he might not contest the assembly election again, as he had not seen whatever happened on March 23 in his 36 years of House membership. Sharma said if the Speaker had arranged for the training of the first-timers in the House, the unfortunate incidents would not have happened. “They lack experience,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-govt-opposition-trade-charges-on-march-23-incidents-in-assembly/articleshow/84836309.cms||Abhay Singh

Manan Desai, who performs shows under the name ‘The Comedy Factory’ and has been entertaining the audiences for over a decade, won a trademark case which he had filed in Bombay high court against the channel and the producer of a show who was using a similar name for their upcoming comedy show. Thirty-three-year-old Desai had first sent a legal notice to the channel in June after he learnt that they were to launch a show ‘The Comedy Factory’. “I contacted the show’s producers and informed them about the similarity between mine and their comedy show’s name. I requested them to change the name of their show. But the channel kept promoting their show with the same name on social media,” Desai, a resident of Vadodara, said. “So, I filed a suit in Bombay high court stating that they cannot use the title ‘The Comedy Factory’ as I have got that name registered under trademark laws. While it is against the laws to use the same title or name, it even creates confusion in the minds of audiences,” Desai told TOI. He further said that he has been performing under The Comedy Factory title since 2011. Advocate Yash Suryawala, an expert in intellectual property rights (IPR) who issued the legal notice, stated that the channel used the name The Comedy Factory for capitalizing on the goodwill associated with Desai’s title. “They first agreed to change the name and prefix their channel’s name in the title. But we objected and said that they cannot use the name Comedy Factory at all,” Desai, who co-founded The Comedy Factory with Vidya Desai, added. “We had two hearings about the trademark suit in the court. The defendants agreed to change the name of their upcoming show completely following which the high court asked them on Tuesday to file an affidavit that they won’t use the title The Comedy Factory now or even in the future,” said Ayush Agarwala, advocate who represented Desai in Bombay high court. “The court has also imposed Rs 2 lakh as the cost of litigation that the defendant has to pay to the plaintiff and the suit has been disposed of,” Agarwala said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/guj-stand-up-comedian-wins-trademark-suit/articleshow/84837337.cms||Tushar Tere

---||Business||Sebi fines Raj, Shilpa and their firm for insider trading||MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi on Wednesday imposed a fine of Rs 3 lakh on Ripu Sudan (Raj) Kundra, Shilpa Shetty Kundra and Viaan Inds (formerly Hindustan Safety Glass Inds) for insider trading in the stock of the company between 2013 and 2015. Kundra and Shetty are promoters of the company. In October 2015, the company had made a preferential allotment of 5 lakh shares to four people, of which more than 51% were to the Kundra couple for Rs 2.6 crore. Under Sebi’s insider trading rules, anyone getting preferential allotment of shares worth more than Rs 10 lakh should have been disclosed. Along with the Kundra couple, the company was also required to make a disclosure about the same. Neither the company nor the two promoters made those disclosures on the exchanges within two days. Instead, the company made the disclosures after three years from the date of allotment. In reply to Sebi’s show-cause notices to the three entities, all of them admitted that as stated by the regulator, the preferential allotments were done in October 2015. The two promoters also agreed that there was a delay in disclosing the allotment but requested Sebi to condone the delay and drop the proceedings. The company said that since the disclosures from the promoters to the company came in after a delay, there was a lag in reporting to the exchanges. Therefore, it requested the regulator to drop the charges. Sebi admitted that the non-disclosure neither resulted into any monetary gains for the promoters nor any unfair advantage. The records also didn’t show any repeat offence by the three entities. However, since there was a violation of its rules, hence the three entities together were asked to pay a fine of Rs 3 lakh, the order noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-fines-raj-shilpa-and-their-firm-for-insider-trading/articleshow/84840893.cms||---

Uproarious scenes were witnessed early in the day as opposition members charged that replies to their questions were not given on time. Criticising the government for reducing the session to just three days, opposition members said that the government was scared to face them. The House had to be adjourned till 2.30pm, when the opposition rushed to the well of the house over the utterances of legislative affairs minister Mauvin Godinho against the opposition. The discussion over suspension of rules not to have general discussion on the budget prompted two former chief ministers — Pratapsing Rane and Luizinho Faleiro — to say that the government was making mockery of the procedures and conduct of the house. “You are streamrolling everything”, said Rane angrily. GFP president Vijai Sardesai and independent MLA Rohan Khaunte were also combative in their approach, targetting the government with pointed questions. There were heated arguments between the opposition and the ruling benches. The day’s business went on till well past midnight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/monsoon-session-off-to-rocky-start-oppn-puts-govt-on-mat/articleshow/84841120.cms||---

At the state level, the number of unclaimed seats stands at 25,000. Activists working on the field said hundreds of complaints have been registered with respective local bodies about schools refusing admission, yet no action has been taken against them. A parent from Manjari said, “When I went to admit my son in the school allocated to him in the centralised process, the school initially accepted all the documents for verification but later returned them saying that they won’t give admissions till the government pays the reimbursement pending for admitting students under the RTE ActI submitted a complaint to the ZP on June 17 and the official said they would call me to present the case, but I am yet to hear from them.” Social activists Mukund Kirdat and Maruti Bhapkar have already written to the education department and state government to take action against schools refusing admission on frivolous grounds and also schools boycotting the admission process stating non-receipt of pending reimbursement amount. However, Pune Zilla Parishad vice-president Ranjit Shivtare said, “The parents are supposed to complain at the local level and if the problem is not solved, they are supposed to file an appeal with the district committee at the ZP. However, till now, we have got only 200 such appeals from parents. Around 3,000 forms have been rejected by schools for want of documents. Without proper documents, schools can’t give admissions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/zp-blamed-for-inaction-over-rte-admissions/articleshow/84838548.cms||Ardhra Nair

The entire process of the export was carried out by the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) in collaboration with Uttarakhand Agriculture Produce Marketing Board (UKAPMB) and Just Organik, a Gurugram-based export firm. “APEDA would continue to focus on the Uttarakhand region both in the manner of capacity building, quality upgradation, and infrastructure development by linking shoppers to farmers through strengthening the whole supply chain of agricultural produce,” the Union ministry of commerce and industry said in a statement.

The students arrived for the entrance test in the online format for the Military Nursing Service (MNS) - a four-year bachelor course for those who aspire to get into the nursing branch of the Indian armed forces. It was conducted by the Jogiwala based private centre Ishan infotech. However, students who were supposed to write their 90-minute long exam in the first shift at 11am entered the hall only after 3pm. While the second shift got late by more than three hours and as per the officials at the centre, the students in the third shift "were free much later in the evening". Most of the students had come with their parents from various districts of Uttarakhand while some travelled from neighbouring states. “I had come with my daughter from Bageshwar. We thought that we would catch the 4 pm bus, but I think now we have to stay back in Doon itself,” said Balwant Singh, a Bageshwar resident. Another parent, Poonam Mittal, told TOI that her daughter got tensed and was not able to write her exam properly and now will look forward to clearing it next year. Meanwhile, Kailash Lasiyal, co-partner at Ishan infotech, told TOI, “The testing agency miscommunicated in their audit report. We gave them a figure of 270-280 seats, excluding buffer systems which are kept for contingency, but the agency allotted us a figure of conducting exams of 350 candidates in one shift. It wasn’t possible for us to hold even if we included buffer systems.

Just because children don’t listen, we cannot put the responsibility on the government and police,” Sawant, who also holds the home portfolio, said.  He said parents have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their children and hinted that they should not let their children, particularly minors, out at night. Read AlsoGoa Forward Party MLA Vijay Sardesai alleges political interference in Benaulim gangrape investigationThe opposition tore into the government’s track record in indicting rape accused, particularly those involved in gangrape cases. Taking the lead in cornering the government, Goa Forward Party (GFP) MLA Vijai Sardesai said that after arresting the accused, the guilty should be charged and punished in“We directly blame police, but I want to point out that of the 10 youth who went to the beach for a party, four stayed on the beach the whole night and the remaining six went home,” he said. “They were on the beach the whole night, two boys and two girls,” said Sawant replying to a calling attention motion in the assembly on the first day of the monsoon session on Wednesday. Four men, one of them a government employee (a driver with the agriculture department), posed as policemen and raped the two girls after beating up the boys who were with the girls on Benaulim beach. All the four accused were arrested Sunday night, he told the assembly. Sawant said that teens, particularly minors, should not be “spending the nights on beaches”. Goa Forward Party president and former deputy chief minister Vijai Sardesai slammed Sawant for trying to shift the blame on children and their parents. "You cannot say why they were on the beach. This is not the answer from the home minister of the state. The home minister should say that we (Goa) are so safe that you can spend the whole night on the beach," Sardesai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-on-benaulim-gangrape-why-were-minors-out-late-night/articleshow/84841180.cms||Newton Sequeira

The case is likely to come up for hearing in a day or two, sources said. Mishra was sent to jail on July 22 for his alleged involvement in an "act of forgery" related to the constitution of the college managing committee. In the FIR lodged by Awadhoot Mandal Ashram Mahant Rupendra Prakash over two years ago, involvement of six individuals was alleged. The accused, however, claimed that the police had singled him out and arrested him under pressure from "higher authorities". Meanwhile, college officiating principal Brijendra Kumar Singhdev told TOI, “The ashram mahant threatened that I, too, will meet the same fate as Mishra if I do not follow his instructions.” The college dispute arose from the renewal of its managing committee in 2016. The work was done earlier, from 1985 to 2015, by the ashram which established the college in 1965 through Prachin Awadhoot Mandal Ashram Karyakarini Samiti, called its parent body. From its inception till 1978, when the college was converted into an 'adarsh Sanskrit mahavidyalaya' under a Central government scheme, registration and renewal had been the college's responsibility. When the ashram failed to get the committee's renewal done in 2015, the college came forward to accomplish it and did it duly through a college resolution, Singhdev said. The ashram resented the act calling it forgery and filed the FIR on June 14, 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/arrested-principal-moves-district-court-for-bail-in-a-case-of-forgery/articleshow/84836296.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal
---||Mumbai||BMC zeroes in on private land for Mahul pumping station||MUMBAI: After waiting for close to two years for a response from the Centre’s salt commissioner, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has now decided to construct the Mahul pumping station on private land. It has identified a privately-owned parcel of land in Mahul and begun the process to acquire it. The around Rs 250-crore pumping station planned near Mahul creek will help pump out excess rainwater water from low-lying areas in central and eastern parts of the city, including King’s Circle, Gandhi Market, Wadala and Chembur. TimesViewWork on the Mahul pumping station has been pending for several years though it will bring relief to lakhs of people affected by waterlogging in areas such as King’s Circle, Gandhi Market, Wadala and Chembur. All chronic flooding spots in the city suffer a great deal with road and rail transport getting badly hit. The municipal corporation must carry out land acquisition swiftly and fast-track the project.“We need around four acres (15,000 sq m) for Mahul pumping station,” P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects), said. “We have carried out a feasibility study of the privately owned land and found it to be technically sound to construct the pumping station. We have now asked the development plan department to acquire the land. Once acquired, we will not have to wait for the salt commissioner’s land,” Velrasu added. In 2019, the BMC had planned to build the pumping station on Mahul land owned by the salt commissioner. The next year, the municipal corporation even decided to invoke the Disaster Management Act to directly take over the plot. During this period the BMC floated tenders for the Mahul pumping station project, but had to scrap them as there was no response from the Centre for nearly two years, despite several reminders. In August 2020, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray raised the issue of waterlogging in a virtual meeting with PM Narendra Modi days after parts of the city were inundated following incessant rainfall. Thackeray asked the Prime Minister to transfer the Centre-owned land in Mahul to the state government for the pumping station. A senior civic official said a proposal was submitted to the cabinet. “Some queries were raised in the cabinet, but so far we have got no clearance, so we decided to acquire a private land for the project instead,” the official added. After the 2005 deluge in Mumbai, the state government had appointed the Chitale committee to probe the reasons for the flooding. The panel had recommended pumping stations to flush out water from flooded areas into the sea during monsoon. Till date, Irla, Haji Ali, Cleveland, Lovegrove, Britannia and Gazdarbandh pumping stations have been constructed in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-zeroes-in-on-pvt-land-for-mahul-pumping-station/articleshow/84843284.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Both Kamat and Alemao “pleaded not guilty,” after the charges were read out to them. Paul has directed both to face the trial. Special public prosecutor for the enforcement directorate (ED) Siddharth Samant had argued the case. Judge Sherin Paul had earlier directed Kamat and Alemao to appear before it for answering the charges. On August 7, 2015, ED registered an enforcement case information report against ‘ministers’ of the Goa government, Louis Berger and others in 2010, to probe the financial angle. This happened two months after the crime branch initiated a probe in the case. Prosecution had said that Kamat, the then chief minister of Goa in connivance with the then PWD minister of Goa Alemao was responsible for holding the file relating to the awarding of JICA consultants work in Goa without justifiable reasons. Prosecution had further alleged that Kamat was also criminal conspirator in concealing the main noting file of awarding of JICA consultancy in Goa in connivance with the other co-accused Anand Wachasunder, the then JICA-Goa project director and Alemao.

These primary schools will be located near an Atal Utkrisht School. In these primary schools, students will be given a basic understanding of the English language. According to officials, the lessons won’t be strictly taught in the English medium but there will be compulsory teaching of the English subject in these feeder schools, so that the transition of students from the feeder schools to the Atal Utkrisht Schools is smooth. The feeder schools will also put emphasis on computer education. Meanwhile, the Uttarakhand Board of School Education (UBSE) has announced that the results of Classes X and XII board exams will be declared on July 31. The written exams were cancelled for academic year 2020-21 in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/edu-dept-to-develop-898-primary-schools-as-feeder-schools-to-atal-utkrisht-vidyalayas/articleshow/84836304.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Delhi||Double trouble: Covid-19 patients with diabetes most at risk of mucormycosis||NEW DELHI: Why do some Covid-19 patients develop mucormycosis and not others? Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this in the past, but a new study conducted by AIIMS has listed surprising risk factors that leave an individual more susceptible to the deadly black fungus infection. Diabetes, the study suggests, is the biggest risk factor for mucormycosis infection, followed by the use of steroids. The study also says that prolonged use of surgical or cloth masks and repeated RT-PCR tests, which involves taking nasal swab samples, also increase the odds of contracting black fungus. Notably, oxygen supplementation or hospitalisation did not affect the risk of CAM (coronavirus disease associated with mucormycosis), adds the study, published as a pre-print in medical journal MedRxiv and yet to be peer-reviewed. Zinc therapy, probably due to its utility in immune function, was also found to be protective. Dr Naveet Wig, professor and head of medicine at AIIMS, told TOI that diabetes and steroids were known to be potential risk factors for mucormycosis. “For me, the surprising finding was that most Covid patients who developed mucormycosis used cloth and surgical masks for longer periods than those who did not. I think we need to spread awareness about the importance of using clean masks and changing them frequently to prevent the risk of secondary infections such as mucormycosis,” Wig said. When asked how repeated RT-PCR testing during illness increased the vulnerability to mucormycosis, a doctor explained that repeated trauma to the nasal lining during the swab collection can affect local immunity and the microbiome which gives protection against the growth of opportunistic infection in this area. “Repeat tests should be avoided as much as possible during Covid treatment,” he advised. For the study, the medicine department selected 352 patients diagnosed with Covid between April and May, the period when the second Covid wave was at its peak. Of them, 152 were under treatment for mucormycosis while the rest had recovered from Covid without suffering the fungal infection. The patients and their families were asked about the various risk factors hypothesised to be responsible for mucormycosis. It was discovered that 92% of the patients who developed mucormycosis had diabetes. In the non-mucormycosis category, only 28% were diabetic. A third (36%) of the patients with mucormycosis were newly diagnosed with diabetes during hospitalisation for Covid, based on raised blood sugar levels or abnormal HbA1c levels, researchers said. “The reason behind the increased vulnerability of diabetics to the fungal infection could be pre-existing low immunity worsened by use of steroids during the treatment. Therefore, control of co-morbidities is very important in such patients,” said Dr Neeraj Nischal, associate professor, department of medicine. When mucormycosis cases started escalating, it was hypothesised that lengthy oxygen therapy might have predisposed some patients to mucormycosis. However, the AIIMS study did not find such a link. Most of the patients in both groups had mild Covid and the requirement of hospitalised oxygen therapy was similar in both groups. The researchers instead found that the use of cloth masks for more than four hours and of surgical masks for more than six hours were associated with a higher risk of CAM compared with the use of such masks for less than two hours or N95 masks for any duration. The study said the findings on the association between mask use and mucormycosis were similar even when healthcare workers — 40 were included in the study — were excluded as confounders who were more limited to the control group of patients (recovered without developing mucormycosis) and used N95 exclusively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/double-trouble-covid-19-patients-with-diabetes-most-at-risk-of-mucormycosis/articleshow/84841255.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

This is one of a string of incidents where owners of hospitality establishments succumbed to mental stress caused by financial losses,” said a statement by the association. HRAWI opposed the “unfair and unjustified imposition’’ of pandemic restrictions on hotels and restaurants, and it urged the state government to either allow them to run businesses as usual or offer concessions. “Over the last year and a half, similar incidents have occurred, and the underlying reason has been the same. Financial loss caused by lockdown and continued restrictions have taken away the right of earning a livelihood,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hotelier-died-due-to-loss-of-livelihood/articleshow/84843352.cms||---

In the Dehradun district, Mussoorie received a maximum of 160 mm rainfall last night, followed by Vikasnagar (140 mm), Jolly Grant (120 mm), and Dehradun city (100 mm). Bageshwar and Almora recorded 140 mm and 70 mm rainfall respectively. In Dehradun, incessant rainfall threw normal life out of gear as several roads in IT Park, Jakhan-Johri road, and Maldevta localities were inundated. Also, a small local bridge in Bakrawala collapsed due to heavy rainfall on Tuesday night. A car stuck in a flooded IT Park (TOI Photo)Following the overnight rain spell, all four highways connecting the Char Dham shrines in Garhwal were blocked. The Rishikesh-Badrinath national highway in Chamoli district also remained blocked at Sirobagad and the Kedarnath National Highway was obstructed at Soudi and near Banswara. Incessant rainfall since Tuesday night also disrupted traffic movement, power, and drinking water supply in several areas of Uttarkashi. According to TOI sources, traffic movement on the Gangotri National Highway was disrupted due to rainfall-triggered landslides at Dharasu, Raturisera, Badethi, Netala, and a few other spots on early Wednesday morning. Due to a landslide, the Yamunotri National Highway was also obstructed in the Kharadi area, cutting off a dozen villages from Barkot tehsil. Besides, 58 link roads, which connect villages from nearby towns were also blocked due to landslides. Heavy rainfall also affected the electricity and drinking water supply in the district. District magistrate, Uttarkashi, Mayur Dixit has ordered the officials of concerned departments to keep their teams on alert mode and restore the facilities at the earliest. Devendra Patwal, district disaster management officer, said, “The teams of several departments are working in affected areas and most of the facilities will be restored till late (Wednesday) evening.” In Mussoorie, vehicular movements on the Mussoorie-Dehradun road and the Mussoorie-Tehri road were disrupted after heavy overnight rain and consequent landslides. The rainfall also led to an increase in the water level in Kempty Falls, prompting the administration to prohibit tourists from entering the pool. The intense rain spell damaged at least 20 roads in Bageshwar, affecting about 20,000 locals. The district officials have deployed earth-moving machines to clear the roads of boulders and debris. Meanwhile, the regional meteorological centre has issued an alert of more rain activity across the state in the next 48 hours. “Heavy to very heavy rainfall with intense spells likely at isolated places in Uttarkashi, Dehradun, Tehri, Pauri, Nainital, Bageshwar, and Pithoragarh districts of the state in next few days,” said Bikram Singh, director, Met centre, Dehradun. He added, “Medium to major landslides and rockfalls could occur at vulnerable places in the hills between July 28 and August 1.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/heavy-rainfall-continues-to-lash-uttarakhand-mussoorie-and-dehradun-receive-over-100mm-showers-major-roads-highways-blocked/articleshow/84836321.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Delhi||Stormy start to monsoon session of Delhi assembly expected today||NEW DELHI: Appointment of 1984-batch IPS officer Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police commissioner will be discussed on the first day of the monsoon session of Delhi assembly beginning on Thursday. During the short duration discussion, AAP MLAs Sanjeev Jha, Akhilesh Pati Tripathi and Som Dutt will initiate discussion on ‘appointment of Delhi Police commissioner in violation of directions of Supreme Court’. In a surprise move, the ministry of home affairs on Tuesday appointed Asthana as the new police commissioner, four days before he was due to retire from the service. Asthana’s appointment follows an extension of service for a year as well as an inter-cadre transfer. The new police commissioner took charge on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the monsoon session is likely to be stormy with the opposition planning to corner the government on various issues, including Covid management. “The opposition wants to ask the government why healthcare infrastructure in Delhi collapsed during the second wave leaving people to fend for themselves,” leader of opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said. The opposition will also raise the issues of water crisis, waterlogging and poor public transport system in the capital, among others. The session will begin at 11am with question hour after obituary references. In special mention (Rule 280), which will follow after question hour, members will raise issues pertaining to their constituencies and other issues of public importance. Later, AAP MLA Bhavna Gaur will move a motion seeking Bharat Ratna for environmentalist Sunder Lal Bahuguna for his enormous and significant contribution in the field of environment. CM Arvind Kejriwal recently wrote a letter to PM Narendra Modi seeking the highest civilian honour for Bahuguna. A heated blame-game between BJP and AAP functionaries on waterlogging is likely to be witnessed in the assembly. According to the list of business, BJP MLAs Vijender Gupta and others will initiate a discussion on the ‘failure of the Delhi government in opening of any new school or college and shortage of teachers in schools.’ Meanwhile, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta, Ramesh Bidhuri and others have planned a protest outside the assembly against “scams” in the AAP government. Delhi BJP general secretary Harsh Malhotra claimed people were compelled to drink impure and contaminated water which is being supplied to them by the AAP government. “The protest is against the DTC scam, government’s failure in education, free ration distribution and the other sectors,” Malhotra stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/stormy-start-to-monsoon-session-expected-today/articleshow/84841261.cms||AlokKNMishra

Veraval town police arrested Madan Singh alias Harajit Singh Dudhani (35), a resident of Vadodara, Joginder Singh Bhand, a resident of Bharuch, Gurmukh Singh, a resident of Vadodara, and Hardayal Singh Tilmtiya, a resident of Mendarda town of Junagadh district. “On the night of July 20, Madan Singh and three others went to Veraval town in a car and burgled four houses, decamping with Rs 90,000 worth valubales from one of the houses. A complaint of theft was lodged by Pankaj Sharma, a resident of Shivaji Nagar of Veraval town a day after the house break-in. On July 21, the gang struck at five more houses in Talala town and escaped from the spot,” said the police. However, no complaint was lodged in Talala house break-ins. But Veraval police had launched a probe in an FIR lodged by Pankaj Sharma and got one clue of a car that was used in the crime. “A similar car was used in the Talala town burglary cases too and when inquired with the Regional Transport Office (RTO), we traced it to Madan Singh. The car was registered in the name of Madan Singh’s wife, Veer Kaur. Police then searched its internal database of criminals and found that over five cases had been lodged against Madan Singh in Vadodara in the past. We picked him up and during interrogation revealed the names of his gang members. We have detained them all,” police said. Police claimed that the four accused have confessed to have committed over 30 burglaries across the state in the past few months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/four-of-chikhligar-gang-held-in-veraval/articleshow/84836221.cms||---

The state public health department had directed all collectors to ready a detailed plan for oxygen generation plants in anticipation of the third wave of the pandemic. An analysis by the public health department stated that during the second wave of the pandemic, 361 tonnes of oxygen were needed daily and the expected supply was 540 tonnes for the district “We will prepare and ready a storage capacity for 1,183 tonnes of oxygen in accordance with the directions of the government. The directions stated that the the storage should be three times more than the present capacity,” Deshmukh said. At present, 957 tonnes of oxygen are beng provided by the plants that have been readied and also some companies, a district administration official said. “With 34 more oxygen generation plants coming up, the capacity will increase further and the district will be self-sufficient,” the official said. Pune district had to depend much on oxygen supplied from Gujarat and Odisha during the peak of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, earlier this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/34-more-oxygen-generation-plants-likely-in-district-soon/articleshow/84841299.cms||Nisha Nambiar

N K Arora, chairman, National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), said there has been no recommendation for boosters from the expert group yet, but studies are ongoing to determine if they will be needed to extend protection. A review of the research will be carried out once the main Covid programme is over, he said. On Tuesday, minister of state for health Bharati Pawar, while answering a question in the Rajya Sabha, had said even the World Health Organisation (WHO) hasn’t yet made a recommendation on booster doses. Former secretary of health and family welfare, K Sujata Rao, said if a booster is indeed required, it will have to be balanced with current coverage as only about 25% of the eligible population has received the first dose. “It’s a choice between all being given partial immunity and some getting full protection,” she said. Rao cited a Lancet article (published this week) which said antibody levels generated after two shots of Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines may drop after six weeks. “If that’s the case, a booster dose may be needed,” she said. Experts, however, said India's policy will have to be guided by what's being found in people who were given jabs two months ago. Virologist T Jacob John said when vaccines are in short supply, priority should be on completing two-dose coverage. He added, "All Covid vaccines are non-replicating, unlike the replicating types used against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox. Replicating vaccines grow in numbers after insertion and the effective dose is hundreds of thousands times more than what is injected. So one dose will suffice for long-term immunity. A second dose may be offered to cover a small proportion of ‘non-responders’ to one dose.” John said all non-replicating vaccines require "priming" of the immune system and "boosting" for increased antibody levels, for sustained long-term immunity. “Without boosting, antibody levels achieved after priming gradually wane, as we have seen with all Covid vaccines given as two doses,” he said, adding that as vaccine availability improves, priority can be extended to people with underlying conditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-plan-for-boosters-yet-priority-is-full-coverage-by-2021-end-ntagi-chief/articleshow/84841279.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The accused was said to be in police custody for around a week. SP Hamirpur has suspended a sub-inspector and two constables and ordered an enquiry into the incident. The incident has been reported from Moudaha police station of Hamirpur district. The accused, Sanjay of Mahoba district, was arrested for raping a minor. As per reports, Sanjay used to often visit a village under Modaha police station where his sister had got married. In the village, he had befriended a minor girl with whom he had eloped on April 6. “A complaint in this regard was made by the girl’s family members at Khanna Kotwali. Acting on the complaint, the Kotwali police recovered the girl and arrested Sanjay from Noida on July 23,” police sources said and added, “No action could be taken due to the closure of court on July 24 and 25. After this, the girl was produced in the court on Tuesday (July 27) and her statement was recorded.” Along with this, the police booked Sanjay under the IPC sections of kidnapping and rape, besides POCSO Act, and handed over the girl to her family members and put the accused in the lock-up, said police. “At around 1 O’clock in the night, Sanjay ended his life by hanging himself from the lock-up grille. He used his shirt to hang himself. Later, when the policemen on duty spotted Sanjay hanging, they brought him down and rushed him to the community health centre in Maudaha, where doctors referred him to the district hospital after preliminary treatment. The police tried to rush him to the district hospital, but he died on the way,” police added further. On coming to know about the incident, senior police officials including SP Hamirpur KK Dixit rushed to the police station. He asked additional SP Anup Kumar to investigate the matter. The SP later suspended SI Devendra Kumar along with constables Anuj Kumar and Anup Kumar for negligence in duty. The body has been sent for postmortem. On why the accused was kept in the police lock-up for a long period, SP Hamirpur said: “I have ordered a detailed enquiry into the incident. Based on its outcome, further action will be taken.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/rape-accused-hangs-self-in-police-lock-up-in-hamirpur/articleshow/84841646.cms||---

The bakery owner was booked for employing the boy for the second time despite being warned during a raid in February. A joint team of volunteers of Sevai Child Line and Child labour elimination and effective rehabilitation society (CHEERS) rescued the boy from Iyengar bakery at Kajapettai on Tuesday. Proprietor J Chandrasekar, 40, was booked under sections of child and adolescent labour (prohibition and regulation) Act 1986 (Amendment Act 2016), Juvenile Justice (care and protection) Act and IPC for employing the boy. Sevai Child Line project coordinator M Ashraf Ali told TOI that the boy informed their volunteers over phone that he wanted to study a course in Industrial Training Institute (ITI) but his family’s financial crisis is preventing him from pursuing his dream. “After completing Class X, he joined the bakery last year. During a child labour eradication drive in February, we rescued him and warned the employer of severe action. Due to the closure of institutions because of the lockdown and poverty, he was forced to work in the same bakery again. But the employer refused to let him go when he expressed his desire to study further,” said Ashraf Ali. The boy is the second child of a poor woman from Musiri and has an elder brother and younger sister. Since the family was struggling financially after his father’s demise five years ago, he chose to give up his studies and earn for the family. On being rescued, the boy was produced before the child welfare committee (CWC) in Trichy on Wednesday. CWC chairperson R Kamala and members summoned his mother and advised her to enrol him in an ITI in their area. “His mother promised to admit the boy in an ITI in Musiri. The boy is in our care and we will hand him over to her after the admission in ITI,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/child-labourer-rescued-from-trichy-bakery-for-2nd-time/articleshow/84838778.cms||Gokul Rajendran
---||Delhi||Delhi govt plans IT shield to ward off cyber threats||NEW DELHI: Delhi government is going to carry out a major security audit of all its IT systems, websites, web-enabled applications, web services and mobile applications against any cyberattack or threat. The government is working towards greater e-governance and many of its services are now available online. It feels that with the growth of web-enabled applications, mobile apps, web services, etc, attacks and threats have also become more sophisticated and it wants its applications to be ahead of the curve through constant innovation and evolution. Delhi eGovernance Society, which comes under the Delhi government’s department of information technology, has floated a request for proposal (RFP) to select a cyber security agency to conduct a comprehensive security audit for the IT system of the state government, its various departments, local bodies and autonomous bodies. The audit will involve finding out the vulnerabilities of the government's IT system against more sophisticated cyberattacks and ways to secure the system against such threats. The RFP says that a deliberate attack can be either a malicious attempt to gain unauthorised access to an IT system, such as through password guessing to compromise system and data integrity, availability, or confidentiality or a benign, but nonetheless purposeful, attempt to circumvent system security. “New threats are evolving day-by-day with the evolving technology and hence organisations face challenges to maintain security of their information security assets. Often organisations leverage new technologies to extend their functionality and reach more clients and partners and hence their exposure to risk grows continuously,” it states. The RFP states a rapid growth in discovered vulnerabilities in applications makes it easier for an attacker to find a path into a network. “In-house and commercially developed applications often put speedy development and convenience over security, which results in vulnerabilities such as authentication bypass, SQL Injection, cross site scripting etc.” It says that applications are also a preferred target for attackers, as they almost always allow access into internal resources through the firewall. The vulnerabilities and security issues could include broken authentication, broken access controls, weak passwords, weak session management, forceful browsing, broken session management, ‘cookie poisoning’, denial-of-service, parameter tampering, week cryptography, improper error handling, third party misconfigurations, information leakage, server misconfigurations, form/hidden field manipulation, insecure use of cryptography, back doors and debug options, errors triggering sensitive information leak, CGI-BIN manipulation, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-plans-it-shield-to-ward-off-cyber-threats/articleshow/84841270.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Card fraudster out on bail shops with victims’ money||AHMEDABAD: You would think that an accused out on bail would lie low and try to avoid the eyes of the law. But this doesn’t seem to be the case with Harshwardhan Parmar, a class 12 passout who was caught for allegedly executing a stunning scam that targeted more than 25,000 foreign nationals from nearly 40 countries. Out of jail, the 21-year-old resident of Isanpur was allegedly back to his old tricks using credit and debit cards of his victims to shop for goods that he resold for cash. "We believe he has committed a scam totalling Rs 20 lakh in June," said police. “We got to know that he had shopped for various items including electrical appliances from shops on Ashram Road and Iskcon Crossroads,” said a cop from the city crime branch. “Parmar has followed the same modus operandi of using the credit and debit card details of victims to buy costly devices which he either sold to local shopkeepers for cash or gifted to some of his friends. However, we are gathering more evidence to nail him,” he added. The city crime branch officers said that they are trying to charge Parmar under the prevention of anti-social activities act (PASA) as he has become a habitual offender. If the police slap PASA charge against Parmar, then he would probably be the first person to be booked under the act even when no victim has approached cops with a cheating complaint. The 21-year-old had committed the Rs 5-crore fraud in just 100 days, and in such a manner that the victims probably still have no clue what happened to their money, officials of the cyber cell of Ahmedabad crime branch had revealed earlier. Apart from the city police, personnel from the local intelligence bureau (IB) have been keeping a watch on Parmar and his activities. Parmar first hogged the headlines when he was caught by city police in a card buying scam in March 2021. The police received an input that someone from Ahmedabad was bypassing the traditional internet service to access the dark web and shop for premium goods and services by defrauding foreigners. “Parmar used to buy credit and debit card details — the card numbers, CVV and expiry date — from websites run by Russian hackers. He used these cards to shop for goods and fund a lavish lifestyle. An analysis of data retrieved from his laptop revealed that he had reportedly scammed people from at least 40 countries including the US, the UK, Japan, France, Australia, and even Ghana,” said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/card-fraudster-out-on-bail-shops-with-victims-money/articleshow/84838868.cms||Ashish Chauhan

The government on March 27 had declared mucormycosis an epidemic. “Residents of Delhi undergoing treatment of Mucormycosis in Delhi Govt hospital can be referred to empanelled private hospitals under this cashless scheme for the treatment,” Jain tweeted. He also shared a copy of an official memorandum issued in connection with the extension of the scheme for such patients. In the last two years, Delhi has recorded over 1,600 cases of mucormycosis. Of these, 952 were active as of July 6, according to official data. “There is limited capacity for performing surgeries pertaining to mucormycosis in Delhi government hospitals,” reads the official memorandum shared by Jain along with his tweet. In view of it, the health minister-cum-chairman, Delhi Arogya Kosh, has approved that eligible patients undergoing treatment for mucormycosis in Delhi government hospitals “may be referred to empanelled private hospitals under the cashless surgery scheme, if the allotted date of surgery in Delhi government hospital concerned is beyond seven days,” it said. Under Delhi Arogya Kosh, the government provides financial assistance to the extent of Rs 5 lakh to the needy eligible patients for treatment of any illness in government hospitals. Only residents of Delhi, identified based on a voter identification card, will be considered eligible to avail the scheme. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-health-scheme-to-cover-mucormycosis-cases-up-to-rs-5l/articleshow/84841350.cms||---

Kirola was returning from duty from a nearby village on a scooty. While the scooty was found 100m away from the spot where the accident occurred, Kirola is yet to be found. Villagers said it was still dark when Kirola was trying to cross the stream, which is probably why he did not realise that there was a strong current in it. On getting to know about the accident from villagers, tehsildar Hemant Kumar Mehra and station officer Ashok Kandpal reached the spot along with relief and rescue teams. A search operation was carried out for hours within a 16km radius of the spot (Masi to Bhikiyasain) from where the home guard went missing. While the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) are still searching for him, Kirola’s family is worried he may not have made it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/24-yr-old-home-guard-swept-away-in-swollen-stream-in-almora/articleshow/84836373.cms||---

The officials said surveillance is on to catch water or vector-borne illnesses that could trigger coinfections — cases with both malaria and Covid-19, for example. “Authorities have been told to keep up Covid safety in relief camps and wherever there are chances of crowding,” an official said. The official said vaccine allotment will be increased for flood-hit Ratnagiri, Raigad, Sangli, Kolhapur, Satara and Sindhudurg. State immunization officer Dr DN Patil said, “More doses will be given to such districts than the routine disbursement.” State disease surveillance officer, Pradeep Awate, said over 600 medical teams have been dispatched to the districts for disease control. Awate said, “The teams are identifying if there are cases of coinfections with Covid, like leptospirosis or dengue or malaria.” Cases of leptospirosis, endemic to Konkan, can also go up after floods. “We have identified high-risk leptospirosis groups in these regions and are giving doxycycline tablets to the high-risk population as chemoprophylaxis,” Awate said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/health-teams-race-to-prevent-coinfections-in-flood-hit-areas/articleshow/84841347.cms||Neha Madaan

The 2009 batch officer, who hails from Pune, was serving as the police superintendent of Cachar in Assam. “Nimbalkar underwent a three-hour surgery to remove (bullet) shell pieces from the body. The next step is to prevent infection,” a family member said. His condition is stable, said Mumbai DCP N Ambika, who was Nimbalkar’s batchmate.

---||Delhi||Nearly 1 crore Delhiites have taken at least one shot of Covid vaccine||NEW DELHI: While the limited availability of Covid-19 vaccines has affected the pace of inoculation in Delhi, around one crore doses have been administered to the approximately 1.5 crore eligible beneficiaries. The government has currently stopped giving Covishield to first-dose recipients and has put aside only 20% available doses of Covaxin for the same group. This has resulted in a higher number of second doses being given daily. A government official claimed that despite Delhi government pressuring the central government to provide it with more vaccines, the supply was limited, forcing the state to restrict the vaccines to certain categories. On Wednesday, just three days stocks were available for the 877 vaccination centres in Delhi. At 5pm on Wednesday, 98.3 lakh individuals had received one or both doses of the vaccine in Delhi. Of them, 56.5 lakh are men, and 41.8 lakh women. While 24.5 lakh people were fully vaccinated, having received both doses, the first-dose recipients numbered 73.2 lakh. “Nearly three times more people have received the first dose of vaccine compared with those who are fully vaccinated. One reason for this may be the long waiting time for the second dose of Covishield,” explained a government official. Apart from the limited availability of vaccines, the different vaccine gaps Covishield and Covaxin were also factors for the restricted approach to inoculation. “The turnout for the second dose has increased since July 22 due to more vaccines being routed for the second dose,” said an official. On July 21, only 33,443 people got the second dose of the vaccine, while 48,640 received the second dose on July 24. Many people who were Covid-positive in April-May are now eligible for the first dose after a gap of three months. Delhi suspended the administration of the first dose of Covaxin on July 7. On July 12, the government ordered that only 20% of the Covaxin stock was to be used for the first dose. On July 22, vaccine use for the first dose of Covishield was restricted till July 31. This caused a lot of inconvenience. People hoping to get their first dose were turned back from vaccination centres. “Every day, some people turn up at the government centres for the first dose and return home disappointed,” admitted a district vaccination officer. Due to these restrictions, and apprehensive of a possible resurgence in infection, many people are approaching private hospitals for their first doses. “The restrictions are not applicable to the private hospitals. Anyone who has received the first dose in the private sector can get the second dose in the government centres or vice versa,” said an officer. Among the 73.2 lakh first-dose recipients, 36 lakh belong to the 18-44 age group, 30.2 lakh to the 45+ group, 2.6 lakh are healthcare workers and 4.4 lakh, frontline workers. Of the 24.5 lakh who have received both the doses, 16.9 lakh belong to the 45+ age group, 2.5 lakh in the 18-44 age group, while two lakh are healthcare workers and 2.9 lakh, frontline workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nearly-1-cr-delhiites-have-taken-at-least-one-shot-of-covid-vax/articleshow/84841343.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Pune||In pregnant women, vaccine side-effects minor and temporary: Pune survey||Pune: A survey in Pune of 106 vaccinated pregnant women found that most experienced only minor and temporary side-effects after the Covid jab. Some of the women in the analysis, carried out by gynaecologists from Gupte Hospital, reported itches, rashes and regular side-effects like fatigue, headaches and fever. A few reported high blood pressure and loose motion. But all the symptoms were temporary with no lasting impact on health, the doctors said. “Some of the post-inoculation side-effects like itching and rash were unusual. A rise in blood pressure was also observed in a few. But we want to emphasise that all these effects were transient (temporary) and no lasting effect was seen in the pregnant women,” said Gupte Hospital’s chief gynaecologist Sanjay Gupte. He added, “The observations are reassuring. More women should shun hesitancy and get the Covid-19 shot.” Some of the surveyed women did not even report symptoms. “Twenty of the 106 pregnant women we followed up with after their shot did not have any symptoms. Not all pregnant women have post-jab side-effects,” Gupte said. Experts have said minor side-effects are normal signs that indicate the immune system is mounting a protective response after the jab, although they are not universal. Some women in the survey had a mix of symptoms, including fatigue, headache and fever. “But all symptoms were self-resolving and a few needed not more than a paracetamol,” Gupte said. The Covid vaccines can be taken at any stage of pregnancy. “The shots are safe in all the three trimesters. In fact, Covid during pregnancy can be very serious for both mother and foetus,” Gupte said. The survey’s findings were welcomed by other doctors. “The Pune study has reinforced the safety profile of the Covid vaccines,” said gynaecologist Pankaj Sarode, vice-president of the Pune Obsterics and Gynaecological Society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/in-pregnant-women-vax-side-effects-minor-and-temporary-pune-survey/articleshow/84841388.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Ludhiana||Erratic supply hits vaccination, fresh supply to come today after five days||Ludhiana: With the possibility of the third wave looming large, the immunization authorities are finding it difficult to vaccinate the 18-plus category persons due to erratic supply of vaccines. The department officials said even as they have to inoculate around 25 to 26 lakh persons who are above 18 years of age, the immunisation authorities have undertaken 14,41,147 vaccinations, including first and second doses, till July 24. They said of these, 11,49,957 persons have received the first dose and 2,91,190 both. On July 23, the health department had got a stock of 19,000 vaccines, which was utilised the next day. Now, the stock of 30,000 vaccines is expected to arrive on Thursday. So, it will be after four days that inoculation will restart in Ludhiana. District immunisation officer (DIO) Dr Puneet Juneja said even as they had set a target of jabbing the eligible population by August 15, they were unlikely to achieve it because of irregular supply. He said they would vaccinate maximum eligible persons with whatever stock they get and there was a demand for vaccination in the district. Giving vaccination data, the health department officials said of around 16 lakh persons between 18 and 45 years of age, around 4.5 lakh have got at least one dose. They added that of nine lakh persons above 45 years age group, more than 5.5 lakh persons have got the first dose. Dr Rajinder Gulati, former senior medical officer (SMO), said, “Vaccination is important because of the probability of the third wave. However, there is a limitation as vaccine production is less. Besides, people need to take preventive measures, including wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and avoiding crowded places.”Many residents are waiting to get themselves jabbed.“I am keen to get myself inoculated and waiting for the vaccine stock to arrive,” said Ranjeet Singh, a city resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/erratic-supply-hits-vaccination-fresh-supply-to-come-today-after-five-days/articleshow/84836455.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||Delhi||Delhi: DDA Janta Flat owners told to repair or raze ‘dangerous’ buildings||NEW DELHI: The residents of Delhi Development Authority Janta Flats in Paschim Vihar have been issued notices by North Delhi Municipal Corporation stating that the buildings they are living in are in a dangerous condition and need urgent repairs. The notices further state that either retrofitting should be carried out or the buildings should be demolished. However, the residents complained that a few flats owned by government departments on the ground floor were lying vacant for the past 20 years and they were being indirectly penalised. Subarno Mukherjee, who purchased his flat around four years ago, said DDA originally allotted the properties around 32 years ago. “There are 30 flats in this row out of which 16 are occupied and 14 have been lying vacant from a long time. These empty flats on the ground floor are owned by government departments. A dispensary used to run from these premises. No maintenance was done and we are indirectly being held responsible for properties that do not belong to us,” he added. The notices were issued in the first half of June. “Our flats are repaired regularly. The pillars of the buildings are on the ground floor. We are being asked to carry out a structural audit. Even if we agree to help in the repairs, how can we break into the locked flats?” asked Mukherjee. One such notice issued by an assistant engineer mentioned that the buildings could be hazardous for residents as well as passersby and the owners should either demolish or retrofit the structures in the next 15 days. “Please note that if the directions are not acted upon in this time period, then as per the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957, we will act without any warning,” it added. Rajinder Pal, another resident, said they received a notice on June 12. They gave a representation that they were carrying out repairs at regular intervals. “We have been asking the municipal engineers about the owners of the locked flats on the ground floor, but have received no replies. A Delhi government dispensary used to be run from this place. How do we get the structure of these flats checked? How is it our responsibility?” he asked. A senior municipal official said that dangerous buildings were identified during the annual surveys so that there was no damage to property or risk to the lives of people living there. “Structural safety audits are being sought on the orders of the Delhi high court with regard to earthquakes and seismic stability of high-risk buildings,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/janta-flat-owners-told-to-repair-or-raze-dangerous-buildings/articleshow/84841443.cms||---

The petition has demanded an SIT inquiry into the allegations. Naithani is now the director, National Health Mission. The bench of chief justice R S Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma heard the petition, filed by Haridwar resident Kapil Dev, on Wednesday and issued notices to the state government as well as director general of health and Naithani. The court has given them four weeks to respond. According to the PIL, Naithani served as CMO Haridwar for almost 11 months till July 2020 but during her tenure there have been several discrepancies in the promotions of the ANM workers as well as appointments done under the National Health Mission. The petition added that these anomalies were earlier reported by the BJP MLA from Haridwar as well after which an inquiry was set up. The inquiry largely confirmed the anomalies but did not indict her. In fact, it put the ball in the court of the finance department, saying that exercise involved analyzing documents of the finance department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-issues-notice-to-ex-cmo-haridwar-over-allegations-of-corruption/articleshow/84836475.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Dehradun||BJP government framing unwarranted laws; if voted to office, will scrap them: Uttarakhand Congress chief||DEHRADUN: Launching an attack on the incumbent government in Uttarakhand, Ganesh Godiyal, the new Congress chief for the hill state, said that instead of focusing on development, the BJP government is framing unwarranted laws like the Char Devasthanam Board Management Board Act. He added that if voted to office, Congress will scrap all unnecessary laws imposed in the last four and a half years. “We already had a Badri-Kedar Temple Committee (BKTC) — that looked after the management of Kedarnath and Badrinath shrines — and there were committees for Gangotri and Yamunotri temples as well. So, what was the need to bring in the Char Devasthanam Board Management Board Act, especially when the priests were not in favour of it,” Godiyal told TOI. Godiyal, who has served as the chairman of BKTC, said, “In my term as the chairman of the committee, the total earning of the Kedarnath and Badrinath temples went up from Rs 7 crore to Rs 40 crore. During the Harish Rawat-led Congress government in the state, massive infrastructural works were carried out in the Char Dham towns. However, the incumbent government is just eying to pocket money from the shrines.” On the issue of allowing people from other states to purchase as much land as they want in Uttarakhand, Godiyal said, “This decision is completely against the state residents who have small landholdings. Outsiders buying plots in bulk for investment will lead to large scale migration and deprive the locals of land. If they claim that the law has been amended to open doors for investment in hills, they must tell the people of Uttarakhand how many factories were set up on the land sold to the people of other states.” Coming to the appointment of Lokayukta – for which the BJP government brought a Bill in the state assembly in 2017 but could not get it passed in the House – he said, “Let me assure that if voted to power, we will appoint Lokayukta, make changes in land law, and scrap the Devasthanam Board Act.” Talking about the poll preparations of the Congress, Godiyal said, “The state elections are barely six months away and there is an urgent need to reach out to far-flung and remotest of the areas. Our party has constituted a big team — comprising senior leaders and young functionaries — to reach out to more and more people.” He said that a core party meeting has been called next week to discuss the poll preparations. “The party committees have been given a week to chalk out strategies and come up with an elaborate poll plan.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bjp-govt-framing-unwarranted-laws-if-voted-to-office-will-scrap-them-ukhand-cong-chief/articleshow/84836485.cms||Kautilya Singh

Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Kapoor, however, said the AAP spokesperson was misleading the public. “Bhardwaj should know that the company handling the trommel machines contract will operate them round the clock to dispose of the garbage. The company will also bring in its own loaders and trucks to remove the sand generated by trommels,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-says-will-probe-graft-by-civic-bodies/articleshow/84841420.cms||---

The state has more than 110 paediatricians and all of them are undergoing PICU training,” he said. Infrastructure for paediatrics is ready at GMC and at the superspecialty block, Bandekar added. On the influx of tourists into the state, Bandekar said testing is already under way at borders and added that this doesn’t come under GMC’s purview. However, the GMC dean said he is “really concerned”. When asked if he would advise the government to keep a check on this, he said, “We have given necessary suggestions in our expert committee report.” When asked why the daily Covid deaths are not declining, Bandekar said these are patients who were admitted a long time back and were on ventilators with chronic diseases. “Some have become negative but have complications of lung fibrosis,” he said. GMC’s superspecialty block currently has 14 patients in the ICU, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/there-is-possibility-of-third-wave-but-cant-say-if-it-will-affect-only-kids-gmc-dean/articleshow/84843505.cms||---

---||Delhi||Capsule-size pacemaker gives new lease of life to Jammu-based man||NEW DELHI: A Jammu-based businessman has received a new lease of life after undergoing a surgery in a city hospital to get a new ‘capsule-size’ pacemaker to treat his heart rhythm condition, doctors said on Wednesday. The surgery was performed recently at Max Hospital in Saket, by a team of doctors, led by Dr Balbir Singh, chairman of cardiac sciences at the facility. “The capsule-sized pacemaker is 93 per cent smaller than conventional pacemakers and needs a minimally invasive approach. It could potentially benefit a larger section of the people in India who undergo pacemaker surgery every year,” Dr Singh added. Sharma, who hails from Jammu and Kashmir, had earlier experienced sudden increase in his heart rate while playing with his children and had a blackout following such an activity. Sensing something serious, he consulted a doctor locally and then took a second opinion from Dr Singh. The doctor at Jammu suggested a few tests, including Holter monitoring, which showed missing heartbeats. In this condition called bradycardia, the heart beats slower than the normal rate, which can be corrected by a pacemaker which sends electrical signals to the heart to correct the heart beat. “After careful consideration of the patient’s condition and the test results, we knew that a pacemaker surgery was needed to avoid potentially serious consequences. I suggested the pacemaker to Sharma to minimise any risk, since he had elevated blood sugar and blood pressure levels,” said Dr Singh. He added that the patient was initially apprehensive of the full-fledged surgery and anxious of the restrictions that come with implants. “Some of my patients felt slight discomfort with the traditional pacemaker, which is placed under the skin in the chest. At times it could potentially lead to chances of an infection. But the new leadless pacemaker has minimised the risk of pocket infections like inflammatory skin changes, including pain, swelling, redness, etc,” he claimed. Since this advanced pacemaker is placed inside the heart via a vein in the leg, the chest incision is avoided and it also “does not create a scar or a bump under the skin,” he said. A spokesperson of the team said the surgery was held on May 29 and this smaller pacemaker costs Rs 14 lakh on an average.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/capsule-size-pacemaker-gives-new-lease-of-life-to-jammu-based-man/articleshow/84841451.cms||---

Recently, three vehicles got stuck in a sinkhole near the Shyamal Crossroads. Cranes had to be called by the car owners to retrieve their vehicles. The city is barely halfway into monsoon season and 47 sinkholes have already appeared on city roads. These occurred near Himalaya Mall, Nilgiri Society junction, outside Sagar Society, on Science City Road, at Mansi Crossroads, Mahalaxmi Crossroads, near Roundtable School and at Shyamal Crossroads, among other places. Data from the flood control office of the AMC shows that three sinkholes had appeared in the Jodhpur area, two spots each in Bodakdev, Ghatlodia, Stadium and Gota areas. The highest number of sinkhole incidents occurred in 2017, when 111 such holes puckered the city across all municipal zones. “Last year there were 54 such instances. The number of incidents has surely come down since 2017, as a number of three decade old lines in the West and East zones have been replaced,” said a senior AMC engineer in the drainage department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/47-sinkholes-this-year-and-counting/articleshow/84839013.cms||---
---||Varanasi||Rajbhar to women: Beat BJP people who come to you seeking votes||Varanasi: Targetting former alliance partner Bharatiya Janata Party (BSP), Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief Om Prakash Rajbhar has called on the women voters to “beat the BJP people who come to them seeking votes." “BJP wale vote mangne do pair pe aye, to unko char pair pe wapas bhejo (when BJP people come to you seeking your vote on two legs, thrash them so that they go back with the support of others),” Rajbhar said during SBSP women’s convention in Varanasi on Tuesday. He justified his assertion again when TOI spoke to him Wednesday. “ Yes, I told the women present at Tuesday’s meeting that if BJP leaders have not fulfilled their promises of ensuring a 33% quota for them and checking inflation, they should be sent on four legs (carried away by others) if they come to seek your votes again,” he said. Earlier, while addressing the gathering of women on Tuesday, he said, “They (BJP leaders) consume ganja and daru (liquor) and start making tall promises in their speech. On their call, the women folk opened bank accounts but did not get Rs 15 lakhs as promised. Promise of two crore jobs has also remained unfulfilled while the price of LPG, pulses and mustard oil has increased massively.” “As they have turned a blind eye to the issues faced by the women, you should operate on them for their cataract,” Rajbhar said, mentioning that the BJP leaders should be given warm welcome on their arrival and after offering water they should be thrashed for not fulfilling their promises. Regarding distribution of free ration, he said , “By giving wheat and rice free of cost, the BJP-led governments at the Centre and state are trying to make the poor population slaves.” About the bid of political parties to woo the Brahmin voters, Rajbhar said, “The Britishers had to quit India after they killed one Brahmin. In this BJP regime, thousands of Brahmins have been killed in police encounters. Vikas (Dubey) was killed in a police encounter. Today, Brahmin is standing at a crossroads. He has to decide where he has to go. Showing faith to a party (Bahujan Samaj Party) that had given a slogan ‘Tilak, taraju aur talwar, inko maro jutey chaar’ is also proving difficult for them,” he said, claiming Brahmins were looking towards him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/rajbhar-to-women-beat-bjp-people-who-come-to-you-seeking-votes/articleshow/84841482.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Delhi doctor is first proven case of 3 Covid infections, 2 times after vax||MUMBAI: A 61-year-old Delhi doctor is the first proven case to have suffered from three Covid infections—two of these SARS-CoV-2 bouts were caused by its Alpha and Delta variants 22 days apart. “The second and third infections occurred after she took both her Covid vaccine shots and had developed antibodies,” said Dr Jayanthi Shastri, head of the BMC-run Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory in Kasturba Hospital who is the lead author of a study tracing the doctor’s Covid infections. On July 27, TOI reported about a Mulund-based doctor Dr Shrushti Halari who had tested RT-PCR positive three times and, like the Delhi doctor, twice after being fully vaccinated. However, as reinfections can only be established through whole genome sequencing and the Mulund doctor’s samples are still under study, the unnamed Delhi doctor becomes the first proven case. The study, a joint collaboration between BMC’s Kasturba Hospital and Delhi-based CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, was on Wednesday accepted for publication in international peer-reviewed medical journal, ‘Frontiers in Medicine’. One of the co-authors, Dr Swapneil Parikh, said the team has coined a new term “breakthrough reinfection” to mark the case. While the term describes an infection that occurs roughly 15 days after taking a vaccine for it, ‘breakthrough reinfections’ highlights the Delhi doctor’s two infections—or reinfections—after full vaccination. The US Centers for Diseases Control states the average time between reinfections is between 45 and 90 days and infection with different clades or genetic types. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) timeframe is 104 days. “However, our Mumbai-Delhi scientific collaboration has established that the doctor got reinfections in 19 days,” said Dr Shastri. The doctor-patient was first infected in August 2020 and she took her vaccine shots on February 1 and March 15. She tested positive for the second and third time on April 12 and May 3, respectively, with a negative test report in between. During the period between two infections, doctor-patient tended to her husband who developed Covid-19 as well. The study’s second author Dr Rajesh Pandey from IGIB said that the husband’s swab samples, too, were collected and sequenced. “We found he was infected with the Delta variant, which over a few days affected his wife as well,” said Dr Pandey. The study showed that the doctor-patient had developed antibodies after her second infection and even had vaccine-induced antibodies. ``The combination of vaccine immunity and natural infection immunity usually produces a very robust hybrid immunity. Therefore any reinfection after a breakthrough ought to be uncommon and severe breakthrough reinfections even rarer still,’’ said Dr Parikh. The doctor-patient needed hospitalisation during her third infection, which dragged on for over 45 days. She is, however, doing well at present. Dr Pandey said the study captured a “rare event” with all scientific material documenting clinical, genomic, epidemiological and radiological findings. The study underlines the need to be vigilant against Covid. The US CDC on Tuesday advised fully vaccinated people to continue using mask even at home. “One cannot let their guard down against SARS-CoV-2 yet,” said Dr Shastri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/delhi-doc-is-first-proven-case-of-3-covid-infections-2-times-after-vax/articleshow/84843796.cms||Malathy Iyer

The ASP also posted the letter on social media which went viral. IG Varanasi range SK Bhagat, who is probing the matter on the directives of ADG Varanasi zone Brij Bhushan, said: “I am still looking into the episode. According to available information, after the ASP (operations) Chandauli detected irregularities in the records of police lines, a heated argument took place between him and the RI.” He added, “The showdown took place in a closed room where only the ASP and RI were present. Now, both are levelling serious allegations against each other. Their separate statements are being recorded.” SP Chandauli Amit Kumar initially probed the matter. The ASP’s action of posting his complaint letter, marked to the DGP, ADG Varanasi zone, IG Varanasi range, chief minister, principal secretary home, SC/ST commissions at the Centre and state on social media, is also being viewed as an act of indiscipline by senior officials. Bhagat said that he would soon submit his investigation report to the senior officials after which the action would be taken in this episode. The spat between the ASP (operations) Chandauli and RI came to light after the former’s complaint letter went viral on social media. In his letter, the ASP stated that on July 20 he had inspected the police lines and sought the appointment register to see the details. The junior staff informed him that all such appointments were being done by the RI and no record was being maintained, the ASP alleged in his viral letter. Following this, he gave the RI time to initiate corrective measure. On Tuesday, the ASP summoned the RI with a register when the showdown took place between them, officials confirmed. Later, the ASP in his letter alleged that the RI not only made casteist remarks against him but also threatened him. Taking serious note of the episode, ADG Varanasi zone asked the IG to probe the matter. The ADG said that any action in this episode would be initiated after the investigation is complete.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/chandauli-asp-writes-to-police-brass-against-ri-probe-ordered/articleshow/84841510.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The PIL was filed by Doon-based NGO, Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra (RLEK), arguing that the Advocates Act of 1961 provides for Rs 750 as registration fee, however, the Bar Council of Uttarakhand is charging Rs 18,650 to almost Rs 40,000 from candidates above the age of 40 years. The petitioners argued that such high charges are now allowed by the Advocates Act. “The purpose of providing Rs 750 for the entire country as an enrolment fee for an advocate is that the Parliament wanted to keep it uniform and affordable for even the weakest candidate. There are several law graduates who cannot afford such fees and, therefore, the rules are prohibitive in nature,” said Kartikey Hari Gupta, the counsel appearing for petitioners. The court has given the respondents four weeks to file their counter-affidavits and listed the case for further hearing after that.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/pil-challenges-high-registration-fees-charged-by-the-ukhand-bar-council/articleshow/84836596.cms||Prashant Jha

This project will complete in a year after which the airspace will become fully fortified, he added. The airport officials said that currently the LBSI airport is equipped with secondary radar system as airport surveillance radar (ASR), which covers 250 nautical miles. Apart from the advanced version of secondary radar system the airport will also be equipped with primary radar system that typically controls traffic within a radius of 60 nautical of the airport below an elevation of 25,000 feet, added the officials. Arrival of the advanced primary radar system, which is installed at large airports, will not only detect and display the presence and position of aircrafts in the terminal area but will also help in detecting even small objects like drones, small aircrafts and choppers in the airspace around the airports, said the officials adding that it will also give weather and cloud information.

---||Delhi||HC stays Rs 25,000 cost on police in northeast Delhi riots case||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Wednesday stayed the Rs 25,000 cost slapped on Delhi Police by a trial court in a case related to northeast Delhi riots. However, the bench refused to interfere with the trial court’s strictures against the police investigation, saying that it would like to hear police and the complainant before expunging the remarks. Justice Subramonium Prasad’s partial relief came while hearing police’s challenge to the trial court order calling the probe in one of the cases “callous and farcical” and imposing Rs 25,000 cost. The trial court order came on a challenge to a magistrate’s direction to police to register an FIR on the complaint of Mohammad Nasir, who lost his left eye after suffering a gunshot injury during the riots. The high court issued notice on Delhi Police’s plea against the trial court order and sought response of Nasir in 10 days. Additional solicitor general S V Raju, appearing for police, said that, at present, the main grievance was against the costs and the strictures. He also maintained that an FIR into the alleged incident had already been thoroughly investigated and the accused was not found at the spot at the relevant time. Advocate Mehmood Pracha, representing the complainant, alleged that police’s stand was misleading, and his client was under “tremendous pressure to withdraw” his pleas before the court. In its challenge to the trial court order, police said the fine, which was to be recovered from the station house officer (SHO) of Bhajanpura police station and his supervising officers, was unwarranted and uncalled for. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav in his order had pulled up police for lack of fairness in the investigation and said it was done in a most casual, callous, and farcical manner. Police had submitted that there was no need to register a separate FIR based on the complaint as it had already registered one earlier. They added that there was no evidence against the people who allegedly shot him as they were not present in Delhi at the time of the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-stays-rs-25000-cost-on-police-in-ne-riots-case/articleshow/84841557.cms||---

Led by senior counsels, the delegation submitted a representation signed by over 250 lawyers apprising him of various problems faced by them and litigants due to virtual hearings. After detailed discussions, CJ assured that distinguishing points raised in their representation for checking out the possibilities of restarting regular working will be positively considered. The CJ was in Nagpur from Monday and sat in a division bench for hearing various matters. Those who met him in the HC included senior lawyers -- MG Bhangde, Subodh Dharmadhikari, Sunil Manohar, Anand Jaiswal, Surendra Mishra, RL Khapre, and Mukesh Samarth. High Court Bar Association (HCBA) office bearers – president Gauri Venkatraman, vice-president Purushottam Patil and secretary Prafulla Khubalkar also accompanied them along with Shridhar Purohit, Harish Dangre, Sudhir Puranik and Deven Chauhan. According to the lawyers, the HC hardly worked for three and half months in regular mode for the last one and half years since the outbreak of Covid. “Even litigants are suffering due to pendency of cases. It’s high time that apart from urgent cases, others too need to be listed. We have been continuously receiving enquiries from panicked clients whose cases are not progressing since the last one and half years. Their worries are genuine and we, as lawyers, have no answers to their queries,” they said. “We would ensure strict compliance of Covid related SOPs, once the regular working resumes. After resuming physical working, if any time it was noticed that the virus is once again spreading, we will immediately shift into virtual mode,” they said. Briefing the CJ on the prevailing situation, the delegation stated that it was normalized in the city and also in Vidarbha, as the Covid-19 cases dropped significantly. “The current situation is safer than the earlier one when physical hearing resumed in January and February. Moreover, the maximum number of lawyers are vaccinated. Even the premises of HC and other courts have spacious bar rooms, common rooms and corridors. Therefore, there’s hardly any problem of overcrowding and congestion,” they said. Stressing that the virtual hearing can’t be a substitute to physical hearing, the lawyers said those weren’t hassle free and often participants face connectivity issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lawyers-delegation-urges-cj-to-restart-physical-hearing-in-hc/articleshow/84836606.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Sreekumar sought transit bail from the court apprehending arrest by the CBI till he obtains anticipatory bail from the Kerala high court. While Sreekumar’s advocate, M M Tirmizi, sought time to reply to the CBI’s affidavit, additional solicitor general S V Raju opposed granting any leniency and submitted, “This is a gross case involving sabotage of India’s cryogenic rocket engine programme at the instance of foreign powers like Pakistan’s ISI so that India does not make these engines and a hurdle is created in its space programme. The targets were top scientists involved in the programme.

---||Madurai||HC hears Bar’s views on right to privacy of acquitted people||Madurai: Madras high court on Wednesday elaborately heard members of the Bar from Madurai and Chennai for nearly five hours on the right to privacy of acquitted people so as to decide on a plea moved by a man seeking to redact (obscured for legal or security purposes) his name from a judgment which had acquitted him from a criminal case.The man who was convicted and sentenced for rape and cheating by trial court in 2011 and subsequently acquitted by HC in 2014, had moved HC Madurai bench seeking to redact his name from the judgment. At the previous hearing, the court had chosen to hear the views of members of the Bar, including the prosecution, before passing a detailed order.On Wednesday, Justice N Anand Venkatesh asked members of the Bar whether a uniform practice was required where the court should direct the search engines to redact the name when it decides to acquit a man during appeal or revision. Also, whether such redaction could be granted only to those approaching the court or a general direction be issued. The judge also sought submissions on the procedural aspects.Advocate R Gandhi said that as per the Supreme Court judgment in Justice K S Puttaswamy (retd) vs Union of India case, right to privacy is fundamental right. Once a person is acquitted, then he should be entitled to right to privacy as his name remaining in records would cause mental agony to him and affect his future.Advocate Abudu Kumar Rajaratnam submitted that it is the duty cast upon the courts to protect the right of dignity of a man acquitted. He suggested that the court could frame regulations or procedures to deal with such cases. Advocate Sanjay Pinto said every person who is acquitted should be entitled to a clean slate. Adverse inferences are drawn when a person answers 'yes' to a standard question asked about criminal proceedings asked in visa, college and job applications though the person may have been acquitted. He urged the court to uphold the privacy of acquitted individuals as right to privacy is a fundamental right.Advocate Arun Anbumani submitted that redaction of name in the order by which an individual is acquitted is not required as it would only be a proof for acquittal. If a person chooses to redact his name in court order, his name would remain in other records such as FIR, remand report, prison record, bail applications. He stated that we do not have a robust system for expungement and sealing of records like the one in the US. Advocate V Balasubramanian said that a dedicated framework is required to deal with such kinds of cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-hears-bars-views-on-right-to-privacy-of-acquitted-people/articleshow/84839077.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Police said he had died of a health problem, and decided to shift the body to a mortuary to conduct an autopsy. It was while checking his bag that the police stumbled on the two passbooks. From the passbook, they found out that he belonged to Nagamalai Pudukottai in the district. Police said Radha was a bachelor and had accumulated his savings in the accounts. He was taken care of by a sister and a brother. He became mentally ill a few years ago and was admitted to Government Rajaji Hospital. After he left the hospital, his relatives could not trace him.

The city has got recognition in the Cycle4India Challenge organized by the Union urban affairs ministry. The ministry has awarded 11 cities; Nagpur, Bengaluru, Bhubaneswar, Chandigarh, Kohima, New Town Kolkata and Surat, in the Cycle4India Challenge competition. These cities will get Rs1 crore each as incentive from the central government. Fourteen other cities have been recognized for their work. The Union urban ministry mentioned Nagpur as a shining example of listening to citizens at every stage of the process of popularizing cycling among the people.  Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari and municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B have congratulated the Smart City team for the achievement. “Measures are being taken to make cycling a priority for an increasing number of citizens in the city,” said Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) CEO Buvaneshwari S. A whopping 15,000 people responded to a survey by the city highlighting their barriers to cycling. These learnings shaped the city’s plans to improve cycling. The city administration went back to the people with its plans, and worked with Resident Welfare Associations to identify neighbourhoods to test out these plans. NSSCDCL has also created an 18-kilometre dedicated bicycle track with the help of CSR funds, said head of environment department (Smart City) Pranita Umredkar. She also pointed out that bicycle riding in the city was growing and even municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B and several other senior officials come to NMC headquarters on bicycles.

---||Nagpur||Once again trees cut in Nagpur for hoarding, activists demand removal of board||NAGPUR: While the civic body is focusing on increasing revenue from advertising billboards, the city’s green cover continues to get destroyed by the advertising mafia, who are mercilessly chopping down trees to ensure better visibility of their hoardings. TOI has been repeatedly highlighting such incidents, but there seems to be no end to such slaughter. On Wednesday, three fully-grown peepal trees were felled illegally opposite the remote sensing centre on Amravati Road. The trees had been planted by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) in 2018 during one of its plantation drives. Over the years, the civic body had taken charge of their maintenance and the trees were about 20 ft tall with tree guards for protection. According to environmental activist Jaydeep Das, who spotted the felling, the trees were deliberately cut for better visibility of hoardings by an advertising agency. “Hundreds of trees were planted on the road stretch but only these three, which were right in front of the hoarding, were cut,” he said. According to a security guard, a group of unidentified men came early morning in an autorickshaw and quickly cut down the trees. Following complaints from activists, a team of officials from NMC garden department visited the spot and carried out an inspection. “We will file a first information report (FIR) against the advertising agency. A notice will also be issued to the company. We will also find out if the hoarding was put up legally,” said officials. “With hoarding mafia, action should be initiated against landowner who has rented the property and the advertiser brand should be shamed for their advertisement leading to this antisocial act,” said Das. With rampant tree felling by advertising agencies, activists have demanded black-listing of the culprits. “These agencies have a mafia who brutally cut down trees for their benefit. NMC should take strict action against them,” they said. In one such bold move, the then municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar had taken a first-of-its-kind action in November 2019 by permanently removing a large billboard. To ensure visibility of this hoarding, three trees had been cut twice near Bole petrol pump. Bangar had formed a committee to carry out a joint inspection and assess the cause of damage. Once the majority of the members concluded that the trees were deliberately cut to improve the hoarding’s visibility, the hoarding was immediately removed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/once-again-trees-cut-for-hoarding-activists-demand-removal-of-board/articleshow/84836677.cms||Manka Behl
---||Jaipur||Jaipur’s choked drainage system not a priority under Smart City projects||JAIPUR: Crores have been spent on Smart City Mission in Jaipur, but no major investment has been made in improving the city’s drainage system. The Smart City Mission, which has been working for beautification and renovation of roads, has no plan for it and claims that drainage is the responsibility of the municipal corporations. The drainage system of Jaipur city fails in every monsoon season. In just minutes of rain, commuters of the city get stuck in knee deep water. The municipal corporations claim that drainage is a ‘high--level project’ for which big investment is needed. On Monday, heavy rainfall brought the entire city to a standstill with water entering into the shops of the market. Everyone in the market faced tremendous losses due to this they approached the municipal corporation authorities to find a permanent solution to this reoccurring problem. Subhash Goyal, president of Jaipur Vyapaar Mahasangh, said, “There is an urgent need to invest in the drainage system of the state. We have been facing losses since many years.” At present, no major project is under Smart City for drainage except the ones in which drainage is being constructed in addition to some other projects. From Choti Chaupar to Brahmapuri, a 1.6km road is being renovated in which road renovation, footpath construction and drainage is included. But especially working on drainage is not part of the Smart City project. CEO of Smart City and commissioner of JMC, Heritage, Awadhesh Meena said, “Smart City projects are target area centric. Whatever is under the given area we have worked on it. We have taken up some projects for the drainage, but changing the entire drainage system is not one of our projects. But whenever any request for drainage is made, we will provide funds to the corporation according to the availability.” Unfortunately, Smart City projects are limited to just Walled City area and Municipal Corporation, Greater is not a part of it. Hence, no focus is being made on the drainage system where Jaipur’s majority of the population resides and in future it will be expanded. JMC, Greater mayor Sheel Dhabai said, “The investment on drainage system is a big budget project. The decision will be taken by the state government due to cost. We are planning to work on the scheme and send a proposal to the state government to improve the three-decade old drainage system.” A few years ago, the JDA had charted out a Rs 400 crore plan to renovate the drainage system in the city. But due to budget constraints, the plan was never implemented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/for-smart-city-projects-drainage-is-still-not-a-priority/articleshow/84841634.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Man brutally attacks wife with iron rod, carrom board||PUNE: The police on Tuesday booked a 32-year-old man after his wife (32) lodged a complaint accusing him of brutally attacking her with an iron rod used to hang curtains and smashing a carrom board on her head. The accused also allegedly damaged their five-year-old son’s smartphone as he was angry with the boy for not focusing on his online class. The incident occurred at the couple’s residence at Pargenagar in Kondhwa at around 12noon on Monday. The woman, who is a teacher, sustained injuries to her face, nose, left hand, legs and head. She was treated at a private hospital and discharged later, the police said. Her five-year-old son is a kindergarten (KG) student while her husband used to work with a private company before losing his job in 2017 and has since remained unemployed, the police added. “My husband has been harassing me over trivial reasons because he wants my parents to help him launch a business,” the complainant told TOI. In the complaint registered with the Kondhwa police station, the woman stated that her husband started scolding their son for not focusing on his online class, snatched and switched off his smartphone and threatened to damage it. He then damaged a water bucket in the bathroom. At this point, the woman intervened and tried to pacify her husband. However, the man turned his ire towards her and attacked her, she stated. Despite several efforts to contact the accused, his cellphone remained switched off. The police have registered a case of voluntarily causing grievous hurt against the man and are investigating the matter further. No arrest had been reported in the case till Wednesday evening. Inspector (crime) Shabbir Sayyad of the Kondhwa police station said, “We invoked the charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt on the basis of a medical certificate relating to the victim’s injuries issued by the Sassoon General Hospital. We have issued a notice to the man asking him to join the investigation. The charges against him are bailable.” The injured woman’s father said, “My son in-law had been in the habit of misbehaving with his wife over trivial reasons ever since he had lost his job in 2017. My daughter was helping her son during his online class, when her husband woke up from his sleep and accused his son of not focusing on studies. He also accused my daughter of not being attentive towards their son. The husband snatched the phone from his son and asked him to go out. He then threw his study table and books and started an argument with his wife, demanding money. He pulled her hair and kicked her in the stomach and attacked her with the curtain rod and carrom board.” The victim shared, “Around six months ago, I had registered a non-cognisable offence with the police against my husband. At the time, the complaint was filed due to a dispute over not putting soil in a flower pot. On Monday, he attacked me in such a way that it has become difficult for me to work with my hands. I am suffering from severe pain and I had even developed bleeding in my nose.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-brutally-attacks-wife-with-iron-rod-carrom-board/articleshow/84839879.cms||Asseem Shaikh

---||Jaipur||Jaipur to have four new police stations||JAIPUR: City police will set up four new police stations including one at SMS Hospital and another at the airport by next month. The other two which are likely to become operations soon are Jaisinghpura Khor and Daulatpura. ACP (crime) Ajay Pal Lamba told TOI that currently there is a police chowki (checkpost) at SMS Hospital near the mortuary ward. The chowki comes under Moti Doongri police station, but a steady increase in footfall at the hospital warranted a new one. “Patients and their family members from different cities come to SMS Hospital regularly. Sometimes, there are law and order issues outside the mortuary too,” he said. The Moti Doongri and Ashok Nagar police stations will be bifurcated to accommodate the new SMS Hospital police station. Similarly, a dedicated police station to cater to the airport and its nearby areas has long been in the pipeline. “We are scouting for a location for the airport police station, so that nearby residents can easily approach us,” Lamba said, adding that the new police station will be carved out of Jawahar Circle police station. Some of the existing staff of the Jawahar Circle police station will be sent to the new police station. Jaipur police said the new Jaisinghpura Khor police station will be carved out of the Brahmpuri police station to cater to the local area. Apart from that, the new Daulatpura police station will replace the existing police chowki. “Daulatpura is also a major location which needs a separate police station of its own. Some areas of Daulatpura come under the VKI while another half comes within the jurisdiction of Amber police station,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/city-to-have-4-new-police-stations-including-at-sms-hosp-and-airport/articleshow/84841604.cms||---
---||Jaipur||76% population in Rajasthan has antibodies against Covid: ICMR survey||JAIPUR: State’s 76.2% population contains antibodies against Covid, the second highest in the country after Madhya Pradesh, where 79% people have it, says the findings of the 4th round of National Sero-Prevalence Survey conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). “The result of the ICMR survey shows how widespread and aggressive the second wave of Covid was in the state. Despite its aggressive nature, the state’s Covid management dealt with it effectively,” Siddharth Mahajan, secretary health, told TOI. ICMR had taken blood samples of 1,226 persons from different parts of the state and out oft them, 934 were found sero-positive. Mahajan said the higher the sero-positivity, the lesser the chances of third wave to emerge, but people need to remain careful and continue following Covid appropriate behavior. In states such as Maharashtra, Assam and Kerala, the sero-positivity found in the survey was 58%, 50.3% and 44.4%, respectively. Kerala has the lowest sero-positivity in the survey. Bihar stood at third position with 75.9%, followed by Gujarat (75.3%), Chhattisgarh (74.6%), Uttarakhand (73.1%) and Uttar Pradesh (71%). Earlier, Sawai Man Singh Medical College had claimed that the second wave was aggressive and it was dominated by the Delta variant. Now, high sero-positivity shown in ICMR survey indicates that the wave was aggressive and it has affected almost three-fourth of the population in the state. Now, the Centre has advised the states to conduct state-specific sero surveys in consultation with ICMR to generate district-level data on sero-prevalence as the findings would guide formulation of localized public health responses for Covid management. It was stated in the letter by the Union health secretary to the state government that such studies follow a standardised protocol, and the findings can then be utilised quickly by the respective states to guide objective, transparent and evidence-based public health response to the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/75-population-in-raj-has-antibodies-against-covid-icmr-survey/articleshow/84841623.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Stuck for over a month at 4-5%, Maharashtra positivity rate falls to 3.8%||MUMBAI: After plateauing between 4% and 5% for over a month, the state’s weekly positivity rate for Covid-19 has finally climbed down. It fell to 3.8% in the week ending July 27. However, experts caution that a dip in testing in some of the high-burden districts due to the floods could have contributed to the drop.  From a staggering weekly positivity rate of 27% in the first week of April, Maharashtra started to see a steady decline only around mid-May, when it fell to 14.3%. Thereafter, till mid-June, the drop was steady with positivity rate declining to 5% in the week ending on June 16. However,from June 17 to July 21, the weekly rate stubbornly stood between around 4.4% to 4.5%, showing no signs of decline.  Positivity rate is an indicator of the transmission of the disease and also the volume of tests carried out. Six to seven districts, including Kolhapur, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sangli, Nandurbar and Sindhudurg were mainly driving the positivity rate, officials said. “In those four weeks, the positivity rate didn’t see any movement as newer pockets within these districts would report cases,” said a health official. “The decline in positivity is a good sign but we can say it’s real only if it’s consistent,” said the official, adding that Maharashtra is encountering newer pockets almost every fortnight. Testing figures also show that less than 2 lakh tests were carried out daily on five of seven days last week.  Currently, ten districts continue to have a positivity rate higher than the state average: Satara, Pune, Kolhapur, Sangli, Sindhudurg, Solapur, Ahmednagar, Beed, Raigad and Ratnagiri. Satara is at the top of the chart, with positivity of 8%, followed by Pune and Kolhapur that have a PR of 7.23% and 7.18% respectively. The state, in its recent bulletin, mentioned that Satara, Pune and Sindhudurg were once again seeing a rise in weekly positivity.  The Centre on Tuesday also pointed out that Solapur and Beed were among the districts reporting a higher number of cases. Solapur officials said that from 150 daily detections till last week, the number has now doubled to 300-350. Civil surgeon of Solapur Dr Pradeep Dhele said while the lockdown continues to be in force, people roam around post 4 pm too. “Vaccination has given people confidence and has resulted in dropping of the guard at some places,” he said, adding that cases are coming from Pandharpur, Karmala, etc.  The district with the least positivity rate is Nagpur, whose weekly rate has come down to 0.19%. At the beginning of the second wave in Vidarbha, Nagpur was one of the districts with the highest positivity rates (35%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-stuck-for-over-a-month-at-4-5-state-positivity-rate-falls-to-3-8/articleshow/84841658.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Jaipur||To attract tourists, Rajasthan to open two safari routes at Nahargarh Sanctuary||JAIPUR: Tourists visiting Pink city will have an added destination for leopard safari as the forest department plans to open two routes in Nahargarh Wildlife Sanctuary (NWS). The routes earmarked are between Papad Ke Hanuman Ji -Mayala Bagh and Biological Park - Odiram Sagar. DFO Ajay Chittora said, “We have received approval to open these routes. The work to develop the grassland and tracks will be started as soon as budget is sanctioned.” As per the wildlife estimation 2020, there are five leopard cubs and 10 adult leopards, including three females and seven males, in the sanctuary encompassing an area of about 52sqkm. Other than the leopards, the department recorded porcupine (35), hyena (30), fox (5), blue bull (248), peacocks (1,440) and mongoose (50) at Nahargarh. Environmentalists have appreciated the move as it will conserve the forest and wildlife. Dhirendra Godha, member of State Board for Wildlife (SBWL) said, “Rajasthan was the first state in the country to initiate ‘Project Leopard’ and started effective monitoring at Jhalana . The move is commendable as it would make Nahargarh flourish like Jhalana. The forest department should also develop Galta in next step as it would give more space for wildlife to breathe.” Hope and Beyond’s chairman Joy Gardner, who is running a campaign ‘Nahargarh Matters’ said, “ Due to shortage of staff , encroachment in the sanctuary is rapidly increasingly. Also, people visiting Nahargarh do not consider it as forest and throw litter and alcohol bottles. In our campaign, we have collected 5.5 tonne garbage so far.” Buoyed by the success of Jhalana, which was introduced two years ago, the department is confident the safari in NWS will attract tourists. A forest officer at Jhalana said, “Jhalana is a shining example of how wildlife tourism can thrive in the middle of a crowded city. On an average, 100 tourists come for safari daily round the year. There are many big hotels in the catchment area of NWS. Eco-tourism will make the sanctuary self- sustained.” Plea for lightning arrester As many celebrities and thousands of tourists visit Shikar Audhi, the erstwhile hunting place, SBWL member Dhirendra Godha has put forward the proposal to install lighnting arrester at the structure. The place stands testimony to all the hunts that were carried out in Jhalana . He said, “This structure has historical relevance and lighting strike threat prevails on it. The forest department should not neglect it and arrester should be installed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/to-attract-tourists-raj-to-open-two-safari-routes-at-nahargarh-sanctuary/articleshow/84841669.cms||---

Dhabai along with Sanganer MLA Ashok Lahoty went to give a cheque to the mother of the child on Tuesday. However, controversy fueled when the cheque was found to be given by the same company that was responsible for maintenance of the public park where the child died. During a live debate on a news channel, Dhabai was participating in a panel discussion with the child’s mother Anita Keswani said the company responsible for her kid’s death should not be allowed to give me any compensation and there can be no price tag put on her child.She returned the cheque to Dhabai who tore the cheque and said, “I am not trying to put any price tag on your child. I just wanted to help your family, which is why I went to your house to give it you. We will also provide a dairy booth to your family.”In an audio that went viral on social media on Tuesday, a family member called up mayor and said that this was not the right way to help them and threatened to file an FIR against the corporation officials for neglect. To this, the mayor said, “I just wanted to help you and have no intention to offend your feelings. There is no point registering a case. Lawyers will take away your money, which will be difficult for you to arrange.”This statement didn’t go well with the Bar Council of Rajasthan. Mahesh Sharma, member of the Bar council, sent a legal notice to Dhabai saying, “On July 28, you openly abused the entire legal fraternity by calling them money snatchers. It is pertinent to mention that the aforesaid statement was issued by you in the context that when you and your staff was being held responsible for negligence. Your statement is false and derogatory to a noble profession upon which several people look up to.” The Bar council has demanded an unconditional apology from Dhabai and threatened of legal action if she failed to do so.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mayor-tears-cheque-given-to-victims-mother-in-live-tv-debate/articleshow/84841653.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||No medal but a learning curve||Ahmedabad: For the first time in Olympics history, Gujarat had three young players representing the country in Tokyo Games. The air was thick with excitement, but the results did not meet the expectations. The three athletes from Gujarat — Ankita Raina, Elavenil Valarivan and Maana Patel — all on their Olympics debut in Tokyo, failed to win the coveted medal. But, despite the disappointment, they may just have inspired a generation of young and ambitious athletes by just making it to the biggest sporting event on the earth.Maana Patel, arguably the best swimmer the state has produced so far, made it to the Olympics via the universality quota. Competing in the 100m backstroke, Maana finished second in the three-woman heats with a timing of 1:05.20, behind Zimbabwe’s Donata Katai, who clocked 1:02.73, while Grenada’s Kimberly Ince (1:10.24) finished third. Maana, whose personal best was1:03.77, later told TOI that the occasion got the better of her. “I was numb and the race didn’t go as per what I had planned.”“All the training I had done here felt brilliant, so I was very confident about my race. I was getting my best times in training here. On that basis, I was expecting a much faster time in the race. But, honestly before the race I was super stressed and nervous. I guess that affected me physically also. I felt my muscles getting stiffer. I was shivering while wearing my costume. I think I let the pressure get the better of me.” She, however, termed the race a good learning experience going forward. A lot was expected of tennis star Ankita Raina who paired with Sania Mirza in the women’s doubles event. The pair, however, lost in the first round despite being ahead for most of the match. The Indian pair was leading 6-0, 5-3 before the Ukrainian twin sisters Liudmyla Kichenok and Nadila Kichenok staged a remarkable comeback. The duo lost 6-0, 6-7 (0-7), 8-10 to bow out of the event.About the loss, Ankita said, “The result was disappointing. I was not able to sleep that night. Earlier too I have lost matches being up or have won matches from being down. But this happening in Olympics was heart-breaking, devastating and disappointing because all that comes to mind is the years of hard work that has gone behind it, not just for me but for all the people who’ve worked with me.” The 28-year-old added, “I am still thinking what I could have done better to improve or change the result of the match.” For shooter Elavenil Valarivan, too, it was a disappointing Olympics. The highly-rated Elavenil, who was the top-ranked player in the women’s 10 metres air rifle event and was a major madal hope for the country, finished 16th in the qualification round with a score of 626.5. Only the top eight athletes qualify for the final. China’s Qian Yang clinched the gold medal. In the 10m air rifle mixed team event that took place on Tuesday, Elavenil and Divyansh Singh Panwar shot a combined series of 626.5 to be placed 12th after the first stage qualification. On the performance in the mixed team event, Elavaenil’s mother Saroja Valarivan told TOI, “The results of the team event were a huge disappointment. We were expecting a podium finish for either of the two Indian pairs. This was totally unexpected. But, this has been an immense learning curve for the shooters.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-medal-but-a-learning-curve/articleshow/84819856.cms||Sabu Cherian
---||Goa||Members raise protest over Godinho’s remarks||Porvorim: The assembly session was adjourned briefly on Wednesday afternoon following a chaos in the House over use of unparliamentary use of words by legislative affairs minister Mauvin Godinho while criticising opposition members who opposed the motion tabled by him. Speaker Rajesh Patnekar adjourned the House after the opposition members were seen walking into the Well as they raised their voices to Godinho’s usage of words to describe the behaviour of opposition members. No sooner he tabled he motion seeking to suspend certain rules of the House, the opposition members stood to object, and pointed out that it was not within the rules. The motion was passed nonetheless. Goa Forward Party (GFP) MLA Vijai Sardesai said the suspension of rules entailed there will be a no general discussion on the budget. “After the general discussion on budget is completed, the CM replies. Has he replied? If he has, it’s fine by me, but if has not, he should complete it,” Sardesai said. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat said the discussion on budget was started during the budget session in March, and it was not completed then. “Without completing it they want to suspend the rules. The process has started. I don’t how it can be undone,” said Kamat. Godinho said, “Once the House has been prorogued, nothing survives, and yet the opposition members are raising objections merely on technicalities. The matter was thoroughly discussed in the business advisory committee meeting. The session has been condensed due to Covid-19.” “Ultimately, the Speaker is the final authority about the rules and conduct of the House,” he said. MGP MLA Ramkrishna Dhavalikar said chief minister Pramod Sawant should inform the House that the rules are suspended because he does not want a general discussion on budget even as the latter quoted the rules under which the rules were suspended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/members-raise-protest-over-godinhos-remarks/articleshow/84841670.cms||---
---||Kanpur||Uttar Pradesh: Anganwadi workers did great job in second wave, says CM Yogi Adityanath||KANPUR: Lauding the anganwadi workers on Wednesday, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said they were constantly converting negativity into positivity. He added that a meaningful effort has been made to connect educational centres with the society. “It is a good initiative to adopt anganwadis and make them well equipped. It is the foundation of the social system,” the CM said this while addressing a gathering in the programme of distribution of essential commodities to 75 anganwadi centres in Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University on Wednesday. He said that during the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, when he went to see the situation in the villages, anganwadis workers were found working with full zeal and spirit to control the spread of the pandemic. “Even today, anganwadis are playing an important role in protecting children from coronavirus by screening three to five year olds,” said the CM and added, “The initiative taken to solve the problems related to anganwadi actually fulfills the vision of Antyodaya, which was inspired by Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay ji in the 60s.” He said, “Last year on the initiative of the Governor, the state government had decided to take forward anganwadi as a pre-primary centre, where the children here will be strengthened by engaging in general sports and knowledge development.” “However, due to corona, the plan could not be implemented. But, soon the form of anganwadis will be changed and they will be developed as per the need of the time,” he said. The CM said anganwadi workers are constantly converting negativity into positivity. “To avoid a possible third wave of Covid, door-to-door screening as well as medicine kit distribution is also being done by anganwadi workers,” he said. CM further said that the efforts to make arrangements for treatment and food by adopting TB affected children in association with the universities of the state is commendable. He said, “Everyone was apprehensive about UP, which has a high population, during the corona period, but the model with which the state has controlled Covid has been appreciated by WHO and NITI Aayog, besides many other institutions of the World.” Yogi said, “If the government is at the front and the society is behind, the chances of any action plan being successful are very less. However, if the society itself is ahead and the government is behind, then it becomes a factor of public welfare by becoming a successful mass movement.” Governor Anandiben Patel, who was the chief guest on the occasion, said that earlier anganwadi centres used to run on paper. “When Narendra Modi became the Chief Minister of Gujarat, she put this thing in front of him, after that there was no looking behind.” She said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi told her to run the same mass movement of Gujarat in Anganwadis of Varanasi. “After this the whole curriculum was made and the women were taught how to teach the children,” she said. “The birth may be given by someone else but it’s anganwadi worker who teaches the children, hence she is called Yashoda Mata. Children should come to the anganwadi laughing and not crying. “They should feel that they will get a chance to play there,” she said. Axis Institute of Technology and Management, PSIT, Kanpur, Kanpur Institute of Technology, Maharana Pratap Group of Institutions, Narayana Vidyapeeth Group of Institutions, Allen House Institute of Technology and Kanpur Institute of Management Studies were honoured for adopting anganwadi centres. During the programme, anganwadis were given educational toys, ABCD, numbers, puzzle, blocks, toy fruits, toy animals, educational map, playbook, pictorial story book, white board, weight machine, height gauge, first aid box, handwash, tricycle, swing, kids table-chairs and food utensils. Vice-chancellor Professor Vinay Pathak, mayor Pramila Pandey, industrial development minister Satish Mahana, minister of state for higher education Neelima Katiyar, district panchayat president Swapnil Kamal and registrar Anil Kumar Yadav and teachers attended the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/cm-says-meaningful-efforts-made-to-connect-edu-centres-with-society/articleshow/84841674.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Nagpur||Nagpur Improvement Trust seeks Ambazari garden, offers free access to people, Rs 3 crore annually||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) has requested the tourism and cultural affairs department to hand over Ambazari garden and land adjoining the lake to it, citing inconvenience being faced by citizens and pending execution of it’s project costing Rs18.26 crore. The civic agency is also planning authority for the area where the garden is situated. On Monday, NIT trustee and West Nagpur MLA Vikas Thakre reportedly forced Garuda Amusements Park (Nagpur) Pvt Ltd, private operator appointed by MTDC, which is managed by the tourism and cultural affairs department, to open the gates of Ambazari garden for morning walkers. Now, the garden will remain open from 5.30am to 9.30am. People in large numbers from Ambazari, Tilak Nagar, Hill Top, Subhash Nagar and adjoining localities had gathered and demanded reopening of the gates for walking and fitness activities. The operator had closed the gates since MTDC took over the garden from Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). In a letter to tourism and cultural affair department, NIT chairman Manoj Kumar Suryawanshi said, “People in large number used to walk or exercise in the garden. Families used to visit the garden and enjoy nature and greenery. Students and children used to come for recreational activities. Now, all are affected and upset since MTDC handed over the garden to private operator. Also, MTDC demolished Ambedkar Bhavan, which hurt many people.” Suryawanshi added, “NIT had proposed light, sound and multimedia show on the life of Swami Vivekananda here costing Rs18.26 crore when the garden was in NMC’s possession. But revenue and forest department on July 21, 2017, leased out the garden and adjoining 44 acres to MTDC for development. NIT and Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority’s (NMRDA) application to MTDC to execute the project has been pending before MTDC board of directors. Considering this, Thakre demanded handing over garden and adjoining land to NIT for development. NIT board of directors on July 13 passed a resolution seeking garden and adjoining land.” Suryawanshi also offered to provide all services to the people free of cost, and pay Rs3 crore per annum to MTDC. The garden and adjoining land is owned by the government. For last many years, NMC was in possession, and developed garden, children play area, nursery, walking tracks etc. Around nine years ago, NMC also planned to re-develop the garden on lines of Shegaon’s Anand Sagar on PPP model. The DPR was prepared by the consultant who crafted Anand Sagar’s project. But NMC failed to execute the project. Then, NMC gave possession to MTDC on January 30, 2018, on state directions. MTDC appointed a private operator to develop the garden in two years, and operate and maintain it for 28 years. However, MTDC and private operator have allegedly done nothing till date and also closed the garden for the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nit-seeks-ambazari-garden-offers-free-access-to-people-rs3cr-annually-to-mtdc/articleshow/84836705.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Jaipur||Contractors quoting less than base price will have to deposit guarantee||Times News NetworkJaipur: To maintain the quality of civil works after selecting the contracted firm, the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) has again switched to its old formula that it followed six years ago. Following the direction of urban development minister (UDH) minister Shanti Dhariwal, the civic body will now ask the selected firm to deposit the work performance guarantee amount if the tender’s rate is quoted less than the basic schedule rate. An official said many a times tender rates are quoted less than 40 per cent less than the fixed basic schedule rate. This always raises a possibility in quality compromise. The new system will tighten the noose on contractors. “The JDA would forfeit the guarantee amount, if the work done by the firm is found to be substandard.”In 2016, after demonetisation, contractors participating in tender process requested the JDA not to take work performance guarantee due to weak financial conditions. Following this, the JDA removed the clause to deposit the guarantee amount. However, now the guarantee amount will have to be deposited within 14 days after the letter of acceptance is issued from JDA to start work.“The JDA will forfeit the earnest money if the awardee fails to deposit the money within the stipulated time,” said an official. Sources claimed the step was taken as JDA engineers have failed to carry out proper monitoring. JDA engineers in the past were in the line of fire for constructing poor roads. The lokayukta had also issued a show-cause notice to the JDA seeking an explanation on damaged roads at JLN Marg and Tonk Road within the defect liability period. It was witnessed on both these roads that bituminous concrete was uprooted from the surface within three years, before the defect liability period could be completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/contractors-quoting-less-than-base-price-will-have-to-deposit-guarantee/articleshow/84841639.cms||---

The recruitment process was on hold because of the Covid-19 pandemic in the state and two government resolutions (GRs) issued by the state finance department. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who heads the finance department, chaired a meeting on Wednesday and relaxed the two GRs issued on May 4 and June 24, which had restricted recruitment process of all departments except public health and medical education department. On Wednesday, Pawar, after taking a review of vacant posts of class I and class II, asked all the departments to submit their proposals on vacant posts by August 15. MPSC aspirant Swapnil Lonkar killed himself at his home in Pune on June 30. His family met chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on July 16. During the meeting the CM consoled and assured them that the government is with the grieving family. The 24-year old Lonkar had been unable to secure a job despite having cleared his MPSC prelims. Facing the heat over Lonkar’s suicide, during the state legislature monsoon session, Pawar had said that over 15,500 government posts would be filled through MPSC and the state commission will be overhauled on the lines of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) and the MPSC recruitment programme will be declared a year before.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-month-after-mpsc-aspirants-suicide-hiring-curbs-relaxed/articleshow/84843670.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

The flight had last operated on April 9.An officer of Airport Authority of India (AAI) said, “The flight operator has asked for possible schedule for its operations and is willing to start it around August 9. Since there are chances of fog in the morning hours, we have suggested to the airlines to operate in the afternoon hours as visibility is good at the time at Sahnewal airport.”The airport officials said as Covid cases have fallen significantly and the rule to show RT-PCR report has been done away with, they expected the flight to witness a good response. “Picking up of business activity in the city will also help draw more passengers,” they added.An Air India official said, “As per the proposal, the flight may take off from Delhi at 8.40am and from Ludhiana between 10am and 11am. The AAI has sought advice from the airport director and the director of the meteorological department before its schedule is fixed.”He said they were getting queries from people about the flight resumption and would start bookings after its schedule was fixed. “As Covid cases are on the decline in Delhi, too, we expect a good response from there as well,” he added.Residents are eagerly waiting for its resumption.“I go to Delhi frequently for business-related work and prefer to go by air. But as the flight between Ludhiana and Delhi has not been operating for the last few months, I have to travel by road. If the flight starts, the business community will benefit,” said Harpreet Singh, a businessman.Low occupancyThe data of Delhi-Ludhiana flight shows that during the first 20 days of March, its average occupancy was mostly below 50%.

---||Mumbai||50 academics, doctors, parents write open letter to various CMs to reopen schools||MUMBAI: Over 50 academicians, including professors from IIT-Bombay, IIT-Delhi and Delhi University, doctors, lawyers and parents from Maharashtra, Delhi and Karnataka, have written an open letter to chief ministers of their respective states, presenting a case to reopen schools. The petitioners have said there may never be a “zero-case scenario” as Covid-19 is here to stay. They have also said in addition to learning loss, children are facing mental distress, reduced development of social skills and are losing confidence. They have requested state heads to set up a task force on an urgent basis to plan reopening of schools. Schools in the country have largely remained closed for 16 months, even as scientific evidence is in favour of reopening them with all safety protocols in place, they said. The signatories said vaccination of the eligible population is likely to take many more months and vaccinating children cannot be a prerequisite for reopening schools at this point. Bhaskaran Raman, professor in the computer science and engineering department, IIT-Bombay, said one whole academic year has been a washout for most students and if this continues for a second year, it will be a major disservice to our coming generations. “We are already witnessing extreme dropout rates in several states. As a country, this break from schools would push us back by decades. Not just rural and urban poor who are at a loss, children from well-to-do families are facing serious mental health issues too.” Many countries have already opened their schools, he said. The signatories have suggested a plan to reopen schools in a staggered manner, starting with regions where the positivity is low. “Explore opening of pre-primary and primary sections before secondary schools, offer vaccines on priority to school staff, starting with smaller groups of students to attend once or twice a week, ensure proper ventilation,” they suggested. Meanwhile, Vijay Yewale, member of the state’s paediatric Covid task force, told TOI one cannot compare India with other countries. A majority of the population in countries such as the UK has developed herd immunity, he said. “While we agree with all the academic and developmental losses students face, reopening schools is a tough call even for the government,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-50-academics-docs-parents-write-open-letter-to-various-cms-to-reopen-schools/articleshow/84841707.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Delhi||Time for Delhi Police to sharpen tech skills: Court||NEW DELHI: A city court has said it was “pathetic” that Delhi Police was still not updating its record of undertrial prisoners (UTPs) regularly. The observation came when an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) said he was not aware of the exact status of the cases pending against a man arrested for alleged robbery. It noted that disposal of bail applications was delayed for not knowing of the present status of cases pending against them. Additional sessions Judge Sonu Agnihotri said the time had come for Delhi Police to sharpen its technology skills and directed the police commissioner to update the state crime record bureau’s (SCRB) data of southeast and south Delhi police stations. The court said that generally involvement reports of UTPs, according to SCRB record, were not updated and time was usually sought by police to verify the updated status of cases where accused/UTP was shown to have been involved, which lead to unnecessary delay in disposal of bail applications. “In today’s world, when almost every information is available on the click of a mouse, it is pathetic that Delhi Police is still not updating its record regularly on account of which disposal of bail applications of accused/UTPs is delayed. I think the time has come for Delhi Police to sharpen its skills as far as implementation of technology is concerned,” the judge said. The court directed the police commissioner to file a compliance report by August 11. It also noted that matters where the accused was shown to be involved according to the SCRB report pertained to a period as early as 2010, and it was difficult to imagine that such matters of theft might still be pending before the trial courts. During the hearing of Surender’s bail hearing in the robbery case, the ASI submitted that he was not aware of the exact status of pending cases against the man, and that the involvement report of the accused filed by him was based on the record maintained by SCRB. He added that he could file the updated status of pending cases against Surender if some time was granted and the present bail application was adjourned. The court, however, granted bail to Surender on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 50,000 with one surety of like amount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-time-for-police-to-sharpen-tech-skills/articleshow/84841806.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Cave-ins, cracks question sturdiness of Char Dham ‘all-weather’ road||DEHRADUN: Landslides and cave-ins along a newly built 554km stretch — which is part of the Centre’s ambitious all-weather Char Dham road — has residents and environmentalists questioning whether the proposed “all-weather” road was actually as sturdy as it was made out to be. The proposed 880km road is meant to provide year-round connectivity to the four important Himalayan shrines at Kedarnath, Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri, which mostly remain cut off during winters. Work is already complete on a 554km stretch of the road in Uttarakhand, but cracks and cave-ins have occurred in several places during monsoon while landslides on the route have cut off villages. In Tehri district, cracks have appeared on the Rishikesh-Gangotri National Highway-94 while a part of the highway caved in near the Chamba tunnel. “A 150m long stretch has eroded while cracks can be seen on a 300m stretch even before it was formally inaugurated,” said Mahavir Negi, former pradhan of Majyur village. Negi said that a retaining wall also collapsed after torrential rain. “These incidents pose serious questions on the road construction quality and its sustainability,” he said. Residents have appealed to the district administration on Tuesday to conduct an investigation into the “shoddy construction work”. In Uttarkashi’s Badethi village on Gangotri National Highway, part of the all-weather road caved in on Wednesday, crushing two houses. The residents managed to flee just in time. Environmentalists TOI spoke to said the road seemed to be all weather in name only. “In the past 15 days, there have been many landslides on the route — both reported and unreported — which is supposed to be newly developed. If the road cannot withstand the monsoon, how do we call it all-weather?” said geologist-environmentalist S P Sati. Ramesh Pahari, an environmentalist from Rudraprayag, said an all-weather road is expected to show enough resilience during bad weather. “Hundreds of trees were felled for this road and mountains cut. But was it built focusing on science and sustainability?” he said. Navin Juyal, former senior scientist at Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, added that the climate resilient road should have taken steps to minimise damage from rockfalls and landslides. Government officials said their expert team was swiftly treating any damage to the road. Virendera Khera, chief engineer regional officer, ministry of road transport and highways, told TOI, “Experts from Tehri Hydro Development Corporation and Geological Survey of India are conducting geotechnical investigation of the road and treating the gaps.” Residents in Pithoragarh, meanwhile, burnt the effigies of top BJP leaders, alleging that cutting hills during road construction was leading to frequent landslides. “Landslides have become so frequent that our livelihood is at stake now. Most residents here are farmers who are not able to take their produce to mandis. We were told that this stretch was being built for Rs 400 crore and is of strategic importance, but it is ruining our lives,” said Trilok Meher, one of the protesters. In Rudraprayag district as well, local residents blamed construction for landslides. Recently, they wrote to Rudraprayag BJP MLA Bharat Singh Chaudhary demanding an alternate route. “Due to all-weather road cutting work on the Rishikesh-Badrinath highway as well as rains, there have been frequent landslides and blockage near Narkota for the past two months,” they said in the letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cave-ins-cracks-question-sturdiness-of-char-dham-all-weather-road/articleshow/84836710.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Bengaluru||Basavaraj Bommai takes oath as Karnataka CM; race for portfolios begins||BENGALURU: Basavaraj Bommai was sworn in as the 23rd chief minister of Karnataka on Wednesday, bringing down the curtains on weeks of uncertainty over leadership in the state, and paving the way for BJP to buckle down ahead of the 2023 assembly elections. Clad in a standard cotton kurta and draped in a pinkish-saffron silk shawl, the 61-year-old leader was accompanied to the ceremony at Raj Bhavan’s Glass House by his family members but the overwhelming presence was that of BS Yediyurappa, underscoring his continued importance in BJP. Keen to dispel any impression that the former CM would be backseat-driving his government, Bommai categorically said: “I will not be a rubber stamp CM.” While he would seek Yediyurappa’s counsel and draw on his expertise, Bommai added, he would work to get the “stamp of approval from the people”.  This, as hordes of party men made a beeline to Yediyurappa’s house to lobby for ministerial berths on Wednesday in an early indicator of where the centre of power rests. On cue, BY Vijayendra, Yediyurappa’s younger son, announced “I will no longer be called a Super CM”, in a reference to such barbs aimed at him during his father’s dispensation. Earlier in the day, Bommai offered prayers at Bhagavan Sri Maruthi Temple and called on the former CM at his house and sought his blessing before heading to Raj Bhavan. Following the example of his predecessor and mentor, he later held a one-man cabinet meeting with top officials and announced a slew of populist welfare schemes. This includes a scholarship programme for farmers’ children at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore. “It’s going to help students from agrarian families to pursue higher education,” the chief minister said. Pension for widows and financial assistance for disabled will be increased from Rs 600 to Rs 800 monthly at an additional cost of Rs 504 crore. This will benefit 17 lakh widows and 4 lakh disabled people. “Old age pension under Sandhya Suraksha scheme will be increased from Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,200 at an additional cost of Rs 864 crore, helping 36 lakh people,” Bommai said. These measures have been taken, considering inflation. “Our government will reach out to sections of society which need social security,” the new CM said. He also added in the same breath that maintaining fiscal discipline through efficient utilisation of resources and reducing expenditure, given the Covid-induced financial crunch, will be a priority. “I have stressed inter-departmental coordination, teamwork and time-bound implementation of schemes to avoid corruption and to cut down on unnecessary expenditure by 5%,” he said. Bommai’s next big challenge will be to expand his cabinet. “I am going to Delhi on Friday to meet the BJP brass, including PM Narendra Modi, and will discuss all issues, and seek their suggestion,” he said. Asked if he would wait for the month of ‘Ashada’ to pass before undertaking the expansion, he said: “I won't take too much time because I need a complete team to do the work, amid Covid and floods.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bommai-takes-oath-as-cm-race-for-portfolios-begins/articleshow/84844754.cms||---

According to the civic body records, Rs 8 lakh have been spent on repairing 1,200 leakages in the past two months. Following lack of proper maintenance, more than thousand litres of water is wasted in different parts of the city on daily basis. As per an official estimate, at least 50 MLD water is wasted in the city due to pipeline leakages. The number of leaks has only increased in the past two years. So far, Jal Sansthan has no city-wide plan to check the situation. The main leakage points in the city are Jeevani Mandi Road, Transport Nagar, Kailash road, Balkeshwar locality, Ghatia Azam Khan, Belanganj, Daresi, Rawatpara, Noori Darwaza, Idgha and Trans-Yamuna localities. General manager of Agra Jal Sansthan RS Yadav said, “We are working towards fixing all leakages. Twelve teams have been tasked for repairing the leakages in the water supply pipelines.

They made him drink liquor and then repeatedly struck him with an iron rod till he fell unconscious, police said. The 46-year-old farmer was later found hanging from a tree, the police added. The incident took place at a Sambhal village under Rajpura police limits on July 19.

Preliminary investigation revealed that he had gone to take care of his fields on the night of July 19 and did not return home. He was found hanging the next day. On suspicion, the man’s wife had filed a police complaint and the case was taken up.” The SP added, “A probe was ordered after the autopsy report. It revealed that the man was murdered and his own daughter was the main suspect. She along with her boyfriend and his friend had killed Harpal as he was against her marriage plans and refused to give any property.” Preeti and his boyfriend Dharmendra Yadav from Badaun's Islamnagar were picked up from a crossing in Sambhal and sent to jail on Tuesday while the third accused, identified as one Gaurav, is absconding, police said. During interrogation, the accused couple confessed to their crime, the police added.

The civic body, which revived entry fees at various facilities, had decided to increase parking fees to Rs 10. However, it did not go down well with the residents. Regular users had opposed the increase saying it would affect them at a time when people are bogged down by Covid-19 and related lockdown restrictions.Following the apprehensions raised, Madurai corporation has now fixed it at Rs 8. The entry fee for the central vegetable market and fruit market was also increased to Rs 10 from Rs 6. This was also reduced by the civic body to Rs 7 following the public opposition. Corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan said, “Parking fee was reduced by Rs 2 and fixed only at Rs 8. Similarly, entry fee for central vegetable market and fruit market has been cut by Rs 3 and only Rs 7 would be collected now,” he said. Sources from the revenue department said that the new fee would come into effect once the facilities are auctioned and handed over to the new lessee.

Incidentally, the accused is the same person who had ordered feathers and stuffed head of exotic birds from abroad, which were intercepted by the customs department in Jaipur recently. Few weeks ago, customs authorities intercepted two parcels at the foreign post office, Jaipur, on the basis of suspicion. On examination, it was discovered that the parcels appeared to contain parts of wild birds, which included feathers of an ostrich and stuffed head of the greater bird of paradise. The import of these items of wildlife is prohibited by law. Further, there was mis-declaration regarding the contents of the packages. Follow up search was carried out by the customs officers and incriminating documents were seized during the same. “During search, officials found the person named in the FIR collected animal trophies following which the forest department was called in and the recovered antlers were taken for testing. After nearly two weeks of that, an FIR was lodged under relevant sections and this offence has provision of penalty of upto Rs 25,000 or imprisonment”, said a forest official. Meanwhile, the customs department probe against the same person is yet to proceed further as the feathers along with the stuffed head have been sent to Dehradun for DNA testing, the results of which are awaited. The parcels had come to Jaipur back from United Kingdom and were addressed to a person in the city. These banned animal items were valued at approximately Rs 22,000 and officials claimed that the person who ordered them is a collector who used them for decorative purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/forest-dept-files-fir-for-possession-of-sambhar-antlers/articleshow/84841701.cms||---

The court said that frivolity was at its heights. The petition was filed by one Rasila Kharadi from Aravalli district demanding termination from government service of her daughter-in-law on the ground that she had been hiding her marital status from the department. Kharadi’s advocate submitted that her daughter-in-law, Chetna Ninama, had secured a government job but showed herself as unmarried, whereas her divorce petition has been pending since 2016. The daughter-in-law had thus obtained the government job by suppressing information and was therefore in violation of service rules. The court said that such petition cannot be entertained because it is aimed at settling a score with family members because of a domestic problem. The court observed, “The court is confronted with very unusual and strange prayers and petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution. The mother-in-law is seeking direction for setting aside the daughter-in-law’s appointment saying that it was obtained wrongly by suppressing the facts. This is a dispute between them. The court fails to understand how this petition is maintainable when such prayers were asked for by the petitioner on her personal account.” The court further said, “The court is at pains to see that the advocate has also encouraged such litigation. Instead of advising the petitioner to file appropriate proceedings before any other forum and that she should not be filing a petition in the high court, he preferred this petition.” The court imposed a fine on the petitioner saying, “The frivolity in the litigation is at its heights. In these circumstances, because of such petitions, the court and its staff’s time has been wasted and hence it is rejected with exemplary cost of Rs 10,000.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-fines-saas-for-seeking-bahus-sacking/articleshow/84839365.cms||---

---||Goa||Sparks fly on Day One as opposition seeks answers on Mollem linear projects||Porvorim: The opposition cornered the government on the first day of the monsoon session of the Goa legislative assembly on Wednesday over the three linear projects. The House witnessed heated arguments between the opposition members and chief minister Pramod Sawant during Question Hour as the former sought to know what the Goa government has decided about the recommendations of the Central empowered committee (CEC) of the Supreme court pertaining to the three projects. Sawant told the House that the apex court has not given its ruling on petitions challenging the projects, and said that his government will file its statement before the court. The CEC’s report containing objections to the Tamnar project and South West Railway's double-tracking project has been submitted to the SC. Goa government will file its say in the Supreme Court,” Sawant told the House. Khaunte said that the CEC has given its report by studying the Tamnar project, four-lanning of the national highway and South Western Railway’s (SWR) double-tracking project. “The government should tell the House whether it will accept and adhere to it,” he said. Earlier, revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate told the House that she had not received the copy of the report, and the government will collectively take the decision. Khaunte reiterating his point said the report is in public domain and he can place it on the table of the House, sought to know whether the government will accept it. Monserrate emphasised that her department cannot single-handedly decide on it. Since the matter is pending before SC, the government will wait for the order of the court, she said. Khaunte also sought to know the status of land acquisition for the railway project. Since the CEC does not favour the two projects and suggested that permissions granted to these projects be revoked, he questioned the need for land acquisition. He further pointed out that the land acquisition proceeding has lapsed. “If that was the case, the Central government will take the decision on it,” Monserrate said. “The land belongs to the state. Tell me what the state government will do about it?” Khaunte said. At this point, Sawant told the House that land was acquired by the Central government under the Railway’s Act and the state government has only been a facilitator. The land was acquired bfrom the people who gave it willingly, and some from the government, the CM said. Khaunte said about 2,875 objections were raised by the people affected by the land acquisition, and added that the CM was misleading the House. At this point, speaker Rajesh Patnekar said he will not allow further discussion on the question as it was discussed for over 20 minutes, and he would call the next question. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat and Goa Forward Party (GFP) Vijai Sardesai objected stating the members cannot be denied their right to raise supplementary questions. During the opening of the session, the opposition members complained to the speaker that despite raising the issue several times in the past, they are still not given copies of replies to questions tabled by them 48 hours in advance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sparks-fly-on-day-one-as-opposition-seeks-answers-on-mollem-linear-projects/articleshow/84841697.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Govt not doing enough on Mhadei, say Khaunte, Vijai||Porvorim: Goa legislative assembly witnessed noisy scenes over the Mhadei issue during Question Hour on Wednesday as the opposition charged that the Goa government hasn’t done enough to stop Karnataka’s transgressions in diverting Mhadei water, and demanded to know the status on the issue. The opposition sought to know the quantum of water that has been diverted, and whether there will be an outcome for this problem by the time the state goes to polls early next year. Independent MLA Rohan Khaunte, Goa Forward Party (GFP) chief Vijai Sardesai, and opposition leader Digambar Kamat tried to corner the government for not getting speedy results even as chief minister Pramod Sawant and water resources minister Filipe Neri Rodrigues said the matter was pending before the Supreme Court. Sawant told the House that the special leave petition filed in 2019 is slated for hearing on September 8. Of the two contempt petitions filed, one will be heard on August 2, and the second on September 8. However, Sardesai repeatedly sought to know if the issue will be resolved any time soon as “Karnataka continues to do what it wants to while the Goa government has been getting a date after date”. “Have you quantified the water that’s been diverted so far? Is there a technical team to carry out the task,” Sardesai asked. Khaunte said though the Goa government has been filing special leave petitions to show that it cares about the Mhadei, this is far from reality. “There has been no outcome so far. All applications filed are pending. Aggression on the part of the Goa government is lacking to stop Karnataka even as it is in the process of losing its only source of water,” he said. In the interlocutory application filed, Karnataka has been asked not to carry out any work, but the direction has been flouted. There’s been no action by the Goa government despite these blatant violations, he said. Rodrigues disputed the charge, and explained the legal measures initiated by the government, and said that the opposition should suggest if any other remedies are available to take this issue to its logical end. However, he said certain points cannot be disclosed in the open. The arguments reached a tipping point over a salinity study.

---||Ahmedabad||FIR against ED officer: CBI court rules out two trials||AHMEDABAD: A special CBI court has dismissed the CBI’s plea for two separate trials against the suspended Enforcement Directorate (ED) officer J P Singh in connection with an IPL betting case and the Afroz Fatta case. The CBI had filed an FIR in September 2015 against Singh, the ED’s joint director at the time; assistant director Sanjay Kumar; and eight others. The FIR related to criminal conspiracy and corruption during the investigation of the IPL betting racket and Afroz Fatta money laundering case. As the investigation took place on the FIR, the CBI filed a chargesheet in 2017 against the two ED officials and eight private persons. In October 2020, the CBI filed a supplementary chargesheet in this case against Fatta and others. Later, the CBI moved the court and requested it to hold two separate trials because the chargesheet filed in 2017 and 2020 were the outcomes of two distinct offences and different acts. These two chargesheets cannot be clubbed together, the CBI said. Opposing the CBI’s demand, Singh’s advocate Amit Nair argued that that there is no provision in the CrPC to hold separate trials in one FIR. The mere filing of a supplementary chargesheet is not a ground for different trials, Nair said. He submitted that the witnesses in the case were found during a single investigation and even common names of the accused figure in both the chargesheets. The court agreed with the defence advocate’s submissions. “This court is also of the opinion that if three separate trials are or two separate trials are conducted, it will be the court’s time which will be ruined unnecessarily,” the court said. “…and there will be repetition of same witnesses for depositions before the court and there will be repetition of production of documentary evidences before the court which will ultimately result into wastage of precious time of the court.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fir-against-ed-officer-cbi-court-rules-out-two-trials/articleshow/84839408.cms||---

The agency tasked with running the ambulances, GVK EMRI, has terminated the services of at least 570 contractual workers in the last two days for “indiscipline”. Over 19,000 ambulance workers are on indefinite strike, leaving around 4,600 ambulances stranded in 75 districts. Just four to five ambulances are operating in each district to cater to emergency cases. The union representing the ambulance workers is demanding permanent jobs for all the employees of 102 (emergency ambulance) and 102 (maternity ambulance service). Meanwhile, the Ziqitza Healthcare Limited (ZHL), the agency that has been given the contract of operating 250 Advance Life Support (ALS) ambulances said that the most of the demands being raised by the on-strike ambulance staffers are directed towards National Health Mission (NHM) and the state government regarding regularization of jobs. “The only demand directed towards ZHL is regarding recruitment of the ALS ambulance staff in the state, for which we have sent out multiple notices, newspaper ads time and again to the ambulance unions for participating in the recruitment process. Also, experienced ALS ambulance staffers, employed by previous service provider GVK EMRI, are being given preference in the recruitment process,” says Chandan Dutta, Head- Government Business, ZHL. The company further clarified that they have been given tender for operating 250 ALS ambulances in the state and the company is not responsible for the operation of 108 and 102 ambulances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/strike-by-ambulance-workers-in-up-enters-3rd-day-570-staffers-terminated/articleshow/84834421.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Madurai||Woman cop booked for extortion||Madurai: A woman police inspector from the district police unit was booked under various sections of IPC on charges including extortion as she allegedly took away Rs 10 lakh from an aspiring businessman from Sivaganga earlier this month. Vasanthi, inspector of Nagamalai Pudukottai police station, was placed under suspension based on orders from higher police officials on Wednesday. Police said one K Harshad, 33, from Ilayankudi in Sivaganga district, was working in a bag stitching unit as tailor in Villapuram in Madurai city. He wanted to set up a bag stitching unit on his own at Ilayankudi. He got Rs 4 lakh from Abbas, owner of the Villapuram unit and took another Rs 4 lakh from his relative besides Rs 2 lakh from his brother Baskaran to set up the unit. Harshad went to purchase equipment required for his unit on July 5 along with Baskaran and carried Rs 10 lakh in a bag. As the money was insufficient, Baskaran told him that he would take him to a moneylender he knew. The moneylender, identified as Pandi, asked the two to wait at Nagamalai Pudukottai. Soon, one Karthick met the duo claiming that he was sent by Pandi. As he was talking to the duo in connection with documents required for the loan, Vasanthi reached the spot. She picked up Harshad and conducted an inquiry, questioning him about the bag in his possession. She snatched the money bag and asked him to collect it from the police station the next day before leaving the spot. Harshad went to the station the next day to get his money back, but to his astonishment Vasanthi told him that it contained only notebooks and nothing else. Realising that he has been cheated, Harshad petitioned district superintendent of police V Baskaran the next day. Additional deputy superintendent of police Chandramouli conducted an inquiry. As the preliminary inquiry proved that the inspector was involved in the extortion, a case was filed by the district crime branch police on Tuesday. Inquiries also revealed that Karthick was an accomplice in the crime. Vasanthi and her accomplices K Palpandi, 42, M Pandiaraj, both from Theni district, Ukkirapandi and Karthick from Silaiman were booked under IPC sections 384 (punishment for extortion), 420 (cheating), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant) and 506 (1) (punishment for criminal intimidation).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/woman-cop-booked-for-extortion/articleshow/84839401.cms||---

Kamat said also that the government should look into the town and country planning department’s decision to give special FAR 3 which will convert villages of Goa into concrete jungle. Taking part in debate on various demands, Kamat said if the special FAR 3 is implemented in the state then ground plus 10 floor buildingS will come up in villages. He also said that because of Section 16B of the TCP Act, a lot of land in the villages are being converted. He also sought a time frame for implementation of the tourism policy and tourism master plan. Referring to the governor’s speech that the government will double farmers’ income by 2022, Kamat said sought to know how the governments will achieve that when instead of cultivating, land is being converted. Speaking on home demands, Kamat urged chief minister to post two police inspectors at police stations, one inspector should be posted to maintain law and order and second inspector only for investigation. Kamat said that this formula should be implemented at one or two police stations, while pointing out that police stations are overburdened.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kamat-seeks-white-paper-on-finances/articleshow/84841765.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In Agra, potholes made driving risky on city roads, while non-functional streetlights only added to the woes of commuters. Rain exposed the sub-standard work in many areas where drains were recently cleaned. Rainwater entered shops and warehouses at marketplaces. Agra mayor Naveen Jain said, “Waterlogging affected many areas after continuous rain for hours in the city. Zonal sanitary inspectors have been asked to pump out water and make other arrangements to stop water from entering houses and shops.” Agra district agriculture officer Rampravesh Verma said, “Farmers of around twelve villages under Kirawali sub-division reported damage to their bajra and cotton crops due to waterlogging in the fields.

Officials said this was the first time in the state that such a special camp was organized and that such camps are also being planned in other districts. The special vaccination camp was inaugurated by Madurai district collector S Aneesh Sekhar in the presence of senior health officials. The camp was organized with the aim to help HIV positive patients get the Covid-19 vaccine in a safe and organized manner. “Often there is much fear surrounding Covid-19 vaccination for a vulnerable group such as HIV positive patients. Hence, we have been actively counseling the patients on the importance of Covid-19 vaccination,” said P Jeyapandi, District Programme Manager (DPM), DAPCU, Madurai. Officials have been reaching out to HIV positive patients and seeking willingness for getting the Covid-19 vaccine. “If a HIV positive patient goes to a regular Covid-19 vaccination centre, they will be asked their medical history. To avoid it, such camps are being organized,” said Jeyapandi.

Only manufacturers, producers and service providers come under the definition now though most traders in agro food products are in the sector, said the president of Agrofood Chamber of Commerce and Industry S Rethinavelu. Recently, the Centre included retail and wholesale traders under MSME classification. “Later we came to know this is only to make them eligible for priority sector advances by banks and financial institutions,” the chamber president said. This is with the objective of helping Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) achieve priority sector lending (PSL) target of 75% of its net credit by 2024. One of the key benefits that traders would enjoy if brought under the definition of ‘enterprise’ is under the Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council (MSEFC). The MSMED Act states that a buyer from micro and small enterprises should pay the invoice amount within 45 days failing which they have to pay with compound interest that is thrice the bank rates. Since a legal course is time-consuming, the enterprise can approach MSEFC, an alternate dispute resolution forum for speedy settlement, Rethinavelu, who was a member of the council for five years, said. The award is passed by the council in 90 days. In Tamil Nadu, these forums are functioning in Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai and Trichy. The chamber has written to the Prime Minister and MSME minister Narayan Tatu Rane to enable traders to enjoy all the benefits under the MSME category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-to-bring-traders-under-msmed-act/articleshow/84839411.cms||---

These colleges are currently affiliated with state-run universities. Many professors in the state are opposed to the move as they seek more clarity from the government about the change in the law. The new law makes changes to the Gujarat Private Universities Act, 2009, where private universities were not allowed to give affiliation to grant-in-aid colleges. Now, these universities will be allowed to award affiliation to grant-in-aid colleges, but the college must be run by the same management or trustees. “Eight grant-in-colleges in Surat and 10 in Vallabh Vidyanagar have already announced their affiliation with private universities. About 15 from Ahmedabad have also begun the process in a similar direction,” said a member of Gujarat State Professors’ Association. Members of the association on Wednesday held a meeting with the state education department to discuss the issues likely to arise due to the new set of rules. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/30-grant-in-aid-colleges-seek-private-univ-affiliation/articleshow/84839450.cms||---

The study, a joint collaboration between BMC’s Kasturba Hospital and Delhi-based CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, was on Wednesday accepted for publication in international peer-reviewed medical journal ‘Frontiers in Medicine’. Read AlsoCovid-19: Mumbai doctor tests +ve thrice, twice after vaccinationA 26-year-old Mulund-based doctor has tested positive for Covid-19 three times since June 2020, twice after she got vaccinated earlier this year, reports Malathy Iyer. “The reinfections are confusing,” said Dr Shrushti Halari, whose swab samples have been collected for genome sequencing as part of aOne of the co-authors, Dr Swapneil Parikh, said the team has coined a new term “breakthrough reinfection” to mark the case. While the term describes an infection that occurs roughly 15 days after taking a vaccine for it, ‘breakthrough reinfections’ highlight the Delhi doctor’s two infections—or reinfections—after full vaccination. The US Centers for Diseases Control states the average time between reinfections is between 45 and 90 days and infection with different clades or genetic types. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) timeframe is 104 days. “However, our Mumbai-Delhi scientific collaboration has established that the doctor got reinfections in 19 days,” said Dr Shastri. The unnamed Delhi doctor-patient was first infected in August 2020 and she took her vaccine shots on February 1 and March 15. She tested positive for the second and third time on April 12 and May 3, respectively, with a negative test report in between. During the period between two infections, the doctor-patient tended to her husband who developed Covid-19 as well. The study’s second author, Dr Rajesh Pandey from IGIB, said the husband’s swab samples, too, were collected and sequenced. “We found he was infected with the Delta variant, which over a few days affected his wife as well,” said Dr Pandey. The study showed the doctor-patient had developed antibodies after her second infection and even had vaccine-induced antibodies. “The combination of vaccine immunity and natural infection immunity usually produces a very robust hybrid immunity. Therefore, any reinfection after a breakthrough ought to be uncommon and severe breakthrough reinfections even rarer,’’ said Dr Parikh. The doctor-patient needed hospitalization during her third infection, which dragged on for over 45 days. She is doing well at present though. Dr Pandey said the study captured a “rare event” with all scientific material documenting clinical, genomic, epidemiological and radiological findings. The study underlines the need to be vigilant against Covid. The US CDC on Tuesday advised fully vaccinated people to continue using masks, even at home. “One cannot let their guard down yet,” said Dr Shastri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-doc-got-covid-twice-after-taking-both-vaccine-shots/articleshow/84841821.cms||Malathy Iyer

India meteorological department (IMD) has stated in a bulletin that the system over West Bengal is likely to start moving during next 48 hours. “The well-marked low pressure area with slow westward movement and associated circulation is likely to last for three to four days. Its impact on weather over Goa will be comparatively less, compared to the one which formed near Odisha coast last week,” Rahul M, scientist, IMD, Panaji said. But rainfall activity, which will be mostly between July 29 and August 1, is likely to be heavy. This system is set to revive the weak monsoon activity, which has produced hardly 70mm of daily average rainfall during last five days, as compared to 114.9mm recorded in a single 24-hour spell on Friday. During the last 24 hours, most centres recorded light to moderate rainfall, as Quepem received the highest of 28.4mm, Mapusa 17mm , Old Goa 11.6mm and other centres below 10mm. The seasonal total has touched 2,199.7mm (86.6 inches) while 1,864.4mm (73.4 inches) is normal at this stage, leaving a 18% surplus.

The number of people evacuated due to rain is 4.35 lakh, while villages affected is 1,381 across seven districts. The cabinet was expected to announce measures to provide relief but a decision could not be taken due to lack of details on losses suffered. A decision to provide enhanced compensation beyond National Disaster Relief Fund norms will be taken within two weeks after losses are accurately estimated. Enhanced compensation was given for losses due to Nisarg and Tauktae cyclones. “Compensation allotted at that time was 50-80% more than NDRF norms,” said an official. The toll in rain-related mishaps in the state climbed to 213 on Wednesday, with four deaths. Search and rescue operations were called off at most places, but eight people are still feared to be missing. The relief and rehabilitation department made a presentation to the state cabinet regarding estimated losses, pegged at around Rs 4,000 crore, with damage to government infrastructure making up for the bulk. Damage to standing kharif crop has doubled to three lakh hectares from the earlier estimate of 1.5 lakh hectares. Paddy cultivation in all districts of Konkan has been affected, with maximum damage in Kolhapur and Sangli districts, state agriculture department officials said on Wednesday. “In many districts, water levels were still high and government machinery has not been able to survey the area for losses,” said urban development minister Eknath Shinde. The government has allotted land to set up a permanent base camp for the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) at Mahad in Raigad. The government resolution to allot 2.57 hectares belonging to the dairy development department for setting up a base was issued on Wednesday. Six talukas in Ratnagiri have recorded more rainfall than Chiplun but it is the worst-hit, having got 2,430mm rainfall. A special camp is being organised at Taliye for providing Aadhaar and ration cards to the flood-affected. Four hundred municipal corporation staffers of Thane and Navi Mumbai have been deputed for sanitation, cleaning and medical operations in Raigad, Ratnagiri and Kolhapur. The Posare gram panchayat in Khed, Ratnagiri is facing an acute water shortage due to destruction of water storage and supply networks. Chiplun bus depot manager Ranjeet Rajshirke, who climbed the roof of a submerged bus and sat there for around nine hours to save the cash from getting damaged from flood water, was felicitated by transport minister Anil Parab.

Aurangabad district registered daily Covid positivity rate of 0.83%, Parbhani (0.11%), Jalna (0.29%), Hingoli (0.48%) and Nanded (0.49%). While Latur has daily Covid positivity rate of 2.8%, Beed stood at 5.75% and Osmanabad at 5.19%. While the weekly positivity rate of aforesaid five Marathwada districts, which will form a basis for a new strategy for easing restrictions being planned by the state government could not be ascertained officially, some of these districts may benefit from the proposal concerned. Maharashtra public health minister Rajesh Tope has already said that the districts with lower than 1% weekly Covid positivity rate or lesser than the state’s average could witness further relaxation in existing curbs with final nod from the chief minister. The progressive count of active cases of Covid-19 across eight districts of Marathwada reached upto 2,781 by Wednesday morning with the region showing average recovery and mortality rate of 97.04% and 2.50% respectively. Meanwhile, rumours of Covid-related curbs getting lifted from immediate effect spread in parts of Marathwada in view of the comments made by Tope, prompting the authorities to dispel such hearsays. Latur district administration, in a public appeal, has requested citizens not to believe any rumours related to lifting of curbs. “The existing Covid-related will continue till further notice and all stakeholders are expected to abide by it,” Latur collector Pruthviraj B P said, adding that level-3 restrictions are being imposed on the line of many other districts from the state. Marathwada so far has witnessed around 6,13,726 cases of Covid-19 since March last year which include 5,95,574 recovered patients and 15,371 deaths. A total of 22,36,911 RT-PCR tests and 28,04,688 antigen tests have been conducted across eight districts of the region. The average positivity rate for RT-PCR test was 15.4% and 9.6% for antigen testing. Beed district, which has a major share of total active cases in the region, has planned more aggressive testing as a measure to contain the spread of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/below-1-daily-covid-positivity-rate-for-aurangabad-4-other-marathwada-districts/articleshow/84834502.cms||---

Later, she admitted the woman and her new-born girl to a hospital with the support of policemen posted with her at Dial 112 response vehicle. The woman, Rekha Devi, 26, a resident of Jalalabad town, had come to meet her relative in Shahjahanpur. She was accompanied by her inebriated husband Dinesh Kumar and mother Kaushalya. After de-boarding a bus, they decided to walk when Rekha went into labour pain while crossing a railway track. Her husband couldn’t do much because of his condition. But her mother started shouting for help. One of the locals, Vikas Kumar, tried to call an ambulance, but didn’t get any response due to the strike. So, he called Dial 112 and a response team arrived in five minutes. Head constable Manveer Singh and constable Vintu Pushkar found that any delay in the delivery would be dangerous so they arranged for delivery inside a shop. Vintu told TOI, “We didn’t have a moment to think and we did what we thought was right. Being a woman, I was able to empathize with Rekha. I helped in the delivery of her daughter. I am very happy that I was able to help the woman in need. My colleagues ensured that Rekha and her baby girl were admitted to a hospital on time after the delivery. I met her at the hospital later and she was thankful to us.” Vikas said, “Since ambulance was on strike, I thought that only police could help the woman as her husband was not bothered about her condition. After this incident, I have more respect for the police.” Lauding the efforts of the Dial 112 team, SSP S Anand said, “It was an extraordinary effort. I will recommend commendation letters for constable Vintu and other members of the response vehicle for their good work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/strike-up-cop-helps-pregnant-woman-deliver-baby-at-shop-later-takes-them-to-hospital/articleshow/84834496.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The island in Jamnagar which has a timeless feel to it, is all set to turn into a tourism destination, hosting water adventure rides and nature interpretation zones. “The idea is to make it a weekend family haunt, where along with adventure activities, we can provide an educational experience,” says a senior official of Gujarat Pollution Control Board. The forest department recently called for proposals from consultants to prepare a master plan to exploit Pirotan island’s tourism potential. The proposal claims that apart from hovercraft, catamarans and boat rides, there will be nature interpretation zones. “We cannot have intensive water sports as it is within the protected marine park limits,” adds the GPCB official. The island is blessed with mangroves, coral reefs, degraded reefs, inter-tidal mudflats (lower and higher), creeks, estuaries, sandy strands, saline grassland, marshy areas and rocky islands. The marine life system here is intricately woven. “Among things that will interest visitors the most are colourful sponges and corals, star fish, giant sea anemone, tube anemone, jelly fish, sea horse, octopus, oyster, and pearl oyster,” says the official. There are sea turtles, dolphins, dugongs and porpoise too.  Today, Pirotan island can be accessed from Bedi Port and Rozi Port. “Following initial survey and discussion with the port officer, Jamnagar, Rozi Port has been found most ideal location for accessing the Island,” claims a senior forest department official. The exact location of the boarding has been identified just near the entrance of the port. The forest department is also exploring suitable options within the Rozi Port for construction of a jetty, claim officials. A copy of the Pirotan island master plan proposal is with TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/strap-up-for-hovercraft-ride-at-pirotan/articleshow/84839486.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Agra||Aligarh: Girl turns 18, marries boy she had framed in rape case under pressure||AGRA: Just three months after she turned 18, an Aligarh girl married her boyfriend who has served eight months in jail after being accused of abducting and raping her -- an allegation which she says she made in 2019 after being “emotionally blackmailed” by her parents. The girl, Nisha Pathak (name changed), who turned 18 on March 31, has filed an affidavit in a POCSO court in Aligarh, saying that Vijay Agarwal (name changed), 20, was innocent and did not do anything “wrong with her”. Nisha said that she has been in a relationship with Vijay since she was in Class X after they met at a coaching class in 2017. She said that her parents were against the relationship. "They had pressed the charges in June, 2019 after spotting us together," she said. Nisha said that her parents had threatened that they would commit suicide if she did not give a statement against Vijay. Booked for abduction and rape of a minor, Vijay was arrested and sent to jail on June 7, 2019. He got bail from Allahabad high court in March 2020, after spending eight months in jail. On Tuesday, they got married in a temple in Aligarh. Nisha, who is pursuing BCA from a private engineering college in Mathura, went to the office of senior superintendent of police (SSP) before tying the knot and demanded police protection from her family members. But she added that she doesn’t want any action against her parents. “I fear that I will be killed by my uncles, who came to my in-laws house last night and threatened me and my husband,” Nisha told TOI. Vijay told TOI, “Khushi contacted me and came over to Aligarh a few days ago to file an affidavit in the court. Finally we got together.” Nisha’s lawyer Chitranjan Agarwal said that she appeared before the POCSO court on Tuesday and filed the affidavit. The date for the case’s hearing is scheduled on August 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/girl-turns-18-marries-boyfriend-she-had-framed-in-a-rape-case-under-parents-pressure/articleshow/84836894.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Allahabad||BJP cheating people in the name Ram Mandir: BSP’s Satish Mishra||Prayagraj: Keeping up his attack on the BJP government in the state, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) national general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Satish Chandra Mishra on Wednesday alleged that the BJP had "cheated" the people in the name of Lord Ram and of playing the temple card only to gain votes. The BSP general secretary, who has been holding the Prabudh Varg Sammelans to woo the Brahmin voters, once again raised the issue of VHP's donation drive for the Ram Mandir and alleged that the BJP had collected huge donations in the name of temple construction, only to fill its coffers. Mishra was in neighbouring Pratapgarh district on Wednesday, attending a Prabudh Varg Sammelan, the BSP's outreach programme to win over Brahmin voters in the state ahead of the 2022 assembly elections. In his 65 minute-long-speech at Ram Nagar under Raniganj assembly segment of Pratapgarh district, Mishra claimed that the temple foundation of Ram Mandir was not complete even though it had been over a year and said that the BJP has plans to collect funds in the name of the temple until the very completion of the mandir. Mishra credited the BSP for the "overall development" of many places like Bithoor, Varanasi ghats, and Vrindavan during its regime. He said that it was the BSP chief and former chief minister Mayawati who had created 17 new districts and as a result, a series of development works could be carried out. Claiming that the BJP had "cheated" the youth in the name of employment, Mishra said that lakhs of people had lost their jobs in BJP's regime. "The highest unemployment rate in the last 45 years was registered under this Modi led Union government's regime," said Mishra. The BSP general secretary also claimed that agitated farmers were seeking justice but that the Union government is unwilling to hear out their problems on the three controversial farm laws. He also accused BJP of shutting down over 450 Sanskrit schools in the state. The Rajya Sabha MP, speaking on the power of BSP's 'social engineering', said that the time had come when 23 per cent of the traditional BSP votes and 13 per cent of Brahmin voters came together in Uttar Pradesh to "uproot" the Yogi led BJP government in the state in 2022 state assembly polls. In an open pitch to woo the Brahmin voters, he also claimed that if the neglected Brahmin community comes in the BSP fold, they will have the key to power in the state after the 2022 assembly polls, Once again alleging that the BJP led state government was "committing atrocities on Brahmins and Dalits in the state", Mishra claimed that the priests and purohits who attended the Prabudh Varg conclave in Ayodhya recently, were harassed by the state government. The BSP general secretary, when asked if his party would form an alliance with any outfit in the state, said that the only alliance BSP had was with the people of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/bjp-cheating-people-in-the-name-ram-mandir-bsps-satish-mishra/articleshow/84841786.cms||---

---||Surat||Surat: Five cops booked for murder, atrocity||SURAT: Five policemen were booked for murder on Wednesday evening in connection with the death of two youths inside Chikhli police station last week. The offence was registered against suspended police inspector Ajitsinh Vala, sub-inspector M B Kokni, head constable Shaktisinh Zala, constables Ravindra Rathod and Ramji; based on a complaint filed by Mitesh Jadhav, brother of one of the deceased youths Ravi Jadhav. Ravi and Sunil Pawar (both aged 19 years) were found dead on the morning of July 21 inside the computer room of Chikhli police station. Police had claimed that the duo had hanged themselves using computer cables from the ceiling fan. The duo was picked up by the accused cops over suspicion of motorcycle theft the previous day. According to FIR, the five cops have been booked for murder, causing hurt, kidnapping, wrongful confinement, extortion, criminal conspiracy and various sections of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. “We have registered the FIR exactly what they (family of the deceased) have alleged in their complaint,” said inspector P G Chaudhary of Chikhli police station. The families had stated that cops of Chikhli police station had violated the legal guidelines that are supposed to be followed. They alleged that police did not make a note in the station diary about their arrest, nor informed families of the two suspects after they were arrested. The duo was not produced before a judicial magistrate nor a copy of the FIR was sent to the judicial magistrate’s court, the family members claimed. “They (family of the deceased youths) have alleged that the two suspects did not commit suicide but were killed inside the police station,” Chaudhary said. The investigation in the case has been handed over to R D Faldu, deputy superintendent of police (SC/ST cell). The registration of FIR comes after the family members of the deceased, members of the tribal community, BJP and Congress MLAs and local politicians made representations to the district collector and superintendent of police. Entire Dang district observed a complete bandh on July 26 in protest against the custodial deaths, leaving tourists helpless in Saputara and Waghai. Initially, senior police officials had suspended four cops except Vala to pacify people. However, the move raised questions and eventually Vala too was suspended. Later, the families of the two youths, supported by the community and elected leaders demanded that the offence be registered against the cops as Ravi and Sunil were illegally picked up and were healthy, a day before their bodies were found.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/five-cops-booked-for-murder-atrocity/articleshow/84836924.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Arrange for Yusuf Lakdawala to give view on mediation: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Wednesday directed the Arthur Road prison authorities to make arrangements for builder Yusuf Lakdawala to inform if he is willing to opt for mediation to amicably settle disputes with his second wife. A bench of Justices Prasanna Varale and Nitin Borkar heard a petition by Sabina Lakdawala for police protection and to quash an FIR for causing grievous hurt to Lakdawala’s daughter-in-law Noorie. Sabina’s petition says Lakdawala built an “empire worth over Rs 1000 crore’’ and assured her equal rights. With the economic offences wing and enforcement directorate instituting cases against Lakdawala, who is in prison due and ailing with prostate cancer, his children are forcing him to transfer his assets, it added. On June 26 the judges suggested that the parties explore mediation and Sabina’s advocates welcomed it. His children’s advocate Asadali Mazgaonwala said all her claims are against Lakdawala and the properties belong to him.“As he is in jail we are not able to take instructions,” he added. Asked about the possibility of complainant Noorie settling the matter with Sabina, Mazgaonwala replied, “There is no chance for settlement. She has undergone 20-23 stitches over her eye.” Sabina’s advocate Mathews Nedumpara said his client "is a single lady (sic) pitted against ten persons."  He said the Supreme Court has also suggested to the Kirloskar brothers to go for mediation. The judges said instructions from Lakdawala will have to be sought. The prosecutor informed that due to the pandemic jail visits are not permitted and a video call may be made. “It is a better way. It will serve the purpose,” said Justice Varale. The judges directed that Mazgaonwala will make a video call on July 30 between 2.30 – 4 pm and the prison authorities/superintendent will make necessary arrangements to establish Lakdawala’s contact with him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/arrange-for-lakdawala-to-give-view-on-mediation-in-mumbai-hc/articleshow/84843811.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Schools must be reopened for all classes and not just for IX to XII like last year,” said M Arumugam, state president, Federation of Private School Associations (FePSA). It is important especially for schools to reopen for primary and middle school students since they are the ones who have been unable to pick up on online learning. “It is much-needed especially for government school students who have been missing out on proper learning. If not reopened, many children may lose interest in school and go to work,” said the headmaster of a government higher secondary school. N Lakshmi, a science teacher of middle school students, said online classes have been just as pressurizing for teachers as well. “Teachers can be vaccinated for Covid-19 on priority and schools reopened. Online learning has affected them also, especially those from private schools as we are forced to work long hours to prepare material for teaching and recording videos. Students are also not paying attention properly in online classes,” she added. Parents and students are also equally keen on reopening of schools after over an entire academic year has passed since the Covid-19 pandemic began. “School reopening is essential but with restrictions like having classes on alternate days. Children have completely lost their routine, sleeping and eating whenever they want and are also getting addicted to TV, video games etc., This is affecting their health. Social interaction is also missed,” said Ramya R, parent of a Class XI student. Another parent, G Niraja, said schools must be opened for the sake of mental health of children. “Half a day of school at least will be a big relief for kids. They will at least get used to wearing masks, which is going to be a must in the long run,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/teachers-students-want-schools-to-reopen-in-phases/articleshow/84839468.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan
---||Delhi||Delhi: DCP’s reply sought on police inaction in DSSSB exam case||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has sought a response from the deputy commissioner of police (DCP) concerned on an application seeking action against the police officers for allegedly failing to lodge an FIR against the offenders within the timeline in a case related to caste-based questions being allegedly asked twice in the primary teachers’ recruitment exam held by Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board (DSSSB). The court had on February 17 this year directed the officer empowered under the SC/ST Act to conduct an investigation and file a monthly report before it in the case. Additional sessions judge Ravinder Bedi said that when ACP (Shahdara) was inquired as to why the order had not been complied with, he feigned ignorance and stated that the investigation had been deputed to him recently. “Despite the order dated February 17,2021 to register an FIR against the offenders for the offences under the provisions of The Atrocities Act, the same has not been complied with within timeline by police authorities and no reason has been placed forth before the court for the same,” the court said in its order. The court directed the DCP to file a detailed report. Advocate Satya Prakash Gautam had filed an application in March seeking necessary directions against the alleged erring police officers for neglect of duties. He further claimed that the police officers allegedly deliberately violated the court’s order. The application further stated that the alleged police officers are liable to be prosecuted as under section 4 (neglect of duties) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act or neglect of duties and under sections 166A (public servant disobeying law), 217 ( public servant disobeying direction of law with intent to save person from punishment), and 218 (public servant framing incorrect record or writing with intent to save person from punishment) of IPC. The police had submitted in its status report that they had registered two FIRs in the case on June 21 under the provisions of SC/ST Act. The FIR does not name anyone as accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dcps-reply-sought-on-police-inaction-in-dsssb-exam-case/articleshow/84841864.cms||Usha Das

However, the Nanded division, which caters to Marathwada, has been left out from the downward revision of the platform ticket rate. Aurangabad and Nanded are among the 80 stations in the Nanded division that would continue to have platform ticket priced at Rs 30 — which was temporarily raised from the earlier price of Rs 10 to restrict public movement at stations during the Covid outbreak. “The platform ticket rate, which was temporarily increased as a precautionary measure against Covid-19, has been revised downwards at all railway stations in the Secunderabad division. The decision has been taken in view of resumption of unreserved express trains over the rail network,” said an official release by SCR. Notably, Aurangabad and some other key stations in Marathwada have also started seeing the movement of unreserved trains in the form of three diesel electric multiple unit (DEMU) trains. Besides, unlike in past, when the pandemic was at its peak, those accompanying passengers of the express trains are now allowed to visit the platforms. They will each continue to shell out Rs 30 towards a platform ticket. Railway activist Gautam Nahata said the platform ticket rates in the Nanded division should also be slashed. “The Covid situation has been contained in the region. The hefty price of platform tickets is an additional financial burden on many,” he said. Rajesh Shinde, the public relations officer of the Nanded division of SCR, said the top-brass has not considered the Nanded division so far to restore platform ticket rate. “A set of Covid curbs is still in place in Maharashtra and, therefore, the Nanded division would be considered during the next official review,” he said. In the Secunderabad division, the decreased platform ticket fare at all railway stations, including non-suburban and suburban stations, will be Rs 10 except in Secunderabad and Hyderabad stations, where it will be Rs 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/scr-slashed-platform-ticket-rates-in-secunderabad-division-nanded-left-out/articleshow/84834549.cms||---

Government departments have failed to utilise funds allotted to them, Madkai MGP legislator Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar said while pointing out that although the state had borrowed around Rs 1,000 crore for development work, it had used just 20% of this to create infrastructure. “A small amount was used for infrastructure development and the rest to pay salaries,” he said. The MLA further said that there was no need to draw more money from the treasury as the House had already approved outflow of funds for five months during the budget session in March. “A very small amount has been utilised from the funds that were approved last time,” he said, and claimed that the GSIDC’s estimates for construction of bus terminus and hospitals have since increased. “The government will pass a budget, but where is the money to spend?” he asked.Porvorim independent MLA Rohan Khaunte, on the other hand, questioned the legality of the government making demands without passing a full-fledged budget.The government had, in March, sought a vote on account for five months to meet the expenses of the state till the budget for 2021-22 was passed when the state legislative assembly reconvened in July. The House had passed the Goa Appropriation (Vote on Account) Bill, 2021, enabling the government to withdraw Rs 10,439 crore from the consolidated fund of Goa to meet the estimated expenditure requirements of the state.Khaunte further said that his greatest concern was the ‘saffronisation’ of the 10,000 jobs announced by chief minister Pramod Sawant last month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/oppn-trains-guns-on-govt-over-poor-utilisation-of-funds-for-infra/articleshow/84841827.cms||---
---||Mumbai||At MVA cabinet meet, ministers push for easing of restrictions||MUMBAI: Considering the reducing number of daily Covid-19 cases in 25 districts of the total 36 in the state, the MVA government may relax lockdown-like restrictions if it follows recommendations of the public health and relief and rehabilitation departments. The relaxations may be sanctioned taking into consideration the positivity rate in areas and for people who are fully vaccinated. However, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will take a final call after meeting the state Covid task force members on Thursday. In the state cabinet meeting held on Wednesday, most of the ministers were in favour of relaxing restrictions in districts where the positivity rate is low. CM Thackeray, however, seems not too keen to approve the relaxations considering fears of spread of disease after easing of norms, a minister said. According to the health and relief and rehabilitation departments, of the 36 districts, 11 have a positivity rate higher than the state’s average rate, while 25 districts have a less-than-average rate. “It has been recommended that some relaxations should be provided so that timings of shops can be extended till 7 pm-8 pm in place of the current 4 pm closure deadline. Also, norms for restaurants, cinema halls and gyms can be relaxed for people who have been fully vaccinated and in districts with low positivity rate,” the minister said. The CM, however, pointed out ministers should not go by the current positivity rate but exercise caution when allowing relaxations, the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-at-mva-cabinet-meet-ministers-push-for-easing-of-restrictions/articleshow/84841855.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

As reiterated in my earlier D.O. letter dated 14.07.2021, all efforts should be made to ensure that there is no increase in the 'R' factor. Further, strictest possible measures should be taken in the districts that are still showing high positivity rates,” Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla wrote to all state chief secretaries and UT administrators. Drawing attention to the upcoming festival season, Bhalla impressed upon the states/UTs the need to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour in all crowded places. “There should be continuous focus on the five-fold strategy for effective management of Covid-19, that is, ‘test-track-treat-vaccination and adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he said. While noting that the decline in the number of active cases was a matter of satisfaction, Bhalla cautioned the states and UTs to re-open the activities within their jurisdiction in a gradual manner. “It may be noted that the absolute case numbers are still significantly high. Therefore, there is no room for complacency and the process of relaxing restrictions should be carefully calibrated, as has been reiterated in my earlier communications,” he said. Urging states and UTs to issue strict directions to the districts and all other local authorities concerned, to take necessary measures for management of Covid-19, Bhalla insisted that the officers should be made personally responsible for any laxity in strict enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour. He also advised that orders issued by the respective state and UT governments and district authorities in this regard be widely disseminated to the public and to the field functionaries for proper implementation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/as-festival-season-approaches-mha-asks-states-to-take-steps-to-ensure-no-rise-in-r-factor-of-coronavirus/articleshow/84844994.cms||Bharti Jain
---||Surat||Bizman denied ‘ownership’ of trademark, can’t use logo||Surat: Tables turned on a textile auxiliary products manufacturer after the court restrained him from using the very trademark for his products for which he had taken his estranged distant relative to court by filing a trademark suit against him. Petitioner Anil Gonawala, who manufactures and sells lace, ribbons, buttons, pins and needles among other products, had filed a trademark suit in October 2016 against Jitendra Jariwala, who too manufactures and sells the same products under the brand name ‘Bright’. Gonawala had claimed that he had been using the brand name for his products since 1990 and Jariwala later started manufacturing the same products using the same brand name. He asked the court to restrain Jariwala from using the brand name for any of his products and be ordered to pay a meagre amount Rs 300 as damages. However, matters related to ‘Bright’ started to become a quite ‘dark’ for Gonawala when the court realized that his intentions were merely to harass his kin after he could not produce any evidence that he was the holder of the trademark during the court proceedings. Jariwala was never cross-examined during the hearing nor was the evidence submitted by his firm rebutted by Gonawala. In fact, after the matter was set for trial, Gonawala and his advocate never appeared before the court.Jariwala filed a counterclaim stating that he has been using the brand name since 1999. He even stated that Gonawala had applied for the trademark of ‘Bright’, he had opposed it due to which Gonawala’s application was abandoned. He also claimed that Gonawala had filed the suit only to harass and extort money from him. Last week, the court of additional district and sessions judge V N Mapara upheld Jariwala’s claim and held that Gonawala’s suit was frivolous. The court declared that Gonawala is not entitled to use the trademark ‘Bright’ or any other identical or similar trademarks for products which are also manufactured and sold by Jariwala. He was also asked to not cause any hindrance to Jariwala in using the ‘Bright’ trademark. The court further asked the petitioner not only to bear his own cost of litigation, but also pay the cost borne by Jariwala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/bizman-denied-ownership-of-trademark-cant-use-logo/articleshow/84836958.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Maharashtra records 286 fatalities as Mumbai witnesses only six deaths||MUMBAI: While Mumbai continued to report single-digit Covid-19 fatalities (6), the state reported 286, the highest in nearly 45 days. Maharashtra reported 6,857 cases on Wednesday. The total cases climbed to 62.8 lakh and deaths rose to 1,32,145. Officials blamed the surge in fatalities on some districts updating their data and adding old deaths to their tally. Vasai-Virar added 56 deaths on Wednesday while Raigad district added 34 deaths and Satara added 40 deaths. The daily Covid-29 cases in Mumbai climbed to 403, two days after registering the lowest-in-15-months tally of 297. A BMC public health department doctor said the cases for the last two weeks were below the 500-mark, which had become the city’s average for a month before that. The city’s total caseload touched 7.3 lakh and fatalities rose to 15,860. At the moment, only 13.3 % of the 21,315 Covid-19 beds in the city are occupied. The occupancy of ICU beds is 36% as 827 of the 2,283 ICU beds are occupied. Doctors said the second wave is on the decline. “In the last week, the occupancy rate in our hospitals is under 20, while for most of the second wave all our 70 beds were occupied,” said Dr Prince Surana of the Surana Sethia Hospital in Chembur. Another indicator is the dipping weekly growth rate of the infection: in B ward (P D Mello Road), the weekly growth rate is the lowest in the city at 0.02% and the case doubling rate is 3,805 days. The city’s overall growth rate is 0.05% and the doubling rate is 1,383 days.

According to a purported suicide note, which he left behind, some businessmen owed him lakhs of rupees, but did not pay him back. Police had to stop his cremation on Tuesday and remove his half-burnt body from the pyre after receiving information about his "mysterious death". The body was immediately sent for postmortem. The report, however, did not reveal the exact cause of his passing away. But, preliminary investigation suggested that Gupta had consumed some poisonous substance and his viscera has been preserved for further study. Police said that Gupta’s wife Chanchal Gupta is suffering from cancer and he needed money for her treatment and was mentally depressed after he failed to get it. He had shifted to Agra from Rajkot since the Covid-19 pandemic and had been staying in a rented apartment with his family. His wife told police that he went out on Monday and did not return till 7 pm. So, she called him up. The phone was answered by some passersby who told her that he was lying unconscious at Balkeshwar Ghat. She reached there and took him to a hospital where he was declared dead. Station house officer of Kamlanagar police station, Narendra Sharma, said that acting on information received by the control room, police stopped his cremation and sent his body for postmortem.

---||Delhi||Children at protest sites: Rights panels not on same page||NEW DELHI: National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) have taken opposite stand in Delhi High Court over alleged participation of children from two childcare homes in the protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act last year. These homes are run by an entity associated with social activist Harsh Mander and had approached the court challenging NCPCR’s adverse inspection report and subsequent prosecution. While NCPCR said such action of taking children to protest sites was prima facie in violation of the child protection laws, DCPCR had taken a contrary view. The two childcare homes — Ummeed Aman Ghar for Boys and Khushi Rainbow Home for Girls — are run by the Centre for Equity Studies where Mander, an ex-IAS officer is a director. Based on NCPCR inspection report of October 2020, prosecution was started against the two homes. NCPCR had contended that, while “one of the girls shared that she along with 4-5 girls went to Jantar Mantar during CAA protest”, it found that older boys were also sent to the protests. Such usage of children is illegal and prima facie a violation of Section 83(2) of Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, it claimed. However, DCPCR maintained that protesting against the government’s policy decision was not illegal. “All citizens, including children, are well within their right to know, discuss, debate any issue facing India and form their own conclusions. The fear expressed by NCPCR is rooted in the belief that children are stupid, have no agency and cannot think at all. DCPCR vehemently opposes such a belief and expects greater dignity be accorded to children.”, it said, urging the court to quash the report and the consequent proceedings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/children-at-protest-sites-rights-panels-not-on-same-page/articleshow/84841904.cms||---

---||Chennai||DMK’s sartorial transition: From ‘karai veshti’ to party symbols close to the heart||CHENNAI: Moving away from the traditional ‘karai veshti’, a new crop of young DMK leaders has changed the way politicians look in the state. Sporting white shirts with jeans or formal shirts and trousers, the young leaders have embraced modern attire without losing the party’s intrinsic sartorial style — they wear the DMK party flag and symbol close to their heart. Mannargudi MLA T R B Rajaa wears a shirt with a party flag embedded on the pocket. A trendsetter, he had earlier tweeted saying, "I prefer to wear the party flag close to my heart". Since assuming charge as the DMK youth wing secretary in July 2019, Udhayanidhi Stalin has been wearing jeans and white shirt with the youth wing logo printed on the pocket — a man holding the party flag beneath the blazing sun. This has brought a change in the outlook of DMK partymen, particularly members of the youth wing. State deputy secretary of youth wing Thoothukudi S Joel prefers to wear shirts and trousers while in Chennai, and slips into the traditional veshti-shirt when he is in his native district. While the DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi’s contemporaries continue to wear veshtis with borders of the party colours, the younger leaders, including health minister Ma Subramanian prefer to wear trousers. From black trousers and white shirts in his earlier days as a youth wing leader, Stalin adopted casual wear that suited the day’s affair when he became the mayor of Chennai Corporation in October 1996. He got a makeover when he toured the state under the ‘Naamakku Naame’ campaign in 2015. He is seen in sportswear when he cycles. Recalling the early days, party organising secretary R S Bharathi said party founder C N Annadurai and senior leaders wore ‘jubba’ (kurta) and always had a ‘thundu’ (black and red border towel) on their shoulders. Party functionaries would not be allowed to step on to the stage and speak, if they did not wear the party’s ‘karai veshti’. "It was an unwritten rule those days. In fact, the DMK party had a uniform colour code for different wings such as youth (white trouser and shirt), advocate (black trouser and white shirt) and labourers (black trouser and red shirt). It was introduced by the youth wing leader and now party president M K Stalin," said Bharathi. In the late 1970s, the practice among functionaries of using ‘thundu’ faded away and a new crop of leaders emerged from the youth wing. "It shows the evolution of the party and how it adapts to the changes," Bharathi said, while minister Subramanian said it was a welcome change. He wears veshti and shirt during the Pongal festival, while on the other days he prefers black trousers and a white shirt. The party functionaries find their own tailors to design the logo for them. The young leaders hold on to the party’s core ideology and continue to adopt modernity. "It is not just a transition of attire; it reflects the quality of the young policy makers from the Dravidian movement. It’s a positive outlook. Since I don’t wear ‘karai (black and red border) veshti’ that touches the feet, I wear the party flag close to my heart to show I am a proud DMKian," said T R B Rajaa, who is also a member of the state development policy council. He has been wearing shirts with the party flag embedded on the pocket for more than six years and has made it his trademark. The look of the young generation of DMK members also reflects the people of the state, who are educated, he said. His father and senior party leader T R Baalu was the trendsetter during the 1980s. He was the first district secretary to go around in trousers and shirt. The DMK is all about adapting to changes without compromising on its core value and ideology, said Thousand Lights MLA Dr N Ezhilan, who wears a white shirt with black and red stripes on the inner collar. "It is all about comfort. What I prefer suits me to carry out my duty as a doctor and a people’s representative," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/dmks-sartorial-transition-from-karai-veshti-to-party-symbols-close-to-the-heart/articleshow/84839623.cms||Shanmughasundaram J

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat govt slashes RT-PCR test, HRCT scan rates||GANDHINAGAR: The state government announced on Wednesday that rates of RT-PCR tests and HRCT scans have been slashed. Private laboratories will now charge Rs 400 instead of Rs 700 for conducting RT-PCR tests. For RT-PCR samples collected from homes or hospitals, private laboratories cannot charge more than Rs 550, a reduction of Rs 350 from the existing rate of Rs 900, deputy chief minister Nitin Patel told reporters in Gandhinagar. In another significant discount, RT-PCR tests conducted by private laboratories for passengers at airports in the state will now cost Rs 2,700, a reduction of Rs 1,300 from the existing Rs 4,000. Patel further said private radiology centres cannot charge more than Rs 2,500 for a high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan. This is a reduction of Rs 500 from the earlier fixed charges of Rs 3,000. The HR-CT scan is vital to ascertain Covid-19 infection in patients. The decision to reduce the rates of RT-PCR tests has been taken keeping in mind the drop in the prices of kits used in these tests, and as part of the state government’s preparation for a possible third wave of the pandemic, he added. Providing figures, Patel said that 1,66,99,857 RT-PCR tests and 91,55,936 Rapid Antigen Tests have been conducted in Gujarat. “For those who seek to get themselves tested in private laboratories, the state government had reduced the rates on two occasions in the past. The price of kits used in RT-PCR tests has also come down. So a government core committee has decided to slash the cost of tests,” Patel said. He said the health department has launched measures to tackle a possible third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The first thing to ascertain if a patient is Covid-19 positive or not is the RT-PCR test,” Patel added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/state-govt-slashes-rt-pcr-test-hrct-scan-rates/articleshow/84839651.cms||---
---||India||Covid-19: Social distancing likely to cause sharp rise in polling booths in state elections next year||NEW DELHI: The five state polls coming up next year, for which the Election Commission held the first preparatory meeting on Wednesday, may see polling booths increase by nearly 25,000 in UP, 11,000 in Punjab, 2,160 in Uttarakhand and 262 in Manipur, according to early estimates. The rise is on account of EC’s move to cut voters per polling station to around 1,200 from the usual 1,600 to maintain social distancing in view of the Covid pandemic. EC sources clarified that the figures cited above are provisional, based on suggestions received by it during internal discussions. They are based on a formula that seeks to work out the number of polling stations with the 1,200-voters cap per polling station and the overall turnout at the last Lok Sabha and assembly poll in the state concerned. “The final figures may be different based on any future change in the Covid situation. EC is right now only starting with advance planning for a smooth conduct of polls despite Covid concerns,” an EC functionary told TOI. In the last Lok Sabha poll, UP had approximately 1.62 lakh polling stations, Uttarakhand 11,200, Punjab 23,000, Manipur 2,862 and Goa 1,652. At the review meeting chaired by chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra with election commissioner Anup Chandra Pandey and attended by chief electoral officers of the five poll-bound states of UP, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur, the CEC emphasised on the need to ensure purity of electoral rolls and expedite disposal of voter registration applications. Chandra called for early identification of manpower needed for the polls so that the state concerned can be told to ensure their vaccination in time for the polls. Covid mitigation plan, rationalisation of polling stations and early planning of postal ballots to be used by senior citizens and persons with disabilities, etc, were the other issues discussed. Chandra told the CEOs election planning needs to have a voter-centric approach and participative decision-making involving all stakeholders. Election commissioner Pandey asked the CEOs to focus on filling up infrastructure gaps & logistics requirements, updation & purification of electoral rolls and an extensive voter education & empowerment outreach program. The five state CEOs gave a detailed presentation on health of electoral roll, availability of budget, manpower resources, SVEEP, planning, polling station arrangements and IT applications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-social-distancing-likely-to-cause-sharp-rise-in-polling-booths-in-state-elections-next-year/articleshow/84844995.cms||Bharti Jain

---||Delhi||Delhi govt may take control of Apeejay School||NEW DELHI: Delhi government has decided to issue a show-cause notice to Apeejay School, Sheikh Sarai, for taking over its management. The proposal of Directorate of Education (DoE) was approved by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and now it has been sent to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal for his nod. DoE claimed that the school had repeatedly failed to comply with various orders of the government on rollback of hiked fees. However, the school said the fees was charged on the basis of a Delhi High Court order. On May 4, 2020, DoE had sealed the premises of the school for violating their order on fee hike. The school then moved the high court, which directed for de-sealing the premises and gave it a chance of being heard. A statement issued by the government mentioned, “DoE had inspected the financial statement of the school for fiscal years 2012-2013 to 2018-2019. The department found that the total funds for 2018-2019 were Rs 49,72,45,586 of which the expenditure was estimated to be Rs 18,87,02,422. This implied that there was a net surplus of Rs 30,85,43,164. The department concluded that the school had no actual need to increase the fees.” This was reason Delhi government didn’t accept the proposal for increase in fees for academic sessions 2018-2019 and 2019-2020. “The directorate then issued notices to the school, asking why its recognition should not be cancelled or why the government should not take over the management. Several notices were issued for not charging increased fees, but the school did not submit a reply. The school approached the high court, but the judge endorsed DoE’s order and asked for rollback of the increased fees,” the government stated. Apeejay School, in a statement, said, “We are shocked at the prejudicial and incorrect statements made by Delhi government while the matter is subjudice, and especially during Covid-19. Our parents and students will remain unaffected and we will continue our excellent virtual education in partnership with them.” Deputy CM and education minister Manish Sisodia said, “The Kejriwal government will not let injustice prevail. Parents should rest assured that we will stand with them and not let them face any difficulties.” This is the second takeover announced by Delhi government this year. On June 26, the takeover of the government-aided Swami Sivanand Memorial School, Punjabi Bagh, had been announced. On July 16, the government had ordered the closure of SD Public School, Kirti Nagar. In 2016, the government had ordered the takeover of two branches of Maxfort School. However, the school moved court and was granted relief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-may-take-control-of-apeejay-school/articleshow/84839734.cms||---

However, a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Jyoti Singh made it clear it was not issuing notice at this stage and only wanted a short reply from the Centre, after it opposed the plea raising preliminary objection that the petitioner has not made the investigating agencies parties to the petition and has not disclosed the name of the advocate on whom the search was conducted. Petitioner Nikhil Borwankar, a lawyer, sought direction for framing of guidelines for conducting search on advocates with adequate safeguards to ensure provisions of law pertaining to attorney-client privilege and their fundamental rights are protected. Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma submitted that the Centre was opposing this petition “tooth and nail” and the court must not issue notice without giving them a hearing. “Who is this advocate must be disclosed. What is the relation of this advocate with the petitioner must be disclosed,” he contended. Appearing for the petitioner, advocate Prashant Bhushan said the plea was filed at a time when there existed an atmosphere of deep mistrust between advocates and law enforcement agencies with regard to recent searches executed against certain advocates representing accused persons and victims in controversial cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centres-stand-sought-on-norms-for-search-on-lawyers-premises/articleshow/84841981.cms||---

The timing of vaccination centres has also been fixed from 9am to 5pm, although centres that may want tofunction longer will have the liberty to do so. The BMC received 1.79lakh Covid vaccine doses on Wednesday. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the city received 1.79 lakh Covishield doses, which will help sustain the momentum for a few days. The city on Wednesday vaccinated 57,362 people. So far, 69,66,930 doses have been administered in the city. TimesViewVaccination through walk-ins continues to be a problem in the city. It has been over six months since vaccination has started, yet serpentine queues are a common sight. While the BMC has often blamed the shortage of doses for the overcrowding and long wait in vaccination centres, efforts must be made to evolve a more efficient system.Kakani said a special drive will raise coverage in slums. “Special camps will be set up inside slum pockets, where registrations will be done on the spot from next week. The 50% online vaccination and 50% through walk-ins is not possible to implement in slums since not everyone has access to cellphones or internet,” he said. In Mumbai, nearly 17 lakh people have been fully vaccinated while 36.14 lakh people have got the first dose. The city has an estimated adult population of 93 lakh. Several corporates and NGOs have tied up with private hospitals to vaccinate people living in slums. Jaslok Hospital has tied upwith Citi Bank to vaccinate people living in Dharavi. Godrej Hospital too is planning to start a CSR drive. The announcement about timings was made given that hundreds continue to queue up outside centres hours before these open. The slot announcements will be made through Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, the BMC said. Mumbaikars said walk-in continues to be a mess as there are limited slots. People are forced to queue up from 5am and 6am as there are limited coupons. Every centre has 100-200 slots, of which doses are reserved for walk-in and online. Slots are further divided between first and second dose recipients. RN Cooper, Juhu, Babasaheb Ambedkar, Kandivli, Rajawadi, Ghatkopar and BYL Nair, Mumbai Central, have administered over a lakh doses each so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-to-announce-slots-for-vaccination-at-5-30pm-on-social-media/articleshow/84841971.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Restaurateurs welcome curfew cut; wedding industry elated||AHMEDABAD: Restaurateurs and hoteliers in Ahmedabad are rejoicing the government decision to reduce the curfew timing by an hour. Just a day ahead of the decision, citing the reduced number of Covid-19 cases in Gujarat, the Hotels and Restaurants Association (HRA) of the state has asked that the curfew be imposed from midnight instead of the present 10pm. Dilip Thakkar, an Ahmedabad-based restaurateur said, “The relief in timings will go a long way in helping the restaurants revive their business.” Narendra Somani, president, HRA — Gujarat, said, “With curfew being imposed at 10pm, restaurants are compelled to stop walk-ins at 9pm and this is affecting footfalls. With reduced curfew timings business will get a good boost,” the representation states. Hoteliers said 85% of dine-in business takes place in the evenings and with curtailed timings, footfalls are lower. HRA Gujarat had also sought to increase the cap on the number of guests allowed at weddings to at least 500. The government decision to increase the cap on guests at weddings and other social gatherings to 400 persons too has come as a major relief, especially to caterers and hoteliers. Somani said that Rs 2,000 crore of business loss was reported by catering and banquets industry due to the pandemic. The decision will bring in the much-needed relief to weddings industry and give business to several small traders associated with the business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/restaurateurs-welcome-curfew-cut-wedding-industry-elated/articleshow/84839764.cms||---
---||Goa||‘Govt snatching rights of MLAs’||Porvorim: Opposition leader Digambar Kamat on Wednesday alleged that the state government, after destroying every constitutional institution, “has now snatched the constitutional rights” of elected representatives even in the assembly. He said the Pramod Sawant-led government would go down in history for passing the state budget without proper discussion. It was shocking, he said, to listen to the blatant lies of the legislative affairs minister claiming that the business advisory committee had agreed to suspend the rules for passing the budget without discussion. Kamat and GFP president Vijai Sardesai wondered why the government would ask for such an intervention when the opposition has long been demanding for an extended assembly session. Sardesai also alleged that there was a scam in the private forest issue. “The government is scared to face the opposition. Replies were not given to various questions, including the postponed starred questions. This government wants to hide its misdeeds,” Kamat told reporters. He also said that the government had compromised the interests of the state by “selling” the Mhadei river to Karnataka. “The admission of water resources minister Filipe Neri Rodrigues that former Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar had written to Karnataka’s BJP president on the eve of the southern state’s elections without Cabinet approval, clearly showed that he had compromised Goa’s interests to give political advantage to Karnataka,” the leader of opposition said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-snatching-rights-of-mlas/articleshow/84842000.cms||---

The opposition also expressed concern over the recent floods that led to immense loss of property, livestock and homes in the state. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat said that students across Goa are unable to attend online classes due to poor infrastructure for internet connectivity. Kamat questioned the delay resolving the connectivity issue. “It is important to note that the lives of student community are at risk as they are attending online classes sitting in forest areas and roadsides in search of internet connectivity in rural and urban areas,” said Kamat. Opposition MLAs also highlighted the plight of the flood-affected who lost homes, crops and belongings due to “man-made disasters, which includes floods”. The opposition said that fields are flooding due to the shoddy work by PWD and NHAI contractors. The opposition said that “unplanned and unscientific planning” along with a lack of “immediate response from the National Disaster Response Force and State Disaster Response Force” resulted in a huge loss in the state. MLAs Ramkrishna Dhavalikar, Rohan Khaunte, Vijai Sardesai, Prasad Gaonkar and Vinod Paliencar also raised concerns over the damage to water pipelines, haphazard construction of roads, debris being dumped in gutters and flooding of roads and fields. “Basic amenities should not be compromised on on the pretext of infrastructural development of thestate, particularly keeping in mind the Covid crisis,” said Sardesai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/students-risking-lives-for-internet-kamat/articleshow/84841961.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: 40 bird species form flocks of flight risk||AHMEDABAD: Researchers from Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History have identified 76 species of birds in the 10km radius of the Ahmedabad airport. The bird sightings were recorded from 16,235 encounters. Of the 76 species, 22 were found across all areas of the airport. The researchers found 40 bird species within the airport campus; the figure was 45 in the 2km area from the airport. The researchers’ recent study is titled ‘Bird hazard in select Indian airfields — Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport’. Its authors are P Pramod and P V Karunakaran with Anees Khan and Binisha B. Their centre is based in Coimbatore. The report was submitted to the authorities in August 2020. The researchers had divided the study area in Ahmedabad into various zones: zero km, that is the airport itself; 0-2km; 2-5km; and 5-10km. “High congregation of blue rock pigeon was observed inside the airport area,” the study said. “The building owned and managed by the airport authority is being used as perches and resting sites by these birds.” Pigeon-proofing arrangements are required urgently to control roosting, the study said. It added: “All the unused hangers and buildings in the airport serve as a safe roosting area for these pigeons.” The study suggested that along with pigeon-proofing of buildings, trapping and relocation of the birds be undertaken. It has been suggested that the birds be rehabilitated at least 10km away from the airport. “There are many solid waste dumping sites and meat or butcher shops located adjacent to one of the landing and take-off quarters of the area,” the study said. “As a result, crows and kites were observed abundantly and frequently in this area.” Hence the cleanliness of the surrounding landscape is vital to manage these birds and the potential threat from them to aircraft, the study said. “Cleanliness drive and regular surveillance should be conducted specifically in these areas around the airport,” the study said. The study also suggested that the banks of water bodies be covered with nets to prevent the congregation of water birds. A focused study on the identified problems about birds has been recommended. The study should cover the birds’ activity pattern and their behavioural aspects such as feeding, roosting, and nesting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/40-bird-species-form-flocks-of-flight-risk/articleshow/84839803.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

---||Ahmedabad||Govt insurance: 21% of claims made in 2nd wave||AHMEDABAD: Reflecting the high Covid-19 toll in the second wave in April and May, 21% of the claims disbursed under the PMJJBY (Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana) since April 2020 were during 2020-21’s first quarter. Data tabled in the parliament suggests that Gujarat reported about 7,020 claims disbursed under the PMJJBY from April 2020 to June 2021. Of these, 1,529 claims were disbursed in the first quarter of the year 2021-22 alone.  “The mortality rate in the second wave of Covid-19 infections was high due to which many people succumbed,” said M M Bansal, convener, State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC), Gujarat. “So more claims were lodged during the year. The majority of the claims pertained to Covid-related deaths.” Of the total claim amount of Rs 1,439.26 crore disbursed from April 2020 to June 2021 in India, Rs 139.4 crore was disbursed in Gujarat — 10% of the total across the country. According to the data released by department of financial services, this is the second highest disbursal in the country, the maximum being Rs 187.2 crore in Uttar Pradesh. “Greater adoption and more awareness in Gujarat about the government-backed insurance scheme is also one of the clear reasons for the surge in claims,” Bansal said. In fact, Gujarat has some 250 more claims under PMJJBY pending with banks and post offices. According to SLBC-Gujarat, about 6.98 lakh new enrolments under PMJJBY were registered during the pandemic year. PMJJBY provides a life insurance cover of Rs 2 lakh as part of the Union government’s social security scheme at a nominal premium of Rs 330. “The PMJJBY comes at a very nominal premium,” said an Ahmedabad-based banker. “At a time when a lot of people lost their lives to Covid-19, an increasing number opted for the government-backed life insurance scheme, especially amid the rising uncertainty due to the pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-insurance-21-of-claims-made-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/84839760.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Kolkata||Camera trap census: At 96, Sunderbans big cat population remains stable||KOLKATA: The tiger population in the Indian Sunderbans has remained stable in the past one year. A day before the Global Tiger Day on July 29, state forest minister Jyotipriya Mullick released the report, saying that the mangroves is home to 96 tigers, as per the camera trap exercise undertaken by the state forest department between December 2020 and February 2021 — also known as the Phase IV estimation. Similar exercise last year had also pegged the number at 96. As per the latest estimation, while the tiger reserve area is home to 74 tigers, the area outside it, called the South 24 Parganas forest division, has 22 big cats. Last year, 73 tigers were clicked inside the tiger reserve area while 23 outside it. Of the 74 big cats in the tiger reserve area, 12 were found in Sajnekhali Wildlife sanctuary area, 17 in Basirhat range, 21 in National Park East and 24 in National Park West range. Of the 22 tigers in South 24 Pgns division, 4 were found in Matla range, 11 in Raidighi and 7 clicked in Ramganga range. While the All India Tiger Estimation, which was last done in 2018 and had pegged the presence of 88 tigers in the Sunderbans, is conducted every four years by the Centre, the Phase IV monitoring is conducted by the state to monitor the population for the next four years till the next All-India estimation. The Phase IV monitoring also aims to find out the minimum number of tigers. This time, 1,395 cameras (close to 700 pairs) were placed across the Sunderbans compared to 1,200 used during the same exercise in 2019-2020. Of this, WWF-India gave 400 cameras. “The entire mangrove forest was divided into 2 sq km grids, each with two camera traps,” said chief wildlife warden VK Yadav, adding that 4 cubs clicked in Basirhat and National Park East ranges were not taken into account while arriving at the final number. He said that this is the minimum number that have been photographed and that the actual number may be higher. “In order to get more accurate details we want to divide the entire mangrove forest of 4,500 sq km into 1 sq km grid and place two cameras at each grid. For this, we are planning to procure 800 more trap cameras,” he added. State wildlife advisory board member Biswajit Roy Chowdhury said that the yearly exercise is important as far as monitoring of the tiger population is concerned. “The results show that the tiger population in the Sunderbans has remained stable,” he added. Meanwhile, Yadav said the department would soon set up a mangrove research centre in Sajnekhali. “It will be used for research on mangroves that will eventually help in our plantation activities,” Yadav said, adding that a control room will be set up in Sajnekhali that will collect details regarding protection and monitoring activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/camera-trap-census-at-96-sunderbans-big-cat-population-remains-stable/articleshow/84839759.cms||Krishnendu Mukherjee
---||Delhi||Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia seeks view of parents, teachers on school reopening||NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday sought suggestions from students, parents, and teachers regarding reopening of schools and colleges in Delhi. Within three hours of the announcement, the government had already received over 5,000 emails. Among the few mails that was checked, many expressed interest in re-opening of schools. One can mail their suggestions to the government at delhischools21@gmail.com. Depending on the response, the government will take a call whether schools are to be reopened. Due to the Covid pandemic, the majority of schoolchildren haven’t attended physical classes for over 16 months now. “At the moment, special PTMs are being organised at all Delhi government schools from July 19 to 31. I visited some schools and interacted with parents and teachers during the PTM. All were curious regarding reopening of schools, mixed with fear about the safety of the children,” Sisodia claimed. The minister added that as colleges have been closed, youth have also spent more than a year confined to their houses. “College life of our youth has also been reduced to a small room in houses. They dream of studying proudly in big colleges, but because of the pandemic, their campus is also confined to their homes. Therefore, the youth are curious about when and how their colleges will open,” he added. As the pandemic began to rage in the city, Delhi government closed schools and colleges keeping in mind the safety and security of children. But now, schools have opened or are opening in nearby states and the Covid situation in Delhi is also under control,” the deputy CM said, adding that approximately 75,000 tests are being conducted daily in the capital, of which only around 40-50 are returning a positive result. “However, before making any decision to open educational institutions, Delhi government wants to take suggestions from parents, teachers, principals, and children as to when and how educational institutions can be reopened,” he added. Sisodia also shared that in the special PTMs running across government schools, over five lakh parents have visited the schools and interacted with the teachers about their child’s education and well-being. “This shows the outstanding success of Delhi’s education system, with parents taking a keen interest in their children’s education,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sisodia-seeks-view-of-parents-teachers-on-school-reopening/articleshow/84839780.cms||---

Special Public Prosecutor Pardeep Gharat told a single bench presided over by Justice Anuja Prabhudesai that Rajan had multiple cases pending against him and was convicted and sentenced in a host of other cases. Gharat urged the high court not to grant bail to Rajan, saying the gangster was a ‘Z plus security threat’. He said Rajan had fled India and travelled to several other countries on fake names and passports before he was finally arrested and extradited to India in November 2015. Rajan was extradited from Indonesia in 2015 and has been in judicial custody at the Tihar prison in New Delhi since then. Gharat was making submissions opposing an interim application filed by Rajan, seeking bail in a case of attempt to murder a hotelier. Rajan was sentenced to imprisonment for eight years in the case by a special court in Mumbai in 2019 under the MCOCA. However, Rajan's counsel, told HC that there was no credible evidence against the gangster in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-respect-for-countrys-law-cbi-opposes-rajans-bail-plea/articleshow/84843985.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi board looks to take IB route for excellence||NEW DELHI: The Delhi Board of School Education (DBSE) and the International Baccalaureate (IB) Board are working on a collaboration for the state government’s new Specialised Schools of Excellence (SOE) and for a pilot project on some Sarvodaya Schools. IB has submitted a proposal to the government about the application process and details of the curricula. This year, the existing Schools of Excellence and Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya (RPVV) will form the SOE, where four specialisations will be introduced for students from classes IX to XII. The new institutions will be affiliated with DBSE. The document submitted by IB to the Directorate of Education states, “DBSE has expressed interest in applying for IB programmes via an expression of interest during our discussions, and IB, through this proposal, is motivated to collaborate with DBSE in order to bring the benefits of IB’s programmes to schools within the group, across the entire cycle of IB affiliation process from the application of candidacy to authorisation and beyond.” According to a senior government official, the two parties are working out the modalities of engagement. Presentations have been made to the heads of schools in both these categories and details shared with them. As per the presentations, the performing and visual arts and 21st century skills specialisation will be handled through the IB careers programme and the humanities programme entirely by IB. For Sarvodaya Vidyalayas, IB will work with DBSE as a “knowledge partner”. The document states, “We propose to offer IB programmes to a group of DBSE schools. DBSE will benefit from a 75% reduction in the AFC application fees. The DBSE team will identify the school leaders and schools which will adopt the IB programmes across Delhi.” The plan is for the heads of the chosen schools to apply for IB candidacy, about which some of the institutions have queries. One asked: “Do we have to consider all the class sections or can we select only 4-5 sections because taking all the sections means a student strength of 1,814? If we go for selection, the number may be limited to 1,100. Kindly guide us for further processing.” Another said, “How will this primary years programme (PYP) offered by IB differ from the continuous and comprehensive evaluation (CCE) system and the no detention policy?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-board-looks-to-take-ib-route-for-excellence/articleshow/84839852.cms||Shradha Chettri

Although the airbag of the driver’s seat opened, Salunkhe sustained severe head injuries, indicating that the car was being driven at a very high speed. The car would have skidded further along the road but halted only because it hit the streetlight. His friend Akshay Nandkumar (25), a Chembur resident, who was seated beside him, had fallen out of the car after it crashed the median. He was found severely injured in the bushes about 25 feet away from the spot where the car had hit the streetlight pole. Nandkumar has been admitted to Apollo Hospital in CBD-Belapur.

Police suspect the bus was being driven on the wrong carriageway. The bus driver fled after the accident, but was later arrested. An initial probe suggests that the cluster bus was taking a turn and entered the carriageway from where the Swift car was coming, leading to a head-on collision. The impact was such that the front portion of the car got completely damaged. The deceased have been identified as Akhil (35), Pradeep Singh (32) and his brother Kuldeep Singh. The injured man, their friend Sahil, is currently undergoing treatment. The accident took place around 10pm. A call was received at Chhawla police station reporting that a car and bus had collided, resulting in grievous injury to four occupants of the car. DCP (Dwarka) Santosh Meena said when cops reached the spot, they found that passersby had pulled out the four men from the car and rushed them to Rao Tula Ram Hospital. “The hospital informed us that Akhil had been declared dead. Pradeep was shifted to Safdarjung Hospital, but he died there. Kuldeep was taken to Venkateshwar Hospital, but even he could not be saved. Sahil is still in a critical condition,” he added.

About 60 teachers who had gathered for the paper checking stated that that the Central board in Class XII has announced MCQ-based examination pattern for Class XII Science students for the March 2022 examination.  The teachers said that the Gujarat Board usually follows the CBSE pattern and announces the changes. “The CBSE board has announced the examination pattern a fortnight ago, but the Gujarat government has not made any such announcement yet.” The teachers stated that the Gujarat government should also hold MCQ examination for 50% of the syllabus in November or December followed by the written examination in March or April. The teachers of Class XII from the government schools have demanded that the announcement should be made in advance so that students are relieved of the major stress and they can make preparation for the examination accordingly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mcq-teachers-want-guj-to-follow-cbse/articleshow/84839949.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Can there be common CET question paper for all boards?: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday directed the Maharashtra government to inform whether a common question paper can be set on the syllabi of SSC, ICSE, CBSE and IGCSE boards for the optional common entrance test (CET) for admissions to junior colleges. The bench of Justices Ramesh Dhanuka and Riyaz Chagla asked whether a committee can be constituted of boards, who are party to the petition, “to prepare a comm-on paper which would include the questions relating to the subjects opted by stud-ents who passed through” th-ese boards. It also asked the state to consider “whether students can be given an option to answer questions according to subjects opted by them in the class 10 exams.” These suggestions were made on a petition by ICSE student Ananya Patki challenging the optional CET based on SSC syllabus. On July 22, the state was directed to inform whether there can be separate syllabi for CBSE and ICSE students who wish to opt for CET. Also in case it cannot be done, “whether the condition for giving priority only to those students who appear for CET can be withdrawn by or not.” The state was allowed to place data of registrations for the CET to be held on August 21. Government pleader Poornima Kantharia sought time saying that due to a technical glitch on the CET website, the deadline for registrations was extended by three days. She said that she could neither take instructions on HC’s suggestion for separate syllabi nor place data of the number of applications received. It was then that the judges asked whether “it is possible to sit” with CBSE and ICSE boards “to work out a common syllabus”. Kantharia said it “may be rather difficult”. “It may not be possible because the SSC board will not be able to venture into these boards for common questions,” she added. The judges said their suggestion is for a common question paper for all boards so that students have options to answer questions. “All will be treated on par,” said Justice Dhanuka. But Kantharia kept saying it is difficult to set a common question paper. “If there is no reasonable solution, then we’ll find a solution. If there is an attempt to eliminate students from other boards we’ll not allow it,” said Justice Dhanuka. On an intervention plea, the HC directed the IGCSE board to be added as a party. Posting the matter on August 4, they said “students who have passed class X from other boards may apply for registration without prejudice to their rights and contentions”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-can-there-be-common-cet-question-paper-for-all-boards/articleshow/84842165.cms||Rosy Sequeira

State forest minister K Ramachandran was also present.The farmers pointed out that crops suffer extensive damage due to intrusion of elephants and wild boars in several villages along the forest fringes. Besides damage to crops, villagers are also on constant fear of being attacked by wild animals. Ramachandran assured the farmers that steps like digging more trenches to prevent elephant movement into villages would be taken up. He said that spots where elephants frequent would be identified and steps would be taken to minimise conflict.The farmers also urged the state government to end pollution of river Noyyal by coming down heavily on those letting out effluents. Stating that the threat of water shortage looms large over the region whenever there was an erratic monsoon, farmers suggested that surplus water in river Noyyal, Parambikulam and Aliyar dams during rainy season could be filled in lakes and ponds. In addition to the fact that water thus stored could be used later, ground water would also raise owing to storage in ponds.This apart, the farmers also sought a market appropriate price for agri products, utilisation of workers under MGNREGA work for agriculture, additional subsidy for fertilisers, free nutritional supplements for livestock.Panneerselvam who gave a patient hearing to the speeches of the farmers said that he would take their demands to the knowledge of the chief minister and take necessary action.He told the farmers that the objective of the government was to make Tamil Nadu numero uno in agriculture and transform farming into a profitable venture for the farmers. It was for this purpose that chief minister had announced a separate budget for agriculture, he said. “The government is executing several schemes to build agri infrastructure, devise crop wise and region strategies and enhance crop production,’’ he said.Panneerselvam said that he was holding such consultative meetings across the state to gather inputs from the farmers. Farmers can also feed their views in Uzhavan app, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/farmers-seek-concrete-plan-to-mitigate-man-animal-conflict/articleshow/84839873.cms||---

She had participated in a global short story writing competition floated by the Unesco and the Idris Sah Foundation, and was adjudged one of the best. She is the only one from India and in her age category, the only one from Asia, too. The competition was held in April 2020 and the results were declared this month. Tannistha is thrilled that she has been recognised for something that has been her refuge in these difficult months of the pandemic. She says despite the fact she would be writing her board exams in the next couple of months and scores around 94-95% marks in school exams, she has no career plans at all and loved to coil up with a pen and paper, writing stories. In April 2020 she came across the Unesco World Tales competition and took part in the 14-15 year category. Her story was judged the second best, bringing her the silver medal among thousands of global participants. “It was a letter that I wrote to myself from a future self. I called it, Dear young me,” she said. Tannistha’s parents, Rupanjana De, a company secretary and Paritosh Nandi, an entrepreneur who works with solar energy, are happy.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 40% of surveyed students say no to optional CET for FYJC||MUMBAI: The brouhaha over the optional common entrance test (CET) for admission to jun-ior colleges may well end up being an academic debate as a large percentage of students may not take it at all, according to a survey. And those who may attempt it are not really tearing their hair over its preparation. But a small portion, about 11% of respondents, said they had enrolled for special coaching to prepare for the CET. The optional CET was necessitated after the state cancelled class X exams due to the pandemic. The CET scores will be given preference in the first round of FYJC admissions. While the matter is being heard in the Bombay high court, a survey conducted by TOI last week saw close to 40% respondents stating that they do not plan to take the test and another 26.6% are wondering whether to take it or not, and a lot of them added the final court hearing would help them eventually decide. Out of the 1,800 respondents, 588 said they would take the test. Many students who have migrated to other places, would be forced to return to take the offline CET, a point that the state did not consider in its survey. Close to 30% of the respondents said they would have to return to take the test. A parent of an ICSE student summed up what many others feel. “It is absolutely unfair and wrong for the government to expect ICSE students to study the SSC portion. There is no direction provided. Students are traumatized and feeling pressured.” The parent added, “Also how safe is it for them to do exams offline when there is no relief from the pandemic...We feel that education is something that is given least priority in this pandemic. As parents we feel cheated and totally exhausted.” Yet, the answer to the question on whether students would take the CET or not was a helpless “maybe”. A student from the Cambridge board who donned a PPE kit and went to take the board exam in February asked, “I have already taken the board exam. Why are we put through another exam?” Another student added, “Students from other boards will have to study the whole portion in a month. The SSC have been studying this since March 2020. How are we on a fair footing?” Apart from that, students who would have dropped certain subjects since class VIII would have to go back to picking the basics. While several students have decided to stay back in their school, many commerce aspirants know that getting into a college after class XII is tough as the aspirants outnumber the seats. For instance, Palash Jain from Cambridge International School, who scored 99.8% in ICSE and wants to join a commerce college and pursue CA, will be taking the CET. “Despite the fact that I studied very hard and I did so much self-studying as there was only online schooling, I am upset that I still have to prepare for the CET. It is very unfortunate for all of us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-40-of-surveyed-students-say-no-to-optional-cet-for-fyjc/articleshow/84842197.cms||Hemali Chhapia

The project to radio collar Baahubali has been postponed to post-monsoon season.The department had brought Kaleem, Venkatesh and Mariappan from ATR to Mettupalayam to radio collar Baahubali, which has been destroying crops in the Mettupalayam-Sirumugai forest range. “We decided to radio collar the elephant after receiving complaints from farmers. Baahubali, which is used to humans, did not respond to attempts to scare it away,” said Sirumugai forest officer Senthil Kumar.The decision to radio collar the elephant was taken to identify its forest exit routes and timings so that officials could send him back. They also want to study the distance Baahubali travels within and outside the forest and why it does not eat in the forest.“For radio collaring, we needed the elephant to come to a suitable place — a spot in plains — by 5pm. However, it came twice close to darkness and then avoided us altogether,” said Kumar. “The on-and-off showers further hampered plans. Also, two of the three kumkis became unwell. They refused to lie down throughout their time in Mettupalayam and suffered leg injuries.”District forest officer Venkatesh Durairaj said the kumkis need time to recuperate. “Work to fix the radio collar will resume in the appropriate season, when the tusker comes to a suitable place,” he told TOI. “The region is receiving rain.

In Rajya Sabha, the Juvenile Justice (care and protection of children) Amendment Bill 2021 Bill was passed without a debate as protesting members continued to shout slogans and many occupied the Well demanding a discussion on the snooping issue and among others. Amendments to the bill make way for significant changes that give the district and additional district magistrates the power to issue adoption orders and monitor the functioning of various agencies including Child Welfare Committees and district child protection unit that are responsible for implementation of the JJ Act. In Lok Sabha, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code Bill was passed without debate, providing for a pre-packaged resolution process for stressed MSMEs. The bill was moved by junior minister for corporate affairs Rao Inderjit Singh and passed in under 10 minutes and without discussion as opposition members continued their protests. Lok Sabha also passed the supplementary demand for grants moved by Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Amendments to the IBC Bill will enable government to notify the threshold of a default not exceeding Rs 1 crore for initiation of the pre-packaged resolution process. The government has already prescribed the threshold of Rs 10 lakh for this purpose. The business was transacted between six adjournments. In the morning, Lok Sabha took up Question Hour amid continued slogan-shouting by Opposition members. The protests intensified in the afternoon with some Congress MPs seen throwing papers at the Chair and at the Treasury benches while protesting against the Pegasus snooping row and other issues. The government said it was likely to move suspension notices against 10 opposition MPs, mostly from Congress, for repeatedly disrupting the House. However, opposition MPs met Speaker Om Birla to apologise. Even amid din, Rajya Sabha also conducted the business during Question Hour. Deputy chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh allowed members to ask questions and ministers to respond to the queries for around 40-45 minutes. As soon as the House started business in the first half, members from opposition parties displayed placards and started shouting slogans against the Pegasus snooping allegations and three farm laws. Protesting members shouted slogans in Hindi, Bengali, Tamil and Malayalam against the government and demanded the Prime Minister to come to the House and address the concerns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ls-rs-clear-crucial-bills-hold-question-hour-amid-protests/articleshow/84845182.cms||---

The fuel tanker was seized from the stone crusher at Abdullapurmet. Police said that Rao, who was a petty officer in Navy and took VRS in 2009, had been running GHMC fuel stations since January last year at Kavadiguda, Khairatabad and Malakpet on a sub-contract from main contractor Ayub Ali Baig.

Not just private colleges and universities, even grant-in-aid engineering colleges have got their programmes accredited from NBA that was initially established by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) to carry out periodic evaluations of technical institutions and programmes based on standards recommended by AICTE council. “We have begun the process to seek NBA accreditation for our BA mechanical, BE civil and BE computer programmes. Once, we cover the three programmes, we will move forward to get our other BE programmes accredited. The ME programmes can be accredited only after the BE programmes receive accreditation so initially, our focus is to get all BE programmes accredited,” said FTE dean professor C N Murthy.Unlike the accreditation process followed by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), which accreditates university as a whole, NBA accreditates programmes and not departments that offer the programmes. “We are hopeful to get the NBA accreditation within this year,” said Murthy, adding the accreditation will also help in seeking central government funds while the overall profile of the faculty will also improve with rise in number of PhDs and MEs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/msus-fte-finally-decides-to-seek-nba-accreditation/articleshow/84837485.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai cops bust oxygen concentrator racket run by 3 couples in Ghaziabad, Delhi||Mumbai: City police, probing the cheating of a south Mumbai businessman who wanted to buy oxygen concentrators, have stumbled upon a bigger racket. Investigators say this is the first time they have come across a case where at least three couples were part of a “cheating syndicate”. The couples are residents of Ghaziabad and New Delhi. The Mumbai businessman, who had ordered oxygen concentrators, was allegedly cheated of Rs 2 lakh by a New Delhi man. D B Marg police registered an FIR in May after the Grant Road resident told police he spoke to a friend from New Delhi about concentrators. His friend said he had ordered one over the phone from “an Andheri firm” and shared its contact details. The victim ordered 20, each priced around Rs 50,000, and the deal was finalized for Rs 9.6 lakh. The caller gave a Delhi bank account number and asked the victim to deposit Rs 2 lakh into it online. The businessman and friend did not get delivery though. When the police reached the firm’s Andheri address, they found it did not exist. A team led by inspector Raja Bidkar and PSI Pradip Patil of DB Marg police started a probe into the fraud case. “We first collected the mobile number of the person who had called up the victim and the bank account details where the victim had transferred money to buy oxygen concentrators. We found the bank account was in the name of one Rekha Agarwal, a Gaziabad resident. Our team landed at Rekha’s residence and began questioning her. We learnt of the role of her husband, Nitish, as well. Nitish is currently in a Faridabad jail for a similar fraud,” said an investigating officer. He added Rekha’s bank account was used to get money from the victims. Police recovered Rs 1.5 lakh from Rekha and issued her a notice, asking her to meet cops in Mumbai. “Over Rs 25 lakh was deposited in Rekha’s account in May,” said an investigator. During the probe, investigators found Nitish had first met another wanted accused, Rohtash, in a Delhi jail. After the duo got bail, Rohtash told Nitish he had a team of trusted persons who would call up those keen on buying concentrators and cylinders. He took Rekha’s bank account details from Nitish. “The Agarwals would get 20-30% for allowing use of their account. One of Rohtash’s associates, Vijay Malik, too had opened several accounts,” said an investigator. Rohtash’s calling team comprised Delhi’s Chandrashekhar alias AK, his wife Charu, AK’s brother-in-law Lavesh and wife Sakshi. AK and Charu are in Faridabad jail now in a cheating case while Lavesh and Sakshi are on the run, said cops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-cops-bust-o2-concentrator-racket-run-by-3-couples-in-ghaziabad-delhi/articleshow/84835854.cms||Mateen Hafeez

The committee, formed by the high court to ensure conservation and protection of monuments in the state, has already identified 27 sites including Golconda Fort and Qutub Shahi tombs. State counsel Harender Pershad informed this to a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy which had earlier taken up the case based on a TOI report highlighting the plight of the city’s historic Golconda Fort and Qutub Shahi tombs. “The committee visited all the monuments between July 13 and 16 and they need time to prepare a comprehensive redevelopment plan,” the state counsel said, urging the court to grant them some more time. “Authorities physically inspected each of the monuments and received scores of suggestions on how to accord them complete protection and develop them without affecting their originality,” he informed. The counsel explained that the committee needed to analyse suggestions to formulate a clear plan. “The field survey gave authorities useful first-hand information on the current situation,” the counsel said. The bench sought a report from the panel by September 22. It may be recalled that assistant solicitor general (ASG) Namavarapu Rajeswara Rao had made a field visit to Golconda Fort and Qutub Shahi tombs earlier and had raised issue over the structures mushrooming in the fort’s proximity. As many as 153 complaints had been lodged by central archaeological authorities with the state government over illegal structures within a 100-metre-radius of the Golconda Fort. “We have been giving these complaints right since 2010 and none of them (authorities) are acting on our complaints,” the ASG had said in the last hearing. Referring to another plea which also raised issue over such structures, the bench said the redevelopment committee has to play a role in this matter as well. “All those who claim permissions to raise structures in the vicinity of the fort too have to approach the redevelopment committee and obtain approval from it,” the bench said before posting the case to September 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/panel-on-monuments-nearly-ready-with-conservation-plan-t-tells-hc/articleshow/84840924.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

He then said diesel prices would be reduced. But he was not able to keep up the promise,” Velumani said while taking a dig at the DMK for not implementing its promise of providing monthly financial assistance to homemakers.On the other hand, the government has failed to protect the rights of Tamil Nadu in Cauvery issue. “Though DMK and its alliance have 39 MPs, they are watching helplessly when Karnataka is making serious attempts to build dam across Cauvery at Mekedatu,” he said.Even in handling of Covid crisis, DMK has mismanaged, Velumani charged. “When we were ruling, the whole country appreciated TN’s Covid management. But now DMK government has failed. There are so many deaths happening, but the government is under reporting,” he alleged.Stating that the AIADMk government brought several welfare projects to Coimbatore like flyovers, roads and drinking water projects, Velumani alleged that DMK government was cancelling some of those projects. “They should bring back those projects,” he said.Velumani alleged that the state government was foisting false cases on AIADMK cadres and that police have become agents of the DMK government. Since the DMK government could not deliver on the promises they made, they were resorting to raids to divert attention, he alleged.In Tirupur, a similar protest was led by former TN assembly deputy speaker Pollachi V Jayaraman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/will-not-be-cowed-down-by-dvac-raids-says-velumani/articleshow/84839966.cms||---

The decision follows Bharat Biotech’s termination of its partnership with Brazilian partner Precisa Medicamentos. On July 23, Bharat Biotech had informed Anvisa that Precisa Medicamentos was no longer authorised to represent it in Brazil. According to Anvisa, director Alex Machado Campos, rapporteur of the matter, “Considered that the loss of the legitimacy of the company Precisa to act before Anvisa can influence the fulfilment of the requirements and conditions of importation.” “The decision also took into account news that illegitimate documents may have been added to the import process, which could impact the conclusions regarding the aspects of quality, safety and efficacy of the vaccine to be used by the national population,” Anvisa said. Pointing out that no doses of Covaxin were imported by Brazil so far, Anvisa said the exceptional import authorisation required compliance with obligations and conditions set forth in the terms of rapporteur’s vote for the purposes of distribution and use of the Covaxin vaccine under controlled conditions. The exceptional and temporary importation of Covaxin for distribution and use under controlled conditions had been authorised on June 4, at the 9th extraordinary meeting of the collegiate board of Anvisa. In his vote, the rapporteur informed that he called the Agency’s legal attorney and is promoting actions with the vaccine developer Bharat Biotech and the ministry of health. Bharat Biotech too, after terminating its deal with Precisa, had said that it would continue to work with Anvisa to complete the regulatory approval process for Covaxin. After the Hyderabad-based vaccine maker’s termination of its deal with Precisa ended the $324 million deal for supply of 20 million doses of Covaxin to Brazil, Anvisa first suspended the proposed Phase-3 clinical trials of Covaxin that were to be conducted on 4,500 Brazilians and then closed the EUA request.

The mandapam, also known as Kameshwaralayam, was a huge tourist attraction. The Sabha Mandapam was dismantled by the Archaeology Survey of India (ASI) in 2012 as it was deemed to pose a risk to visitors during the rainy season. In 2013, visitors to the five-day Kakatiya Festival held at the Ramappa Temple’s premises had expressed their disappointment over the missing mandapam. In the year 2017, the ASI approved its reconstruction with some conditions. Contractors were asked to submit a plan with details of the technology to be used for reconstruction. However, more than four years after floating the plan, the meeting hall is far from reconstruction. Completely made of stone, the mandapam is said to have been built by the Kakatiya kings using sand technology during the construction of the Ramappa temple. About 1,000 lengthy stone pillars and beams were used to construct the meeting hall. The Ramappa temple saw a big inflow of tourists soon after the it earned the world heritage site tag from Unesco recently. However, all they get to see at the mandapam site is blocks of stone and sand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/10-yrs-on-sabha-mandapam-yet-to-be-rebuilt/articleshow/84841033.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna
---||Hyderabad||Telangana's Ramappa temple featured on draft Rs 10 note in Nizam era||HYDERABAD: A draft Rs 10 currency note of the Nizam government in 1923 had the historic Ramappa temple on its reverse while it carried the picture of another temple on the obverse. This temple, which obviously is from within the erstwhile Nizam dominion, is yet to be identified despite several efforts by numismatists and heritage experts. With Ramappa temple now declared a Unesco world heritage site, a city heritage expert has offered as reward a silver coin of the Nizam government minted 100 years ago, if any of the TOI readers can identify the temple. According to heritage expert, numismatist and banker Amarbir Singh, in 1923 (corresponding to 1332 Fasli calendar), during Nizam VII, Mir Osman Ali Khan’s reign, renowned banknote design, printing company Thomas De La Rue had proposed the design with Ramappa temple on reverse for the Hyderabad Rs 10 note. “The Hyderabad currency was also called Halli Sicca and Osmania currency. This design, however, was not adopted as Waterlow and Sons of England had already bagged the contract,” Amarbir told TOI. Amarbir said the currency of Hyderabad state was printed by Waterlow and Sons from 1917 to 1936. After that, the denominations of Rs 5 to Rs 1000 were printed at Currency Note Press at Nasik; and the Re 1 note was printed at the Government Press at Malakpet in the city. A change of design was proposed in 1923 and it was sought from Thomas De La Rue. Designs were submitted after consulting with the Nizam government. However, these designs were not adopted and the Waterlow designs kept being printed with the design unchanged. Senior architect Asif Ali Khan, who hails from the city nobility, said the Nizam government had sought the designs from Thomas De La Rue in1923. Ramappa temple was so superior architecturally that the currency designers had included it on the Rs 10 note. He said the temple on the obverse has not yet been identified. Amarbir said Bibi-ka-Maqbara at Aurangabad and Ellora Cave No. 8 were depicted in the proposed design of Rs 100 note. Gulbarga’s Jama Masjid and Nakul Sahadev Rath from Mahabalipuram Pancha Rath complex of Mahabalipuram were depicted on Rs 1,000 proposed design. Incidentally, Ramappa temple first came to limelight or rather rediscovered during the regime of the Nizam VI, Mir Mahbub Ali Khan, after he requisitioned the services of British expert H Cousens in the late 19th century to study the antiquarian remains of the princely state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ramappa-temple-featured-on-draft-rs-10-note-in-nizam-era/articleshow/84840965.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Pune||153 villagers from Velhe taluka moved to safer location in Mahad||Pune: The district administration has shifted 153 residents of Karnavadi village in Velhe taluka to safer locations in Mahad tehsil of neighbouring Raigad district in the wake of the hazard posed by constant rainfall activity and the fear of landslides. The village is part of the Kelad group gram panchayat and is located at the foothills of the Kelad hill. It does not have road connectivity from Pune district. The residents usually climb a four- to five-km steep hilly portion to reach Kelad village, said officials from Velhe tehsil administration. As such, shifting them to Mahad instead of Kelad seemed more convenient, the officials added. Velhe block development officer (BDO) Vishal Shinde and tehsildar Shivaji Shinde visited Karnavadi on Monday to take stock of the situation. “A big portion of the hill close to the village had fallen due to the continuous rainfall on Sunday. So, as a precautionary measure, we have shifted them to Ranavadi and Biravwadi village in Mahad tehsil and Kelad village in Pune district on Monday. They are living in temples and schools there at present. We have provided packets of grains, kerosene cans and other necessary items to them. In Kelad, local villagers will cook food for them. The expenses will be covered by the tehsil administration,” the BDO said. A kilometre-long crack had developed in the farms of the village during the rains in 2019, said Shinde. “A group of geologists had then carried out a survey of the farms and had recommended shifting of villagers to a safer place,” the BDO added. The tehsildar said, “We have been urging residents of Karnavadi to shift to a new location in Pune district, but they are not ready to do so due to various reasons. Currently, they are not in a proper state of mind to discuss the issue. We will hold a meeting with them in the coming days.” Kelad sarpanch Santosh Shinde said, “The villagers have been staying there for the last six to seven decades. They have been mainly cultivating paddy in their farms. They don’t want to leave the village. But the district administration needs to take firm step and rehabilitate them to a safer place in view of a possible natural calamity there.” Rajendra Jadhav, sub divisional officer at Bhor, under which Velhe tehsil is located, said, “There are about 10 villages situated at the foothills and could face landslide issues during the monsoon season. As a result, we had to shift about 200 villagers from Kondhare village to a safer place in the last week. We had to undertake similar efforts at other villages too.” On the issue of permanently rehabilitating residents of Karnavadi village, Jadhav said, “We will conduct a series of meetings with the villagers to persuade them for permanent rehabilitation at a new place.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/153-villagers-from-velhe-taluka-moved-to-safer-location-in-mahad/articleshow/84840013.cms||Sandip Dighe

The bus crammed with 140 labourers was on its way from Ludhiana to Bihar, when it broke down in the dead of night on National Highway 28 on the Barabanki-Ayodhya stretch. With air-conditioning snapped and windows sealed, many passengers got off the stranded bus and dozed off on the road while the driver scrambled to fix the broken axle. An hour later, a truck came in at blinding speed and collided head-on with the bus, crushing passengers asleep on the road and leaving the vehicle in a mangled heap. The Bihar-bound labourers were employed in factories at Ludhiana in Punjab, and Hisar in Haryana. While 11 died on the spot, seven were declared dead at the district hospital. Identities of two are yet to be ascertained and 11 of the injured were taken to Trauma Centre, Lucknow, said superintendent of police, Barabanki, Yamuna Prasad. President Ram Nath Kovind, PM Modi, home minister Amit Shah, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar expressed grief at the loss of lives. The PM announced Rs 2 lakh compensation to the kin of deceased and Rs 50,000 for the injured and called up UP chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, to enquire on relief operations. The CM directed cabinet ministers to reach the hospital and oversee medical aid. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar condoled the deaths and announced Rs 2 lakh ex gratia to kin of each deceased. BSP chief Mayawati asked the government to provide free treatment to the injured and send bodies home at government expense. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav too appealed to the government to ensure treatment of the injured and sent party leaders to visit the injured at the hospital. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi urged party workers to provide aid to the accident victims. Police said, drivers of both bus and truck were on the run. “Owner and manager of Rishabh Travels, which runs the air-conditioned bus and drivers of both vehicles have been booked for death by negligence, rash driving and under sections of Epidemic Act and Disaster Management Act,” said SP Barabanki. Mishri Lal, 50, who survived the crash, told reporters he was asleep inside the bus when he was jolted and quaked. “I woke up to see passengers tossed onto the bus floor. When we managed to extricate ourselves out of the wreckage, we saw dismembered bodies strewn along the road and the injured crying in pain. We tried to stop passing vehicles, but to no avail. Then we blocked the highway with bodies, triggering a gridlock. It was then that a passer-by called the police,” he said. The complainant in the case and a fellow passenger, Falgun Sahni, 30 of Sitamarhi, said, the bus was overloaded and after its axle broke, the driver sought money from passengers for repairs. After cops received the SOS, senior police and district officials rushed to the spot to launch rescue operations. District Magistrate of Barabanki, Adarsh Singh, supervised the rescue operation and arranged buses for other passengers to reach Bihar. “We formed a panel of doctors to conduct autopsies and simultaneously send the bodies to Bihar,” he said. Eyewitnesses:Neeraj Kumar, 18, of Sitamarhi said he along with his friends took a bus from Ludhiana, but when it reached Hisar in Haryana, the conductor stopped the vehicle midway and forced us into the ill-fated double decker bus standing nearby. Another injured, Shambhu, 29, of Madhubani, said passengers were forced to spread sheets and sleep on the road as it was stifling inside the bus with the windows sealed. “When it began raining, some of them took shelter under the bus,” he said. Helpline number:Barabanki police has issued a helpline number — 9454417464 — for any queries on the dead and injured. The deceased who were identified include Suresh Yadav, 35, of Madhepura, Indal Mahato, 25, Gagandev 35, Rajdev Mahato, 60, Monu Sahni, 30, Jagdish, 40, Naresh, 37, Shanishchar, 50, Mastram Mandal, 60, (Sitamarhi residents), Sikandar Mukhiya 40, Akhilesh Mukhiya 30 of Saharsa, Jai Bahadur, 40, Baijnath Ram, 55, Balram Mandal, 55, from Supaul, Santosh Singh 30, Bauwa 30, both from Araria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/18-crushed-in-sleep-as-truck-rams-into-bus-in-barabanki/articleshow/84842202.cms||---

Ramgopalpet inspector S Saidulu said that the 21-year-old woman had left her residence in Kukatpally in anger following an argument with her family. In a fit she had said that she would jump into Hussainsagar lake to end her life and left in her car. As she did not respond to calls from her family, they informed her friend about the situation. “Since she had said that she would end her life at Hussainsagar, her friend called the police station,” the inspector said.A patrolling team saw her car in the parking area of Necklace Road railway station. Just then, an ice cream vendor approached the team and informed that the woman gave him the car keys saying she was going to jump into the lake and showed them the woman who was approaching the water body. She was stopped by cops who then took her to the police station and counselled her. It was found out that she had attempted to take the extreme step earlier too.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Gang rode bikes in ‘Dhoom’ style to snatch gold chains||JAIPUR: They worked as a gang from the Hindi blockbuster ‘Dhoom,’ cruising around highways, zipping in and out of cities to snatch gold chains and staying at comfortable hotels before scheming another heist. The five accused arrested by Udaipur police on Tuesday snatched chains across several cities of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. In Rajasthan, they travelled from Bhilwara to Ajmer, Udaipur, Jaipur, and in Madhya Pradesh, they robbed chains from women in Ujjain. Udaipur SP Rajeev Pachar said the accused had been involved in about 100 chain snatchings, of which 27 were in Udaipur alone. The accused, identified as Lokeshpuri Goswami (23), Prem (22), Vinod Soni (24), Deepak (20) and Mohit alias Lucky (22), are residents of Bhilwara district. “The accused had ventured into the world of crime when they were still minors. They sold their chains to Vinod Soni,” Pachar said, adding that Lokesh is the kingpin of the gang. Rajasthan police said that the five accused formed one of the most notorious chain snatching gangs of the state. “They travelled from Bhilwara and quickly fled after snatching gold chains from women,” Pachar told TOI, adding that the gang travelled to faraway places to steal. The police said that the accused had perfected the art of stealing chains and quickly vanished from the crime scene. The Udaipur police said it had become an arduous task to track them down. “We examined over 300 CCTVs and quizzed several people including those lodged in jails to get some information about the gang,” Pachar said, adding that 10 teams of Udaipur police tracked down the hotels in which the accused stayed. Police retrieved information from hotels and began searching for the accused. The accused had kept their criminal activities under tight wraps, so much so that even their family members never got a whiff. Police said the accused especially targeted women heading for morning and evening walks. “All the accused started stealing chains when they were minors. We are trying to find the number of chain snatchings they have done so far. They also travelled very widely, going as far as Ujjain in MP to snatch chains,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gang-rode-bikes-in-dhoom-style-to-snatch-gold-chains/articleshow/84842193.cms||---

Shreyams’ notice in Rajya Sabha is the second such statutory motion moved in under a week, after the first was one moved by CPI MP Binoy Viswam on July 22. Both statutory motions have been admitted. If adopted by Rajya Sabha, it will then also be sent to the Lok Sabha to decide whether there should be a debate on the subject. The new digital media rules have been cleared as subordinate legislation and need only be placed on the floor of the House. The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, commonly known as the digital media rules, have been opposed by legacy print and digital media organisations on grounds that they were instituted without any consultation with stakeholders, or the public, as is procedure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-cpi-mp-now-ljd-member-moves-motion-in-rs-to-annul-new-digital-media-rules/articleshow/84845229.cms||---

---||Agra||Girl turns 18 & marries boyfriend she had framed in a rape case under parents’ pressure||Agra: Just three months after she turned 18, an Aligarh girl married her boyfriend who has served eight months in jail after being accused of abducting and raping her -- an allegation which she says she made in 2019 after being “emotionally blackmailed” by her parents.The girl, Nisha Pathak (name changed), who turned 18 on March 31, has filed an affidavit in a POCSO court in Aligarh, saying that Vijay Agarwal (name changed), 20, was innocent and did not do anything “wrong with her”. Nisha said that she has been in a relationship with Vijay since she was in Class X after they met at a coaching class in 2017. She said that her parents were against the relationship. "They had pressed the charges in June, 2019 after spotting us together," she said. Nisha said that her parents had threatened that they would commit suicide if she did not give a statement against Vijay.Booked for abduction and rape of a minor, Vijay was arrested and sent to jail on June 7, 2019. He got bail from Allahabad high court in March 2020, after spending eight months in jail.On Tuesday, they got married in a temple in Aligarh.Nisha, who is pursuing BCA from a private engineering college in Mathura, went to the office of senior superintendent of police (SSP) before tying the knot and demanded police protection from her family members. But she added that she doesn’t want any action against her parents. “I fear that I will be killed by my uncles, who came to my in-laws house last night and threatened me and my husband,” Nisha told TOI.Vijay told TOI, “Khushi contacted me and came over to Aligarh a few days ago to file an affidavit in the court. Finally we got together.” Nisha’s lawyer Chitranjan Agarwal said that she appeared before the POCSO court on Tuesday and filed the affidavit. The date for the case’s hearing is scheduled on August 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/girl-turns-18-marries-boyfriend-she-had-framed-in-a-rape-case-under-parents-pressure/articleshow/84831673.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Mumbai||Debris flow from hill after heavy rain caused Taliye landslide: GSI||MUMBAI: The cause of the massive landslide in Raigad’s Taliye village, where 84 people died, was the collapse of debris from a hilltop following torrential rain, according to a preliminary report from the Geological Survey of India (GIS) which is probing the incident. The area in Mahad taluka was categorized as facing “low to moderate risk” of landslides. Heavy rain was a key factor in releasing debris on the hill, officials said. “The hill-slope is steep and at a distance of just 300 metres from the village. Rain in the region was extremely heavy, perhaps the highest in 40 years. This loosened 5-6 metres of naturally-occurring debris on top of the hill,” Dr S Raju, GSI additional director general told TOI. The GSI has now written to all states to set up a rain gauge in landslide-prone spots and also consult the body before undertaking major infrastructure projects near areas at risk of landslides. “An assessment of rainfall will help with warnings about landslides…the GSI is consulted before undertaking dam projects but it is also necessary to consult before setting up major infrastructure projects in such areas,” said Raju, who is the national nodal officer (landslides). In India, about 0.42 million sq. km or 12.6% of land area, excluding snow-covered regions, is prone to landslide hazards. Of this, 0.09 million sq. km lie in the Western Ghats and Konkan hills. Evaluating landslide hazards has become more important given the rise in human settlements and infrastructure projects near mountain slopes, according to the GSI. The single biggest cause of landslides in the country is heavy rain, said Raju. “Ninety-per cent of the landslides are caused by heavy rain. A much smaller number are caused by earthquakes and digging for infrastructure projects.” The GSI has carried out landslide susceptibility mapping to identify such areas and mitigate risks. It has also started testing early warning systems for landslides in Darjeeling and the Nilgiris. “GSI has mapped out critical slopes. It’s important for governments to take corrective action in these areas. Vulnerable slopes near infrastructure projects need risk mitigation,” said geologist Vivek Kale. He added that while some slopes are inherently vulnerable, extreme rainfall and human activity can hasten the pace of slope failure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/debris-flow-from-hill-after-heavy-rain-caused-taliye-landslide-gsi/articleshow/84842241.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

This is 70% of the required stock. The lakes need to have over 14 lakh million litres of water by the end of monsoon. The current stock should last 263 days. In a related development, an increase in rain activity in Mumbai and Thane has been indicated for July 30 and 31. BMC officials have already clarified that no water cut is likely to be imposed in the city this year. A 20% water had been imposed in the city cut in August last year due to low level of water storage in lakes. The total water quantum in the seven lakes has crossed 50%. As of Wednesday, it stood at 10.13 lakh million litres (70.05%) as compared to 4.37 lakh million litres on the same day last year (32.69%). So far, four lakes — Tulsi, Vihar, Tansa and Modak Sagar — have overflowed. In all these lakes, stock of water is 100% except in the case of Tansa where the stock stands at 99%. In a forecast issued for the next five days, the Met department on Wednesday indicated heavy rain at isolated places on July 30 and July 31 for Mumbai, Thane and Raigad. A ‘yellow’ alert has been indicated for July 30- 31 while a ‘green’ alert has been issued for August 1, indicating ‘light to moderate’ rain activity.

A memorandum has been submitted to the district collector and the school principal. On Wednesday, a large number of villagers staged a dharna outside the school. Later, district collector Ashish Modi handed over the case to SDM Ramesh Shirvi, who went to the spot and spoke to villagers and persuaded them. The parents have alleged that a teacher in the school harassed the girls discriminated on the basis of their caste. After the girls reported the incident, their parents met the principal and applied for mass transfer certificates (TC). Koonp Singh, a villager from Laudrava, said if any girl went with some symbol of any religion, the teacher used to humiliate her and make her stand till she fell unconscious. The teacher also threatened the girl students to give less marks in practical tests, monthly tests. Another villager said the parents of the girls, earlier too, had apprised the principal about the teacher, but no action was taken. Many girls were forced to quit their studies due to the fearful atmosphere in the school. Villagers demanded strict action against the teacher and demanded his suspension. The villagers said if the administration does not take any action, they will lock the school and the entire responsibility will be of the administration. SDM Ramesh Shirvi said that he spoke to the guardians by going to the school and they have complained about the teacher, but some advocated for the teacher, too. He will submit his report to the district collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/40-girls-demand-tc-from-jaisalmer-school-over-discrimination/articleshow/84842242.cms||---

The SIT held its first meeting on Tuesday. One team has been asked to collect and send voice samples of Punamia to forensic experts to match with the five-hour recorded telephonic conversation. The conversation was recorded by Agarwal during a meeting with Punamia. Punamia is heard saying that the MVA government will fall following Singh’s allegations against former home minister Anil Deshmukh for demanding Rs 100 crore from beer bar owners. Punamia also boasts about his contacts, and the likelihood of the CBI taking over the case. Besides, Punamia said that he had taken the responsibility of ensuring the fall of a big state minister. He also speaks about the possibility of Singh getting a posting in Delhi. An officer said: “The conversation happened soon after Singh made the allegations against Deshmukh. At that point CBI was not in the picture. The conversation indicates that Punamia knew what was in the offing. He also spoke about the fall of a politician. We find something amiss.” The police also wanted to carry out a detailed probe into Punamia’s complaint with the police in February alleging that he received four to five calls in 2016 from elusive gangster Chhota Shakeel asking him to settle the matter with Agarwal. Punamiya claimed he received a missed call from a Pakistani mobile number in December. Within five days of registration of the FIR, the case was transferred from the Juhu police station to the crime branch and stringent sections of Mcoca were invoked. Agarwal and Chhota Shakeel were shown as absconding accused. Agarwal alleged that based on this case, he was forced to file consent terms with Punamia in the property dispute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/param-case-initially-sit-to-focus-on-threat-calls-in-mumbai/articleshow/84842306.cms||Ahmed Ali

The DA revision was withheld in 2020 due to the financial stress on state coffers due to the devastating outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic. “The Centre announced revision of DA from 17% to 28% of the basic salary on July 14. The state will follow suit and the CM has asked the finance department to immediately draw up a proposal on this, so that the change can be implemented at the earliest,” said a senior government official. New rate to be applicable from July 1Following the decision of the Centre, Uttar Pradesh government had also announced in April 2020 that there would be no increase in DA till July 1, 2021. Normally, DA is increased twice annually, on January 1 and July 1. The decision to defer the revision deprived government employees three hikes. The new rate, however, will be applicable only from July 1, 2021, and till then the rates revised on July 1, 2019 will be applicable. “The decision was taken as there had been a fall in the state’s revenue due to Covid-19. The government needed funds for Covid-19 prevention, management, treatment and relief work. UP would have increased DA by 4% from January 1, 2020, as decided by the Centre, but had to put the decision on hold due to the pandemic,” the official said. “We cannot say if and by how much the DA would have been revised in July 2020 and January 2021. Presuming that it would have been revised by 4% on both occasions, it is being estimated that the state government would have saved around Rs 7,000 crore in a year,” the official said. The order will benefit state government employees, employees of aided educational institutes and technical education institutes, and those of urban local bodies, along with pensioners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-approves-da-hike-for-28l-govt-staff-pensioners/articleshow/84842261.cms||---
---||Jodhpur||Rajasthan: Court summons FBI expert for 21st time in Bhanwari Devi case||JODHPUR: Stuck since September 2018, the trial of the infamous Bhanwari Devi abduction and murder case has again hit the rock. The US-based FBI’S DNA expert and important prosecution witness Amber B Carr has again been summoned by the trial court, though 20 similar attempts failed earlier. All the witnesses pertaining to the case have been examined in the court except Carr, who is an important prosecution witness in the case, as she had conducted a DNA examination of the bones recovered from a canal and claimed to be those of Bhanwari Devi. According to a defence counsel, she has been issued summons 20 times between May 2017 and September 2018, but she has expressed disinterest in honouring the summons citing diplomatic reasons over and over again. “In order to secure her witness, the CBI had sought permission of both the trial court and the high court to get her examination through video conferencing. But the plea had been rejected following vehement opposition by the defence lawyers”, said the counsel. Later, the high court, while allowing the prayer of the defence counsels, had directed the trial court to proceed with trial by recording the accused statements, dropping Carr as witness. Challenging this decision of the high court, the CBI had moved a SLP in the Supreme Court, which had directed the trial court to proceed with a fresh summons to Carr. “But this permission has been granted on the condition that if CBI failed again to get Carr to the court for examination, the petition would be deemed disposed of without even bringing to the notice of the court”, said a defence counsel. Though, in compliance with the direction of the apex court, a summons has been issued to Carr by the trial court, there is hardly any hope for CBI, which has already given in on Carr’s physical presence in the court 20 times with no option then to seek permission for hearing through video conferencing. The high court, however, in its order in November 2019 had directed the trial court to proceed with accused’s statements instead of holding the trial in wait of Carr, but had said its order would remain subject to decision on CBI’s SLP in apex court. A prosecution counsel said Carr was a crucial witness in the case as she would be an important witness to prove that the charred bones, recovered from a canal in Jaloda village near Jodhpur, were those of Bhanwari Devi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/court-summons-fbi-expert-for-21st-time-in-bhanwari-devi-case/articleshow/84842268.cms||---

No vehicles or motorbikes will now be allowed to ply inside the premises. The event was held to mark World Nature Conservation Day. Delhi zoo director Ramesh Pandey said the initiative was aimed at reducing the carbon footprint at the zoo and at controlling noise pollution in the area. “This will ensure minimal disturbance to animals and is an eco-friendly initiative to ensure the overall carbon footprint is controlled. More such measures will be implemented,” said Pandey. To celebrate the day, a nest-making workshop was held by Rakesh Khatri, who is also known as the Sparrow Man of Delhi. All animals and birds were provided an ‘enriched’ diet on Wednesday, which included seasonal fruits and vegetables. “For herbivores, fresh produce, fruits and veggies were given, while carnivores were given more red meat and chicken as compared to normal. Individual choices of animals were also taken into account. Beat keepers understand the diet preference of each animal,” said Pandey. The Delhi zoo is set to reopen from August 1 with only a total of 3,000 visitors allowed across two shifts of four hours each. Only online bookings will be allowed initially keeping Covid-19 norms in mind. While the morning shift will function from 8 am till 12 pm, there will be a break of one hour from 12 pm till 1 pm, when the zoo will be sanitised and disinfected. The afternoon shift will then begin from 1 pm, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bicycle-fleet-launched-at-zoo-to-reduce-carbon-footprint/articleshow/84840072.cms||---

At the Rajaram barrage in Kolhapur, the Panchaganga was flowing at 42.10 feet — just below the danger level of 43 feet. The Krishna, meanwhile, was flowing at 43 feet at Sangli’s Irwin bridge, 2 feet below the danger mark. The discharge through the automatic gates of the Radhanagari dam located upstream of the Panchaganga river was stopped on Wednesday afternoon. Currently, a discharge of 1,400 cusec is taking place from the power house spillway. The dam was 100% filled two days ago to its maximum capacity of 8.36 TMC. Rainfall in catchment areas of the dam has also reduced. As a result, the dam water level has dropped to 8.23 TMC. As many as 47 barrages on the Panchaganga river are still submerged. But to the relief of the flood-affected citizens of Shirol taluka, the Panchaganga is now flowing below the danger mark at all the barrages. Meanwhile, discharge from the Koyna dam continued at 31,000 cusec as its catchment areas received rainfall on Wednesday. After 8am, Koyna, Navaja and Mahabaleshwar received 33mm, 14 mm and 25 mm rainfall, leading to an inflow of 27,000 cusec into Koyna dam. Before 8am, these locations witnessed 51 mm, 56 mm and 99 mm rainfall respectively during the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Sangli district collector Abhijeet Chaudhary said the rescue work carried by the Indian Army is almost done and they may go back anytime soon. He, however, said stationing of NDRF teams will be requested for some more time to assist the local disaster teams in providing relief aid. NH-166 to remain shut for 5 more days Vasant Pangharkar, project director of National Highway’s state public works department, said the Kolhapur-Ratnagiri National Highway 166 will remain shut for five more days. “Landslides have occurred at 12 spots between Sakharpa and Amba ghat section of the highway. The work to remove the rubble is going on and will take at least five days. Therefore, the road will be shut till the roads are cleared. After the work of removing the rubble is over, the highway may be opened initially only for light vehicles,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/panchaganga-krishna-recede-below-danger-levels-after-5-days/articleshow/84840080.cms||---

On Tuesday, Santosh Kumari, 22, marched into the Mandawar police station with a complaint. She had driven from Sarai Kale Khan with her friends, looking for Ajmal Ahmed, 25, her partner. The two had met in Delhi at a salon where Ajmal is a hairdresser. They got close and moved in together at a house in Sarai Kale Khan. “Days ago, Ajmal left Delhi and came home. Here, he was getting married to another woman,” Mandawar SHO Manoj Kumar told TOI on Wednesday. Santosh wanted police to help her get him back. And they did. A team of cops accompanied her as she stormed the nikah venue in the afternoon. The wedding ceremony stopped midway and Ajmal was brought to the police station along with Santosh. A group of VHP members, meanwhile, heard of the prolonged ruckus at the police station and landed there, trying to intervene. They wanted to “protect” the Hindu woman, they said. But she paid no attention to them and said it was not a case of coercion. “I have been in a relationship with Ajmal of my own accord for the past one year. I want to marry him. I am going to Delhi with him and will marry him there,” she wrote in her complaint to the police. No FIR was filed. The VHP members were disgruntled. “We tried to make her understand this was wrong but she was adamant,” said Jitendra Chaudhary, a local VHP leader. Since the girl’s family was not around, Chaudhary and his men could not get a police complaint filed against the boy. “We asked the cops to take strict action in this case. But they remained mute spectators.” Santosh, meanwhile, drove away with Ajmal to Delhi in the evening. “Ajmal’s family did not file any complaint,” said SHO Kumar. “The case now belongs to Delhi cops.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/hindu-woman-crashes-muslim-partners-nikah-walks-away-with-him/articleshow/84837560.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Pune||Parts of Pimpri Chinchwad await smart roads||PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Major roads in Pimple Gurav and Pimple Saudagar area in Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits are waiting for modern roads under the smart cities mission project even after the deadline for the work ended last month. Residents living in these areas have complained that incomplete and dug-up roads have made commute difficult apart from posing a threat to their safety. However, the woes of the residents are unlikely to end soon as the deadline for the work has been extended till the end of December, said a Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) official. Kunal Londhe, a resident of Pimple Gurav, said that road concreting has been going on for months. It becomes particularly difficult to commute during the monsoon, with one lane closed to traffic and even public transport buses plying in a single lane, he said. Activist Raju Sawale said, “Lack of coordination among internal departments of the civic body has resulted in residents of Pimple Gurav, Old and New Sangvi and commuters who travel to other parts of Pimpri Chinchwad facing inconveniences. Almost all the major roads are either being concreted or dug up.” He added that frequent road digging results in power failure due to damage to underground cables in the areas, which affect people working from home. Ashok Bhalkar, joint city engineer, PCMC, told TOI, “The work was affected due to shortage of labourers due to the pandemic, but we are working on full swing now. The revised deadline for completion of the repair work of the 22-km road in Pimple Gurav and Pimple Saudagar has been extended till December end. Our budget for the work is around Rs320 crore, of which Rs100 crore has been spent so far.” PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil said that he has issued warning to officials after frequent complaints regarding poor condition of roads. “I have told the officials concerned from the civil, electric and the water supply department to commence road digging work after coordinating with each other. If they fail to do so, we will initiate action against them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/parts-of-pimpri-chinchwad-await-smart-roads/articleshow/84840086.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Lucknow||Now, sponsor a one-time meal of your favourite tiger at Lucknow zoo||LUCKNOW: Now, think beyond making your friends a part of your birthday treat and celebration. How about making tigers and lions at Lucknow zoo join in the festivities, too? You can include them on your special day by sponsoring the one-time meal of a lion, tiger or leopard at Lucknow zoo. What’s more: your name would be displayed on the LED screen at the ticket counter at the zoo. A meeting on the new scheme was held on Tuesday. Lucknow zoo is celebrating its 100th year and launching a scheme like this would add to its popularity. The department of environment, forests and climate change (EFCC) has come up with this novel way to involve the public and boost a connect with wildlife. Children, who constitute a considerable chunk of visitors to zoo, would relish the idea. Additional chief secretary, EFCC, Manoj Singh said, “We have worked out the per-day per-tiger meal cost, which would make it easy for people to sponsor the meal for these inmates.” The scheme is meant for large carnivores such as lions, tigers and leopards. The one-time meal of a tiger and a lion at Lucknow zoo costs around Rs 2,400 while that of a leopard is around Rs 800. A tiger eats 12-14kg meat at a time. The young ones eat more. A leopard, on the contrary, eats around 4kg meat at a time. The decision also stems from the fact that last year, city residents had shown immense sensitivity and generosity by contributing towards the zoo’s adoption scheme. The lockdown had impacted the earning of the zoo but through the adoption scheme, zoo had gathered about a crore from institutes, organizations and individuals. “At least 350 people in Lucknow alone had adopted animals at the zoo last year,” said director RK Singh. The new scheme, to be implemented shortly, is meant to make it possible for many people who want to adopt felines at the zoo but the high annual cost keeps them away. The scheme might be implemented in other zoos of the state also.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/now-sponsor-a-one-time-meal-of-your-favourite-tiger-at-city-zoo/articleshow/84842315.cms||Neha Shukla

---||Hyderabad||Owaisi's AIMIM gearing for the big fight in Uttar Pradesh||HYDERABAD: While the party could not make an impact in the recently-concluded West Bengal elections, the efforts of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) to extend its footprint across India is receiving good response, especially in Uttar Pradesh, party leaders claimed. Three to four candidates from each assembly constituency are seeking to contest elections on its ticket in the ensuing elections to Uttar Pradesh state assembly. Men and women from minorities, SC, ST, BC and Yadav communities are mainly seeking to contest on a AIMIM ticket. Owaisi has already announced that AIMIM will contest 100 of the total 403 assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh. However, the alliance partners will sit together and finalise the seats to be contested by each ally. AIMIM is part of the alliance of Bhagedari Sankalp Morcha—led by former minister Om Prakash Rajbhar. This morcha comprises nine various smaller parties. Elections are due to UP state Assembly in February 2022. Uttar Pradesh AIMIM state president Shaukath Ali confirmed to TOI that the applications from aspirants from more than 100 constituencies in UP have been submitted so far. Even women are coming forward to contest on AIMIM ticket. “We are asking them to continue their work in their respective constituencies. The party will conduct a survey and finalise the candidates with clean image, good work history and winning prospects,” he said. On the possibility of poll alliances, he said Congress is a sinking ship and no one wants to sail with it in UP elections. Even the once-strong Left scored a duck in West Bengal by going along with the Congress. On BSP chief Mayawati ruling out any alliance with AIMIM, Shaukath Ali said smaller parties have vote bank in UP. If Samajwadi Party (SP) or Bahujan Samajwadi Party (BSP) are really serious about defeating the BJP, then either one of them or both the parties should come forward for an alliance with smaller parties like Bhagedari Sankalp Morcha. Without the support of smaller parties, both SP-BSP alliance could not defeat BJP in 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The SP-Congress alliance too failed to defeat BJP in 2017 polls, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/amim-gearing-for-the-big-fight-in-up/articleshow/84842273.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Goa||Little progress for Goa’s big cat conservation||KERI: World over, July 29 is observed as International Tiger Conservation Day to raise awareness on the endangered big cat. However, in Goa, the prospect of declaring a tiger reserve is far from reality even though it has now been proven beyond doubt that a resident population of the big cat exists within the state’s boundaries. As per the report of the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, submitted in 2010, tiger presence exists in Goa within a 322sqkm. The first confirmed presence of three tigers was in 1993, followed by six in 1997, five in 2002, another five in 2014, three in 2018 and five in 2019. During the meeting of the state wildlife board on December 16, 2017, and chaired by then chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar, it was proposed to declare a tiger reserve in Goa. But this proposal has not materialised till date. It was the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) which recommended setting up of a tiger reserve in Goa. Former minister for environment and forest Jairam Ramesh, in a letter to former Goa chief minister Digambar Kamat, had said, “There is evidence to show that tigers in Goa are not mere transient animals, but are a resident population as well.” However, no sincere efforts were made to provide necessary protection to the tiger in their natural habitat which eventually resulted in death of five tigers in Golaulim, Sattari in the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary. Based on the preliminary report on the tiger deaths, the NTCA constituted a team to inquire into the cause of the tigers’ death in Golaulim. The five-member team visited various locations inside the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary from January 9 to 11, 2020. “Our wildlife division has been making sincere efforts to implement various recommendations that were made by the team constituted by the NTCA, after the incident of four tigers’ death came to light, for the protection and conservation of the tigers,” said additional principal chief conservation of forest, Santosh Kumar. Presently, through camera traps it has been revealed that the Mhadei sanctuary has the presence of four tigers and the forest officials have been making efforts to ensure the long-term protection of these biodiversity rich areas. Deputy conservator of wildlife, North division, Jabestin Arulraj said, “We have taken steps to set up anti-poaching camps, mechanism for monitoring tiger movements through patrolling, setting up wireless network, speedy compensation payment mechanism, setting of watch towers and preparation of management plan, inside the Mhadei wildlife sanctuary.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/little-progress-for-goas-big-cat-conservation/articleshow/84844059.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

The controversy over the issue has been brewing for the past several days after a flag atop the fort was torn down by a group of persons in the presence of an independent, inviting reactions from the BJP and people on social media. Police said two FIRs had been lodged at Transport Nagar police station over the issue and the investigation into the separate cases was underway. “The area of the fort comes under the forest department, therefore, entry of people could be detrimental to conservation of wildlife,” said ACP (law and order) Rahul Prakash. Jaipur police said strict action would be taken against anyone who tries to disrupt law and order and harmony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cops-tighten-security-at-amagarh-fort/articleshow/84842300.cms||---

The decision by MU comes after Bar Council of India (BCI) advocate Amit Sale informed a bench of Justices Ramesh Dhanuka and Riyaz Chagla that its June 10, 2021, directive to law colleges/universities to conduct end-term exams will apply with prospective effect only, and “shall neither apply to, nor adversely affect the results declared prior to it.” Following BCI’s statement, the judges said results of all intermediate exams declared on the basis of average of previous scores and internal evaluation would stand restored. MU’s advocate Ashutosh Kulkarni said “results for all semesters referred to in MU’s July 5 circular and for examinations for the next class for which students have appeared” would be declared within two weeks and marksheets issued. Latoya Ferns, a final-year student of Government Law College, had filed a petition stating that 10 assignments have to be submitted within 21 days. On June 26, the judges had lambasted the BCI for its direction that resulted in MU cancelling results of semesters 2 and 4 of three-year LLB and 2, 4, 6 and 8 of five-year LLB programmes. They expressed a prima facie view that the results declared could not have been withdrawn. Kulkarni had then said that among 10,000 students, only Latoya is aggrieved with the time limit for assignments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-university-to-restore-20-law-results-after-bci-gives-clarity-on-fiat/articleshow/84842389.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Mumbai||BMC took double the time to resolve fewer road-related complaints in 2020||MUMBAI: In 2020, BMC took around two months to resolve a road-related complaint, compared to 31 days in 2019. The percentage of complaints closed was also lower 67%, compared to 95% in 2019. This data was part of NGO Praja’s report card on ‘Status of civic issues in Mumbai’, released in June 2021. Following TOI’s report on BMC’s Rs 21,000-crore road construction and maintenance expenditure over the past 24 years, many citizens expressed shock and said it took several days to address complaints on ‘bad roads’. Chembur resident Kala Suresh said she also holds citizens responsible. “Everyone makes a noise about bad road conditions in Mumbai only during the monsoon, while the rest of the year we do not go behind the authorities or our elected representatives and demand good roads. This allows them to get away easily as they know that public memory is short-lived,” she said. Praja data, collated via Right to Information (RTI), showed complaints on roads in 2020 stood at 6,908, compared to 15,239 in 2019. Praja Foundation trustee Nitai Mehta said this in no way showed that citizens were satisfied with road quality. “The year 2020 was extraordinary. Mumbaikars were dealing with a pandemic and very few were moving out of their homes. Most offices had adopted work-from-home. No one can be directly held responsible for bad roads, as there is always passing of the buck, from elected representatives to BMC officials and contractor,” said Mehta. Andheri MLA Ameet Satam, on whose RTI query BMC said its road department had spent over Rs 21,000 crore since 1997, said Mumbai was an international city but its roads were not of international standard. “Every year we have a debate in the city if there are roads in potholes or potholes in roads. After spending so much of tax-payers’ money we have been deprived of good roads,” said Satam. Byculla corporator and MLA Rais Shaikh said in 10 years he has often said BMC was not capable of maintaining roads and pointed out various scams. A scam in BMC came to light in 2015 when then civic chief Ajoy Mehta appointed a committee to probe roads repaired in the previous three years after complaints of shoddy work. A preliminary report showed that almost all work on roads inspected by the committee was shoddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-took-double-the-time-to-resolve-fewer-road-related-complaints-in-2020/articleshow/84842337.cms||Richa Pinto

By the financial year 2023-24, 3,300 MW of green power will be operationalised by BSES discoms. Discom sources said that out of this, 2,291 MW will be “pure play renewable”, comprising solar, wind and waste to energy and around 1,000 MW comprising hydro power. This means that by 2024, 36% of BSES’s long-term arrangements will comprise pure play renewable energy and 16%, would be hydro power, adding up to a total of 52%. At present, around 22% of long-term arrangements of the discoms comprises green power, which includes pure play renewable power of over 9% (365 MW) and about 13% (548 MW) hydro power. The BSES discoms recently inked a power sale agreement with the Solar Energy Corporation of India to procure 510 MW of solar and bundled hybrid power. Of the total quantum of 510 MW, 300 MW is solar power and 210 MW, hybrid power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/50-of-power-needs-may-be-met-by-green-sources-by-2024/articleshow/84840164.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Prior water release averted greater flooding: Officials||Kolhapur: A study of the past 25 years and preparing for a heavy rainfall forecast in July helped reduce the flooding of the Panchaganga river in Kolhapur, irrigation department authorities have claimed. The irrigation department had decided to release water in June to prepare for a possible heavy spell between July 15 and August 15. By July 19, the department had discharged of around 11 thousand million cubic feet from the Tulashi, Kumbhi and Kasari dams. This water ultimately flows into the Panchaganga river through different tributaries. Mahesh Surve, superintending engineer of Kolhapur Irrigation Circle, said a statistical analysis of the rainfall and flood data of last 25 years has shown that there is more than 75% probability of heavy rainfall in the period between the last two weeks of July and first week of August. “We ensured the dams were filled to an extent that they could accommodate the rainwater. We did not require to release into the river during the heavy rainfall spell,” Surve. The department ensured that the big dams such as Radhanagari did not have more than 60% water stock. Except for Radhanagari, the discharge from other dams upstream of Panchganga river was very little before the arrival of the heaviest spell on July 21. The catchment areas of Tulashi dam unexpectedly witnessed highest downpour of 895 mm in 24 hours on July 23. Such massive downpour led to the near to complete filling of the dam. Ahead of the heavy spell, district guardian minister Satej Patil had visited the dams and instructed the irrigation authorities take necessary steps. “If the dams had been filled before the arrival of the heavy spell, then the water discharge from the dams would have been needed. By our estimates, if the dams were 100% filled and discharge had been carried out during the heavy spell, then Panchganga would have risen to 65 feet,” said Surve. The authorities said the period of heavy spell is still not over. Surve said they are gathering the weather data to estimate the likely rainfall. “Currently, most dams are filled. I hope that the next spell of rains will be less intense and accordingly, we will ensure dams have adequate capacity to hold the rainwater. We are initiating the discharge from Radhanagari dam through its power house spillway,” Surve said. The authorities have assured that they would ensure that the dams have adequate stock by October to cater to the requirement till next monsoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/prior-water-release-averted-greater-flooding-officials/articleshow/84840102.cms||---

In this connection, a complaint was lodged with the district education officer. The DEO has instructed to conduct an investigation and file the report on Thursday. In the complaint to district education officer, student Komal Sharma said she and her sister Palak said the government prepared the class 12 result on the basis of class 10 board results. Komal said she got 87 per cent in class 10 finals while her sister Palak got 69 per cent. However, both failed in the recently released class 12 result in practical exams. Both the girls accused that the school did not allow them to sit for practical exams for non-payment of fees. District education officer Ram Chandra Pilaniya said, “We have received a complaint from the parents and an investigation is under process. We are hoping to get the report on Thursday and will take appropriate after that.” This is one of many cases in which parents are being harassed by private schools for non-payment of fees. Sunil Yadav, president of All Rajasthan Parents Forum said, “How can students fail for not sitting for practical exams. The school can mark them absent in the practicals, but cannot mark them fail. We will give a memorandum DEO and Bal Ayog on Thursday to look into the matter.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-class-12-girls-accuse-school-of-failing-them-for-not-paying-fee/articleshow/84842371.cms||---

Paddy in all districts of Konkan has been affected, with the maximum damage in Kolhapur and Sangli districts, state agriculture department officials told TOI on Wednesday. Another state agriculture department official told TOI that Kolhapur registered the maximum crop losses. Crops in Akola, Amravati, Buldhana, Washim, Nagpur, Chandrapur and Wardha in Vidarbha were also damaged. “Maximum damage was reported to sugar cane crops in Kolhapur and Sangli, soybean in Vidarbha and paddy in Konkan, apart from all vegetables in fields. Farmers with fields in low-lying areas and those next to the riverside and nullahs especially incurred heavy damage as waterlogging and muck from flooding still persists.” he added. Crops in Palghar, Ratnagiri, Raigad and Sindhudurg were mainly affected in the Konkan region, he said. Since the department still has a primary report of the losses, crop-wise damage is yet to be compiled, officials added. Maharashtra’s total kharif area, barring sugar cane, is 141 lakh hectare. “Resowing will not be possible in case of some crops as soybean as the sowing time has already passed,” he said. Uday Patil, chairman of a farmer’s producers company in Kolhapur, said, “Soybean is a sensitive crop among cash crops, and is affected by both, heavy rains and flooding. Farmers in Kolhapur have recorded 30-50% damage to soybean due to waterlogged fields. Flooding and rains weakened soybean roots and damaged the leaves of the crop.

---||Pune||Pune: Bridge across Pavana river linking Thugaon & Baur in Maval caves||PUNE: A 50-year-old bridge across Pavana river, which linked Thugaon and Baur villages in Maval taluka, caved in on Tuesday evening, following incessant rainfall. No casualty was reported. The bridge was being mainly used by villagers, as well as employees of several hatcheries and poultry farms, in the area. They will be required to take a 10km detour to reach either villages through alternative road passing via Kadadhe village, where another bridge is located across the Pavana river. Maval, along with Mulshi, Bhor and Velhe talukas in Pune district, is known to record heavy rainfall every monsoon season. During the last year’s monsoon, the bridge was partially damaged, but was still in use by the daily commuters. Maval tehsildar Madhusudan Barge told TOI, “We had asked the villagers not to use the bridge after the last year’s damage. However, they continued using it despite being warned at regular intervals.” He said the state irrigation and the public works departments have jointly planned to construct another bridge on the river joining the two villages. “For now, we have asked the villagers not to visit the bridge site,” Barge said. An irrigation department official said, “We will start construction work of the new bridge in the next two months. It will be completed in six to seven months.” Thugaon resident Baban Jagtap told TOI, “I work in a hatchery-cum-poultry farm located on the other side of the river. I was using the bridge daily and it was just a five minute journey for me. However, I have to travel about 10-12 km one way to reach my office now.” Kaka Dhapse, a resident of Baur village, said, “I deliver milk to the areas in Pimpri Chinchwad. The bridge was good for me as it used to save at least 15km (one side) journey for me. Now, I have to commute from Kamshet or from the Kadadhe village. We need another bridge soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bridge-across-pavana-river-linking-thugaon-baur-in-maval-caves-in/articleshow/84840192.cms||---

It asked the Prime Minister and Union home minister to answer if there was any “quid pro quo” involved in the appointment and if they feared Asthana “has something” given that the officer was also on the list of those snooped upon with Pegasus. AICC spokesman Pawan Khera said Asthana had just four days left for superannuation while the SC in the landmark Prakash Singh case clearly stated that only an officer with at least six months of remaining tenure can be appointed to the post of DGP.

Mohd Furqan has been booked for “orchestrating” the murder of his first wife Mohsina. Police claimed that Furqan gave Rs 3 lakh to contract killers who shot her dead on July 15. Police investigation revealed a chilling trail of events. Furqan got married to Mohsina in 2012. A few years later, Mohsina allegedly got her sister-in-law killed over some dispute for which she was arrested and sent to jail. While she was still in prison, Furqan married another woman, a namesake of Mohsina. A couple of years later, the first wife came out on bail and confronted Furqan. “Fearing that his first wife, who had already committed a murder, could kill his second wife, Furqan plotted her murder,” a police officer said. Senior superintendent of police Abhishek Yadav had ordered Mansoorpur police to crack the case. SHO KP Singh said, “Furqan’s first wife was threatening him to give share from his property. To get rid of his first wife, Furqan had hired a contract killer.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-kills-1st-wife-to-save-the-2nd-one-arrested/articleshow/84835073.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Kolhapur||Maharashtra IITians offer free coaching & guidance to rural students||KOLHAPUR: Several youths from Maharashtra, who are currently pursuing higher education at different IITs (Kanpur, Kharagpur & Bombay), have come forward to provide free coaching and guidance to the JEE aspirants from the rural areas of the state who have been financially and mentally ravaged by the floods and the Covid-19. Saurabh Borchate, who is doing a Ph.D from IIT-Kanpur in aerospace structure (mechanical engineering) and coordinator for the free JEE coaching project, said, “I am from the Jakhale village in Kolhapur district. I got most of my education at Warnanagar. Rural students are often unaware of the IITs and don’t get proper guidance in Classes XI and XII. That is why there are so few students from our region in the IITs. Over the past few years, due to the floods and the pandemic, the students in rural areas have become mentally and financially weak. However, if they get proper guidance along with notes and question banks, they can definitely crack the JEE.” “We have formed a team of six-seven IITians from IIT Kanpur, Kharagpur, Delhi and Bombay. They will provide books (soft copies), question banks, notes and online guidance and coaching to the rural students. Those who are interested should email their details to us at borchate@iitk.ac.in,” added Borchate. Aditya Deshpande, from the Sutala village in Buldhana, who too is pursuing a Ph.D in aerospace structure at IIT-Kharagpur, said, “As a social responsibility, we are trying to help the students from our region. We can’t go there and help the people in distress. So we thought of providing our services for free to the young students.” Pramod Salunkhe, an associate professor at the Manipal Institute of Technology, Udupi, said, “I am from Solapur and an IIT-Bombay Ph.D holder. When the initiative to guide these students was discussed, I willingly joined the group. We have been through the entire process of getting into the IIT and know how much a student is burdened when he/she is in Class XII. Our experience will be useful to the students who aspire to write the JEE.” Prasad Deshpande, who hails from Sangli and is a Ph.D student at IIT Kanpur in water resources (civil engineering), said, “The online lectures for these students will be taken through Cisco Webex app. We will take out time from our busy schedules and teach the students of Classes XI and XII physics, chemistry and maths. The rural students have the talent but need some polishing. They need to be shown a proper route. We will help with that.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/iitians-offer-free-coaching-guidance-to-rural-students/articleshow/84840160.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Lucknow||BJP to flaunt e-way launch, Noida airport on development plank||LUCKNOW: With a host of ambitious projects like the Noida International Airport and Purvanchal Expressway being lined up for foundation laying and inauguration by Prime Minister Narendra Modi next month, the ruling BJP is all set to position itself to get into an an electoral groove to take on a belligerent opposition in the run-up to UP Assembly elections next year. A senior government official told TOI that the two key projects are in their final stages of getting necessary clearances/ formally completed for being flagged off by the PM anytime next month. Sources said that additional chief secretary to CM Yogi Adityanath, SP Goyal, who also holds the charge of civil aviation, has been closely coordinating with the Centre and the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) for fast-tracking the Noida airport. Likewise, the UP Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA), too, has pressed the accelerator for completion of the 340-km Purvanchal Expressway and getting it open for public use by August-end. The green-flagging of the two projects, experts said, could well arm the BJP to counter the opposition which has been seeking to put the saffron party on the mat over developmental projects. This will also allow it to launch itself into a full-blown poll mode for the 2022 state elections. The development coincides with the BJP refurbishing its frontal wings to step up the outreach amongst the SC/ST, OBC and women. BJP sources said that the party would soon be reconstituting its farmer frontal wing as well as the youth wing. Party sources said that the state leadership plans to further adjust senior party functionaries in the various boards and corporations, expectedly by August 15. But while it expedites reconstitutions of organisational set up, the UP BJP is learnt to be treading cautiously over nomination of its candidates on four MLC seats which fell vacant on July 5. The nomination of MLCs will be done by Governor Anandiben Patel on the recommendation of CM Yogi Adityanath after due clearance by the state cabinet. Sources said that the state leadership has discussed the names of prospective candidates with the party high command before a final announcement is made in the next few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-to-flaunt-e-way-launch-noida-airport-on-dev-plank/articleshow/84842369.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC to decide if it can hear Param Bir Singh’s plea on merit||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday reserved for orders an issue raised by the state and DGP Sanjay Pandey to the maintainability of ex-Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh’s challenge to preliminary enquiries, which he alleged were sought against him “hastily” on April 1 as “vendetta and retaliation” by then home minister Anil Deshmukh. The second letter for another preliminary enquiry (PE) is dated April 20. For the state, former additional solicitor general Darius Khambata said the enquiries against Singh are for alleged breach of his service law, All India Service Conduct Rules of 1968. He said, “Now for any complaint, Singh thinks he has a cloak of immunity in law. The allegations against him are extremely serious. No one is above the law, not Singh, not anyone else.” Khambata cited a Supreme Court judgment to argue that the HC must send Singh’s petition to the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), the appropriate forum to hear service matters.  Pandey, appointed initially to conduct the PE, had recused soon after Singh approached the HC on April 30. On May 3, the state allotted two PEs, one in a complaint filed by a police officer Anoop Dange to the DG, Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) and one to an additional chief secretary, hence nothing survives in the challenge against him, Khambata said. He said Singh’s plea was “essentially to remove the PE from purview of Sanjay Pandey on the ground that there are some conversations between the two, some of which are tape-recorded.” Jethmalani said “it is not an administrative enquiry” and the “only purpose of appointing Sanjay Pandey to conduct it was to persuade me (Singh) to withdraw the March 20 letter to the CM Uddhav Thackeray accusing Deshmukh, others of corrupt malpractices” and on April 5, the HC, in another matter, directed a PE by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into his allegations against Deshmukh. Jethmalani read out at length from transcripts of a April 18 taped conversation Singh and Pandey had where he said Pandey “offered to mediate” and asked Singh to withdraw his letter against Deshmukh. “Pandey clearly acted at the behest of state and this taped conversation shows the malafide of state…that in event Pandey proved to be unsuccessful, other cases would come up,” said Jethmalani, adding, “subsequent circumstances prove what the conversation, Pandey had said one case may be in offing.” Khambata intervened to say, “These are all unproven allegations.” Jethmalani added, “Singh has not been summoned by either of these two enquiries till today. These were only to put a gun to his head. Now they have moved to other things like FIR.” Jethmalani said Pandey recused because of taped conversations and the state was supporting Pandey, who has yet not responded to Singh’s petition and questioned how he was “still a DGP.” Senior counsel Navroze Seervai for Pandey too said Singh’s petition be “dismissed at the threshold” as he said it is on the face of it “not maintainable.” “There is complete adequate alternative, equally efficacious remedy available to the petitioner, Singh.” “The allegations against Pandey are entirely false. They are a tissue of falsehoods…wholesale suppressions. If for any reason Jethmalani convinces the court of the petition’s maintainability, we are ready with the reply,” he said. The bench asked if a tribunal can go into alleged malafides. Seervai said “Pandey has a very honest record” and “this is nothing but a dishonest attempt to trap a person.” Seervai said Pandey is “ready to defend himself to the hilt.” Khambata said the “enquiry started by the state indicates that an explosive device was found outside Antilia building and the issue is how did the CP (Singh) fail to control and supervise his subordinates. The other issue is that the March 20 letter was published in the media the same day, tarnishing the image of the state, thus he violated All India Service Conduct Rules.. Jethmalani it is clear that Singh is a “whistle blower” and hence he is being “harassed” by the state. The new enquiry officers are junior to Singh, which is not permissible, he added. Khambata disputed, but said the issue now is only whether HC can even hear the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-to-decide-if-it-can-hear-ex-cps-plea-on-merit/articleshow/84842401.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Raj Kundra’s plea for bail in porn case rejected||MUMBAI: A magistrate court on Wednesday rejected the bail plea of businessman Raj Kundra in the pornography case being investigated by the Crime Branch. The prosecution submitted that investigations are in progress and, if granted relief, the 45-year-old accused might tamper with the evidence. It was also submitted that the statement of key witnesses, including the victims, were yet to be recorded. The court also rejected the bail plea of Ryan Thorpe (43), the IT head of Kundra’s company. Kundra has now moved the sessions court for bail. Opposing the bail pleas, the prosecution submitted it could not be ruled out that Kundra, who was known in the film industry, had uploaded obscene videos of actors and actresses and that Thorpe had aided the act. Kundra had sought bail on Tuesday after the court refused the police plea for extension of his custody. He was instead sent to 14 days’ judicial custody. The bail plea said the chargesheet was already filed and as such, no case was made out against Kundra. It further said there was no evidence to show he was involved and his name had not even featured in the initial probe. During the hearing on Wednesday, his advocates submitted his family was based in the city and he would be available for further investigations. The prosecution expressed fears that Kundra would abscond as he was a British national. It was also submitted the accused was rich and could use his wealth to influence witnesses. The defence, however, sought parity with other accused who have been granted bail in the case. They even questioned if Kundra was a “terrorist”. Opposing Thorpe’s plea, the prosecution submitted a model had complained to the police about her obscene video being broadcast on Hotshot app. An FIR was registered at Malwani police station and investigations were on. If granted bail, there were fears that the accused might threaten the complainant, the prosecution’s reply said. It was also alleged that Thorpe, in collusion with other accused, had been broadcasting obscene videos for a subscription charge. The prosecution said an investigation into his finances needed to be carried out. The prosecution said if granted relief, the accused would be encouraged to continue to make such obscene films that damaged the social fabric. It iterated that after the Hotshot app was shut down, the accused conspired to create another one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-kundras-plea-for-bail-in-porn-case-rejected/articleshow/84842446.cms||---

The state had stopped registering new names as it had almost reached the upper limit of 4.46 crore beneficiaries set by the Centre. Some of the applicants narrated the ordeal faced by them due to the pandemic situation, which had rendered them jobless since Lockdown-1. Of the total applications (3.87 lakh), 32,854 applications have been approved so far; 32,919 have been rejected; 54,264 applications are under process and several documents have been sought from 2.67 lakh applicants (as on July 27), said a food department official. Dinesh Kumar, 38, whose name figured in the list of applicants issued by SDM office (Kota), due to be added as NFSA beneficiary, said, “I have been working in a grocery shop for the past 15-20 days. I’ll be paid Rs 5,000-6,000 per month. With this money, it is difficult to sustain a living. Before this, I was working as a delivery man at Zomato. When lockdown was enforced in March last year (2020), I was rendered jobless. There was no job anywhere and I did whatever I managed to get to make ends meet. If I start getting ration under food security scheme, it will be a huge relief for us.” Kumar, who lives at Mahaveer Nagar Vistar Yojana in Kota, has four family members including two daughters. “We received ration only once when it was distributed during Covid emergency situation,” he said. Another applicant Mukesh, 33, wife Rani, 32, said they made several rounds of collector’s office in Kota hoping to get benefits under food security scheme, but to no avail. “My husband works as a daily wage labourer. He earns around Rs 200-300 per day. This is not enough to run a family. We have two daughters. We had to borrow money and wheat from our relatives and the debt has gone up to Rs 15,000. We were asked to get a labourer’s diary made to apply for Jan Aadhar card. We did that too. But nothing happened. We have been told there is no order from Jaipur to start distribution of ration,” said Rani, another resident of Poonam Colony, Kota. Yasmeen, 31, whose name, too figured in the same list of applicants, is waiting for her turn to get benefit under NFSA. “Her name appeared on the list of applicants to be added as a beneficiary, but it hasn’t happened yet. We went to collector’s office several times enquiring about it. I work as a mechanic in a repair shop and my wife works a housemaid,” said Yasmeen’s husband.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/food-security-act-applicants-still-wait-for-their-turn-to-get-benefits/articleshow/84842411.cms||Sidhartha Dutta

After his family accused him of being beaten by the police for three days and admitted to the hospital when his condition deteriorated, Sant Kabir Nagar superintendent of police (SP) suspended Bakhira station house officer. Senior administrative and police officials reached the hospital where the family members were staging a sit-in and assured them of stringent action against the guilty after they received the postmortem report. On July 21, Ashok Kumar, son of victim Bahraichi Prasad, had allegedly eloped with a girl of his village. The girl’s family filed a police complaint against him but a case was not registered. However, for recovery of the girl, police picked up Ashok’s father Bahraichi on July 24 and kept him in the lock-up.

---||Delhi||As dengue cases rise, south Delhi civic body puts schools on notice||NEW DELHI: With the arrival of monsoon there has been a rapid rise in mosquito breeding cases. Domestic breeding checkers (DBCs) from the three municipal corporations have detected mosquito breeding in 6,207 houses in the last week alone. Also, vector-borne disease control report has found a 20% rise in weekly dengue cases in the last week. South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has written to schools to incorporate vector-borne disease-related classes in the online education system. A senior public health official said that letters have been sent to school authorities for appointing nodal officers to control mosquito-borne diseases and to keep the school premises free of mosquito breeding. “The school authorities have also been requested to display preventive messages and awareness material during the online classes. The educational material has already been sent to the schools,” the official added. Another official said that during these classes the schools will explain various types of diseases caused by mosquitoes and their potential breeding sites in and around the houses. The children will be told to check for accumulated water. “Once the schools reopen, the nodal officers will have to ensure that no water is getting accumulated on school premises as some parts of schools may be closed for a long time,” official stated. Analysis of mosquito breeding data from the three civic bodies shows that peridomestic containers — such as money plant, vase, flower pot, bird pot, tin, tyre, fountain water, etc account for the largest chunk of mosquito breeding sites (38%). Report shows that domestic water storage containers — drums, buckets, jeri cans, etc — which are usually used in water-stressed regions come second at 33% of overall cases. Desert cooler, which find significant usage in Delhi’s arid weather over summers and over-head tanks come at third and fourth spot respectively. The contribution of each category keeps on varying all through the year with domestic water storage containers and desert coolers being the largest contributors in summer and peridomestic containers assuming a larger proportion in monsoon season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-dengue-cases-rise-sdmc-puts-schools-on-notice/articleshow/84840255.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Path work exposes poor road repairs, adds to citizens’ agony||PUNE: The poor quality of road repair work carried by the civic body was once again exposed on Wednesday, as the administration hurriedly tried to repair the potholes at the Tilak Smarak Mandir Chowk after the Congress announced to stage an agitation against the issue. The repairs, instead of praise, attracted the commuters and local residents’ ire due to the poor quality of work. The civic staff hastily filled the potholes with a concrete mix, but did not pay attention to the quality, further worsening the situation. The activists claimed that the restoration work was not in accordance with the Indian Roads Congress (IRS) guidelines and the material used for the work was “substandard”. A group of Congress workers found another pothole nearby and staged a protest by playing ‘Gilli Danda’ using it. Prashant Inamdar of Pedestrians First said unscientific approach and use of substandard and inappropriate material were compelling the administration to repeatedly repair the same road patches. He said, “No standards like using cold mix or hot mix for the repair work are followed. Even paver blocks are used to fill the potholes. Tar roads are being repaired with cement concrete. On the other hand, concrete roads are developing cracks. This shows that there is a lack of scientific approach to the repair work.” Inamdar emphasised on the need for quality check of the material being used for repairs. “The material should be tested in laboratories. The administration should also check if the contractors are trained to carry out road and repair works. Otherwise, the ongoing repair works will only be a fire-fighting exercise and the roads will again develop potholes.” he said. Aba Bagul, leader of the Congress in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said despite spending huge money on the road repair tenders, the civic administration has failed to keep the roads pothole-free. “The repair and restoration works are not up to the mark and also not as per the set standards. All major roads are in a pathetic condition. If the contractors are supposed to carry out repairs during the defect liability period, why is the civic body doing it?. There is a nexus between the officials and contractors which is leading to poor road condition,” Bagul said. He said the civic chief should initiate action against officers concerned for failing to inspect the road works as per the technical parameters. Hemant Rasane, chairman of the standing committee, said, “The civic body will try to repair the roads at the earliest. We have planned to finish the works in a fortnight.” V G Kulkarni, head of the PMC’s road department, said the civic administration has deployed mobile road repair units. “The contractors will be held responsible for their work. They will be directed to do the repair work. Action will be taken against those doing substandard work,” he said. A PMC officials said urgent repair work could not be carried out due to the heavy showers. “Different material are used for improving the quality of road repair work during monsoon. But there are limitations to do the repairs, when it rains heavily,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/path-work-exposes-poor-road-repairs-adds-to-citizens-agony/articleshow/84840277.cms||Sarang Dastane

With the healthcare system already battling shortage of vaccines and poor infrastructure in rural areas, the government’s failure to resolve the issues of ambulance drivers has left them with no option but to strike, making the situation worse. “People are being forced to return from vaccination centres without the jab in the absence of regular supply of vaccines. The situation is so grim that vaccination centres are closing down one after the other across the state. Patients from rural areas who used the ambulance services to reach better medical facilities in the nearest city, have been the worst hit by the strike called by ambulance operators and drivers,” Akhilesh said, adding that the government is to blame for the crisis. “First the government removed the word Samajwadi from the ambulance service that was launched by the SP government. Then they changed the agency operating the ambulances. Despite having engaged the agency of its choice, the government has not been able to ensure smooth functioning of ambulance services. Who is to blame for it,” he asked. He said the government wanted to remove the existing employees associated with ambulance service and appoint new ones on new terms and conditions which is not acceptable to the existing employees of the service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/human-lives-have-no-value-for-this-failed-govt-says-akhilesh/articleshow/84842467.cms||---

As per an analysis of road accidents in the first six months of this calendar year, conducted by Nagpur city traffic police, 221 of the 424 road accidents happened due to the reasons mentioned above. A total of 56 people were killed and more than 224 injured in these accidents. However, the study puts dangerous driving as the top reason for road accidents as was evident in 96 cases in which 31 people were killed, 54 grievously injured and 46 sustained minor injuries. Similarly, overspeeding is another major cause of road accidents. Exceeding the speed limit was found responsible for 56 accidents killing 31 people and injuring 54 others. Other reasons like overtaking, human errors etc too contributed to 198 road accidents. The analysis revealed that these factors have claimed 57 lives and injured 202. The analysis also revealed that in 2020 calendar year, the city roads witnessed maximum accidents due to exceeding speed of vehicles. Overspeeding contributed to 194 accidents, while driving under the influence of liquor was the reason for 23 accidents.

Similarly, 22 car drivers, 21 bicycle riders and 199 others (mostly two-wheeler riders) were killed in accidents in the last 18 months, revealed the data. Traffic police, however, claimed that they have intensified their drive against motorists flouting speed limit norm. In the first six months, the cops have penalized 8,778 people for the same reason. Similar actions were also initiated against other major violators including wrong side driving, driving without licence etc, the police added. “The drive against violators of traffic rules too has been intensified with 4,42,516 motorists being issued challan and Rs7.35 crore fine recovered from them,” said the police. Traffic experts say the city roads are facing host of challenges ranging from poor system of issuing driving licences to almost zero scientific investigation of fatal crashes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/50-accidents-in-city-due-to-dangerous-driving-118-lost-life-in-6-months-this-year/articleshow/84840292.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: V Sivankutty rejects opposition's call for his resignation||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: General education minister V Sivankutty as well as CPM rejected the opposition’s call for the minister’s resignation in the wake of the Supreme Court dismissing the government’s plea to drop the cases against LDF legislators in connection with the assembly ruckus case. “There is no verdict against the minister. There is no logic behind the argument that the minister should resign because he is about to face trial,” CPM state secretary A Vijayaraghavan told reporters on Wednesday. Addressing a news conference at his residence, Sivankutty claimed that the Supreme Court did not get into the merit of the case. “As far as we know, the Supreme Court only discussed the Constitutional angle in the case. Politicians often face cases and trials as part of their political work. I am sure that our innocence can be proved in the trial court. There is no question of quitting the cabinet,” he said. However, opposition leader V D Satheesan said there was enough ground for the opposition to demand Sivankutty’s resignation. “Sivankutty contested the election and has sworn in as minister when the case was on stay. Now, the Supreme Court has rejected all the arguments put forward by the government for permission to withdraw the case. There is no moral ground for the minister to remain in the post,” he said. IUML leader P K Kunhalikutty said no other assembly in the country has witnessed such an incident. Not allowing a minister to enter the assembly and creating such a ruckus were unheard of and the minister should step down from the post, he said. Former opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, one of those who approached the court against the decision to withdraw the case, said that SC’s order was a major setback to the government. “The verdict is a milestone in the country’s democracy. It has shown that the privilege for the elected representatives is not for undertaking criminal activities. In fact, the government’s decision to withdraw the case is a challenge to the law-and-order system of the country. Sivankutty should either step down on his own or the chief minister should seek his resignation,” he said. CPM central committee member A K Balan said the opposition’s demand for minister’s resignation did show the dearth of topics in the opposition camp. “There is nothing unusual in the court’s order that persons accused in the case should undergo trial,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/sivankutty-rejects-oppns-call-for-his-resignation/articleshow/84840269.cms||---

Sources said though Kundra has not been named in this FIR, he is likely to be made an accused as his app has been mentioned in the complaint. Hotshots is owned by Kundra’s brother-in-law Pradeep Bakshi’s company Kenrin, registered in the UK. According to the model’s complaint, she was taken to different bungalows in Madh Island and one in Lonavala and forced to act in porn films. The clips were later uploaded on the apps. This is the fourth FIR in connection with the pornography racket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fresh-fir-filed-against-accused-gehena-vashist/articleshow/84842498.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: After slow start, rain casts heavy spell, monsoon now 30% surplus||NEW DELHI: Before the monsoon hit on July 13, Delhi was in the “large deficient” category. While five out of nine districts had “deficient” status, four were “large deficient”, which meant there was a total deficit of over 60%. After a flurry of rainy days, which included two “heavy” rainfall spells, now there is a 30% surplus placing Delhi in the “excess” category. IMD data showed that between June 1 and July 28, Delhi received an average rainfall of 314.8mm, as opposed to the normal mark of 241.6mm for this period. While North and North West districts have been lucky in terms of rainfall, North East, which is barely a few kilometres away, is parched and the only deficient district. Both North and North West districts are in the “large excess” category with 72% and 75% surplus rainfall, respectively. North East district has only received 125.2mm of rainfall so far from June 1 onwards compared with the normal mark of 273mm, making it deficit by 54%. Central district has recorded the most rainfall (435.3mm) during this period, followed by North at 380.7mm. Rainfall is classified as deficit when it is more than -19% and large deficit or large deficient when it is more than -59%. If rainfall is between -19% and 19%, it is classified as normal and between 20% and 59% as “excess”. South and East districts are verging on the “deficient” category with a deficit of 13% and 10%, respectively. A Met official said the distribution of rainfall, even over a small region such as Delhi, could vary significantly depending on the monsoon trough and cloud formation. “If there is a movement of rain clouds, there may be a passing shower and only some parts of Delhi will receive rain. Distribution is more even if clouds are directly over the city and rain occurs over a period of time,” added the official. The onset of monsoon was declared on July 13 this year, making it the slowest since 2002. The normal date is June 27. Last year, the monsoon hit Delhi two days early, on June 25. Met officials said the overall forecast for monsoon was expected to be in the “normal” range, with long-term data showing rainfall becoming more evenly distributed by September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-slow-start-rain-casts-heavy-spell-monsoon-now-30-surplus/articleshow/84840326.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Pravin Jadhav’s Tokyo exit leaves his coaches heartbroken||The 32-inch rectangular TV in Amravati-based archery coach Praful Dange’s house could have passed for a circular target board on Wednesday as around 13 pairs of eyes fixated on it between 12.30 pm and 1.30 pm. The wordless attention of his archery students towards the progress of Dange’s former student, Satara’s Pravin Jadhav, at the individual men’s recurve archery rounds in the Tokyo Olympics was interrupted only by connectivity issues when their gaze darted from the TV to the three mobile phones in the room that were streaming the match simultaneously. Cheers that had shot up in the room like arrows during the first round when 25-year-old Jadhav knocked out World Number 2 Galsan Bazarzhapov from Russian Olympic Committee in straight sets became deflated verbal darts in the second round when Jadhav went down to United States’ World Number 1 Brady Ellison without a fight. Ellison wasn’t at his finest, but Jadhav’s misses tilted the eliminations round in favour of the American who won with an easy 6-0. As one of many coaches who shaped Jadhav’s journey from undernourished child sprinter to Maharashtra’s first Olympian archer, Dange couldn’t help but blame himself, too, for the poor show. “I’m not exactly sure what happened,” said Dange, who could not recognise his studious, calm ex-pupil in the archer on screen who seemed to flounder momentarily before firing arrows in the match against Ellison. The difficult weather conditions in the range would be a flimsy excuse, felt the coach. “Yes, it was windy, but then both the players are subject to the same conditions. We fell short in our preparation,” said an apologetic Dange, who recalled Jadhav’s confident tone during their video call earlier that day. “He said he would play with all his heart.” Besides this assurance, what had filled Dange with hope that Jadhav could beat the American was the memory of an earlier contest from the pre-Covid times between Ellison and Jadhav that had ended in a tie-breaker. Though Jadhav had lost that match, “Ellison was in awe,” recalled Dange.  Back in Phaltan taluka in Jadhav's hometown Satara, Vikas Bhujbal—the sports teacher who had prescribed athletics to 10-year-old Jadhav as an escape from his destiny as a wage labourer and who had seen the Tokyo-bound Jadhav off at Pune’s international airport--was sorting gunny sacks of rice meant for mid-day meals even as his prodigy’s match was on. “I can never get myself to watch any of his games. I’m a sports teacher but my heart is not that strong,” said a heartbroken Bhujbal, who couldn’t recover from the fact that Jadhav lost the first set to Ellison 27-28, “by just one point”. “Luck wasn’t on his side,” said Bhujbal. Dange, on his part, turned off the TV only after reading both respect and relief in the expression that ensued on the World Number One archer Ellison’s face after his win on Wednesday. “It was the expression of someone who had dismissed a tough competitor.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-jadhavs-tokyo-exit-leaves-his-coaches-heartbroken/articleshow/84842657.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram
---||Kochi||KC(M) guarded in its response||Kottayam: With Kerala Congress now part of LDF, party chairman Jose K Mani was guarded in his reaction to the Supreme Court’s dismissal of the government’s appeal to withdraw the criminal cases against the then MLAs in connection with the ruckus inside the assembly in 2015. All are obliged to obey the court’s judgment, Mani said, adding that he is not going to debate whether the verdict is “right” or “wrong”. The court has made correct observations about the case and has said that the MLAs will have to face trial. He also welcomed minister V Sivankutty’s statement that he will face the trial. Mani had earlier lodged protest with LDF over remarks made about K M Mani and the bar bribery scam by the government counsel’s while presenting the case in the Supreme Court. The very next day he backed CPM’s stand after acting secretary A Vijayargahavan said that K M Mani’s name was not there in the affidavit submitted by the government in the court and that it mentioned only ‘former finance minister’. Now, both CPM as well as the KC(M) are liable to make it clear against whom the battle was waged in the assembly six years ago. The CPM-led LDF had raised several serious allegations against Mani and had even accused him of having a ‘currency counting machine’. Even as SC’s verdict has come as a relief and as a sweet revenge to KC(M), the leadership has conveyed to the ranks to react cautiously. The verdict did not trigger any celebrations at Pala, the home turf of K M Mani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kcm-guarded-in-its-response/articleshow/84840327.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: CBI searches premises of 2 cops in Anil Deshmukh case||MUMBAI: In a surprising move, the CBI on Wednesday carried out searches at the premises of deputy police commissioner of police Raju Bhujbal and assista-nt commissioner of police Sanj-ay Patil whose statements the agency had recorded in the initial days to strengthen its corruption case against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh. The CBI seized their cellphones for examination. A few others, who acted as middlemen, were also searched. CBI sources said, “We collected incriminating documents and digital evidence at the premises of Bhujbal, Patil and a few middlemen.” The raided premises were in Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Ahmednagar, Solapur, Sangli, Nashik and Osmanabad. They searched Bhujbal’s premises in Mumbai and Ahmednagar, and Patil’s residence in Mumbai and Pune. Bhujbal was unavailable for comment. Patil said he doesn’t want to comment as the case is under the investigation. Former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh had alleged that Deshmukh had asked assistant police inspector Sachin Waze, then heading CIU branch, to collect Rs 100 crore from bars and other establishments every month for him. Singh had also claimed that Deshmukh had reiterated the demand with Bhujbal and Patil after calling them at his official residence, Dnyaneshwari, in south Mumbai. Deshmukh’s private secretary, Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde were passing instructions to Waze, Bhujbal and Patil related to the demand. Singh had also annexed WhatsApp chats between him and Patil where they discussed the alleged demands made by Deshmukh. The CBI is also investigating the posting of these officials along with many others and their links with Deshmukh to ascertain if there were financial transactions between them. On Tuesday, TOI reported that the CBI has asked the state government for the details of all transfers that took place during Deshmukh’s tenure. It is learnt that the state may seek advice of legal experts before taking a final decision on CBI’s request. Last week Bombay HC dismissed Deshmukh’s writ plea challenging the CBI FIR filed against him on April 21 on charges of bribery, corruption and criminal conspiracy. The HC also dismissed a separate plea filed by the state seeking directi-ons to set aside two “unnumbered paragraphs” from the FIR. The two paragraphs refer to Waze’s reinstatement in the force last year, him being assigned most of the ‘sensational cases’, and alleged ‘exercise of undue influence. Subsequent to the order, the CBI expedited its probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cbi-searches-premises-of-2-cops-in-deshmukh-case/articleshow/84842509.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: 28 bidders from 2019 owe HMDA Rs 45 crore despite extensions||HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) is planning to serve notices on bidders who have not cleared their dues after winning the bids in Uppal Bhagat layout near Nagole. Twenty eight bidders owe Rs 45 crore to the HMDA, which has already given extensions and relaxations twice in the last three months. The HMDA had recently earned Rs 2,000 crore from the land auctions at Neopolis layout in Kokapet. As many as 155 plots were auctioned by the HMDA in Uppal Bhagat layout in April and December 2019 which fetched Rs 1,057 crore. The layout was developed by the metropolitan authority under land pooling scheme by taking over 700 acres from farmers owning land on the Musi bank. Official sources said the bidders have paid Rs 1,012 crore till now. “Initially, they paid 33% of their amount, but due to Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown, the bidders could not pay the amount. The HMDA gave time till March 31, 2021, and later it was extended till June-end. Twentyeight bidders are yet to clear the balance amount,” official sources in the municipal administration department said. Among the defaulters, around 20 of them won the bids in the first phase of auctions, while another eight secured the plots in the second bids held in December 2019. “If the bidders do not come forward to pay the balance amount, the HMDA will forfeit the paid amount or it can collect 15% of interest on the balance amount,” a senior municipal official said. Problems arose since many bidders are real estate agents and firms which purchased the land in Uppal Bhagat and now struggling to sell off the land as a result of pandemic-induced slowdown. They are seeking more time from the authorities for clearing the dues. The HMDA, which had apprehensions about payment of initial 33% of bidding amount from Kokapet land auctions, heaved a sigh of relief after all the eight bidders (some took more than single land parcel) paid the initial amount of Rs 650 crore on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/28-bidders-from-19-owe-hmda-rs-45-crore-despite-extensions/articleshow/84840302.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Defeated mucor, but necrosis due to clotting surfaces||NAGPUR: Around two months after being diagnosed with mucormycosis, several patients have been found to be suffering from frontal bone osteomyelitis and zygomatic bone osteomyelitis, also called necrosis, in routine CT scan of the face. Doctors at the Kingsway Hospital, which treated over 120 patients, found eight patients complaining of headache or pain in cheek (zygomatic) bone during their routine check-ups. Following a CT scan, treating doctors stumbled upon what they describe as secondary or delayed manifestation of mucormycosis. The only symptoms these patients had were mild headache and swelling on the head. The radiological findings led to immediate removal of the affected part. Dr Rahul Atara, head of the dental department at the hospital, said in some cases re-surgeries are needed. “The patients are explained and counselled during the first surgery that they may need another operation. Hence, it is advisable that recovered patients compulsorily go for routine check-ups and screening,” he said. Dr Shweta Lohiya, consultant ENT specialist at the hospital, said as far as she has observed these are those patients who suffered from mucormycosis during the shortage of Amphotericin B injections. “These are among those chunk of patients who couldn’t receive sufficient dose of the life saving drug and are now showing a kind of reoccurrence in frontal or cheek bones. All previously operated patients are doing very well,” she said, adding regular follow-up is a must. Dr Vipin Dehane, consultant maxillofacial surgeon at the hospital, said, “Basically, it is a thromboembolic phenomenon leading to necrosis of bone. Clots are blocking minor blood vessels leading to necrosis of the particular bone.” He also said the hypercoagulability was detected through rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) and TEG-Thromboelastography in some of these patients. “The clots were not stabilizing. This was seen in post-Covid patients who would get small patches in lungs or heart.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/defeated-mucor-but-necrosis-due-to-clotting-surfaces/articleshow/84840375.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Kolkata||Presidency University may reopen portal as West Bengal JEE set to refund test fee||KOLKATA: Students, who were disappointed when West Bengal Joint Entrance Exam Board cancelled the entrance tests at Presidency University, are now eagerly waiting for the institute to reopen its application process for 16 undergraduate programmes. With WBJEEB already issuing a notice about refund of the fees that candidates had paid for entrance tests, Presidency is now likely to finalize the process and announce the application criteria for UG programmes next week. “The continuing Covid pandemic has made it difficult to conduct admission tests. After the state government decided to cancel all entrance examinations, keeping in mind the health and safety of students, WBJEE Board was forced to scrap the admission test at Presidency despite collecting application fees and completing formalities,” said a senior higher education department official. He added that even the question papers had been readied when the exam was cancelled. “Now that WBJEE Board is set to refund the entrance test fees, Presidency University is likely to reopen the admission portal. But the final decision will be taken at the university’s admissions committee meeting,” the official said. The board recently asked students who had paid for entrance tests to apply for refund within July 31. Presidency University could only reopen its admission portal after the WBJEE Board cancelled their earlier notification to hold admission tests, which were initially slated for April 11 and 12 and were postponed due to the pandemic. “The same UG admissions cannot have two notifications. Thus, the first one had to be cancelled before we can issue the admissions circular. We will subsequently decide on a date to publish the merit lists,” said Presidency registrar Debajyoti Konar. Going by the request from the state government, the university will not charge any application fee. Senior Bikash Bhavan officials pointed out that since all state-run universities had been instructed to open the UG admission portals from August 2, Presidency could not be an exception. According to the government directive, online applications have to be completed by August 20 and the first merit list has to be published by August 31. First-semester classes have to begin from October 1. Last year, in absence of an admission test, Presidency University had admitted students based on marks they had obtained in their Class X boards and Plus-II Higher Secondary or equivalent (10+2 standard) examinations.  Over the past few years, WBJEE Board had been holding admission tests. “This time, admissions committee will have to be cautious while framing the criteria and chalk out a formula to judge the applicants’ merit in the best possible manner,” said an official. Last year, the Presidency University Admissions Committee had included Class X scores as it gave an understanding of the candidates’ overall merit. “In the absence of the actual evaluation, the admission committee will chalk out a similar formula when only those who have been consistent in their performance will find a seat,” said a teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/presi-may-reopen-portal-as-jee-set-to-refund-test-fee/articleshow/84840293.cms||Somdatta Basu

The development plan would have helped to market the archaeological site as an international tourist destination. The Union government had recommended to Unesco that Dholavira should be named a world heritage site — a distinction which was accorded earlier this week. A key officer close to the development said, “As Dholavira has now got the world heritage site status, we will expedite the preparation of development plan.” In 2019, the Union government had included Dholavira in the first list of 17 iconic tourism sites of India and the ministry of tourism had included the Harappan civilization site in the list of international tourism sites of India. The Centre had asked the state government to develop tourist facilities at the site and market it as an international tourist destination of Gujarat and India.  However, the department could not do it. “A committee was formed earlier under the chief secretary to chalk out the plan. But, so far the state government is yet to prepare any action plan. The government will shortly plan a meeting with the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) officials to prepare the Dholavira tourism development plan. However, it may take two to three years more. Consultants will be appointed in a few days to prepare the master plan which will include museum, tourist facilities, interpretation centres etc., The state government will also focus on making Dholavira village more accessible by road to tourists,’’said a source. The Union government has identified iconic tourist spots in India to attract foreign and domestic tourists. Pursuant to the Budget announcements of 2018-19, the ministry of tourism identified 17 sites in 12 clusters in the country for development as Iconic Tourist Sites. These are Taj Mahal & Fatehpur Sikri (Uttar Pradesh), Ajanta & Ellora (Maharashtra), Humayun’s Tomb, Red Fort and Qutub Minar (Delhi), Colva (Goa), Amer Fort (Rajasthan), Somnath and Dholavira (Gujarat), Khajuraho (Madhya Pradesh), Hampi (Karnataka), Mahabalipuram (Tamil Nadu), Kaziranga (Assam), Kumarakom (Kerala) and Mahabodhi Temple (Bihar). The tourism ministry proposed to develop these sites in a holistic manner by bringing private investment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dholavira-state-to-seek-funds-from-centre/articleshow/84840371.cms||Kapil Dave

The court convicted Bhaskar and 17 others by awarding them a penal punishment. They were asked to pay Rs 3,000 as fine. His conviction comes close on the heels of two other TRS leaders- Mahabubabad MP, M Kavitha, and Khairathabad MLA, Danam Nagender getting convicted. The MLA & MP court’s judge awarded a punishment to these two leaders by directing them to undergo imprisonment. A few days ago, TRS general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Banda Prakash, a resident of Warangal was booked by district police on the charge of misappropriation of over Rs 12.24 lakh funds of Alluri Trust-,which runs the popular Alluri Institute of Management Sciences in Hanamkonda, In July 2010, on a call given by the Joint Action Committee (JAC) to conduct rail roko across Telangana, Vinay Bhaskar along with several others sat on railway tracks at Kazipet station. As a result, a Kerala-bound train was halted from morning till evening, causing inconvenience to passengers. Following this, the Railway Protection Force (RPF) filed a criminal case and subsequently a chargesheet was also submitted in the court. The court, convicted them under sections 144 and 174 of the Railway Act. It is expected that the MLA might appeal the verdict in a higher court. The accused in case if they fail to pay the fine, they will be liable for simple imprisonment. Bhaskar paid the fine of Rs 3,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/train-stopping-case-trs-mla-17-others-convicted/articleshow/84842578.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Lady Brabourne, Goenka college share admission criteria||KOLKATA: Two reputable colleges affiliated to Calcutta University have uploaded their undergraduate admission criteria before the admission portals start accepting applications on August 2. Goenka College of Commerce and Business Administration and Lady Brabourne College, both government institutes, receive several thousand admission applications every year for a few hundred seats. At Lady Brabourne College, according to the notification on its site, each candidate can apply for a maximum of four subjects. Students will also have to upload attested copies of Class X marksheets, along with other documents. The candidates’ Class X board exam scores will be given weightage for admission to many courses. For subjects, such as Bengali, microbiology, physics and geography, weightage will be given to marks scored in the subject as well as related subjects. This is being done because all the boards and councils cancelled their classes X and XII exams this year and the government also ruled out any admission test or interview of applicants. Lady Brabourne, like many other institutes, has devised its own formula to evaluate the candidates and see if they have the aptitude for the subjects and whether they are interested in the fields or not. At Goenka College the eligibility criteria this year is that a candidate must have passed Class XII boards in 2021 and preceding five years, up to 2016, with at least five subjects of 100 marks each, including English and any one related subject, including accountancy, mathematics, economics, statistics,commerce, costing and taxation. Candidates must have also scored 75% in aggregate and 60% in the related subject. The college has 549 seats, including both morning and day sections. “All important dates and method of application have been shared on a specially designed portal, which went live on Wednesday,” said a college official.

With a total 230 students in two streams, IIIT Trichy was functioning on a temporary campus at Oxford Engineering College, Trichy. IIITs are the third-generation technical institutions started specifically to cater to information technology companies. TCS, Cognizant, Infosys, Ramco, Elcot and tech solutions are the stakeholders who have 15% stake in the institution. “Intake of students could not be increased in the absence of a permanent campus. Now that we are into the permanent campus, we will be increasing the intake of students,” said the director. The government has given us the option to start any programme related to IT and related conventional programmes, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/iiit-trichy-to-increase-its-student-intake/articleshow/84837754.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Communication holds the key to last- mile vaccination||Back in January 2021, a Public Health Foundation of India and UNICEF formative study on ‘perceptions and barriers to Covid vaccination’ brought to the fore an awareness disparity that prevented people from taking the jab. The problem assumed a different shape in gender, social and income groups. Now, zoom into July 2021. A recent study by UNICEF and Ipsos has some good news: 71% people confirmed to receive reasonable information on Covid-19. Though TV with 46% leads the pack, word of mouth matters hugely, especially for women and socially and economically marginalized as 40% women would trust family and relatives. Sadly, the high exposure is not getting translated into real protective and preventive action. The same respondents show poor response to protocols like isolation and using toll-free number (12% and 6% respectively) upon getting Covid symptoms. To effectively beat the third wave of Covid infection, expected to hit the population sooner or later, acceleration of vaccination and universal compliance to Covid-appropriate behaviour (CAB) are extremely essential. And it is important to take the ongoing vaccination drive to the last mile. Feedback from the field indicates that there is a need to create a higher degree of assurance by better plugging gaps in our communication with information-dark population. This also demands shift from the routine communication strategies of print and electronic media. Current challenges and response actions may be summarized into three: First, intense and inclusive risk communication and community engagement is paramount. Second, special social mobilization platforms should be tapped to reach women, low-income and socially marginalized population. And third, mere exposure of messages is not sufficient and more word of mouth and persuasive communication approaches are needed to develop protective skills such as effective and timely isolation and complete adherence to CAB. The journey so far… Uttar Pradesh has taken account of multi-layered challenges in communication. Along with introduction of vaccine in January, it defined a phased communication strategy in sync with vaccination roll out plan. The early focus was to build awareness and trust by communicating vaccine benefits, safety and assurance of support during adverse event following immunization. Gradually, a good mix of 360-degree media strategy has evolved with objectives of awareness building and positive buzz creation, trust and confidence building, role modelling and peer education and in select circumstances, handling of vaccine avoidance. Keeping in view the pressing need of information-dark population, three strategies have high promise. They are, cluster strategy, Dastak and women SHG engagement. What’s happening in these three areas? Cluster strategy is a unique mix of ‘near home’ vaccine delivery and dedicated social mobilization. Every block has been divided into clusters that have 8-10 revenue villages, and a time-bound pre-vaccination micro-plan is executed leveraging all government and non-government frontline functionaries. The recent vaccination data confirms that over 67% of the jabs have been administered between July 1 and 14 in rural areas and this new strategy owes credit. The second big push is coming from Dastak, which put UP in a unique position when it comes to synergistic public health education by more than a dozen government departments. Started in 2018 with seven east UP districts, this drive is covering the entire state three times in the year. The second round (July 12-25) of household-level mobilization is on. A blend of activities around acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), Covid and range of vector-borne diseases is in place. The massive impact of Dastak on reduction of deaths from AES cases from 16% (2016) to 2% (until June 14, 2021) has been internationally acclaimed. Timely identification, isolation and treatment of Covid cases by trained health facilities is key. Dastak has played a major role in restoring trust and confidence for health facilities over the last three years. In west UP, as per evaluation, almost one out of three persons is utilizing government health facility in fever cases which is a three-time leap from 2018. Over 92% people are using their own flush toilet which has doubled in three years. Keeping in view the dangers of Covid-19 on children, Dastak has particularly unleashed the energy of school teachers. The third and equally important platform is women self-help groups in Uttar Pradesh. The Uttar Pradesh State Rural Livelihood Mission (UPSRLM), with its massive presence of 4.63 lakh SHGs across the state, uniquely provides vaccination gateway for rural women. Recognizing this on time, the mission has taken up vaccination of SHG women on priority. Besides, it trains women leaders to become ambassadors for mask use, social distancing and many other appropriate behaviours. A recent study confirmed that close to 60% SHG women are trained and their confidence level in managing Covid-19 is high.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Opposition & Kerala government slug it out over smuggling case||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The opposition and the government locked horns in the assembly on Wednesday over the Ramanattukara gold smuggling case and the incidents relating to it, including the death of a man summoned by the customs in connection with the case. Seeking leave for an adjournment motion, Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan MLA said Rameez K C (an accomplice of the main accused Arjun Ayanki), can be suspected to have been murdered to prevent the case details from coming out. He said as many as 20 cases of crime related to gold smuggling have been reported in the last one year near the airports in the state and the government cannot wash of its hands from the responsibility of maintaining law and order in the state. Replying to the charges, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said it is the Centre’s responsibility to curb incidents like gold smuggling as customs has been included in the seventh schedule of the Constitution. He said police have no role inside the airports even if they are deputed on some duties. Police have registered a case under Sections 279 and 304A of the IPC in the death of Rameez, and are probing the matter. He said the accident occurred when Rameez’s bike crashed into a car from behind, when the car took a right turn. The chief minister said the opposition charges regarding Rameez’s death is laughable, and added that there is no such situation in the prisons in the state because of which the TP Chandrasekharan case convicted need to be transferred to prisons outside the state as demanded by the opposition. Opposition leader V D Satheesan said the opposition is talking about criminal activities being undertaken using party connections as a cover. Reminding that it was not the state police but the customs which had arrested Ayankai, the main accused in the case, the opposition leader said that the court itself had remarked that Ayanki had connections with Kodi Suni and Muhammad Shafi, convicts in the TPmurder case and Akash Thillenkeri, an accused in the Youth Congress activist S P Shuhaib’s murder. The opposition leader said the chief minister has made it a habit to personally demean the opposition leaders who are raising the matters inside the assembly, and said it is not the right way in a democratic set up. The opposition staged a walkout after speaker M B Rajesh refused permission for an adjournment motion, based on the explanation by the chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/oppn-govt-slug-it-out-over-smuggling-case/articleshow/84840476.cms||---
---||Delhi||Crime control, law and order to be new Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana’s priorities||NEW DELHI: Focus on core policing for crime control, emphasis on evidence-based investigation and upholding law and order — these are the top priority areas for Rakesh Asthana, a 1984-batch IPS officer who took charge as the new Delhi Police commissioner on Wednesday. “It’s a privilege to head the world’s largest metropolitan force. It will be my endeavour that Delhi Police becomes more approachable and crime is under control. Curbing street crime and encouraging evidence-based investigation will be among our focus areas,” Asthana told TOI. Lauding the force for its past performance and investigations, Asthana said he wished to work as a team and stressed upon continuing the good works in busting cyber crime, terror, narcotics, gun smuggling, etc. He got down to business immediately after taking charge and held his first meeting with officers where he was given a presentation about the force’s functioning. People who know Asthana closely said he was expected to review all crucial ongoing investigations this week itself. Whether it was the Christian Michel or Vijay Mallya cases or the fodder scam, Asaram and Vadodara blasts probe, Asthana is known to closely supervise investigations and insists on evidence-based probe, which ultimately results in conviction. He is known to be a hard taskmaster and a no-nonsense officer who believes in swift action and result-oriented policing. Asthana has a very good record in city policing. He was earlier the police commissioner of Vadodara and Surat. Under him, the diamond capital of India, Surat, became the first city in the country to have high-end, real-time automatic surveillance with facial recognition system, numberplate recognition and vehicle speed violation systems. His investigation into the 1995 Purulia arms drop case successfully established international and domestic links. Asthana investigated the fodder scam-related corruption cases, which resulted in the conviction of former Bihar CM Lalu Prasad Yadav and others. He supervised the probe into the 2002 burning of Sabarmati Express at Godhra railway station. His investigation as DIG (CID) was upheld by the Supreme Court-appointed SIT and led to awarding of death sentence and life imprisonments. He also headed the probe in the 2008 serial bombings in Ahmedabad and Vadodara. His teams saved many lives by defusing bombs in Surat. He also supervised the investigation in the sexual assault case lodged against Asaram’s son, Narain Swami. In 2017, while posted in CBI as additional director, he supervised probes into high-profile cases, including the AgustaWestland chopper scandal and Mallya’s multi-billion dollar loan default. He played a crucial role in the extradition of Agusta middleman Christian Michel from Dubai. Detection of crime and strong preventive measures not only reduced the crime burden, but also ensured a feeling of safety and security, particularly among women and vulnerable groups, said Asthana. He emphasised on team work and responsibility to achieve the goal of making Delhi Police one of the best metropolitan forces in the world. Asthana is the third IPS officer who has been appointed Delhi Police commissioner on inter-cadre deputation. Earlier, Ajay Raj Sharma from UP cadre had headed the force. Prior to that, SS Jog was brought in from Maharashtra to head the force in 1984. Before this, Asthana was director general of Border Security Force and Narcotics Control Bureau. He has previously held the positions of special director in CBI and director general of Bureau of Civil Aviation Security.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/crime-control-law-and-order-to-be-new-top-cops-priorities/articleshow/84840388.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Lucknow||Groundbreaking for Aligarh node of defence corridor in August||LUCKNOW: Ahead of the 2022 assembly polls, the government is planning to kick off key infrastructure projects, starting with the all-important defence corridor. Ground breaking for three defence corridor nodes will take place within the next six months, starting with Aligarh in August, Kanpur by October and Jhansi by January. The announcement was made at the inaugural session of the four-day long indigenization on defence and aerospace seminar, where chief minister Yogi Adityanath was the chief guest. The CM said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is likely to perform the groundbreaking for the Aligarh node, and defence minister Rajnath Singh were monitoring the work on the defence corridor. The seminar has been organised by the Society of Indian Defence Manufactures in collaboration with CII and the UP Expressways Industrial Development Authority. “The UP defence corridor is a greenfield project and even those MSMEs and start-ups which are not directly related with defence and aerospace can benefit immensely by it. UP has the highest number of MSMEs with more than three crore people involved in them,” he said. The CM spoke about the defence and aerospace policy implemented by the government which is providing crucial subsidies and benefits to investors. The government has already acquired 1,500 hectare land for the six nodes and the CM has directed officials to acquire more in nodes where demand is high. “We acquired 74 hectare land in Aligarh which has been fully distributed to 19 units. An investment of Rs 1,500 crore is possible through these. During Defence Expo in 2020, 23 investors signed MoUs worth Rs 50,000 crore,” the CM said. The UP government has signed an MoU with the Navy through the UP Expressway Industrial Development Authority for establishing a centre for excellence at BHU and IIT Kanpur. It has also worked with the defence ministry to establish labs under common facility centres for defence testing and infrastructure . Jayant Patil, president of SIDM, spoke about reforms in the defence sector which, he said, are focused on building capacity. Talking about the importance of the sector and the opportunities it was offering, he said: “This is evident through the 15% increase in defence budget allocation. Two-thirds of the budget is dedicated for purchases from Indian industries, of which 20% has been reserved for MSMEs. Other than this, 208 items have been moved to the positive list which means that these items cannot be imported.” Highlighting the work done by his government to create an investment conducive environment in the state, the CM spoke about the 20 sector specific policies to promote investment in various sectors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/groundbreaking-for-aligarh-node-of-def-corridor-in-aug/articleshow/84842619.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||GUVNL raises fuel surcharge||AHMEDABAD: The consumers of Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL) will have to shell out a little more for the electricity they use. The state-run power utility has increased the Fuel Price and Power Purchase Adjustment (FPPPA) or fuel surcharge by 10 paise per unit. GUVNL has worked out a fuel surcharge of Rs 1.90 per unit for the April-June quarter of the current fiscal. It will be recovered from the consumers in the subsequent quarter of July-September, GUVNL said in a communication dated July 27. The power company had levied fuel surcharge at the rate of Rs 1.80 per unit in April-June 2021. A power distribution company (discom) levies FPPPA or fuel surcharge on consumers to offset any variations in fuel (coal and gas) costs. All the four power distribution companies affiliated to GUVNL have been asked to charge the fuel surcharge of Rs 1.90 per unit for the period from July to September 2021 till further communication. This fuel surcharge will be levied on all categories of consumers, excluding agriculture consumers as the state government provides subsidy to discoms for the consumption of electricity in the agriculture sector. “The increase in the fuel surcharge will put a burden of Rs 88 crore per month on consumers of GUVNL,” said K K Bajaj, a city-based energy and regulatory expert. “The cheaper power procured through wind energy projects, energy exchanges and short-term power purchase agreement (PPA) helped GUVNL reduce the cost of power,” Bajaj said. “Otherwise, the fuel surcharge had gone above Rs 2.50 per unit.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guvnl-raises-fuel-surcharge/articleshow/84840422.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Like Aurangabad, cancel class XI centralized admission procedure for Nagpur too: Academics||NAGPUR: A pan Maharashtra school trusts’ association has written to education minister Varsha Gaikwad and demanded that Centralized Admission Procedure (CAP) for Std XI be scrapped as thousands of seats go vacant anyway. The immediate reason for the letter being written now is that the state education department has cancelled CAP for Aurangabad. Maharashtra Rajya Shikshan Sanstha Mahamandal (MRSSM) feels it should be implemented in Nagpur too. Ravindra Fadnavis, executive member of MRSSM, said that having a CAP for Nagpur does not make sense. “On an average, about 17,000 Std XI seats remain vacant every year, so it’s absolutely clear that we have an over supply of seats. Now, logically CAP is used when there is a shortage of seats. Colleges want that only the top academic students get admissions. So, this entire process of CAP, deploying so much manpower and spending money on the system, is not needed,” said Fadnavis. He added that even though the education department did not get into details of why the Aurangabad CAP was cancelled, the reason he claimed was ‘obvious’. “The education department at local level sent the recommendation to the state department, which was approved. But it was a strong local political leadership which lobbied with the district’s education department. The decision is a practical one but even for that you need some strong political support,” said Fadnavis. Another issue which MRSSM has raised is about the proposed CET for Std XI. “The education department is planning to conduct CET on August 21. How many hoops do student have to go jump to apply for admission to colleges? Even though CET is not mandatory, it has been made clear that such students will be given priority in admissions. So, now we are literally forcing students to appear for a CET based on which they will then go through CAP and then secure admission in a college where seats are anyway lying vacant. This is beyond any logic. Hence, we strongly feel that CAP must be scrapped,” Fadnavis added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/like-aurangabad-cancel-std-xi-cap-for-nagpur-too-academics/articleshow/84840466.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Kolkata||Brilliant kids may suffer for ‘reference yr’: CBSE principals||Kolkata: CBSE schools are tense that many of their good students may fall short of expectations and score less than what they might have had they written the Class XII board exam. The institutes on Monday completed submission of marks for the computation of final scores of Class XII students. At every school, marks of a bunch of students, who had initially made it to the 96%-100% bracket, had to be “pushed down” to keep within the reference year as CBSE strictly monitored those entries. The board told principals to be careful not to put more kids in the 96%-100% bracket than the number that had been in that category in the reference year. Those in the lower brackets were unlikely to suffer heavily, principals said. The board fixed a “limit”, which was the reference year, based on the best performance of the school recently. Principals said this was done to control marks inflation, but quite a few in each school would suffer. In a CBSE school in Kolkata, at least 15 students was initially placed in the top bracket but the number was changed to two. “We have a good batch this year but they will suffer. We have to accept this,” said the principal.  “Many brilliant children will suffer this time because of the reference year rule, which gives a lot of importance to the school’s average in a particular year,” said Rita Chatterjee, director of North Point Senior Secondary Boarding School. The bulk will benefit, principals felt. “Our school mean is 85%-plus and I would be more interested in finding out whether that mean has been maintained or not,” said Mukta Nain, director of Birla High Schools. New schools will suffer more, principals felt. In such schools, the average improves every year. Brilliant performers this year will be at a disadvantage. “Quite a few children will suffer. Our average is going up each year,” said principal of Indus Valley School Amita Prasad. Candidates are worried, too. “Had there been admission tests, chances were better. Now all depend on how high we score,” said Ishaan Nandi, a XII student at Birla High School.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/brilliant-kids-may-suffer-for-reference-yr-cbse-principals/articleshow/84840416.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||India||Florence Nightingales of armed forces to get service parity and dignity||NEW DELHI: The all women Military Nursing Services (MNS) of armed forces are poised to get back some parity of service with other regular Army personnel, in terms of rank and dignity even while they continue to don their beige coloured uniform, a high-level defence committee has recommended in its report submitted to the Supreme Court. The Ladies with Lamps, or the Florence Nightingales of the Indian Army, appear to have won a battle for their dignity and pride after waging a frustrating battle in the SC for the last six years, which was more marked with adjournments than any meaningful hearing. The SC had on March 29, 2017 directed the three service chiefs to consider the grievances of MNS personnel alleging discriminattion on at least 13 grounds that included discontinuation of arms training, change in uniform (from military green to beige safari suits), stripping of stars and flags from vehicles and verbal instructions to regular Army personnel to stop saluting MNS officers among others. Pursuant to the order, the defence ministry had set up a large committee of senior defence personnel headed by Lt Gen I S Ghuman, which recommended that MNS be accepted as part of the regular Army and repeal of MNS Ordinance of 1943 along with MNS Rules of 1944. It had also recommended that MNS cadre could be imparted weapon training as a means of self defence. However, it rejected their plea for change of their uniform from beige safari suits back to olive green military uniform. Another grievance about regular Army cadres not saluting even high ranking MNS officers was also resolved in favour of MNS by the committee. But, it rejected the MNS officers' demand for getting assigned 'buddies' like regular Army officers. After considering the recommendations, the chairman of the chief of staff committee approved some recommendations of the Ghuman Committee report, modified some others and rejected a few. As against the recommendation for making them part of the regular Army, the COSC said, "Making MNS part of a separate MNS Act would mitigate the perceived grievances as also confer service privileges as given in Chapter V of the Army Act." However, the COSC overturned the Ghuman Committee recommendation for giving weapon training to MNS cadres for the purpose of self-defence as they work in battle fields and insurgency affected areas to treat wounded soldiers. The COSC said, "Weapon training for MNS officers is not recommended as they are not authorised (to handle) weapons." In an important benefit for retired MNS personnel, the COSC agreed that they should be treated as ex-servicemen and get benefits. However, on the demand of MNS officers for parity in ranks with regular Army officers, the COSC recommended, "There is no rank equivalence between regular Army officers and MNS officers being distinct classes and separate cadres." The grievance of the MNS officers that junior rank officers of regular Army do not salute them remained half resolved. The COSC recommended immediate issuance of orders for saluting by JCOs/ORs to MNS officers but deferred a decision "on saluting by junior officers/regular officers to MNS officers senior in rank." MNS officers will also be not entitled to 'buddies' like the regular Army officers, the COSC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/florence-nightingales-of-armed-forces-to-get-service-parity-and-dignity/articleshow/84845264.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||Hyderabad||‘Stop Dalit Bandhu scheme till bypoll’||Hyderabad: Forum for Good Governance has sent a representation to Chief Election Commissioner of India requesting him to direct the Telangana state government to postpone the Dalit Bandhu programme in the Huzurabad Assembly constituency till the by-election is over. FGG secretary M Padmanabha Reddy said: “Due to various reasons, the by election has become a prestige issue for the ruling party. There is a general feeling that the result of this by-election will have impact on next assembly elections.” A week ago, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao announced a new scheme called Dalita Bandhu. Reddy added: “As part of the scheme, 100 Dalit families in every Assembly constituency will be given Rs 10 lakh cash for their upliftment. In all, Rs 10 crores will be spent on this per Assembly Constituency, Rs 1,190 crore for entire state the of Telangana. The chief minister said he will extend the scheme to 10,000 families in Huzurabad by spending Rs 1,000 crore. The state government, with its meagre resources, cannot implement these schemes announced in entire state. While the schemes are good, the intention of introducing the scheme just before by-elections is questionable.” The FGG secretary went on to say, “The ECI has to take serious note of the CM’s announcement and realise that the scheme is being introduced for electoral gains. This is against the spirit of the constitution. Additionally, no guidelines have been announced regarding the selection of beneficiaries so far, and the purpose for which the amount to be spent is yet to be worked out.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/stop-dalit-bandhu-scheme-till-bypoll/articleshow/84842696.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Set up Lonar devp authority in 2 weeks: HC to govt||Nagpur: In some good news for the Lonar crater lake in Buldhana district, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday directed the Maharashtra government to set up ‘Lonar Development Authority’ within two weeks. A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor asked the government to issue a resolution (GR) to constitute the body that would be headed by the Amravati divisional commissioner. It was further told to include names of senior counsel Chandrashekhar Kaptan, who is already a member of HC-appointed committee, and petitioner’s counsel Anand Parchure, both of whom are assisting the court in saving the historic lake believed to have formed about 50,000 years ago due to a meteorite impact. Both Kaptan and Parchure declined to take remuneration when justice Kilor asked about their fees. The HC then asked the government to arrange their lodging, boarding, and travelling arrangements whenever they visit the site. The commissioner was told to select two NGOs that would be part of the authority. The directives came while hearing a plea (No 4549/2009) by lawyer Kirti Nipankar along with Govind Khekale and Sudhakar Bugdane from Buldhana contending that Lonar lake was slowly degrading because of pollution and silting. Earlier, the judges rejected the government’s suggestion of having a three-tier system to ensure lake’s development where one panel would work on state-level while other two on the local. On the other hand, suggestions given by Kaptan, Parchure and Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) counsel Ravi Sanyal were in-principally accepted. All three lawyers had in the past demanded development authority for the lake on the lines of Shegaon temple.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/set-up-lonar-devp-authority-in-2-weeks-hc-to-govt/articleshow/84840573.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The three tiger reserves in UP — Pilibhit, Dudhwa and Amangarh — make the state a potential ground for thriving ecotourism. Protected areas in the state also have a fleeting population of tigers who cross over from neighbouring Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh. “UP has tremendous potential to attract tourists in tiger reserves in the Terai belt as it is well-connected by road and the train network. The area has a healthy tiger population which is growing over years,” said secretary, finance, and nature enthusiast and photographer Sanjay Kumar. The 2018 tiger census had projected around 173 tigers in UP which was a remarkable increase of about 48% against the national average of 33% from the previous census held in 2014 which counted around 117 tigers in UP. Ecotourism, however, is still in a fledgling stage in UP. On the occasion of the International Tiger Day, it is worth mentioning the steps the department of environment, forest and climate change (EFCC) is taking in the direction. Additional chief secretary, EFCC, Manoj Singh said, “We are in the process of developing ecotourism circuits in the state. Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) and Dudhwa Tiger Reserve may be developed as one circuit. Tiger sightings are very good in Pilibhit, while Dudhwa has its own unique landscape.” PTR in November 2020 was awarded the coveted TX2 Award for doubling the number of tigers in four years against the target of 10. PTR was the first reserve to receive the award among 13 tiger range countries. The reserve had 25 tigers in 2014 and the number increased to 65 in 2018. With the award it also won international recognition. The forest department has made UP Forest Corporation (UPFC) a nodal agency for ecotourism promotion and development in tiger reserves, national parks and wildlife sanctuaries. “The forest corporation has definitely worked in the direction. There is enough infrastructure within the tiger reserves. What we are trying to do is to bring in private entrepreneurs to improve the boarding and lodging facilities outside the reserves,” said PCCF (wildlife) and chief wildlife warden, UP, PK Sharma. The existing infrastructure at PTR has been improved recently. The tourism department along with UPFC has launched compact tour packages for ecotourists from Lucknow to Dudhwa and Lakhimpur Kheri. General manager, UPFC, Eva Sharma said, “It is one of the most recent efforts we took to boost ecotourism in the state. The idea is to provide a hassle-free trip.” The taxi service is offered by empanelled tour operators. Allowing homestays in Dudhwa, Pilibhit, Katarniaghat and Suhelwa is another initiative that the government took in 2019. The initiative allows ecotourists to stay with Tharus and other locals in their home after paying charges. “The tiger reserves of Dudhwa, Kishanpur, Pilibhit and Katerniaghat are home to unique species like one-horned rhinoceros, swamp deer, sloth bear, Asiatic elephants and around 550 species of birds. We need to project these incredibly beautiful reserves to the world and simultaneously encourage investments by private entrepreneurs in the form of good and earthy resorts and homestays, which will attract nature lovers and increase employment opportunities and income levels of the local population,” said Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/tiger-reserves-in-up-could-soon-be-a-delight-for-ecotourists/articleshow/84842698.cms||Neha Shukla

Of them, 980 people were prosecuted at various traffic nakas. While total 816 vehicles were checked across the city between 9pm and 10pm on Tuesday, around 508 vehicles reportedly flouted the IPC sections 188 and 200. Cops checked another 756 vehicles between 10pm and 11pm and found that 472 vehicles violated the rules. “We have asked traffic guards to ensure that all the violations registered under IPC 188 and IPC 200 are reported to local police stations, from where they will be forwarded to the courts,” said DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha. The huge number of violations during restrictions at night — now not only on weekends but also on weekdays, despite a severe crackdown by Kolkata Police — led Lalbazar to plan some new measures to “discipline” the citizens. The number of nakas, manned by both traffic police and cops from local police stations, will now go up and Lalbazar has asked all senior officers to hit the roads.  Cops have also decided to inform the excise department about any possible violation in excise rules that they come across during the raids. “If required, we will propose a joint raid,” said an officer at Lalbazar. Last week, the number of prosecutions were around 520.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/1k-booked-for-curb-flouting-on-a-weekday/articleshow/84837950.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

If the trend continues like this then the weekly total of cases (week ending Sunday) could rise for the first time since the peak of the second wave. The rise is mainly because of a big surge in Kerala, which continued to account for over 50% of India’s new cases for the second straight day. Covid cases in July didn’t follow the trend of drastic fall that happened in May and June.

Replying to a question, he said the matter was discussed with the chief justice of the high court and the advocate general, and they have agreed, in principle. If necessary, existing rules and acts will be strengthened to ensure justice for victims, he added. The government will include awareness against dowry in the school curriculum and take stern action against policemen if there are lapses on their part when women file complaints. The society should decide that it won’t accept or offer dowry and change its perception towards divorcees, said the chief minister. Vijayan said governor Arif Mohammed Khan’s protest against dowry was meant for creating awareness through Gandhian method. There is an attempt to spread misleading information despite the governor making his stand clear. He said that torture in the name of dowry is defaming state and there needs to be a huge awareness against this. The CM said 100 deaths and suicides were due to torture over dowry from 2011 to 2016 and 54 from 2016 to 2021. There were six such deaths each in 2020 and 2021 in state, he said. On minority issue: A section led by Sangh Parivar is trying to spread false propaganda that Muslim community are the beneficiaries of ineligible benefits from the government. All religious sections are focussing on secularism and society should be cautious about such propaganda being spread for communal interests. Vijayan said the government will examine allegations about the number of members in Madrassa teachers’ welfare board. He said that there are 23,809 beneficiaries under the board. Children and cyber world: Family members and parents should keep an eye on children while they are using digital devices. CM said that service providers can put curbs on undesirable contents, including dangerous online games, and government is in discussions with service providers in this regard. Vijayan said it has come to thegovernment’s notice that websites including darknet are exploiting children sexually and mentally. Agencies like Cyberdome are observing such matters. Many aren’t ready to file complaints against cybercrimes; this will only lead to rise in such crimes, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/special-courts-to-try-cases-of-atrocities-against-women-cm/articleshow/84840574.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Home-bound commuters suffer as buses go off roads in late afternoon||KOLKATA: Home-bound commuters find it difficult to get a bus to return home and they have to spend more on other modes of transport. Buses are going off roads because they cannot make a full trip before 9pm. The government has been strictly enforcing the night curbs after 9pm and buses are often being seized by the enforcing authorities for violating it. A bus needs around 3.5-4 hours to complete a round trip in the city. Since they cannot complete a trip and run the risk of landing in trouble for being on the road after 9pm, most of the operators withdraw buses from various routes, leaving commuters stranded for hours. TimesViewThis is a serious issue. It is not unexpected in a crisis situation but all stakeholders should come together and address this on a priority basis.Almost 90% of private buses go off the roads in the late afternoon, admitted the bus operators. The hapless commuters have to opt for alternative modes of transport, which burns a hole in their pockets — they have to change several autos or take cabs or hire mini trucks jointly to reach their destinations. “Nowadays, returning home is a nightmare for many people like me as buses disappear from the road. We have no other option than paying through our noses to return home,” said Anil Patabardhan, who travels to his home at Behala all the way from his office at Park Circus. “No operator runs the risk of getting penalised for plying bus on road after 9pm. That is why, buses go off the roads without completing the routes. Besides, the bus crew — driver, conductor and cleaner — also go back home by buses. They park the buses early in garages to catch buses to return home,” said Titu Saha, general secretary of City Suburban Bus Service. “Earlier, we had a great inconvenience as buses were fewer. But now buses are plenty during the morning peak hours, but in the evening, the city roads are ruled by autos, mini trucks and other vehicles as buses disappear from roads. Even if you find a bus run by one of state transport undertakings (STUs), it is so jam-packed that you cannot find a toehold,” said Mukti Chandra, who will retire next year and repents her extra expenditure on conveyance. The city commuters mostly depend on private buses. Nearly 5,000 buses in the city ferry maximum passengers. If the private buses stay off the roads, the public transport system gets crippled. What makes the situation worse is that the suburban train services are yet to resume. “Trains and buses are complementary to each other. We feed passengers to the railway, railway feeds passengers to us. If one is off, the other suffers,” said Tapan Banerjee, general secretary, joint council of bus syndicates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/home-bound-commuters-suffer-as-buses-go-off-roads-in-late-afternoon/articleshow/84837983.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The accused procured building materials on credit, claiming to have got a contract to build a hospital, and defaulted on the payment. According to police, Mayur Vasoya (30), a resident of Vimal Nagar on University Road in Rajkot, lodged a complaint against Luhar and other unidentified persons for cheating him to the tune of Rs 30 lakh. “Few days back my uncle Ramesh Vasoya received a call from a man identifying himself as Dr Kalaria who said that they had received huge funds from Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) for setting up a hospital and they are purchasing construction materials like iron pipes, steel roofing sheets. My uncle asked him to contact me and later Luhar called me. He placed two orders — Rs 15 lakh worth iron pipes and Rs 15 lakh steel sheets,” Mayur Vasoya said in his police complaint. “As per their request, we dispatched the iron pipes to Sanand near Ahmedabad and steel roofing sheets to Maliyasan village near Rajkot on 23 July. Two days after delivering the materials, I called Luhar after which he sent a cheque to me. However, when I deposited the cheque in the bank it bounced and since then his mobile number has been switched off,” Vasoya added. Police said that accused Luhar used to make WhatsApp calls to Vasoya. Moreover, when inquired in Maliyasan village, it was revealed that the accused had rented a godown for just one day and they shifted the steel roofing sheets immediately after receiving the delivery. Police suspect the involvement of an organized gang behind the cheating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rajkot-trader-duped-of-rs-30-lakh/articleshow/84836027.cms||---
---||Delhi||Another invasive Mexican tree species enters city’s lungs||New Delhi: While the focus may be on removing Vilayati Kikar—a Mexican invasive species—from Delhi’s green areas, another invasive Mexican plant has escaped attention. Subabul, which grows fast and survives in harsh conditions, is thriving in parts of the capital. Faiyaz Khudsar, scientist-in-charge at Yamuna Biodiversity Park, says while it is not as invasive as Vilayati Kikar, the tree can grow quickly and take space over from native tree species around it. “It is growing in numbers and its seeds are dropped in all sorts of locations across the city by birds. If the area becomes densely populated, it can become a problem, as it will not allow native species to grow there,” said Khudsar. While the tree was introduced for fuel and fodder purposes initially, it is becoming a problem in certain areas, Khudsar added. Residents of Defence Colony have also been trying to get Subabul (Leucaena leucocephala) species removed from a 1.4km-long Central Park in the area. Subabul saplings have suddenly grown here in large numbers and locals say these should be eliminated before it gets too late. Rajeev Suri, who approached the south corporation recently, says once they are fully grown, it would be difficult to remove them as permissions will be required under Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994. “The saplings should be eliminated at the earliest. We have noticed recently that after some trees were pruned in the park, Subabul seeds, which might have been dormant in the soil, have started germinating and are quickly growing.” Suri says while he has managed to remove a few, it is difficult for locals to do it alone across the 1.4km area. “Subabul will completely destroy the ecosystem in the area and other species will not be able to flourish,” he adds. Pradip Krishen, environmentalist and author of Trees of Delhi, has also observed an increase in Subabul trees across Delhi’s central ridge over the past few years. Its growth, if left unchecked, could be detrimental to the area, he warned. Krishen says the tree grows in tough condition and can also propagate readily. The species was chosen for its farm-forestry utility in 1970. However, experts soon realised its invasive nature. Its leaves can also be toxic for cattle, if consumed in large quantities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/another-invasive-mexican-tree-species-enters-citys-lungs/articleshow/84840594.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The heaps of garbage accumulating along the ghat and on the approach road had been raising a stink and commuters were upset about the illegal dumping. Besides lifting garbage, the administration has also appointed teams to intensify round-the-clock vigil in the ghat to prevent further dumping. The ghat begins after Katraj and ends on the other side of the hill on the Pune-Kolhapur national highway. Shivapur resident Aba Ghule, who often travels to Katraj to deliver vegetables, said that the entire ghat section was full of garbage dumped on both sides of the road. The garbage was also causing obstruction to vehicular movement. Now, the administration should ensure that the garbage is not dumped here again, he said. A PMC official said that the garbage lifting started at the beginning of this month after three villages, located along the ghat section, were merged in the civic limits. “It was observed that a large quantity of garbage was being dumped by the residents of Bhilarwadi, Mangdewadi and Gujar-Nimbalkarwadi, which are located along the ghat. We held meetings with residents to stop the practice of dumping garbage in the ghat,” the official added. In the last three weeks, the administration imposed fines on 83 offenders, who were caught dumping garbage in the section. Pradnya Potdar, head of Dhankawadi-Sahakarnagar civic ward, said, “A drive has been initiated to clean the ghat section. We have cleared the garbage from almost all chronic spots in the ghat. Now, to restrict the dumping we have appointed teams that are working in day and night shifts because garbage was being dumped at night.

The wind augmentation and purifying unit (WAYU) will have activated charcoal and ultraviolet lamp to purify the air like a scrubber. The city corporation, in association with Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, will roll out the Rs 180-crore air and water pollution mitigation programme. The civic body has also planned to install ambient air quality monitoring systems (AAQMS) in 50 locations in the city. The system would calculate the level of air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, SOx, NOx and carbon monoxide and display it on digital boards. According to a concept note prepared by the corporation, these systems consume less than one unit of electricity for 10 hours of operation. The data on levels of air pollutants at traffic junctions will be used to plan projects like flyovers, an official said. Eventually, the corporation plans to impose a toll on private vehicles entering congested areas such as T Nagar and encourage people to use public transport, the official added. Pollution details would also be incorporated in a Google map-like application which would help citizens decide if they want to pick a different route with lesser pollution levels, the official said. Senior corporation officials said that the first step to mitigating air pollution was to provide data to citizens about the quality of air. “Those travelling in the city will be able to view the figures and identify where air pollution is high,” said S Rajendiran, chief engineer (roads and bridges) and in-charge of the special projects division that is handling this proposal. The TNPCB funds would also be used to create cycle tracks on major roads and 10 kilo-litre-a-day sewage treatment plants in 100 parks across the city. With these treatment plants, sewage from the local areas would be treated and used for watering plants, officials said. A report released by Chennai-based Healthy Energy Initiative India and Coastal Resource Centre, public health and environment advocacy groups had on Monday indicated how the city’s air has toxic metals in many locations that were sampled. The report urged Tamil Nadu government bodies such as the corporation to conduct regular monitoring of industrial emissions and impose stringent regulations on industries violating emission norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/purifier-that-can-clean-air-up-to-60-to-come-up-at-20-city-traffic-signals/articleshow/84840680.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar

Replying to a calling attention motion by MLA Anwar Sadath on the illegal dumping of waste in public by agencies that have taken a contract for waste removal, Raju said the government is also considering amending the rules for giving separate colour for such vehicles. He said that dumping waste in public places is creating serious health and environmental issues. He said that there are sections in the MV Act, 1988, to take action against such vehicles. As per Section 190 (2), any person who drives or causes or allows to be driven, in any public place a motor vehicle, which violates the standards prescribed in relation to road safety, control of noise and air-pollution, shall be punishable for the first offence with a fine of Rs 1,000 and for any second or subsequent offence with a fine of Rs 2,000. The minister said that there are also provisions for suspending the licence of such vehicles. Raju said that though the permits for goods carriage are provided under Section 79 of the Act, it does not specifically talk about vehicles carrying waste. Earlier, Sadath said that when such illegal dumping of waste materials was questioned, those involved in such activities were behaving like goons. He demanded that the licence and permits of contract vehicles used for such activities should be annulled and action should be taken against those involved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/waste-removal-govt-may-amend-motor-vehicle-rules/articleshow/84840698.cms||---

The four suspects included — former PCB member Vivek Yadav, Rajan Rajmani and Ibrahim alias Hussain Yakub Shaikh, all criminals on police records and an unidentified man. On July 21, the police had arrested Yadav from a location on the Rajasthan-Gujarat border in connection with an alleged plot to kill a rival by hiring contract killers. On July 14, the police had arrested Rajmani and Shaikh and recovered three country-made pistols and three magazines and rounds from them. Yadav, who represented the BJP in the PCB’s elected body that was dissolved over six months ago, had been on the run ever since. “During questioning, Rajmani and Shaikh told the police that Yadav had given them Rs3 lakh to kill a criminal on police records Vishnu Gawli alias Babliya because he had shot at him with a country-made pistol at a Ganapati immersion procession near Qureshi masjid in Camp in 2016,” senior inspector Sardar Patil said. Patil said Yadav had seven cases registered against him with various police stations. “The questioning revealed that Yadav, Rajmani and Shaikh were active members of an organised crime syndicate,” he said. “I had initiated a proposal to prosecute Yadav and the others under the MCOCA. Additional commissioner of police Namdeo Chavan considered the proposal and accorded sanction to prosecute the trio under the MCOCA,” he added. The investigation was transferred to assistant commissioner of police (Wanowrie division) Rajendra Galande under the MCOCA to take action. Meanwhile, Yadav was remanded to judicial custody and sent to temporary jail in Yerawada after he was produced before the special court on Wednesday. The police have reserved its right to seek Yadav and his accomplices’ police custody remand under the MCOCA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ex-pcb-member-3-others-booked-under-mcoca/articleshow/84839916.cms||---

Over the years, caves, stone beds, inscriptions, and more than 100 sculptures relted to Jainism have been found in and around Madurai. Pandiya Nadu Cultural Foundation led by archaeologist D Muneeswaran, who studied the statue, said it was spotted by Radhakrishnan, a farmer from the nearby Kavasakotai village, when he went looking for agricultural land."The idol is three-foot tall and two-foot wide. It has Mahaveer sitting in meditation on a throne, with two servants (without head as the stone was damaged) holding fans on either side. The throne is on three lion-like structures that are not clear, being eroded over centuries," said Muneeswaran. Officials from the Madurai museum were informed about the idol found at Velambur and the officials had assured to take over the idol along with revenue department officials.With no inscriptions to give further details the age of the idol was ascertained after consulting with archaeological expert C Santhalingam. The idol was also compared with a similar Mahaveer idol found at Kavasakotai village, a little more than two kilometres from Velambur.The previous idol was found at Chenga-medu area in Kavasakotai in May 2020. There are proofs of Jainism flourishing in that village and that it could have been a school for Jainism or to spread their ideologies, Muneeswaran said. More than a decade ago another idol had been found at Karaikeni. All three villages are only a couple of kilometres apart, and experts believe there is scope of finding more Mahaveer idols and Jain monuments in and around T Kallupatti area. The decline of Jainism had begun in the seventh century. Keelakuyilkudi in Madurai has some well-preserved Jain beds. Keelavalavu near Melur is another place where Jain monuments are found.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/1000-year-old-mahaveer-statue-gives-glimpse-of-jain-culture/articleshow/84622536.cms||M K Ananth

He requested the Centre to revive talks of the bank’s possible merger with Bank of Maharashtra.When approached by TOI, a Bank of Maharashtra official declined to comment on Bapat’s speech. A source familiar with the issue said talks between the banks went on till 2018, when the Bank of Maharashtra was scheduled to take over Rupee Bank’s assets and liabilities under a scheme formulated by the RBI. However, the talks cooled after that. Rupee Bank is currently awaiting clearance from the RBI to merge with the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSCB), which is largely involved in agricultural banking, rather than retail.“Bapat’s speech sparks hope of some resolution to the situation of the bank. If the Centre or the RBI decides to revive Rupee Bank’s merger with Bank of Maharashtra, we are ready to take the necessary steps,” said Sudhir Pandit, the administrator of Rupee Bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rupee-bank-admins-express-merger-hope-after-bapats-parliament-speech/articleshow/84839907.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Pune||Criminal & aide arrested for attempt to murder||Pune: The Pimpri Chinchwad police on Wednesday arrested a criminal on police records, as well as his aide, and booked seven others on the charge of attempt to kill a suspended police constable in Dighi on previous night to exact revenge for the criminal’s arrest in a body offence case. Constable Parameshwar Sonke (41) of Dighi was attached to the Chandanagar police station. He suffered injuries to his right knee in the incident. The suspects also damaged Sonke’s car by pelting stones at it. “We have arrested the criminal, Aniket Vani (21), and his aide Suraj Khilare (20) under Section 307 (attempt to murder) and the other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code,” inspector Mohan Shinde of the Dighi police told TOI. “Around 8pm on Tuesday, Sonke, who was out for some work, noticed that a gang of youths had parked their motorcycles in the middle of the road near Mamta Chowk in Dighi and were creating a ruckus. Sonke then asked them to clear the road, following which the youths and Sonke had an argument,” Shinde said. After Sonke left the spot, the suspects chased him on their bikes and forced him to stop his vehicle near the Dighi octroi post. “The suspects broke the window of Sonke’s car by pelting stones at it. They then threatened Sonke with consequences and fled the scene,” Shinde said. In 2017, when Sonke was attached to the Dighi police station, he had taken action against the suspect. “Angered by Sonke’s action against him, the suspect attacked Sonke to exact a revenge,” an officer from the Pimpri Chinchwad police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/criminal-aide-arrested-for-attempt-to-murder/articleshow/84839954.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Stolen items returned before end of trial||KOLKATA: From yellow taxis to a Royal Enfield motorbike and a Toto electric vehicle to multiple mobile phones, Bidhannagar City Police has enhanced the lost/stolen articles return drive to rightful owners following all legal protocols. A Saturday evening exercise that was first initiated by Kolkata Police to return some 200 odd lost/stolen cellphones every week some four years ago has expanded its periphery further in Bidhannagar by returning larger stolen goods than just mobile phones. When Ripan Mistry received a call from Bidhannagar Police last week, asking him to collect his stolen Royal Enfield motorbike, he couldn’t believe his ears. He knew that cops had recovered his stolen bike and had arrested the thieves but he was pleasantly surprised to learn it would be returned to him at such a short notice. “My friends had told me it would take years to get the bike and I used to wonder if it would at all be in rideable condition by that time. My bike was stolen on July 8 and within four days, cops had arrested the thieves. I was returned my bike keys last Saturday by Lake Town police station officers and on Wednesday, I got relevant papers from a Salt Lake court,” said Mistry, a Dum Dum resident. Similar was the experience of Nagerbazar resident Bimal Pal (65), who was beaten up and left gagged by two “passengers” who looted him and stole his electric vehicle on July 11. “My father is still in trauma. But the cops were extremely efficient in not only arresting the criminals but also recovering our vehicle. More so, they returned the vehicle to us within a week,” said Pal’s son Subhadeep. Taxi driver Md Sagir didn’t even had to wait for a week to get his taxi back after it was snatched by three men on a desolate stretch of Bangur Avenue on May this year. “Three men had boarded my taxi from NRS hospital. When we reached Bangur Avenue, one of them said he had to take a leak and asked me to stop the car. When one of them got down, another person strangulated me from behind as the other punched me. They took all my money and the car,” said Sagir (67), a Park Circus resident. Cops tracked down the offenders on the very night of the crime and recovered his car, which was returned to him in two days. A senior officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate said they had decided to return the stolen goods in quick time to reduce people’s hassle during the pandemic. “Some goods are being returned after checking valid credentials and following nod from the senior officials of the commissionerate while in other cases, we are extending all sorts of help to ensure the victims get back the stolen articles maintaining all relevant legal protocol,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/stolen-items-returned-before-end-of-trial/articleshow/84838130.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Swaraj, who had won from the constituency earlier, has alleged in the petition that Babu canvassed votes in the name of Lord Ayyappa and thereby violated the election code of conduct. It is alleged that Babu and other Congress leaders campaigned on March 30 by urging Hindu voters to defeat Swaraj as he spoke against Lord Ayyappa.

The airport had two kiosks outside the terminal till now, one of which (the one opposite the international arrival gate 3C) was out of service for around a year and another one opposite gate 2A/B. “We had got the relevant permission from the airport authorities earlier but with few flights operating from the airport, the load could be managed with just one pre-paid taxi kiosk. However, since the start of this month, the number of incoming flights and passengers have increased exponentially, putting pressure on the existing facility and hence the new kiosk was made operational a few days ago,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar City Police’s traffic department. The officer said the other kiosk opposite gate 3C will also be thrown open once regular movement of international flights resume. “The easing of restrictions in Kolkata and allowing flyers with double doses into the city has increased passenger traffic after two difficult months when arrival and departure figures had reduced to a trickle. From less than 6,000 passengers a day in May-end, the number has been on the rise — to 20,000 a day — since the beginning of this month,” said a senior airport official. Along with the new kiosk, cops have also placed large display boards outside the pre-paid kiosks showing the morning and night pre-paid rates depending on the kilometres to multiple destinations in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-airport-gets-new-pre-paid-cab-kiosk-with-rise-in-passenger-count/articleshow/84838133.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Nagpur||Frauds on the rise as banks fail to follow directives; no power to probe: RBI to Bombay high court||NAGPUR: In a revelation, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has clarified that banks all over the country are witnessing increasing incidents of frauds due to their failure to adhere to its directives issued from time to time. In an affidavit submitted to Nagpur bench of Bombay high court, the apex bank further disclosed that it doesn’t have powers to conduct investigations in banking frauds, nor does it have the machinery to do it. The affidavit was filed while hearing a suo motu PIL for Rs25 crore losses caused to UCO Bank. Rajnish Vyas has been appointed as amicus curiae in the PIL. The embezzlement had taken place due to alleged forgery committed by a bank officer at its Wardha and Hinganghat branches. A division bench comprising justices Vinay Deshpande and Amit Borkar adjourned the hearing by six weeks. Filed by RBI’s counsel SN Kumar, the affidavit added that as a regulator of the banking system in the country, it issued ‘Master Circular of Frauds’ to sensitize banks against scams and to have deterrent systems. “In spite of guidelines issued from time to time, it was observed that the frauds perpetrated in banks showed an increasing trend, mainly on account of non-adherence or improper implementation of circular directives issued by us. To enable the banks to have all current instructions at one place, a master circular incorporating all guidelines, instructions and directives on the subject was issued on August 1, 2001,” the affidavit mentioned. Moreover, to enable the Government of India to have required information on frauds, a suitable reporting system was introduced. Though the circular of March 22, 2002, has prescribed the period of reporting of frauds, it was realized that the banks aren’t following it scrupulously, the apex bank said. At the RBI governor’s instance, the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has set up a high-level group to study incidents of frauds and suggest measures to prevent them. “This group observed that banks are not adhering to the time frame stipulated by RBI for reporting fraud cases. It has suggested that suitable penal action should be taken against defaulting banks. The banks are supposed to report frauds within a week of their detection and then a detailed report needs to be submitted in the prescribed format in the next three weeks,” the affidavit said. The top bank added that to minimize incidents of frauds in the banking system, it has been making continuous efforts and regularly issuing circulars directing the banks to initiate appropriate action to contain them. “The Banking Regulation Act doesn’t empower RBI to conduct any investigations. The action may be initiated only after the offence is established by the law enforcement agencies. It’s mandatory for the banks to lodge a complaint of frauds with the police,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/frauds-on-the-rise-as-banks-fail-to-follow-directives-no-power-to-probe-rbi-to-hc/articleshow/84840825.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Kolkata||Med panel order: Lunch-for-seniors penalty for hosp||Kolkata: The West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission (WBCERC) has asked Belle Vue Clinic to organize a lunch for inmates of an old home in its neighbourhood as compensation for the ‘misbehaviour’ of its nurses with an elderly Covid patient. Kasturi Ghosh, the patient, had complained about the behaviour of ‘sisters’ at the hospital, though she demanded no financial compensation. At a hearing on Wednesday, WBCERC chairperson Asim Banerjee ruled that Belle Vue must hold a lunch for the inmates of an old home at AJC Bose Road — Sisters of the Poor — and invite complainant Kasturi Ghosh. “The hospital must also make sure that the nurses in question are also present. They must be made to realize that their behaviour needs to be more humanitarian towards a senior citizen and a Covid patient,” Banerjee said. Belle Vue, on the other hand, denied that they had been penalized for nurses’ behaviour. “In May, when the patient was admitted, our hospital was full of Covid patients and it was difficult to attend to every patient at short intervals. So, there had been a time lapse in attending to her and there was nothing that we could do about it. We accept the ruling, though,” said Belle Vue CEO P Tondon. In another ruling, Health Ward Hospital was asked to pay Rs 50,000 to a philanthropic organization in Durgapur as compensation for a delay in conducting an RT-PCR test leading to an 81-year-old patient’s death. The deceased’ son alleged that even though his father had been treated at the same hospital on a previous occasion, they had no record of his Aadhaar card, which led to a delay in admission and the RT-PCR test. “We have asked the hospital to pay the amount to an organization chosen by the complainant,” said Banerjee. The commission also heard the case of two doctors who alleged negligence in Covid treatment of their elderly parents. While the hospital had claimed that the patient party had a due of Rs 4.9 lakh, the commission awarded a refund of Rs 1.6 lakh to the complainants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/med-panel-order-lunch-for-seniors-penalty-for-hosp/articleshow/84838143.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Police said a hunt was on to nab three of his associates who used to move around in a bike and a scooter and had robbed at least three elderly morning walkers and women returning from local markets over the last two weeks. Md Shaban, a history sheeter involved in multiple incidents of snatching under Kolkata Police jurisdiction, was picked up by New Town police from the Hata Mohalla area in Garden Reach.

---||Hyderabad||Union govt owes Rs 4,000cr to Telangana||Hyderabad: The Centre owes Rs 4,073 crore towards GST compensation to Telangana for 2020-21 and April and May months of 2021-22. Neighbouring Andhra Pradesh has to get Rs 4,052 crore for the same period from the Centre. Minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary said the economic impact of the pandemic had led to a higher compensation requirement due to lower GST collection and also due to lower collection of GST compensation cess. The GST compensation cess levied under the GST Act is transferred into a non-lapsable fund known as GST compensation fund and states are compensated for any loss of revenue arising on account of the implementation of GST for five years out of the compensation fund. The Centre has been paying the compensation to states, including Telangana and AP, from 2017-18 till 2019-20. GST compensation of Rs 2,780 crore has been released to AP to partly meet the compensation payable for the period April 2020 to March 2021 as the amount in the GST compensation fund was not adequate to meet the full compensation requirement. In his recent letter to the Centre, AP chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy sought release of GST compensation for the financial year 2020-21. Chaudhary said the Centre had considered the request and was committed to releasing GST compensation to all the states, including AP, as per the GST Act. “In 2020-21, the Centre had borrowed Rs 1.1 lakh crore under a special window and passed on to the states as back-to-back loan to help them meet the resource gap due to short release of compensation on account of inadequate balance in the compensation fund,” he said. The Centre is borrowing Rs 1.59 lakh crore from the market through a special window in the current financial year and passing it on to the states/Union territories as a back-to-back loan in appropriate tranches as was done in last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/union-govt-owes-rs-4000cr-to-telangana/articleshow/84842946.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Bhuse had received complaints from farmers during his visit three days ago that neither the company’s toll free number is operational nor the company representatives were available. Following this, Bhuse visited the company’s office and found that it was not set up as per the agreement with the government for operating crop insurance scheme. Total 1,72,655 farmers in the district have availed crop insurance, but unrest prevailed when most of them did not receive any response from the company for compensation for the crop losses incurred by them. Collector Pawneet Kaur on Wednesday asked the company to appoint its representatives at district and taluka levels and settle the claims of the affected farmers at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/plaint-registered-in-amravati-against-crop-insurance-co/articleshow/84840991.cms||---

An autonomous institution of the University Grants Commission, the NAAC judges colleges on various parameters of teaching and learning. At present, there are 16 state government colleges affiliated to Agra university. None of these has an NAAC grade. Besides, 39 state government-aided colleges are also affiliated to the varsity. Out of these, only 10 have been graded by the NAAC. With 940 self-finance colleges affiliated to it, Agra university is the largest higher education institute in UP. However, only 10 private colleges have an NAAC grade. In 2018, the state government made it mandatory for all the colleges to apply for NAAC grading. But the orders are yet to be implemented at Agra university. Director, internal quality assurance cell of Agra university, Ajay Taneja said, “Due to the Covid-19 situation, the workshop to motivate colleges for NAAC grading was not conducted. Besides, funds have not been received to prepare colleges for NAAC grading. We have uploaded the varsity’s annual quality assurance report for the 2019-20 session on the NAAC website and it has been accepted. Suitable action will be taken to ensure colleges apply for NAAC inspection.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/in-2-yrs-no-agra-varsity-college-applied-for-naac-grading/articleshow/84829555.cms||Deepak Lavania

The new date of the examination of July 28 postponed following the single bench order would be announced later,” a university source said in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday. A division bench had earlier in the day stayed a single bench’s order cancelling the first and third semester exams being conducted by the university. The division bench led by the Chief Justice said the exams can be held as scheduled earlier. The court also directed that the exams that was scheduled on Wednesday but could not be held due to the single bench’s order should be conducted by issuing a new notification. An appeal filed by the university was considered by the division bench. The university has contended that UGC norms do not state that offline exams should not be held. The single bench had issued the order citing violation of the norms laid down by UGC for conducting exams through online mode. A petition filed by eight students was considered by the single bench. The students had contended that all exams other than that of the final semester were to be conducted online as per the UGC norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ktu-to-go-ahead-with-btech-exams/articleshow/84840916.cms||---

It said the corporation cannot withhold permissions/approvals for further development of the Wadala Truck Terminus land. The Lodha group had won the rights to build iconic towers on the land up to 500 mt tall. After the agreement was signed, it learnt that due to aviation rules there was building height restriction and over six years later, by Dec 2017) was allowed to build up to 132mt instead of 500mt.

Keen to dispel any impression that ex-CM BS Yeddiyurappa would be backseat-driving his government, Bommai categorically said: “I will not be a rubber stamp CM.” While he would seek Yeddiyurappa’s counsel and draw on his expertise, he would work to get the “stamp of approval from the people”. Earlier in the day, Bommai called on Yeddiyurappa at his house and sought his blessing. He later held a one-man cabinet meeting with top officials and announced a slew of schemes. This includes a scholarship programme for farmers’ children at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore. His next big challenge will be to expand his Cabinet. “I’m going to Delhi on Friday to meet the BJP top brass, including PM Modi, and will discuss all issues,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/basavaraj-bommai-sworn-in-as-karnataka-cm-says-he-will-not-be-a-rubber-stamp-cm/articleshow/84845400.cms||Manu Aiyappa
---||Hyderabad||Telangana got least GST compensation than other southern states||HYDERABAD: Under the Centre’s special borrowing scheme, Telangana received the lowest Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation, Rs 2,197 crore, than other southern states. Facing fund crunch to provide GST compensation to states during Covid-19, the Centre had pooled funds from its own resources to compensate the states. The Centre had borrowed over Rs 1 lakh crore to help states reeling under revenue loss due to the economic slowdown and the pandemic and fill shortfall in payment of GST compensation. Exclusive data with TOI on fund release to states (as of March 21) under the special borrowing scheme reveals that Telangana had received less compensation among the country’s large states. Meghalaya (Rs 112 crore), Goa (Rs 838 crore) and Assam (Rs 992 crore) were the three states with less GST compensation than Telangana under this scheme. Among the southern states, Kerala had received Rs 4,923 crore, while Tamil Nadu got Rs 6,229 crore as GST compensation from the Centre under its special borrowing plan. Karnataka had benefited the most with the highest GST compensation (Rs 12,383 crore) in this scheme. Speaking to TOI, Dr Krishna Reddy Chettidi, assistant professor, School of Economics, University of Hyderabad, said “The need for GST compensation in Telangana as a whole must be lower than in many other states given the state’s strong GST collection efforts. Also, the GST compensation deficiency must be lower.” Under GST law, states were guaranteed to be compensated for any loss of revenue in the first five years of the GST implementation from July 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-got-least-gst-compensation-in-south/articleshow/84843028.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Chennai||Madras HC threatens to stay GO on 10.5% quota for vanniyars||CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Wednesday warned the Tamil Nadu government that it would be constrained to stay the GO on 10.5% internal quota for vanniyars if the state tries to implement it before the court decides on its legal validity. The GO was issued on Tuesday. But later in the day, after the government informed the court that the law had already been implemented in admissions to law courses, the court desisted from staying it and said it would hear the case on August second week. On Wednesday, pointing to a batch of writ petitions filed against the legality of the law brought in by the previous AIADMK regime hours before the poll code kicked in, the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said, “We will hear the batch of petitions challenging the validity of the reservation in the course of 10 days or so. But if the government wants to implement the quota before the court decides its validity, then we have to stay any such move.” The court then directed government counsel to get instructions from the state by noon. When the court commenced its proceedings after lunch, advocate-general R Shunmugasundaram informed the court that the quota was being implemented since April. “Admissions to law courses in the Tamil Nadu Dr Ambedkar Law University have been done following the reservation,” he said. The state has issued the fresh GO on July 26 for implementing the quota in education and employment with retrospective effect. The court can fix a short date to decide the pleas challenging the reservation. But a stay on the operation of the GO is not necessary, the AG added. Recording the submission, the bench said it would take up the batch of pleas for final hearing in the second week of August. The issue pertains to a law passed by the then AIADMK government minutes before the model code of conduct came into force ahead of the assembly election. Subsequently, a series of PILs were moved in the high court challenging the validity of such exclusive reservation for the vanniyar community. The petitioners, including associations of various communities falling under the MBC category, contended that if the reservation was allowed to be implemented, vanniyars and other sub-castes that come under vanniyakula kshatriya community would enjoy exclusive 10.5% reservation in admission to higher education and government services while other 25 castes under MBC and 68 castes under DC will have to share 7% of the remaining reservation. This exclusive reservation would affect the development of the state besides developing enmity among communities falling under MBC category, the petitioners said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-threatens-to-stay-go-on-10-5-quota-for-vanniyars/articleshow/84840905.cms||---

The suspects were produced before the court on Wednesday and were remanded in one-day police custody. The suspects have been identified as Bipin Naik (37) of Pruthviraj Nagar, Vaibhav Mitkar (35) of Adarsh Colony, Sanket Shete (32) of Chatrapati Nagar, Rahul Patil (30) of Dnyaneshwar Nagar, Prashant Dahiwadkar (50) of Vasant Vihar and Manish Jogdande (37) of Manak Complex on Railway Station road. The MNS workers were demanding restoration of equitable and regular water supply to all the areas of the city and had warned of cutting the water connection to Pandey’s bungalow if their demand was not fulfilled. Pointing out that some areas have been receiving water only once in eight days, the MNS had raised serious questions over the discrimination. Police as well as the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation(AMC) officials were left red-faced after the MNS worker not only cut the water connection early on July 18 morning, but also recorded a video of the act and uploaded the on the social media. Based on a complaint lodged by AMC’s water supply department’s deputy engineer Ashok Padde, MNS workers were booked on charges of damage to public property. In addition to this they were also slapped with different sections of the IPC for violating orders duly promulgated by government authority and for unlawfully or negligently doing any act which is likely to spread infection or disease dangerous to life. City Chowk police inspector Sambhaji Pawar said, “We requested the court for three-day police custody to recover the tools used by the suspects to cut the water line. But the court granted only one-day custody.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/6-held-for-cutting-water-supply-to-aurangabad-civic-chiefs-house/articleshow/84833143.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Meerut||As monsoon sets in, Bijnor forest dept issues reptile attack alert||Bijnor: Following heavy rains and over-flowing rivers, the forest department here has issued a reptile attack alert, cautioning villagers, especially those living along river banks, to look out for crocodiles, gharials and snakes. Reptiles are known to enter villages and attack people. M Semmaran, divisional forest officer, said, “During monsoon, there are chances of snakes, including pythons, being forced out of their holes and getting into human habitats. Gharials and crocodiles are known to be dragged away by swift river currents into spots near human habitats. While gharials normally do not attack humans, crocodiles can. We have advised villagers to take precautions and inform forest officials if they spot any reptile so that it can be removed and released into a river or the area concerned.” According to forest officials, there are over 750 gharials in the stretch of the Ganga passing through Hastinapur sanctuary area. Besides, more than 700 crocodiles are known to live in ponds in the region and come out when the water bodies are flooded. Talking with TOI, Budh Singh of Mandawali village said, “There is a deep pond close to my field. A crocodile has been living in the deep water for the last 13 years. It came out of the pond during the incessant rainfall as water level in the pond rose.” Another local claimed that a nine-foot-long crocodile had entered a house in Shamawala village during the 2018 monsoon. Villagers had somehow captured and tied it up before releasing it into the Ganga. In 2019, a crocodile entered Harchandpur village and later, another was spotted at Padala village, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/as-monsoon-sets-in-bijnor-forest-dept-issues-reptile-attack-alert/articleshow/84829586.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Mumbai||Rashmi Shukla informs Bombay HC she took sanction for taps||MUMBAI: Rashmi Shukla, former commissioner (SID), through her counsel informed the Bombay high court on Wednesday that the additional chief secretary had authorised the interception of phones in July 2020 in connection with an alleged conspiracy of “plum police postings for money”. The high court was hearing her quashing petition against a March 26 FIR filed in Mumbai against unnamed persons for an alleged leak of her phone tap report over police posting and transfers. The FIR invoked provisions of the Indian Telegraph Act, Information Technology Act and Official Secrets Act, 1923. The bench of Justice S S Shinde and Justice N J Jamadar heard her senior counsel Mahesh Jethmalani for over an hour, before adjourning to August 5 for his submissions to continue. The state through its special senior counsel Darius Khambata continued its May 6 statement not to arrest her, till August 6. Jethmalani said Shukla, who was appointed as commissioner of State Intelligence Department (SID), Mumbai, for almost two years in October 2018 and earlier was the second woman Pune police commissioner in 2016, has a reputation for being hard working and has successfully handled high-profile confidential cases regarding national security and was never once questioned by any authority. He said the genesis of the case is that information was received by the office of the director general of police (DGP) that some persons were allegedly facilitating transfers of senior-ranking police officers by using purported political links. “The DGP said surveillance is required and he told Shukla to apply and seek necessary permission. She did and ACS S Kunte was the competent authority in home department and he allowed it from July 17, 2020 to July 29, 2020.” Jethmalani said, “Shukla is wrongly being made a scape goat in every sense.” The numbers belong to some brokers with political connections indulging in corruption and demanding massive amounts of money for plum postings, said Jethmalani. “It cannot be in public safety to have corrupt police officers in the force,” he said. On being asked about the status of the probe, state’s special counsel Khambata said the police had been to Hyderabad, where she is at present posted to record her statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-shukla-informs-high-court-she-took-sanction-for-taps/articleshow/84843100.cms||Swati Deshpande

Even as the general education department plans to begin admission process to the higher secondary by the first week of August, teachers and education experts said that unlike previous years, even students who secured A+ grade in all subjects may have to settle for course/school not of their choice. SSLC results 2021 recorded an all-time high pass percentage of 99.47%. Around 1,21,318 students got A+ in all subjects, a three-fold increase compared to 41,906 students in 2020. Ratheesh Kumar, president of Kerala School Teachers Association (KSTA) said the record number of SSLC students eligible for higher studies (EHS) and those who secured A+ grade in all subjects will make the competition for admission to some courses, especially Science with Biology stream, the toughest ever. “In some schools, there is only one Plus Two Science batch with around 55 seats. More than 150 SSLC students got full A+. So all students will not get admission to Plus One science batch in their own school. Moreover, the inflow of students from other streams like CBSE and ISC to state higher secondary schools will make the competition tougher and lead to possible shortage of seats in certain subject streams,” he said. Anil M George, state general secretary of Departmental Higher Secondary School Teachers Association (HSSTA), said that the government’s decision to increase the seats by 20% in northern districts from Palakkad and 10% in southern district from Thrissur might lead to more vacant seats in some schools or subject streams, especially those in rural regions. “Already many streams like computer science and humanities have vacant seats in many schools. So increasing seats will worsen the situation as most students will be opting for science streams. The increase in seats should be district-wise and based on demand for each stream,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tough-competition-in-plus-i-admissions/articleshow/84840989.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Pune Municipal Corporation: CCTV camera plan for flood check||Pune: The civic administration is planning to set up around 100 closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras at spots that get frequently flooded. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had a decade ago installed 21 CCTV cameras, and later added 50 more, to monitor floods in the city. But most of the cameras are out of order. Some of the cameras even stopped functioning barely a year after installation. PMC additional commissioner Kunal Khemnar said, “The new project aims at better monitoring of waterlogging. We will be able to keep a proper watch on the increasing water levels with the CCTV cameras and swiftly chalk out relief strategies.” He said, “The CCTV visuals will help us understand the ground situation better. The number of CCTV cameras may increase or decrease from the estimated 100.” A PMC official said, “The civic administration had installed flood sensors at some of these locations in the past. The CCTV cameras will be added now. The administration has identified some new flood spots for the CCTV cameras. The official said, “The new CCTV cameras will be installed at public places and some private properties. Housing societies facing the problem of flooding will be involved in the project.” Vijay Kumbhar of Surajya Sangharsha Samiti, a citizens group, said, “Public funds should be used wisely. The PMC had seen that the move did not work before. If the PMC is reintroducing the plan, it should tell the citizens what improvements have been made to resolve the old issues,” Activist Sanjay Shitole said CCTVs were also installed to check illegal debris dumping. “The civic administration should inform the public if any offence was registered. A periodic assessment of the project is a must. But it has not happened with the previous projects.” Ranjit Gadgil of Parisar said, “Setting up such a (CCTV) network is a costly initiative. There should be a clear understanding of its outcome and focus on maintenance as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cctv-camera-plan-for-flood-check/articleshow/84838339.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

The border village of Bhachau taluka in Kutch has a population of around 2,700 and most residents are dependent on agriculture for their income. Uninterrupted power supply, drinking water and good roads are a far cry for this village, which has now gained the coveted international tag. Dholavira sarpanch Jilubhai Sodha said, “In peak summer, we are forced to drink water which has TDS levels as high as 1,500-1,700 as there is no groundwater source here. We have represented to the government several times to lay a pipeline from Bambhanka, which is just 40 km away, so that we get Narmada water.” Total dissolved solids (TDS) more than 1,200 are unacceptable according to prescribed standards. Electricity supply is extremely erratic, and, as a result there is a severe problem of mobile network connectivity. People coming from Ahmedabad have to go to Rapar to reach Dholavira, which is a distance of around 90 km. However, around 60 km of this road stretch is in a pathetic condition, said Sodha. The work on two other roads from Ekal to Bambhanka is going on at snail’s pace. Moreover, there is only one state transport bus daily from Bhuj to Dholavira. “The government needs to provide basic facilities like proper roads, public transport and the accommodation in nearby areas to attract tourists,” the sarpanch said. The museum which was to be developed is still a pending project and excavation of some parts is also to be done. The union government in it’s budget of 2020-21 allocated Rs 3,150 crore to develop five archaeological places as iconic sites with museums and Dholavira was one of them. The district administration has already earmarked a land parcel for this project but nothing has moved after that. Subhash Bhanderi, head, archaeology department, Kutch University said, “There is lots to explore at Dholavira site like excavation of a site on easten side, reconstruction, creating a small replica of Harappan era city, development of museum etc. We expect Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) will do it now.” Sources said there is a small museum at the site where surface collection is exhibited. Other articles found during excavation are stored in the national museum and ASI office in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/after-coveted-tag-dholavira-hopes-to-get-basic-amenities/articleshow/84836110.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The arrested accused have been identified as 45-year-old deputy collector Manisha Rashinkar, and her office kotwal Vilas Jankar (32). Both were produced before the court on Wednesday. Subsequently, they were remanded in two-day police custody. This case comes within a week of deputy superintendent of police Rajendra Pal — heading the Selu division of Parbhani district — and his subordinate landing in the ACB net for accepting Rs 10 lakh as an advance for a Rs 2crore bribe. The ACB officials maintained that in the Osmanabad case, the revenue officials were allegedly demanding ‘protection money’ to let the sand traders operate without checks. The 29-year-old trader, in his complaint, alleged that the revenue employees were seeking bribes for letting his heavy vehicle, his brother-in-law’s excavator, and three tractors operate. He said he was threatened of stringent action if the monthly bribe amount was not paid. ACB superintendent of police Rahul Khade told TOI, “There was a complaint against the deputy collector and her subordinate for seeking bribe to let the sand traders operate without checks.” On receiving the complaint, the ACB carried out the verification and found that there was a demand of Rs 1.1 lakh from the complainant and during negotiation, the amount was finalised at Rs 90, 000. The suspects were nabbed after the kotwal accepted Rs 20, 000 as a token bribe on behalf of the deputy collector on Tuesday night. ACB arrested Jankar. As Rashinkar is a woman, she was issued notice and was summoned on Wednesday morning. She was then officially arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/osmanabad-dy-collector-subordinate-land-in-acb-net/articleshow/84833186.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The artists include S Akash (flute), Swarangi Marathe Kale, Gandhar Deshpande, Jidnesh Vaze, Suranjan Khandalkar and Aditya Khandwe (vocal), Aniket Gundewar (guitar), Pandurang Pawar (tabla), Chintan Katti (sitar) and Abhishek Borkar (sarod). “I was planning to organise such a festival live in May to encourage young talent and give them a good platform. However, I had to cancel it due to the pandemic-induced restrictions. My grandfather’s death anniversary is on July 30, so I decided to do an online festival featuring 10 young artists to mark the occasion,” Rahul Deshpande told TOI. When asked how he shortlisted the artists, he said, “I have heard all of them. Gandhar is the son of Ram Deshpande, while Swarangi is the granddaughter of noted vocalist Ram Marathe. Jidnesh is my disciple who will present his first concert. But I can say that all are very talented and as a musician I feel it is our duty to encourage them so that this art continues to thrive.” I was planning to organise such a festival live in May to encourage young talent and give them a good platform.

Earlier this week, the state cabinet had approved the reopening of the schools in an offline format. However, parents' associations have pointed out that schoolchildren haven’t been vaccinated yet, and thus, it is not safe to reopen schools. “There are no vaccines for people below 18 years of age and the third wave is also expected to hit the country in September. In such circumstances, sending children to schools will amount to risking their safety. The state government should either retract their decision or take the responsibility for any untoward incident that takes place after the schools reopen,” said Arif Khan, NAPSR president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/parents-body-against-reopening-schools-for-class-vi-to-xii/articleshow/84836131.cms||Mohammad Anab

A section of residents of the society had opposed the plan and wanted to save the open space. TOI reported the issue on February 28. Mhada has now instructed the society to stop all work on construction of the tank. “This office had issued an NOC for construction of a tank after obtaining approval of the competent authority. However, vice-president and CEO, Mhada, has instructed to ascertain technical details and site aspects jointly with the BMC first. Here, you are informed not to start the work till further communication,” stated the Mhada letter to the society issued by executive engineer (Goregaon division) Sunil Bhadange. The society said there is a severe water shortage in the society of row houses, and several homes have to often call water tankers or use borewells. Residents said the open space is divided into two plots that together measure around 1,459 square metre. The plots are separated by a boundary wall. One houses a gymnasium and the other children’s play apparatus. The New Dindoshi Royal Hills Society has 77 bungalows and around 350 residents. Right now, every row house has a separate BMC water connection and each its own storage tank. Ajit Jathar, secretary of the society, had said a majority of homes did not get enough water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mhada-stays-noc-to-dindoshi-soc-for-water-tank-under-park/articleshow/84836178.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Bhujbal was speaking during a virtual programme organized to launch the national river anthem by Nashik-based Namami Goda Foundation. During the event Bhujbal directed the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) and other government agencies to take immediate measures to stop release of untreated effluents into the river. He also pointed out the encroachment on nullahs and rivers that is hindering the natural flow of rainwater into the river resulting in waterlogging in low-lying areas. The Godavari anthem was released by the magsaysay award winner Rajendra Singh who during his speech also appealed to the people to come together to save Godavari. “River and mountains are our lifeline and efforts are needed to save them. Hence, people from all sections of the society should come together to save Godavari river and Bramhagiri & other mountains. Mayor Satish Kulkarni said the civic body has taken several measures to make Godavari pollution free. “There are 67 nullahs across the city along with three tributaries that finally reach Godavari. There are some nullahs in industrial estates of the MIDC where some industries are releasing the effluents directly into the nullahs,” he said. District collector Suraj Mandhare said a task force has been formed and various environment-related issues are to be sorted out through this. CEO of ZP Nashik Leena Bansod said there are 42 villages situated on the banks of Godavari river in rural areas. “We have undertaken waste management programme in all these villages under various government schemes. Our objective is to stop flow of waste water from these villages into the river. This will help us to make the river free from pollution,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/godavari-pollution-caused-by-untreated-effluents-a-big-concern-says-bhujbal/articleshow/84833352.cms||Tushar Pawar

Meanwhile water level in Kempty Falls rose dangerously prompting the administration to prohibit tourists from entering the pool. Heavy rains throughout the night and early Wednesday morning led to landslides at several places across the town. Traffic on Mussoorie-Dehradun road was obstructed on Wednesday morning after landslides near Shiv Mandir and near Galogi power station. Although the road was cleared after about an hour, debris continued to pour down the hill from the landslide near Galogi. Meanwhile landslides on Mussoorie-Tehri road near Andakhet brought the traffic to a standstill for some time. While an embankment near Oak Grove school came down on the road resulting in disrupting traffic movement. However. road was cleared at both these places in a short while. “The area near Galogi has become a perpetual source of landslides,” remarked a resident. “We have permanently deployed a JCB near Galogi and the road is being regularly cleared. There was no subsequent obstruction of traffic,” told Pushpendra Kumar, junior engineer of the Public Works Department. Heavy rains also led to an increase in the flow of water in Kempty Falls while large quantities of debris and rocks were also coming down with the fast-flowing water in the falls. This prompted the administration to prohibit the entry of tourists in the pool at the base of the falls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/landslides-in-various-parts-of-town-mussoorie-dehradun-road-blocked-water-level-rises-dangerously-in-kempty-falls/articleshow/84836155.cms||Anmol Jain
---||India||Speaker mulls suspension of 13 Congress, TMC MPs identified as ‘repeat offenders’ for tearing papers in House||NEW DELHI: Upset over incidents of tearing papers and throwing on the chair and also on ministers, speaker Om Birla is contemplating suspension of at least 13 MPs belonging to the Congress and the TMC, who have been identified as “repeat offenders”. “It was an insult to the chair as torn papers rained for several minutes when Rajendra Agarwal was the presiding officer. Therefore, we expect that the Speaker will initiate action against the MPs, who have misbehaved with the presiding officer,” said a source. It was learnt that the Speaker summoned some of the opposition leaders in his chamber and conveyed his displeasure and warned that such behaviour will not be tolerated anymore. Sources said some of the MPs have been identified as video of the proceedings was scrutinised and their behaviour was found to be against the parliamentary ethics and derogatory to the chair. In Lok Sabha, Congress and TMC MPs on Wednesday tore papers and threw it at the chair and towards parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi. As opposition MPs mainly from Congress and TMC threw papers on the chair and also on parliamentary affairs minister, some of the ruling MPs were seen outraged and stood up. Realising the gravity of the situation, Rajendra Agarwal, who was presiding in the zero hour, adjourned the house for half an hour. Senior ministers including Narendra Singh Tomar, Piyush Goyal, Anurag Thakur, Joshi were seen in a huddle while another Union minister Darshana Jardosh was heard saying that such “unruly” behaviour should not be tolerated and be brought to the knowledge of the people. Union minister Anurag Thakur said Congress and TMC MPs had tried not to let Parliament function on Wednesday. “They can register their protest but that too has a limit. They threw papers on the Speaker, ministers and even at the media gallery and showed placards. Why is the opposition running away from discussions?” he questioned. Thakur said there is a way to protest but on Wednesday, the opposition damaged the dignity and decorum of the temple of our democracy. “The opposition MPs have ashamed the world’s largest democracy by their condemnable actions,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/speaker-mulls-suspension-of-13-congress-tmc-mps-identified-as-repeat-offenders-for-tearing-papers-in-house/articleshow/84845423.cms||---

This year, in the last four months itself, the hospital said it has got nearly 175 cases of the deadly fungal infection. All these patients had a history of Covid-19. “Nearly 121 patients (69%) required nasal and sinus surgery, while 26 (15%) needed removing the eye to prevent the spread of infection to the nervous system,” Dr A K Grover, chairman of the department of ophthalmology, SGRH told TOI. He added that 102 patients (58%) had been discharged, while around 38 others (approximately 22% of the total cases) died. “The mortality has been low at our hospital by international standards due to very meticulous care,” Dr Grover said. Mucormycosis (often called black fungus, which is a misnomer) is a fungal infection that spreads through the inhalation of spores from the environment, such as in soil or vegetation. Once inside, it can cause blood clots and tissue deaths. The infection affects air sinuses surrounding nose, eyes and the cavity behind the eyes called orbit and brain. It is, therefore, called Rhino Orbito Cerebral Mucormycosis (ROCM). The doctor said mucormycosis was not a new disease entity but had only emerged fast due to Covid-19. He added that they got 31 patients of ROCM, predominantly men in their 50s and 60s, during the first wave of the pandemic. Four of them died because of the extensive spread of the disease in the brain/body. “In the second wave, the disease became rampant across the country. We also received over 175 patients, of whom around 22% succumbed to the disease,” he added. Public education about the disease is extremely important for early diagnosis and management. Also, easy availability of anti-fungal medications, such as Liposomal Amphotericin B, needs to be ensured to save lives, doctors said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/175-mucormycosis-cases-in-4-mths-38-dead-at-ganga-ram/articleshow/84841080.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

During the encounters, the police recovered 19 looted weapons apart from seizing four regular weapons, 96 country-made weapons and 5,802 cartridges. Over 200 IEDs, 179.5 kg of explosives and 95 detonators were also recovered. Eleven extremists, including five from CPI (Maoists) and four from TPC surrendered before the police. Among them were CPI (Maoist) zonal commander Jeevan Kandulan, TPC regional committee member Mukesh Ganjhu and a PLFI area commander. Director-general of police Neeraj Sinha had recently said though encounters do take place during anti-extremist operations, the police would prefer that the extremists surrender under the state government’s policies and join the mainstream. Speaking on the issue, inspector-general (operations) Amol Homkar said, “Apart from carrying out continuous operations we are trying to make the extremists surrender. We are also asking their family members to urge them lay down their arms. Where necessary the police are also attaching property of the ultras.

---||Jamshedpur||Heavy rain alert in Jharkhand for next 2 days||Ranchi: The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) on Wednesday issued a red alert for heavy to extremely heavy rainfall in the next 48 hours over more than half of Jharkhand. This is because of development of a well-marked low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal which is likely to move westwards across to West Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand causing extremely heavy rainfall. Acting director Ranchi IMD, Abhishek Anand, said the low-pressure area over the north Bay of Bengal and its neighbourhood has turned into a well-marked low-pressure area over south Bangladesh and its adjoining north Bay of Bengal and West Bengal early on Wednesday morning. While many parts of the state received moderate rainfall on Wednesday, the IMD bulletin issued by evening predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall in north-eastern, south-eastern and central parts of the state on Thursday. The red alert is valid for 12 districts in north-eastern and central Jharkhand. Orange alert has been raised in three districts — Ranchi, Seraikela-Kharsawan and East Singhbhum. For Friday, the red alert is valid for 18 of 24 districts. While orange alert has been sounded in Seraikela-Kharsawan and East Singhbhum, the four remaining districts — Gumla, Khunti, Simdega and West Singhbhum — are in yellow alert category. Anand said fairly widespread rains are expected during the next 48 hours when monsoon activity would remain significant under the influence of well-marked low-pressure area. “By Sunday, the weather will once again normalise and there can be sporadic rainfall in isolated pockets,” he said. According to Met parlance, rainfall activity of 2,04.5mm and above is categrorised as extremely heavy rainfall while any quantum of rain between 115.6mm to 204.4mm is considered very heavy rainfall. The red warning suggests taking pre-emptive steps. The district administrations in general has decided to keep a watch over the situation and no evacuation measures were started on Wednesday. During the monsoon, Jharkhand has received 463.2mm rainfall as against the seasonal normal of 489.8mm thereby registering a deficit of 5 per cent. While rainfall has been deficient in six districts, four have recorded excess rainfall while rainfall has been normal in the remaining 16 districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/heavy-rain-alert-in-state-for-next-2-days/articleshow/84852936.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

He was speaking at the concluding event of the Sankalp Saptah (Resolution Week) held jointly by the CPI(ML) and the Marxist Coordination Committee at Loyala school premises in Ranchi. Both the parties observed Sankalp Saptah from July 21 to July 28. Bhattacharya said that unity among the Left parties was necessary to rid the country of NDA rule. He added that the present state government in Jharkhand must execute policies that are radically different from the previous BJP-led dispensation. Both the parties have decided to hold a day-long fast on August 5 to protest against alleged spying through Pegasus spyware and the reported attempt to destabilize the Hemant Soren-led government in Jharkhand. CPI(ML) state secretary Janardhan Prasad said, “The protest would be to oppose the conspiracy against the Constitution in Jharkhand and to demand a judicial inquiry into the Pegasus issue.” In their political resolution passed in the meeting, both the political parties stated that the central government has shown its insensitivity towards Covid-19 victims by claiming that no one died owing to shortage of oxygen. The parties said that a programme would be held every Sunday to press for compensation to Covid-19 victims. The parties said that poor people are facing the double attack of unemployment and inflation leading to threat of hunger, death and malnutrition. The two parties said that not only the BJP but also the current state government was not serious about providing employment. They said that a programme would be held between August 15 and August 30 to mobilize the youths on the issue. The parties have also decided to include the issue of justice for late Stan Swamy in all their public agitations. Another programme termed ‘Save Jharkhand from corporate loot’ would be staged from August 9 to August 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/left-parties-plan-series-of-agitations-in-august-over-pegasus-unemployment/articleshow/84853288.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Ranchi||Dawai Dost set to close shop at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences Ranchi||RANCHI: The Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS)’s decision to shut down “Dawaai Dost”, a generic medicine store which used to provide medicines at subsidized rates, is likely to push up the medical expenses of poor .patients visiting the hospital by nearly four times. The move comes in the wake of a 2015 decision made by governing body of RIMS in which it was decided that the hospital would invite an open tender after its agreement ends with Dawaai Dost. However, as no tenders were invited after 2015 and after Jharkhand High Court summoned the RIMS administration over the issue, it directed the store to down shutters within a month. RIMS director Dr Kameshwar Prasad said, “I dont have any knowledge of the governing body’s decision in 2015 Dawai Dost has to close shop and a fresh tender has to be invited. However, soon after the high court sought a clarification on the matter, I tracked down the details and issued the order.” Asked about the difficulties which many poor patients visiting RIMS will face as Dawai Dost offers medicines at subsidised rates, Dr Prasad said as a part of interim arrangement they have spoken to a supplier which provides medicines to Sadar Hospital and it will be available through Jan Ausadhi Kendra on the RIMS campus. Meanwhile, several doctors as well as governing body members termed the decision of RIMS administration a hasty one and expressed their displeasure over it. “I see a lot of patients who cannot afford medicines from private pharmacies and I suggest Dawaai Dost. If the shop is closed without a proper alternative then poor patients will have a tough time,” said an assistant professor of the medicine department of RIMS. Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth also said, “Dawaai Dost has been providing its services to poor patients as it is a non-profit organisation. RIMS should have thought of an alternative before removing the counter or else the patients will have to suffer.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/dawai-dost-set-to-close-shop-at-rims/articleshow/84839416.cms||Gaurav Pandey

The program is need of the hour during the pandemic as it will help the unemployed rural youth develop new skills.” She added, “As part of our training program, we are mobilizing youths across the state and once their training is complete, they are provided with financial assistance by the participating banks so that they can earn their livelihoods.” Asked about the popular sectors chosen by the youths enrolled under the RUDSETI programme, Sahay said, “The most popular sector is agriculture as 68% of the trained youths have opted for that, followed by handloom and handicrafts which constitutes around 16%. Seven per cent have chosen apparel manufacturing while 9% have gone for other sectors. In agriculture, vegetable and nursery management, mushroom cultivation and commercial horticulture are the most sought-after areas while manufacturing of soft toys and jute products under handloom and handicrafts are among the some of the most popular choices. Many have also been trained in costume and jewellery designing, tailoring and beauty parlour management and the parent banks are supporting them with financial assistance to start their businesses.” Upon contact, Jamtara resident Parinita Mandal said: “My husband has a private job and I don’t have any fixed income, which was making it difficult to meet our daily needs, which is when I decided to enrol myself for the mushroom cultivation program. I went through a 10-day training programme and I started cultivating mushrooms with Rs 2,000. Later, I took a loan of Rs 2.4 lakh from the SBI’s Mihijam branch and now, I earn Rs 20,000 in a month.” RUDSETI national director Vipul Chandra appreciated JSLPS’s efforts and said: “The work done by JSLPS in the self-employment program is commendable as they are the ones who are identifying and mobilizing candidates in need of jobs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/99-of-rural-youth-trained-by-jslps-clear-evaluation-now-eligible-for-bank-loans/articleshow/84840139.cms||Gaurav Pandey

On Monday, the district did not report a single new infection. On average, the district is reporting one to five cases every day. “Many people are not wearing masks in public areas. We are fining around 100 such people each day,” additional chief medical officer Dr Sahir Pall said. In between July 1 and July 15 a study was conducted on 4,400 people who visited the office of the civil surgeon. The study revealed that 19% of all the visitors were not wearing masks. Now, the department aims to conduct a similar study in busy and crowded areas of the city. “Over 2,000 people are being screened at the Tatanagar railway station for Covid-19 every day,” health officials said. “Police and civil administration are regularly conducting routine and surprise inspections at public places to catch and discipline the violators but people should also take the rules seriously and display behaviour expected from them during the pandemic,” Pall added. East Singhbhum reported 10 deaths and 458 new Covid-19 infections between June 15 and July 27 this year. Close to 1,100 people have died and 52,000 people have been infected in the district since the pandemic broke out in May 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/east-sbhum-admin-sees-red-over-covid-protocol-violation/articleshow/84840256.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Rally begins from Rajrappa demanding temple reopening||RAMGARH: Members of several Hindu outfits led by BJP’s district youth wing took out a foot march to Raj Bhavan in Ranchi from Rajrappa’s Chinnamastika temple on Wednesday. The rally was taken out to demand the reopening of the Chinnamastika temple and other prominent places of worship such as Baidyanath dham in Deoghar and Basukinath temple in Deoghar for the devotees. The protestors comprised BJP functionaries, priests of the Chinnamastika temple and vendors who sell puja items and memorabilia outside the temple, among others. They are slated to cover 70km on foot and reach Ranchi on Thursday. In Ranchi, they will meet governor Ramesh Bais to raise their demand. “The state government should reopen prominent temples immediately, taking into account the religious sentiments of the people. Our agitation will intensify if the government does not pay heed to our demands,” BJP youth wing functionary Rajiv Jaiswal said. Santosh Tiwari, a resident of Gola in Ramgarh, said, “If the government can allow shopping malls, cinema halls and crowded bazars to reopen, then why can’t it reopen the temples? Thousands of people depend on temples for a living. Where will they go?” Ajay Panda, a senior priest at Chinnamastika temple, said, “Nearly 1,000 vendors have become jobless owing to the lockdown. It has become difficult for the temple management committee to manage the devotees, who are turning up in hundreds and offering their prayers outside the closed temple gates.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rally-begins-from-rajrappa-demanding-temple-reopening/articleshow/84839616.cms||---

The remaining cost will be borne by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC). The civic body has come up with a scheme to encourage groundwater recharging efforts in the city. So far, it is largely developers, government buildings and some select residential societies that have taken up the work. In public places, NGOs have contributed to the efforts. The VMC is looking to provide 80% of the cost of recharge wells to residential societies and complexes. The remaining cost will have to be borne by the societies. The VMC has prepared a proposal in this regard and placed it before the standing committee. The committee will take up the matter in its meeting later this week. The proposal states that if funds from any NGO or corporate social responsibility project are used, these will be deducted from the share of the VMC. The forms for the project will be prepared by the futuristic planning cell of the civic body and shall be distributed from ward offices. The societies will have to provide documents like its maps, building permission and completion certificate to seek funds. The engineers at the ward level will verify the documents before clearing the work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vmc-to-fund-80-cost-for-percolation-wells/articleshow/84837522.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Animal health also important, allow offline work: Maharashtra veterinary students||NAGPUR: Students of government veterinary colleges across the state pursuing Bachelor of Veterinary Science (BVSc) degree have demanded that their colleges should be allowed to function physically, at least for practical experience. BVSc is an undergraduate course of 5 years in the field of veterinary science that aims to impart the knowledge required for nourishment, treatment, and breeding of animals. Maharashtra Animal and Fishery Sciences University (Mafsu), having its headquarters in Nagpur, handles these colleges. “Students of fourth year BVSc are repeatedly appealing for commencement of offline mode of classes. The curriculum for the fourth year is largely practical. Will you allow doctors to work in the field without zero practical experience?” asked student Paras Wanjari. Apart from Nagpur, Mafsu’s government veterinary colleges are situated in Mumbai, Parbhani, Shirwal, Udgir and Akola. Hundreds of students are set to become future veterinarians without practical experience as physical classes are not happening due to Covid-19 restrictions. “We are also doctors and we deal with the lives of animals. We handle veterinary medicines, gynaecology, surgery, and radiology too. It wouldn’t be justice to us as well as to our patients if we learn these important subjects without any hands on experience,” said Dr Tejas Wankhede, president of the students’ group. The students have assured that they will follow all Covid-appropriate behaviour. “We all are ready to abide by Covid-19 safety protocols. We will get vaccinated with at least first dose. We are even ready to present negative RT-PCR report. Moreover, if the government wants, we are ready to sign a declaration letter claiming that we will take full responsibility of ourselves and neither college nor government will be held responsible,” reads a letter issued by the students to the respective district collectors. On Tuesday, a delegation of Nagpur students met district collector R Vimala. According to students, they earlier met the deans of their respective institutions and also vice-chancellor of Mafsu, but both the authorities said only district collectors can issue permissions for offline classes. TOI spoke to a senior official of Mafsu who said the academics agree with the students’ demand. “Like MBBS and BDS students, vet students are also future doctors. They save lives of animals, livestock and their work is especially important to sustain rural economy. Fourth year students should at least be allowed to join colleges,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/animal-health-also-important-allow-offline-work-vet-students/articleshow/84841126.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
