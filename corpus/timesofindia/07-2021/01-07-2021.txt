The children, mostly boys, have been removed to prisons from al-Hol, a desert camp run by Syrian Kurdish forces for 60,000 people from more than 60 countries associated with Islamic State (IS) fighters, the aid agency said. Most are women and children who fled there after IS's last enclaves collapsed two years ago.  "Hundreds of children, mostly boys, some as young as 12, are detained in adult prisons, places they simply do not belong," Fabrizio Carboni, ICRC regional director for the Middle East, told a news briefing.  The ICRC made 36 visits to places of detention across Syria last year, the only agency with such access. It requires private talks with inmates on their treatment and conditions, but its confidential findings are shared only with the authorities.  It has access to some places of detention in northeast Syria - a Syrian Kurdish-controlled area - a spokeswoman said, declining to give details.  The ICRC also renewed its appeal for countries to repatriate their nationals from the al-Hol camp and keep families together, "as international law requires".  Carboni, who has visited al-Hol four times in the past two years, said: "I really can't get used to seeing so many children behind barbed wire."  The ICRC runs a field hospital and provides food and water at the sprawling site. Medical needs remain huge, with a rise in resident children dying last year, including some from preventable conditions, Carboni said.  UNICEF said eight children under 5 years old had died at the camp last August, half from malnutrition-related complications. The other deaths had been due to dehydration from diarrhea, heart failure, internal bleeding and hypoglycemia, the UN children's agency said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/red-cross-reveals-that-children-held-in-northeast-syria-prisons/articleshow/84000006.cms||---

It’s been blown out of proportion." "The EMA is correct in asking us to apply, which we have through AstraZeneca a month ago, and that process has to take its time. In a month we are confident the EMA will approve Covishield. There is no reason not to as it is based on AstraZeneca data and our product is identical to AstraZeneca more or less," he said. The green pass, which will be required for travel in the EU from July 1, does not currently recognise Covishield. Speaking at the India Global Forum, Poonawalla said "what keeps him up at night" is the lack of preparedness for a future pandemic. He called for harmonisation between countries of the regulations vaccine manufacturers have to meet as well as harmonisation of vaccine certificates. "Until it all gets regularised we will struggle to meet the output required," he said. He said waiving of intellectual property rights would not solve the immediate shortage of vaccines as it is not just about the patent but also sharing of technology process. Earlier in the year SII was forced to stop its exports through Covax to lower-income countries to focus on vaccinating Indians. This was a "particularly stressful time" he said, explaining that money that had been advanced had to be returned. "India will go back to supporting Covax in two to three months’ time and start re-exporting vaccines. By the end of the year there will be so many doses coming out of India," he said. "By the end of December a large part of the Indian population should be vaccinated," he said. The SII has ramped up from 50 million Covid vaccine doses per month in January to 90 million in June. But he warned the pandemic may not be over for up to four years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/adar-poonawalla-says-eu-green-pass-covishield-issue-has-been-blown-out-of-proportion/articleshow/84000399.cms||NAOMI CANTON

According to Gowtham, his friend Ramesh TV had invested in the business and made a profit. Ramesh told Gowtham he did not have enough knowledge of it and invested through a friend, Kunal Anoor Chandarana. Gowtham contacted Chandarana and as suggested by him, transferred Rs 3.5 crore to two bank accounts to purchase cryptocurrency on May 15. However, Chandarana neither arranged for cryptocurrency nor returned the money.

---||World||$40 billion pledged at Paris conference for gender equality||PARIS: World leaders, philanthropists and organisations have pledged at least $40 billion at an international conference in Paris to boost gender equality, as women and girls worldwide have been deeply affected by the consequences of the pandemic. UN Women's executive director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka welcomed the pledges at the three-day Generation Equality Forum that started Wednesday. The summit "is about change. It is about moving from making promises to telling us what you are going to do for the situation of women to change,” she said. French President Emmanuel Macron said that over the past year and half, an extra 47 million women fell into poverty amid the pandemic, and millions of others were deprived of treatment, contraception and the possibility of choosing for themselves. “While they were on the frontline of the fight against Covid, women are the first victims of this health crisis,” he said. The conference aims at tackling and funding all issues that impede women's rights - forced marriage, gender-based violence, leaving school, work inequality, losing out on innovation and technology - and ensuring their sexual and reproductive rights and health. Bill and Melinda Gates' namesake foundation announced it will spend $2.1 billion in the next five years on health and family planning programs, economic empowerment projects and other initiatives. The Ford Foundation announced a $420 million investment to tackle threats to women's rights caused by Covid-19. The World Bank committed to funding programmes in 12 African states. The conference, co-organised by the UN, France and Mexico, is mostly held virtually, but some heads of state, UN officials and women's right activists were also attending in person in Paris. Meant to mark the 25th anniversary of the 1995 Beijing World Conference on Women, during which nations made major commitments to achieve gender equality, it was delayed from last year because of the coronavirus. Former US secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton, who famously said in Beijing that “human rights are women's rights, and women's rights are human rights,” came to Paris to encourage younger generations to continue fighting. “Now looking back, I believe we have made progress not near enough, and that we have to recommit ourselves to going even further. But we also need the power to claim the rights,” she said. “Rights without power adds up to very little." US Vice President Kamala Harris, speaking via videoconference, highlighted threats to democracy around the world. “Democracy is in peril. Strongmen have become stronger. Human rights abuses have multiplied,” she said. “And who gets hurt when democracies fall? When democracies falter? ... Well, women and girls are among those who suffer.” Harris previewed US commitments to “reinforce our institutions” in ways that will create “tangible results that improve the lives of women in the United States and women around the world,” without providing details. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres denounced what he described as a current “pushback” from some world leaders, political, economic and religious movements across the world. “We must push back against the pushback”, he said. “We must win that ideological battle against conservative forces.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/40-billion-pledged-at-paris-conference-for-gender-equality/articleshow/83999366.cms||---
---||World||Brazil's Bolsonaro fires health official after graft claims||RIO DE JANEIRO: Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has fired a health ministry official after a newspaper reported his alleged participation in a graft scheme to secure Covid-19 vaccines, further straining the government's defense of its pandemic response.  The order firing Roberto Dias, head of the health ministry's logistics department, was signed on Tuesday night by Bolsonaro's chief of staff, Luiz Eduardo Ramos, and published in Wednesday's official gazette.  Newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reported shortly before the decision that Dias allegedly asked a vaccine provider to inflate the prices of its doses by $1 each in order for the mark-up to be siphoned off.  The publication quoted Luiz Paulo Dominguetti as saying he approached Dias this year on behalf of his company, Davati Medical Supply, to negotiate the sale of 400 million AstraZeneca doses. Dominguetti told Folha that Dias said the health ministry would only purchase the vaccines if Davati agreed to the price-raising scheme, and he declined the proposal.  The Associated Press wasn't immediately able to reach Dias for comment. He did not respond to a request for comments sent to his health ministry email address.  The health ministry didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the reason for Dias's dismissal.  A spokesperson for AstraZeneca, who asked not to be named due to company policy, denied that the firm had worked, or been in talks with Davati Medical Supply. "Our vaccine is not available to the private market and we don't work with intermediaries," the spokesperson said over the phone.  The allegation puts additional pressure on Bolsonaro, whose handling of the Covid-19 crisis is already being investigated by a Senate committee. Members said on Wednesday that they will look into the newspaper's reporting, which included some transcripts of Dias's emails.  The Brazilian leader in the past week was also accused of turning a blind eye to possible corruption in another deal to purchase vaccines, just weeks after the country surpassed the milestone of 500,000 Covid-19 deaths.  Luis Ricardo Miranda, another health ministry official overseeing its import division, told the Senate committee earlier this year he faced pressure to greenlight the import of 20 million Covaxin vaccines from Indian pharmaceutical Bharat Biotech and pointed to seeming irregularities in the invoices - particularly a $45 million upfront payment to a Singapore-based company. Bharat has denied any allegation of wrongdoing with respect to vaccine supply. Bolsonaro has denied any wrongdoing or knowledge of corruption and told reporters earlier this week he can't know what transpires within his ministries. On Wednesday, he told supporters he doesn't fear the investigation.  Late Tuesday, the health ministry announced that it was "temporarily suspending" the Covaxin contract. Comptroller-general Wagner Rosario said his office will evaluate the process by which it was signed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/brazils-bolsonaro-fires-health-official-after-graft-claims/articleshow/84000581.cms||---

The commission, headed by retired Supreme Court judge Ranjana Prakash Desai, would gather firsthand information and inputs concerning the process of delimitation for raising the number of assembly and Parliament seats in J&K. “During this period (July 6-9), the commission will interact with political parties, public representatives and the Union Territory administration officials, including district election officers/deputy commissioners of 20 districts of the Union Territory to gather firsthand information and input concerning the ongoing process of delimitation as mandated under the Jammu & Kashmir Reorganization Act, 2019,” read a handout. The Delimitation Commission was constituted in March 2020 and its term was extended by another year in March 2021 in view of the ongoing pandemic. Besides Desai, the commission has two ex-officio members and five associate members. While the two ex-officio members are chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra and state election commissioner of J&K KK Sharma, the associate members are Dr Jitendra Singh (junior minister and MP), Jugal Kishore Sharma (MP), Dr Farooq Abdullah, Mohammad Akbar Lone and Hasnain Masoodi. Singh and Sharma are from BJP and come from the Jammu division, while Abdullah, Lone and Masoodi belong to National Conference and are from Kashmir division. Interestingly, at the all-party meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi held on June 24 in New Delhi, political parties were asked to cooperate with the delimitation commission, which had already had a series of meetings related to data map of the districts/constituencies related to Census 2011. According to a commission statement, earlier it had invited all associate members for interaction, but only two of them had turned up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delimitation-commission-to-visit-jk-for-4-days-from-july-6/articleshow/84000579.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||World||Pete Buttigieg doles out transport grants with eye toward climate||Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg doled out $905 million in infrastructure grants Wednesday, including to repair a cracking bridge in Seattle during a crippling heat wave and to expand ports in Iowa and Georgia to help reduce the number of greenhouse gas-emitting trucks on the roads. The money for 24 projects in 18 states is part of a Biden administration shift of federal awards to promote climate-friendly policies and racial equity. Federal aid will also go to California to reduce traffic fatalities in south Los Angeles and to Maine for bridge repair. ``These timely investments in our infrastructure will create jobs and support regional economies, while helping to spur innovation, confront climate change, and address inequities across the country,'' Buttigieg said. The money awarded Wednesday under the department's Infrastructure for Rebuilding America program offers a glimpse into how the administration hopes to steer federal transportation dollars in the months ahead. President Joe Biden is currently making his pitch for hundreds of billions in new infrastructure spending to fix crumbling roads and bridges, though the outcome remains uncertain in Congress. Under the grant program, Seattle will be awarded $11.3 million for major repairs on the West Seattle High-Rise Bridge, which was closed in March 2020 due to cracks in multiple locations, triggering alarm of a possible collapse, as well as the Spokane Street Swing Bridge running adjacent to it. The city has been racing to spray down and cool several of its bridges to avert weather-related damage like sink holes or fissures due to the heat wave in the Northwest. Repair work to the bridge, a lifeline to west Seattle, is scheduled to last to mid-2022. The city said it hoped to avoid repair delays because of current detours that send heavy traffic into surrounding lower-income neighborhoods, adding to pollution and road hazards for residents there. ``Restoring the West Seattle High-Rise Bridge to full capacity is critical to the Seattle region's ability to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic,'' Mayor Jenny Durkan and city council members wrote in their application. Iowa will get $5 million to increase capacity at its Gavilon marine port and rail facility in Dubuque, helping to support direct transport of fertilizer from river barge to rail and reduce truck travel. The Georgia Ports Authority will receive $46.9 million to build a new inland container port along the I-85/I-985 corridor in an unincorporated area of Gainesville. And Philadelphia Regional Port Authority will get $49 million to help cover funding for improvements at Southport. The Los Angeles project, meanwhile, will receive $18 million to help add 26 new traffic signals, new separated bike lanes, high visibility crosswalk markings, bus boarding islands, upgraded curb ramps and additional shade trees in a mostly nonwhite section of the city where pedestrian and bicycle deaths are high. During the Trump administration, the Transportation Department prioritized roads projects that encouraged car travel, with more than half of funding typically going to rural areas, which was more than double the minimum 25% set by statute. On Wednesday, the department said 44% of its first awards will go to rural projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/pete-buttigieg-doles-out-transport-grants-with-eye-toward-climate/articleshow/84000634.cms||---

An official said a joint team of the police, Army’s 9 RR and CRPF launched a cordon-and-search operation on specific information about the presence of militants in the area. He said that as the joint team approached, the militants fired at them and they retaliated, triggering an encounter. "The injured soldiers were taken to the Army hospital for treatment," the official said. A police spokesman said that the militants were repeatedly asked to surrender but they instead replied with indiscriminate fire. The three slain militants were identified as Waseem Ahmad Bangroo of Redwani Kulgam, Shahnawaz Ahmad of Kilbal Shopian and Zakir Bashir of Chimmer Kulgam. All three were affiliated to the LeT. According to police records, the slain militants were part of a group involved in various cases. "Incriminating material, including arms and ammunition, were recovered from the site of the encounter. In this connection, police have registered a case under relevant sections of law and an investigation has been initiated, a police statement read. "People are requested to cooperate with the police till the area is completely sanitised and cleared of of all explosive material, if any," the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/3-let-terrorists-killed-2-army-soldiers-wounded-in-kulgam-gunfight/articleshow/84000649.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||World||Trump at US-Mexico border, highlights 'dangerous' migrant surge||WESLACO: Donald Trump visited the US-Mexico border Wednesday to denounce an immigration crisis he said has become "more dangerous" than ever, using an underlying theme of his presidency to rail against his successor Joe Biden. Trump is on his first major fact-finding tour since leaving the White House in January, coming as the Biden administration grapples with a migrant surge that Trump blames squarely on an easing of his "tough but fair" policies that were aimed at deterring new arrivals. "Now we have an open, really dangerous border, more dangerous than it's ever been in the history of our country -- and we better go back fast," the brash billionaire said after receiving a briefing from border region sheriffs at the Department of Public Safety in the small town of Weslaco, Texas. The Republican ex-president was accompanied by Texas Governor Greg Abbott, whom Trump has endorsed for re-election next year, and who has pledged to finish Trump's wall along his state's border, but with private donations and not federal assistance. Trump was joined by several Republican members of Congress, including conservatives Lauren Boebert and Jim Banks, on a mission to "admire the wall" at a border crossing in Pharr, Texas, where an uncompleted portion of the metal structure looms over a grassy bluff. The area is in the Rio Grande Valley, one of the illegal migration hot spots along the 1,930-mile (3,100-kilometer) border. Trump expressed pride in his efforts to build more than 400 miles of border barrier during his four-year presidency and to tamp down the number of migrants crossing into Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California. "We did a hell of a job, and we had it down to really a science," Trump said. "It was down to a point where people just weren't getting in, unless they came in legally." Most of Trump's new construction involved bolstering or replacing existing wall or fencing, with fewer than 50 miles of it being constructed where none stood previously. The detention of migrants at the frontier reached its highest level in 15 years in March, and Biden critics accused the president of downplaying the situation. Republican lawmakers have slammed Biden for reversing some of Trump's programs including his "remain in Mexico" policy, which had forced thousands of asylum seekers from Central America to stay south of the US border until their claims were processed. Abbott, seated next to Trump, took aim at Biden's policies during the briefing. "Things have changed so quickly and so dramatically under the Biden administration, it's been amazing and disastrous," the governor said, noting that the number of people apprehended crossing the border in May was 800 percent higher than in the same month last year. Critics have also warned of the surge in drug trafficking into the United States, particularly of fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid. Biden last week dispatched Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he has tasked with overseeing efforts to stem migration, to the border region where she highlighted the administration's commitment to "orderly and humane" immigration policies. Harris visited El Paso, but received withering criticism because the border city is hundreds of miles from the epicenter of the migration surge. Trump, who may yet seek re-election in 2024 but has not announced his plans, has repeatedly knocked Biden for the border crisis. The Democratic Party has pushed back, saying Republicans were bringing their "clown show" to the border to mislead voters. Trump, who has been booted from social media and was impeached for inciting the deadly January 6 riot at the US Capitol, has recently increased his public appearances as he gears up for a political season ahead of next year's midterm elections. Last week in Ohio he held his first campaign-style rally since leaving the White House, repeating the falsehood that he won November's election but Biden prevailed through fraud. He returned to the theme in Texas. "We have a sick country in many ways, it's sick in elections and it's sick on the border," he said. "If you don't have good elections, and if you don't have a strong border, you don't have a country."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/trump-at-us-mexico-border-highlights-dangerous-migrant-surge/articleshow/84000716.cms||---

Atlanta police Officer CJ Johnson said the shooting happened in the Midtown district. Authorities asked the public to avoid a portion of Peachtree Street, a major thoroughfare through the heart of the city. Patrick Walker, who works as a concierge for the apartment building, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he heard a barrage of gunfire. Walker was at the hotel's front desk when he heard the shots and saw police come running through the doors. Employees and others in the lobby tried to find safety, he said. Walker then saw an officer being carried out by his arms and legs "bleeding so bad," he told the newspaper. The shooting happened on Peachtree Street one block north of the Fox Theatre and Georgian Terrace Hotel, where cast members of ``Gone With The Wind'' stayed when the movie made its Atlanta premier. Video from local television stations showed a large number of police officers and police cars outside an apartment building after the shooting. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation says it's investigating the shooting at the Atlanta Police Department's request. No other details were immediately released.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/police-officer-wounded-in-shooting-in-busy-atlanta-district/articleshow/84000728.cms||---

The technique involves giving people regular feedback on their water use, suggesting usage goals, providing feedback on reaching them and finally, conservation tips. These messages and feedback were given just for a few weeks to bring about long-lasting changes in people’s behaviour. The study covered 120 households for two years (2016-2018). While the researchers intervened for a few weeks, they continued to observe the households to see how long their behaviour lasted. The results are based on 88,560 household days of data. The study was conducted by Vivek, a PhD graduate, Deepak Malghan, associate professor of public policy, and Kanchan Mukherjee, professor of organisational behaviour, and published earlier this month in the journal, PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America). The multi-year study is claimed to be among the first in the world that used behavioural interventions alone to influence household water conservation in the long term. But how did they manage to change people’s behaviour? The study groups were divided into four with different levels of interventions. “Test group 1 received a weekly message informing it of their water usage and group 2 got the usage information plus a suggested goal (as recommended by WHO), along with feedback on how their actual usage compared to the suggested goal. Group 3 received the same content of conservation tips in pictorial forms, like how to take a navy shower or wash veggies in a bowl,” a researcher said. The other two treated groups responded less favourably, and their initial response disappeared over time. The results suggest that group 3 households changed their habits through goal-based motivation to change. This intervention, which lasted for five weeks, yielded a 15-25% reduction in water consumption. This shows that tweaking behaviour in a consistent manner coupled with effective messaging could achieve long-term reduction. Such interventions could be a powerful tool to address growing freshwater scarcity in cities. Deepak Malghan said: “These findings also expand the scope of behavioural interventions to numerous other settings, such as in the larger environment and resource sectors, without the political and social difficulties associated with price-based policies.” A researcher said the next step is to integrate the behavioural interventions for largescale implementation in cities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/iim-b-researchers-devise-behavioural-change-technique-to-monitor-water-use/articleshow/84001236.cms||---

On Tuesday, Shivakumar held a meeting with Raksha Ramaiah and Mohammed Nalpad in the presence of AICC youth wing president BV Srinivas and in-charge of youth wing Krishna Allavaru, and reportedly convinced both to share the post between them for 18 months each. But Siddaramaiah objected to the proposal claiming the party has already announced Raksha as president and that he should be allowed to complete his full-term. Sources said he also spoke to AICC general secretary incharge of Karnataka Randeep Surjewala expressing his displeasure. Surjewala is now expected to arrive in Karnataka to resolve the issue. Raksha was elected youth wing president in February this year in a controversial election after his rival Nalpad, who won the highest number of votes, was disqualified. Nalpad was declared ineligible owing to criminal cases pending against him. Raksha and Nalpad have been at loggerheads after the election backed by Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar, respectively. Raksha is the son of former minister MR Seetharam of the Congress and Nalpad is son of Congress MLA Mohammed Haris. Shivakumar’s camp is backing Nalpad, contending that the high command should not have allowed him to contest the election if the party’s rules prohibit persons with criminal antecedents from holding any position. In the election that was held online amid the pandemic, Nalpad and Raksha polled 64,203 and 57,271 votes, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/stalemate-over-youth-cong-prez-election-continues/articleshow/84001361.cms||---

However, another Sikh group led by Gurudwara Parbandhak Committee, Budgam, disagreed with APSCC's statement. “Few Sikh leaders made offensive statements which were not acceptable and we condemn that,” said APSCC President Jagmohan Singh Raina. Stating that the Sikh community in Jammu & Kashmir has been living in harmony with the Muslim community, Raina said that it is important that both Muslims and Sikhs maintain their communal harmony and brotherhood. However, Pervender Singh Chopra of Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, Budgam, and credited Delhi's Sikh leadership for getting their voice heard. Without taking any leader's name, the Jammu and Kashmir Civil Society (JKCS) cautioned against the attempts by "few" to give communal colour to the incident of the two Sikh girls marrying Muslims. One of the members of JKCS, Altaf Wani, said they assured the Sikh leadership, including the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (DSGMC) President Manjinder Singh Sirsa, of all help. “We not only assured all kinds of help to the Sikh community but also urged them to not give these incidents a religious and communal colour which could prove detrimental to the peace and communal harmony of the valley” he said. When asked about the marriage of one of the Sikh girls, Manmeet Kaur, who despite marrying a Muslim man in court on June 26, married a Sikh man on Tuesday, Altaf Wani, said that “It was due to the efforts of the majority community of valley, JKCS and the Sikh community that the girl was brought from her Muslim husband's home and handed over to her parents so that there is no confusion that she was kidnapped." However, he said the JKCS is of the view that before marrying Manmeet to a Sikh man, the community should have resolved the legal issue first, since Manmeet was legally married to Ashiq on June 26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-sikh-body-blames-delhi-leaders-for-provocative-statements-asks-people-to-maintain-communal-harmony/articleshow/83998140.cms||Yudhvir Rana

Laxamma had stood outside the temple, thronged by many, in Kagawad taluk, but she saw it clear as day: the idol had a pair of eyes, below the embedded ones and they were open, unblinking. From June 23, hundreds of devotees rushed to the temple in Ainapur village to behold the sight. The images, captured on mobile phones and circulated far and wide on social media and chat groups, drew more devotees. “When lockdown restrictions were eased, I went to temple and found that Devi had opened her eyes. I saw this from outside the shrine as the doors were locked. I told the villagers about it too. Later, the priest and villagers said Santubai had opened her eyes to ward off coronavirus from our village,” said Laxamma. Many offered puja and left behind huge offerings of food, grains, oil and money, believing that the darshan would bring good fortune in life and business, hit by the pandemic. Others even maintained that visiting the deity would protect them from Covid-19 and other serious ailments. But while the crowds surged, Kagawad tahsildar Pramila Deshpande smelt a rat. “About 3-4 days after word spread of the so-called miracle, I told local officials to look into the matter,” said Deshpande. “Though some people were certain that the miracle was manmade, the priest, Chandru Kamble, and villagers were convinced that the goddess had opened her eyes. So I visited the temple and opened the doors. We found the eyes and eyebrows were plastic stickers, nothing else.” Deshpande warned the priest and gram panchayat members against spreading rumours and superstition. “I made the priest remove the stickers. He said it was the work of miscreants and not priests working at the temple,” Deshpande said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/plastic-eyes-a-covid-miracle-at-belagavi-temple/articleshow/84001385.cms||Basavaraj Meeshi

This can be gauged from the list of states and cities which recently won India Smart Cities Award Contest (ISAC)-2020 last week. Neither the state nor its seven cities (Bengaluru, Belagavi, Davanagere, Hubballi-Dharwad, Mangaluru, Shivamogga, and Tumakuru) selected under the project won awards in the overall performance category. The only consolation was Bengaluru bagging an award for good management and implementation of solutions for controlling Covid-19 last year and Tumakuru winning for the Digital Library Solution project. The award was instituted by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs for the first time to commemorate six years of the Smart City Mission. Uttar Pradesh is the top performer among all states in rankings, followed by Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.  Among cities, Indore and Surat were adjudged joint winners, and Chandigarh was ranked the first among Union territories. The awards were given on the basis of several parameters, such as social aspects, governance, culture, urban environment, sanitation, economy, environment, water and urban mobility.  For the year of the pandemic, additional parameters of sustainable business model of Integrated Command and Control Centres and innovation in Covid-19 management were considered. According to urban development department officials, more weightage was given for utilisation of funds, projects executed, those in the tender stage and awarded by the smart cities. As per the current ranking of Smart Cities based on the performance of civic bodies, Hubbali-Dharwad is the best as it stands at 21st position among all 100 cities in the country, followed by Tumakuru (23) Bengaluru (31), Belagavi (33), Shivamogga(34), Mangaluru (42) and Davanagere (46). “We’ve done well in implementation and fund utilisation. We have won awards on previous occasions and increased our funding,’’ said CW Shakeel Ahmed, managing director, Hubballi Dharwad Smart City Limited. Almost on all fronts, the progress of Smart City projects is onat a snail’s pace, according to UDD officials. “The Covid-induced lockdown has affected the pace and fund flow, threatening to delay the projects by nearly 6-12 months,’’ said a project head. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa recently pulled up officials for slow progress of works. He had asked them to ensure better coordination among various civic agencies such as electricity supply companies, corporations and traffic police for expediting the works. After coming to power, the BJP government had promised to “change the face” of many cities, particularly Bengaluru, which have been facing traffic congestion and problems related to housing, drainage and drinking water. Karnataka has already proposed to include Mysuru, Ballari, Vijayapura and Kalaburagi under the initiative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/smart-cities-miss-key-awards-as-projects-move-at-snails-pace/articleshow/84001391.cms||Manu Aiyappa

However, the respondent-state is at liberty to proceed with implementation of the notification,” Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum said. The notification under challenge was issued on June 8, calling upon undergraduates who have secured government quota seats and completed their MBBS exams in the academic year 2021 to register for rural posting. A corrigendum was issued on June 17. The date for starting government service was June 30 and a penalty of Rs 10 lakh is payable to the government by those who fail to abide by rules vis-a-vis rural service. According to the petitioners, Dr Prarthana N and others, the notification is discriminatory and arbitrary as it excludes other undergraduates of the same batch (management quota) and is also contrary to Karnataka Compulsory Service by Candidates Completed Medical Courses Act 2012 and the Karnataka Compulsory Service by Candidates Completed Medical Courses Act Rules, 2015 . To pursue higher education, they argued, they had to appear for NEET and the rural service stipulation would affect their preparation. On the legal aspects, the petitioners have asserted that the National Medical Commission (NMC) Act has ushered in a paradigm shift in the national medical courses admission policies and the states have lost their right to regulate medical college admissions through policymaking and legislation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/medicos-say-rural-posting-order-arbitrary/articleshow/84001393.cms||---

Led by agriculture minister BC Patil, the VCs pointed out that 45 per cent of teaching and over 55 per cent of non-teaching posts are still vacant. The acute manpower shortage has been affecting research and burdening the existing staff who have been given additional workload, they said. Under the All India Coordinated Research Project and Krishi Vignan Kendra funding pattern, the universities were getting 80 and 100 per cent of allocation towards employing manpower. The VCs said the state government is yet to sanction the call for these personnel and requested immediate assistance. They also urged the CM to increase grants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/vcs-to-cm-fill-vacancies-in-agri-varsities/articleshow/84001401.cms||---
---||World||Wyoming man accused of torching toddler has bail set at $1 million||CHEYENNE: A Wyoming man accused of burning a toddler with a butane torch, killing him and disposing of his body in an apartment complex dumpster in February has had his bail set at $1 million.  Bail was set for Wyatt Dean Lamb, the boyfriend of the girl's mother, after he made his first court appearance Tuesday in Cheyenne when he was formally informed of the charges he faces.  Lamb, 27, was not asked to enter a plea to one count of first-degree murder and 10 counts of child abuse in the death of 2-year-old Athian Rivera.  Lamb could face the death penalty but prosecutors have not said if they plan to seek it.  Athian went missing on Feb. 19, triggering a search that ended about two hours later with the discovery of his body wrapped in a sheet, blanket and five trash bags in a dumpster near the apartment where he lived, according to a police investigative affidavit filed in court.  The boy's injuries included numerous abrasions and bruises on his head, back, chest, belly and arms - and burns to his groin consistent with a butane torch found in the apartment where the boy lived, according to a summary of the coroner's findings in the affidavit.  The details about the boy's injuries and cause of death were not revealed until this week, when the police affidavit was made public in court.  Lamb had been living with the boy's mother, Kassandra Orona, and her three children in the apartment, Orona told investigators, according to the affidavit.  Orona and Lamb used the two-burner butane torch to smoke marijuana, she told investigators.  The size and shape of the torch's burners "appeared very similar to the shape and size of the burns on Athian," the affidavit said. The boy died two to four hours before he was found of blunt force trauma, lack of oxygen to the brain, or both, the coroner concluded.  Orona told police that Lamb was watching her three children the night before her son was killed while she worked a sandwich shop shift, court documents said.  She told investigators she arrived home at about 3:30 a.m. and was later awakened by Lamb, who wanted her to drive her daughter to school a few minutes away because the girl was running late, according to the documents.  After Orona and Lamb got back, Orona told investigators that she went back to bed. Lamb woke her up just after 12 p.m., saying Athian was missing, according to her account provided to investigators.  Lamb told police he returned to his apartment after Orona got home from work but returned by taxi later that morning when Orona called and said Athian was missing. Police said they went to an address where Lamb previously lived but that he had moved out in August 2020, court documents said.  And several taxi companies contacted by investigators reported no record of a trip that day to Orona's apartment, police alleged in court documents.  Lamb was arrested and jailed after Athian's body was found but on unrelated charges. He faced bond revocation related to a 2020 charge of felony strangulation of Orona and with misdemeanor property destruction and interfering with a peace officer.  Orona had missed a hearing in that case last summer and had been prohibited from living with Orona, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reported.  Lamb's attorney, Ericka Smith, didn't immediately return a phone message Wednesday seeking comment her client's case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/wyoming-man-accused-of-torching-toddler-has-bail-set-at-1-million/articleshow/84001584.cms||---

Kataluna Enriquez, 27, will represent the western US state at the national competition in November after her groundbreaking regional win in Las Vegas on Sunday. "My community, you are always in my heart. My win is our win. We just made history," wrote Enriquez on Instagram. Enriquez, who is of Filipino descent, began competing in transgender beauty pageants in 2016, and first entered cisgender competitions last year. During the Miss Nevada pageant, Enriquez - who designs and sews her own outfits - spoke of the harassment and violence she has faced. "I told the judges that as a transgender woman of color and a survivor of physical and sexual abuse, I am everything that is underrepresented in this country," she told the Las Vegas Review Journal. "Our voices matter. Those whose voices aren't always heard deserve the chance to be heard." The winner of Miss USA progresses to the Miss Universe pageant, which was formerly owned by Donald Trump. Miss Universe changed its rules in 2012 to allow transgender beauty queens to enter, after previously citing a rule that only "naturally born" women could compete. If she reaches Miss Universe, Enriquez would be the global competition's second transgender competitor, after Spain's Angela Ponce in 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/first-transgender-woman-to-compete-for-miss-usa-title/articleshow/84001801.cms||---
---||World||Former defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld dies at 88||WASHINGTON: Donald Rumsfeld, the two-time defense secretary and a one-time presidential candidate whose reputation as a skilled bureaucrat and visionary of a modern US military was soiled by the long and costly Iraq war, has died, his family said in a statement released Tuesday. He was 88. Regarded by former colleagues as equally smart and combative, patriotic and politically cunning, Rumsfeld had a storied career under four presidents and nearly a quarter-century in corporate America. In 2001 he began his second tour as Pentagon chief under President George W. Bush, but his plan to "transform'' the armed forces was overshadowed by the September 11 terrorist attacks. He oversaw the US invasion of Afghanistan and the 2003 overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, where he was blamed for setbacks including the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal and for being slow to recognize a violent insurgency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/former-defense-secretary-donald-rumsfeld-dies-at-88/articleshow/84001880.cms||---
---||World||Crypto art about gender transition fetches $2.16 million at Christie's||LONDON/NEW YORK: A Christie's auction of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and physical artwork by 18-year-old transgender artist FEWOCiOUS fetched $2.16 million, Christie's said on Wednesday, the latest sign of appetite among art collectors for blockchain-based assets.  An NFT is a form of crypto asset which uses blockchain to record the ownership status of digital objects, such as images, videos and text. While anyone can view the item, only the buyer of an NFT has the official status of being its owner.  In an online auction called 'Hello, I'm Victor (FEWOCiOUS) and this is my life,' Christie's sold five lots by FEWOCiOUS, whose real name is Victor Langlois.  The five lots which drew more than 20 bidders, represent one year of Seattle-based Langlois' life as he discovered his gender identity and transitioned from female to male between the ages of 14 and 18.  Langlois is the youngest ever artist to have a sale at Christie's.  Each lot consists of a video artwork that exists in digital form only, sold as an NFT, a set of doodles, drawings and journal entries from the corresponding year in both physical and NFT form, as well as a physical-only painting.  "I feel like, a lot of times, trans voices aren't heard or aren't as respected, so to have my platform to say 'hey look, this is my life and look at what we're doing - it means the world," Langlois said in an interview.  The sale was the latest in a series of moves by traditional auction houses to embrace NFTs, which surged in popularity in early 2021.  "I think NFTs are the future," said Langlois, who also owns cryptocurrencies.  "If you're posting your art and sharing it with the world digitally, I think to offer a way for collectors to own it as a digital asset is just the next step," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/crypto-art-about-gender-transition-fetches-2-16-million-at-christies/articleshow/84002326.cms||---
---||World||US says 'pipe bomb' found in home of ex-cop charged in Capitol attack||A Virginia man awaiting trial on criminal charges stemming from the Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol recently procured a pipe bomb and other weapons, a violation of his parole, federal prosecutors said on Wednesday. US Justice Department lawyers said in a court filing that they discovered a "loaded M4 rifle" and a "partially assembled pipe bomb," among other weapons, during a search of Thomas Robertson's home in Ferrum, Virginia. Robertson is a former police sergeant in Rocky Mount, Virginia. The town's police department fired him and another officer, Jacob Fracker, and photographs surfaced of them inside the Capitol building during the deadly attack. The two were charged on Jan. 13 with unlawful entry into a restricted area and violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. A judge released Robertson from jail while he awaits trial, prohibiting him from possessing firearms. Prosecutors said in Wednesday's court filing that the release order should be revoked immediately because Robertson violated the judge's orders and "presents a danger to the community that no release conditions will adequately mitigate." Prosecutors did not say if Robertson planned to use the weapons, but alleged he recently made comments on an internet forum that suggest he is capable of violence. "I have learned very well that if you dip your toe into the Rubicon ... cross it," Robertson allegedly said on the website Gunbroker.com. "Cross it hard and violent and play for all the marbles." Prosecutors said Robertson's "possession of an explosive device and firearms, coupled with his extreme rhetoric advocating for violence indicating no remorse illustrate that the pending charges are unlikely to serve as a deterrent to future violence." Mark Rollins, a lawyer for Robertson, did not immediately respond to a voicemail seeking comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-says-pipe-bomb-found-in-home-of-ex-cop-charged-in-capitol-attack/articleshow/84002235.cms||---
---||World||Mexico's richest man to rebuild, pay for collapsed subway||MEXICO CITY: Mexico's richest man has pledged to rebuild and pay for a segment of a Mexico City subway line that collapsed on May, killing 26 people, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday.  Lopez Obrador said telecom and construction magnate Carlos Slim has promised to pay for the rebuilding out of his own pocket and have it back in service in a year. One of his companies had originally built much of the section where the collapse occurred.  "He is going to take charge of rebuilding the whole stretch, being careful to ensure it is safe enough, without any cost to the public," the president said.  "He is going to pay for everything, he promised," Lopez Obrador said. "He is not going to wait for the legal question (to be resolved), so that it can be back up and working for the benifit of the public again in one year."  One of Slim's companies largely built the troubled section of the Line 12 subway. Slim has denied there were construction defects, but a study by an outside certification company cited poor welds in studs that joined steel support beams to a concrete layer supporting the track bed.  The city government hired Norwegian certification firm DNV to study the possible causes of the May 3 accident, in which a span of the elevated line buckled to the ground, dragging down two subway cars.  The report said there were apparently not enough studs, and the concrete poured over them may have been defective; the welds between stretches of steel beams also appear to have been badly done.  The existence of construction defects when the line was built between 2010 and 2012 could be a major blow to Slim and to the political career of Mexico's top diplomat, Marcelo Ebrard, who was mayor at the time.  Another round of studies is to be carried out, and a criminal investigation has not yet resulted in any charges.  For almost a decade, there have been reports that the project was rushed to completion so the Number 12 subway line could be inaugurated by Ebrard, the current foreign relations secretary, before he left office as mayor in 2012.  The collapse was also embarrassing for Slim, currently Mexico's richest man and once the world's wealthiest. Slim is an engineer by training and his firms are currently involved in building some parts of the controversial Maya Train project, which will circle the Yucatan Peninsula.  Any suggestions his firm did shoddy work on the subway would be a serious blow to his reputation as a sort of elder statesman of the Mexican business community.  Since the May accident, much of the line has been closed. The elevated portion of the tracks rise about 16 feet (5 meters) above a median strip and roadway in the poor southern borough of Tlahuac. Slender, reinforced concrete columns are topped by horizontal steel beams, which in turn support concrete track beds on which gravel, railway ties and tracks are laid.  Mexico City's subway, which serves 4.6 million riders a day, has never had the one thing it needs most: money. With ticket prices stuck at 25 cents per ride, one of the lowest rates in the world, the system has never come close to paying its own costs, and depends on massive government subsidies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/mexicos-richest-man-to-rebuild-pay-for-collapsed-subway/articleshow/84002899.cms||---
---||World||El Salvador's appointment of new judges raises fears of power grab||SAN SALVADOR: Lawmakers in El Salvador on Wednesday voted to keep the head of the Supreme Court in place for three more years and appointed five new justices, triggering concerns that President Nayib Bukele is shoring up a bid to consolidate power.  Bukele's New Ideas (NI) party and its allies hold a super-majority in El Salvador's Congress, where lawmakers have now appointed 10 court judges in less than two months.  Supreme Court President Oscar Lopez was first appointed last month, just as Bukele's legislative allies abruptly ousted five judges as well as the attorney general in a move that was harshly criticized by the United States and international rights groups as a dangerous power grab.  The new judges to the 15-seat court will be able to serve for nine years.  Bukele said lawmakers voted in line with the constitution and selected the judges from candidate lists submitted by bar associations.  "Their decisions are totally legitimate and represent the power of the people," Bukele said on Twitter.  However, during the congressional session that began on Tuesday and stretched until dawn, lawmaker Dina Argueta from the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) warned that the new judges were Bukele loyalists whose appointments marked a "concentration of power."  Jose Miguel Vivanco, the head of Human Rights Watch in the Americas, also expressed worry that the new judges would not be impartial.  "I am concerned about the appointment of judges to be made tonight," he wrote on Twitter shortly before the vote.  "Under rule of law, judges must be appointed through a transparent, previously established process that guarantees their independence."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/el-salvadors-appointment-of-new-judges-raises-fears-of-power-grab/articleshow/84003212.cms||---

The CBI plea was made on grounds that the CM and Ghatak had led a dharna at its Kolkata office and that “mobocracy” vitiated court proceedings on May 17, the day two TMC ministers, an MLA and an ex-mayor, were arrested in the case. On Wednesday, an HC bench allowed the applications filed by the state, the CM and the law minister, subject to payment of Rs 5,000 by each. The bench also granted the CBI 10 days to file its reply. The next hearing is scheduled for July 15. The applicants had moved the bench on the directions of the Supreme Court, which annulled the HC bench’s order. It had refused to take on record their affidavits on the ground that they were waiting to do so after arguments in the case concluded. In her reply affidavit, the CM denied the CBI allegations about the events following the arrest of ministers Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim, MLA Madan Mitra and former TMC functionary Sovan Chatterjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-to-accept-affidavits-of-didi-law-minister-in-narada-case/articleshow/84002376.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||World||House votes to launch new probe of January 6 insurrection||WASHINGTON: Split along party lines, the House launched a new investigation of the January 6 Capitol insurrection on Wednesday, approving a special committee to probe the violent attack as police officers who were injured fighting former President Donald Trump's supporters watched from the gallery above. The vote to form the panel was 222-190, with Republicans objecting that majority Democrats would be in charge. The action came after Senate Republicans blocked creation of an independent commission that would have been evenly split between the two parties. Emphasizing the importance that Democrats attached to the vote, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told lawmakers in the chamber: "We will be judged by future generations as to how we value our democracy." Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who lost her position in GOP leadership because of her criticism of Trump, was one of only two Republicans to vote for the panel. She declared, "Our nation, and the families of the brave law enforcement officers who were injured defending us or died following the attack, deserve answers." But Ohio Republican Brad Wenstrup rejected the new probe as "incomplete and insufficient'' because it would not look into other incidents including the 2017 shooting at a baseball field that badly injured GOP Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana. Pelosi said she preferred that an independent panel lead the inquiry but Congress could wait no longer to begin a deeper look at the insurrection that was the worst attack on the Capitol in more than 200 years. Tensions have worsened in Congress since Trump's supporters laid siege, aiming to stop Congress' certification of Trump's loss to Democrat Joe Biden. A brief sense of shared outrage has given way to partisan politics and attempts among some Republicans to downplay the events of the day. Most Republicans have made clear they want to move on from the insurrection - and Trump's role - though many of them had fled the violent mob themselves. Democrats expressed frustration with those Republicans who have complained that the investigation would be partisan after their party blocked the bipartisan panel. "I think for some on the other side, nothing that gets to the truth will ever be good enough, because they do not want the truth,'' said Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, who led the debate ahead of the vote. The panel would be led by Democrats, with Pelosi appointing a chairperson and at least eight of the committee's 13 members. The resolution gives her a possible say in the appointment of the other five members as well, directing that they will be named "after consultation'' with House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy. GOP leaders have declined to say whether Republicans will even participate. In a memo to all House Republicans late Tuesday, No. 2 House Republican Scalise urged his members to vote against the resolution, saying the committee "is likely to pursue a partisan agenda." The GOP role in the probe, and the appointments to the panel, could help determine whether the committee becomes a bipartisan effort or a tool of further division. Two Senate committees issued a bipartisan report with security recommendations earlier this month, but it did not examine the origins of the siege, leaving many unanswered questions about the events of the day. McCarthy is facing pressure to take the investigation seriously from police officers who responded to the attack, several of whom sat in the gallery and watched the debate. Dozens of officers suffered injuries that day as Trump's supporters pushed past them and broke into the building to interrupt the certification President Biden's victory. The spectators included Metropolitan Police Officers Michael Fanone and Daniel Hodges and Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn. Fanone has described being dragged down the Capitol steps by rioters who shocked him with a stun gun and beat him. Hodges was crushed between two doors. And Dunn has said that rioters yelled racial slurs and fought him in what resembled hand to hand combat as he held them back. Also in the gallery were Gladys Sicknick and Sandra Garza, the mother and partner of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who collapsed and later died after engaging with the protesters. He was sprayed with chemical irritants, but a medical examiner determined he died of natural causes. Fanone and Dunn met with McCarthy on Friday. Fanone said he asked McCarthy for a commitment not to put "the wrong people'' on the panel, a reference to those in the GOP who have played down the violence and defended the insurrectionists. He said McCarthy told him he would take his request seriously. Trump was twice impeached by the House and twice acquitted by the Senate, the second time for telling his supporters just before the insurrection to "fight like hell'' to overturn his defeat to Biden. Pelosi has not yet said who will lead the panel, but one possibility is House Homeland Security Committee Chair Bennie Thompson, D-Miss. Thompson said Tuesday that it would be an honor to serve as chair and that it's Pelosi's call if she wants to have a say on the Republican members. "They had an opportunity to really engage,'' Thompson said of Republicans who voted against the bipartisan commission. "And they didn't. So they can't now come back and say, `Oh, that's not fair.'" Many Republicans have expressed concerns about a partisan probe, since majority Democrats are likely to investigate Trump's role in the siege and the groups that participated in it. Almost three dozen House Republicans voted last month for the legislation to create an independent commission, and seven Republicans in the Senate have also supported moving forward on that bill. But that was short of the 10 Senate Republicans who would be necessary to pass it. Many Republicans have made clear that they want to move on from the Jan. 6 attack. And some have gone further, including Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia, who suggested that video of the rioters looked like a "tourist visit." Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona insisted that a Trump supporter named Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed that day while trying to break into the House chamber, was "executed.'' Others have defended rioters charged with federal crimes. Seven people died during and after the rioting, including Babbitt and three other Trump supporters who suffered medical emergencies. Two police officers died by suicide in the days that followed, and a third officer, Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, collapsed and later died after engaging with the protesters. A medical examiner determined he died of natural causes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/house-votes-to-launch-new-probe-of-january-6-insurrection/articleshow/84003178.cms||---

The CJI also spoke on the impact of social media and the need to be wary of the “noise” that it amplified as it was not necessarily what was right or what the majority believed in. This, however, should not be understood as meaning that “judges and the judiciary need to completely disassociate from what is going on”. “Judges cannot stay in ivory castles and decide questions which pertain to social issues,” he said. Delivering the 17th P D Desai memorial lecture, CJI Ramana said, “Mere right to change the ruler, once every few years, by itself need not be a guarantee against tyranny. The idea that people are the ultimate sovereign is also to be found in notions of human dignity and autonomy. A public discourse, that is both reasoned and reasonable, is to be seen as an inherent aspect of human dignity and, hence, essential to a properly functioning democracy... day to day political discourses, criticisms and voicing of protests is integral to the democratic process. Read AlsoWhy we need two PMs – one for campaigning, one for governingIn the middle of the largest Covid wave across the world, every country deserves a Prime Minister who does nothing except focus on fighting the pandemic“We live in a democracy. The very essence of a democracy is that its citizenry has a role to play, whether directly or indirectly, in the laws that govern them. In India, it is done through elections, where the people get to exercise their universal adult franchise to elect the people who form part of Parliament which enacts laws. Incidentally, we, the Indian people, gave ourselves the universal adult franchise from day one of the coming into existence of our republic, unlike some of the advanced democracies.” The CJI further said, “In the 17 national general elections held so far, the people have changed the ruling party or combination of parties eight times. In spite of largescale inequalities, illiteracy, backwardness, poverty and alleged ignorance, the people of independent India have proved themselves to be intelligent and up to the task.” Read AlsoWhy Central Vista seems like a criminal waste right nowWith healthcare systems crumbling in the second wave of Covid, spending Rs 30,000 cr on a vanity project is unjustifiableSpeaking on the civilisational importance of rule of law in a democracy, the CJI linked it to a “strong and independent judiciary”. “The judiciary is the primary organ which is tasked with ensuring that the laws which are enacted are in line with the Constitution. This is one of the main functions of the judiciary, that of judicial review of laws, which is part of the basic structure and cannot be curtailed by Parliament,” he said, adding that the task of upholding constitutional values must be shared equally by the judiciary, the legislature and the executive. “For the judiciary to apply checks on governmental power and action, it has to have complete freedom. The judiciary cannot be controlled, directly or indirectly, by the legislature or the executive, or else rule of law would become illusory. At the same time, judges should not be swayed by the emotional pitch of public opinion either, which is getting amplified through social media platforms,” the CJI said. “Judges have to be mindful of the fact that the noise thus amplified is not necessarily reflective of what is right and what the majority believes in. The new media tools that have enormous amplifying ability are incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong, good and bad and the real and fake. Therefore, media trials cannot be a guiding factor in deciding cases. It is, therefore, extremely vital to function independently and withstand all external aids and pressures. While there is a lot of discussion about pressure from the executive, it is also imperative to start a discourse as to how social media trends can affect the institutions,” he added. The CJI said the Covid-19 pandemic had accentuated the importance of rule of law and cast an obligation on courts to use this concept liberally to ensure protection to and welfare of people from all sections of society. “I began to feel that this pandemic might yet be a mere curtain-raiser to much larger crises in the decades to come. Surely, we must at least begin the process of analysing what we did right and where we went wrong,” he added. Touching on the importance of gender justice in a democracy, Justice Ramana said, “The legal empowerment of women not only enables them to advocate for their rights and needs in society, but it also increases their visibility in the legal reform process and allows their participation in it. “Bias and prejudice necessarily lead to injustice, particularly when it relates to the minorities. Consequently, application of the principles of rule of law in respect of vulnerable sections has to necessarily be more inclusive of their social conditions that hinder their progress.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cji-polls-no-guarantee-against-tyranny-of-elected/articleshow/84003422.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Gov. Phil Murphy said Wednesday that an order he signed ending a public health emergency contained a "sunset" provision winding down the smoking ban within 30 days, which is Sunday.  While acknowledging gamblers will be free to light up again starting Sunday, the Democratic governor indicated he would look favorably on a measure lawmakers are considering to permanently end smoking in New Jersey's casinos.  "I would be very constructive on that," he said at a coronavirus briefing, stopping short of saying he would sign the legislation.  The governor's remarks came two hours after dozens of casino workers and anti-smoking advocates rallied on the Atlantic City boardwalk to call for a permanent smoking ban.  Casinos are exempted from a state law banning most indoor smoking, while an Atlantic City law limits smoking to no more than 25% of the casino floor.  New Jersey has even prohibited smoking on beaches and public parks, which was not lost on many of the rallying casino workers.  "How is it that you're not allowed to smoke on our beaches or our boardwalk, but you're allowed to smoke at my table where I can't walk away?" asked Nicole Vitola, a table games dealer at the Borgata. "All I want is the same right that every other worker in New Jersey receives."  Janice Green, a dealer at the Tropicana, has worked in Atlantic City casinos for 40 years.  "Being in the business so long, I have lung disease," she said. "I have asthma because of it. It's under control now, but if you bring smoking back, I'm going to be back on inhalers, and I don't want that." Murphy ordered Atlantic City's casinos to close in March 2020 during the pandemic, and when they reopened 3 1/2 months later, smoking was banned as a public health measure.  "Why is this the only place in New Jersey you can smoke?" said Alvaro Dente, a casino floor supervisor at the Tropicana. "Bars and restaurants don't allow it. And the casinos are not losing money."  Onjewel Smith of the group Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights said the casino workers at greatest risk from smoking "are the mostly Black and brown women, front-line workers. They are the ones putting their lives at risk every day."  The Casino Association of New Jersey, a trade group, opposes a permanent smoking ban, saying it could cause long-term financial implications.  "Going completely nonsmoking would place Atlantic City casinos at a competitive disadvantage with other nearby casinos that allow smoking," the group said in a statement.  Such a ban would lead to fewer customers, fewer casino jobs and lower tax revenue, it said.  The casinos say they have spent considerable sums on cleaning and air filtration systems to protect customers.  And a considerable amount of gamblers say that smoking is an integral part of their gambling experience.  But nonsmoker Tom Cushion, who visits casinos once or twice a week, has loved the smoke-free atmosphere for the past year.  "You can feel the difference," said Cushion, who lives in Galloway, just outside Atlantic City. "That stale, smoky smell - you don't have that anymore. It's time to go smoke-free."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/new-jersey-gamblers-can-light-up-sunday-as-smoking-ban-ends/articleshow/84003495.cms||---
---||World||Burkina president sacks two ministers over massacres||OUAGADOUGOU: President Roch Marc Christian Kabore of Burkina Faso sacked two of his ministers on Wednesday over recent massacres there that have provoked protest among civilians over growing insecurity. Kabore himself took over from Cheriff Sy as defence minister, while he appointed Maxime Kone as security minister in place of Ousseni Compaore, according to two statements from the government. A cabinet meeting will be held on Thursday at the presidential palace to confirm all members of the government, a spokesman said. Earlier this month, the opposition called for the resignation of Prime Minister Christophe Dabire and Sy to take responsibility for the rising tide of jihadist violence. Burkina Faso has faced increasingly frequent and deadly attacks by jihadist groups since 2015. These have killed around 1,500 people and forced almost 1.5 million to flee their homes. Security forces in the impoverished west African country seem powerless to stop the violence, although they regularly claim to have carried out successful operations against these groups. Two suspected jihadists including a local commander were detained after the massacre, the public prosecutor said on Tuesday. An attack on the village of Solhan on the night of June 4 by armed men - including "young people aged 12 to 14" according to the authorities - killed at least 132 people according to the government. The toll was 160 according to local sources, including many children. Angry demonstrations by thousands of Burkinabe against the violence have already taken place across the country and more are planned for next weekend at the call of the opposition and civil society. On Tuesday, the Balai Citoyen citizens' advocacy group filed a complaint against the government for "non-assistance to persons in danger" during the Solhan attack.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/burkina-president-sacks-two-ministers-over-massacres/articleshow/84002629.cms||---

The deal to buy 20 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine has become a headache for Bolsonaro after whistleblowers went public with alleged irregularities. One health ministry official said he alerted the president about his concerns. Bolsonaro, whose popularity has faded as Brazil's toll climbed past 500,000, has denied any wrongdoing, saying on Monday he was not aware of any irregularities. Health minister Marcelo Queiroga told a news conference his team would investigate the accusations during the suspension. "According to the preliminary analysis of the CGU (federal comptroller), there are no irregularities in the contract but, for compliance, the health ministry chose to suspend the contract," the ministry said in a statement. The contract was also evaluated by the ministry of health's integrity directorate, which will carry out an administrative investigation. Brazilian federal prosecutors have opened an investigation, citing comparatively high prices of about $15 a dose, quick talks and pending regulatory approvals as red flags. In a statement, Bharat Biotech said it had followed a "step-by-step" approach for the regulatory approval and supply contract of its vaccine in Brazil, and had not received advance payments from the health ministry. It added that the pricing of Covaxin had been set between $15 and $20 a dose for supplies to governments outside India. The deal is also being probed by a Senate panel investigating Brazil's handling of the pandemic. One leading opposition senator on the panel, Randolfe Rodrigues, filed a formal criminal complaint against Bolsonaro with the Supreme Court on Monday. He asked the court to investigate why Bolsonaro "did not take any action after being notified of the existence of a giant corruption scheme in the health ministry". On February 26, Bharat Biotech Ltd had said it entered into an agreement with the Brazilian government for the supply of 20 million doses of Covaxin during the second and third quarters of 2021. Earlier, the National Health Surveillance Agency of Brazil, Anvisa, had denied permission to import Covaxin under emergency use authorisation after authorities found that the Indian plant at which the jab was being made did not meet good manufacturing practice requirements. However, Anvisa on June 5 gave clearance to the proposal to import Covaxin into the South American country, with some conditions. The EUA was granted on June 4.

---||Business||Small savings rates left unchanged||NEW DELHI: The government left small savings rates unchanged for the July-September quarter after an uproar over a sharp cut in April had forced it to reverse the decision. This is the fifth straight quarter where rates have been left unchanged, providing respite to middle class investors who park their savings in Public Provident Fund, Senior Citizen Savings Scheme and National Savings Certificate, among other instruments. However, the status quo will make interest rates stickier for banks, which will not be able to reduce deposit rates, fearing a flight of funds to higher-earning products such as PPF that also offer tax benefits. It will make it difficult for banks to significantly lower home loan and other lending rates. Currently, State Bank of India offers the highest rate of 5.4% on fixed deposits with a tenure of five to 10 years. In contrast, PPF deposits will offer 7.1% and will be tax-free. So, an investor in the 30% income-tax bracket can hope to earn over 9% on these funds. The last round of rate cuts, which came in the middle of elections in West Bengal and other states, had to be reversed within hours. Given the weak economic sentiment and concerns over price rise, especially in the wake of petrol and diesel rates crossing the Rs 100-a-litre mark in several parts of the country, the government may not have wanted to upset the middle class further. Besides, in the past, the money, which are government borrowings that flow into the National Small Savings Fund, also came handy in meeting off-budget funding requirements, such as paying for food subsidy or lending to Air India. In the last budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had, however, cleaned up the books by clearing dues of FCI and others directly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/small-savings-rates-left-unchanged/articleshow/84003688.cms||---

---||World||52 Italy prison guards suspended over prisoner beatings||ROME: Fifty-two prison officers have been suspended for their alleged involvement in an assault on inmates who had protested the lack of face masks and virus tests during the peak of Italy's pandemic last year, the justice ministry said Wednesday.  Surveillance video of the club-wielding officers beating, kicking and punching prisoners in a holding room and as they came up and down a staircase was published online Tuesday and Wednesday by the newspaper II Domani.  Some of the prisoners at the Santa Maria Capua Vetere prison in Naples were struck repeatedly while on the floor, bleeding, or as they walked with their hands behind their bowed heads. None was seen resisting or trying to fight back.  Italy's justice ministry said 52 officers and supervisors had been suspended, pending a criminal investigation into the events of April 6, 2020.  Justice Minister Marta Cartabia ordered a full internal investigation into what transpired. She called the episode a betrayal of the Italian constitution, "an offense and an outrage to the dignity of prisoners," as well as to officers who do their jobs well.  "Faced with such grave facts, words are not enough," Cartabia said in a statement. "It's necessary to take action to understand and eliminate the causes so that things like this never happen again."  Italian prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into what some prisoners called a "massacre" after they protested the lack of coronavirus protections following a positive case in the prison during the peak of Italy's outbreak last year.  The officers were seen wearing face masks and some even delivered their blows wearing latex gloves. The prisoners had no masks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/52-italy-prison-guards-suspended-over-prisoner-beatings/articleshow/84003958.cms||---

So, on National Doctor's Day, we asked eminent doctors how the pandemic has changed their perspective towards life and their profession. Here's what Dr Rupali Basu, managing director, Woodlands Multispeciality Hospital Limited, Kolkata has to say… It was a bit of a culture shock for me when I came to Kolkata in 1983 from my hometown, Durgapur. However, I adopted the new life easily and started pursuing my childhood dream of becoming a doctor and started working in the early 90s. But who would have imagined that after 30 years of relentless work, my outlook on life and career would change overnight. The war unleashed by the COVID-19 pandemic turned us, doctors, into frontline warriors.  After MBBS, I completed my higher studies in hospital management and when I joined the profession, we were not this dependent on technology. The pandemic has made me unlearn many things and learn new things. The entire concept of managing a hospital has changed.  At first, COVID-19 was an unknown enemy. We went to this war without knowing if we would return. Despite the enormous losses encountered in this war, the medical fraternity has managed to find success. While changing our life’s perception forever, this experience has made me realise that one should never take anything in life for granted. The pandemic is a harsh reminder of the fact that there are certain rules and regulations in life we cannot afford to disobey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/the-pandemic-has-made-me-realise-that-one-should-never-take-anything-in-life-for-granted/articleshow/84004012.cms||Bishwabijoy Mitra
---||World||Another mild algae bloom forecast for Lake Erie this summer||TOLEDO, Ohio - The toxic blob of algae that turns western Lake Erie a ghastly shade of green each summer and threatens drinking water and fish should be on the smaller side again this year following another dry spring, scientists predicted Wednesday.  Researchers expect this will be the first time in more than a decade that the shallowest of the Great Lakes will see back-to-back years of relatively mild algae blooms. But they caution that it's not a sign the lake is turning the corner just yet.  That's because they say the rosy outlook this year is mainly due to the lack of heavy rains that typically wash phosphorus-laden livestock manure and chemical fertilizers off farm fields and into the lake where it feeds the algae.  "While this is good news, the concentration of phosphorus still remains the same as recent years," said Rick Stumpf, an oceanographer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. "Until we begin to see reductions in the concentration of phosphorus, the next year with above-average rainfall will have a more severe bloom."  Ohio's leaders have been under pressure to combat the blooms since algae toxins in 2014 left more than 400,000 people around Toledo unable to drink their tap water. Up until now, little progress has been made.  Republican Gov. Mike DeWine is betting on cleaning the lake through an ambitious 10-year plan offering farmers financial incentives to adopt new agriculture practices and creating a network of wetlands to capture and filter runoff from fields.  But those efforts are just getting started. The approach is being watched closely by states struggling with an increasing number of algae outbreaks. Some environmental groups are skeptical, but others that have been at odds with the farming industry are hopeful.  The forecast for this summer released by NOAA predicts the bloom will come in at 3 on its severity index - a mild reading on par with last year. Anything above 5 indicates a severe bloom.  The algae outbreaks have become more frequent and severe since 2008. But if this summer's forecast holds true, three of the last four years will be below a 5 on the ratings scale.  During that time, farmers have been planting more cover crops and using new methods to reduce fertilizer runoff, said Jordan Hoewischer, director of water quality and research for Ohio Farm Bureau.  "It doesn't make sense to give all the credit to the weather on years when there is a smaller bloom and put all the blame on the farmers if there is a big bloom," he said.  The blooms contain blue-green algae or cyanobacteria, which can produce a liver toxin called microcystin that is harmful to people and can be fatal to animals, including dogs. Even in years when there are smaller blooms, they can still produce dangerous toxins.  NOAA and other U.S. and Canadian agencies have set a goal of reducing the Lake Erie bloom to a 3 on the index.  Ohio, Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario also have pledged to reduce runoff of phosphorus by 40% by 2025 from the 2015 amount.  Measurements this year in the Maumee River, which carries much of the farm runoff from Ohio and Indiana into the lake, show that there are still high concentrations of phosphorus, said Laura Johnson, director of the National Center for Water Quality Research at Heidelberg University in Ohio.  The big difference, she said, is it has been very dry, which has greatly reduced the amount of water flowing in the river.  Until significant and consistent reductions in phosphorus amounts are made in the agricultural heavy Maumee River watershed, the blooms will continue to be a problem, said Don Scavia, a professor emeritus at the University of Michigan and a member of the forecast team.  "We cannot just cross our fingers and hope that drier weather will keep us safe," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/another-mild-algae-bloom-forecast-for-lake-erie-this-summer/articleshow/84004494.cms||---
---||World||Dire fire warnings issued in wake of record heatwave in Canada, US||VANCOUVER/PORTLAND: The worst heat wave on record that has scorched much of Canada's western territories and the US Northwest eased slightly on Wednesday but officials still braced for more record temperatures and the threat of wildfires. Deaths soared in the Canadian Pacific coast province of British Columbia in recent days. Cities in the US states of Washington and Oregon shattered all-time highs for temperature for days. US officials blamed the heat for a handful of US deaths. In Canada, at least 233 people died in British Colombia between Friday and Monday, about 100 more than the average for a four-day period, the BC Coroners Service said. Lytton, a town in central British Columbia, this week broke Canada's all-time hottest temperature record three times. It stands at 49.6 degrees Celsius (121.28 degrees Fahrenheit) as of Tuesday. The previous high in Canada, known for brutally cold winters, was 45 degrees C, set in Saskatchewan in 1937. In the US Northwest, temperatures in Washington and Oregon soared well above 100 degrees F (40 degrees C) over the weekend. Portland, Oregon set all-time highs several days in a row including a 116 degrees F (47 degrees C) on Sunday. The heat dome, a weather phenomenon trapping heat and blocking other weather systems from moving in, weakened as it moved east, but was still intense enough to set records from Alberta to Manitoba, said David Phillips, senior climatologist at Environment and Climate Change Canada, a government agency. "In some of these places, their records are being annihilated," Phillips said. "It really is spectacular, unprecedented for us." It was unclear what triggered the dome, but climate change looks to be a contributor, given the heatwave's duration, extremes, and the fact that it is setting new temperature highs a month earlier than the usual hottest time of year, Phillips said. "Climate change is driving the devastating intersection of extreme heat, drought, and wildland fire danger across the United States," the White House said in a statement on Tuesday. OREGON EMERGENCY Oregon Governor Kate Brown declared a stage of emergency due to "imminent threat of wildfires" while the US National Weather Service in Portland issued a red-flag warning for parts of the state, saying wind conditions could spread fire quickly should one start. "Now is the time to make sure your emergency prep kit is ready to go in the case you are asked to evacuate," the weather service said. The Portland Fire Department banned use of fireworks for the Fourth of July weekend, when Americans celebrate Independence Day. Elderly people, along with children and the chronically ill were especially at risk, said B.C.'s chief coroner, Lisa Lapointe. Advocates warned that migrant workers were particularly vulnerable, especially inside greenhouses. Staff were cancelling outdoor activities to keep seniors safe, said Lee Coonfer, chief executive of the BC Seniors Living Association, which represents 175 seniors homes. FIRE AND MELTING ICE POSE RISKS The extreme weather poses different threats depending on the region. Most of Alberta and large parts of British Columbia and Saskatchewan are at extreme risk of wildfires, according to Natural Resources Canada's fire weather map. "All the ingredients are there. It's a powder keg just looking for a spark," said Mike Flannigan, professor of wildland fire at University of Alberta. The interior of British Columbia fears thunderstorms forecast for Thursday will bring lightning, sparking forest fires. But the Chilcotin region, roughly 600 km (370 miles) north of Vancouver, was on flood warning due to the "unprecedented" amount of snow melting at "extraordinary" rates, according to a government release. "These are the types of issues that are going to be confronted more and more over the next few years," said Adam Rysanek, assistant professor of environmental systems at the University of British Columbia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/dire-fire-warnings-issued-in-wake-of-record-heatwave-in-canada-us/articleshow/84004166.cms||---
---||India||Supreme Court asks NDMA to fix ex gratia for Covid victims in 6 weeks||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the PM-led National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to quantify within six weeks the ex gratia amount to be paid to the families of nearly four lakh novel coronavirus victims and said the NDMA failed to discharge its statutory duty even though Covid-19 was declared a disaster under the Disaster Management Act a year ago. A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and M R Shah left it to the NDMA to decide what the ex gratia assistance should be but said the amount to be fixed by the NDMA and paid from the NDRF and SDRF would be over and above the ex gratia paid by states from other sources, including chief minister’s relief funds. The Centre had taken a stand that though NDRF and SDRF had the financial capability to pay ex gratia, "a conscious decision has been taken by the Finance Commission and/or Union of India to make provision and/or use the fund from NDRF/SDRF for the purpose of creating infrastructure, hospitals, testing, vaccination, ICU facilities and other allied matters, including providing food to the BPL/migrant labourers, and not to pay ex gratia assistance". With the relatives of Covid-19 victims complaining that death certificates mostly mentioned reasons other than coronavirus infection as the cause of death, the bench of Justices Bhushan and Shah asked the Centre and state authorities to take steps to rectify mistakes in death certificates so as to enable families to get ex gratia. The SC recorded the assurance of the Centre through solicitor general Tushar Mehta that non-accurate recording of Covid-caused deaths has already been made a criminal offence. On Tuesday, the same bench had slammed the labour ministry for its "unpardonable" lethargy in implementing the SC's 2018 direction to register all unorganised sector workers and directed all governments to complete their registration by July 31, which has been set as the deadline also for implementing the one nation one ration card scheme. The SC said non-registration of all workers on the portal of the National Database for Unorganised Workers had deprived many needy workers of the benefits under social welfare schemes. Writing Wednesday's judgment, Justice Shah appreciated the financial constraints of the Centre and state governments in the face of a unique disaster in the nature of the Covid-19 pandemic, requiring the governments to fight it on several fronts, but stressed that once Section 12 of the DM Act mandated fixing of ex gratia amount, there was no escaping the statutory mandate for the NDMA. "It can be said that the national authority has failed to perform its statutory duty cast under Section 12," the bench said. Rejecting the Centre's fervent pleas to read "shall" as "may" to permit the government leeway to utilise financial resources that would be required to pay ex gratia for building health infrastructure, providing food, ration and livelihood to millions hit by Covid-19, the bench said, "We direct the NDMA to recommend guidelines for ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life to the family members of those who died due to Covid-19, as mandated under Section 12(iii) of DMA, 2005, for the minimum standards of relief to be provided over and above the guidelines already recommended for the minimum standards of relief to be provided to those affected by Covid-19." The court rejected the petitioners' plea for providing Rs 4 lakh ex gratia to the families of each Covid-19 victim. The petitioners had said that while Bihar paid an ex gratia of Rs 4 lakh, Madhya Pradesh gave Rs 1 lakh and the Delhi government only Rs 50,000. They pleaded for a uniform ex gratia amount payable from NDRF or SDRF. However, the bench said the ex gratia amount, to be fixed by the NDMA and paid from NDRF and SDRF, would be over and above the ex gratia paid by states from other sources. Justices Bhushan and Shah left it to the NDMA to determine what would be a reasonable ex gratia amount. It said the NDMA would determine the amount "taking into consideration requirement/availability of the fund under the NDRF/SDRF for other relief and the priorities determined by the national authority/Union government and the fund required for other minimum standards of relief and fund required for prevention, preparedness, mitigation and recovery and other reliefs to carry out the obligation under DMA, 2005". Finding merit in the Centre's argument that Rs 4 lakh earlier fixed for short-term disasters could not be applied to a long impact disaster like Covid-19, the bench said its spread and impact was very different from natural disasters. "The pandemic is still not over in the country as also in the world and it is extremely difficult to predict with accuracy its further trajectory, mutations and waves. Looking at its peculiarity and the impact and effect, the Covid-19 pandemic is required to be viewed differently from other disasters. There shall not be any justification to provide for the same/similar amount by way of ex gratia assistance as provided in the case of other disasters/natural disasters, i.e. Rs 4 lakh," it added. The SC acknowledged the multi-sectoral measures undertaken by the Centre, especially in bolstering public health, employment, providing food and shelter to common people/migrants, transportation to migrants etc. "The government is also required to deal with the effect of the pandemic on the economy. A huge amount is required to be spent from the NDRF/SDRF, even while providing minimum standards of relief. It cannot be disputed that ex gratia assistance would also have financial implications and which may affect the other minimum standards of relief to be provided to persons affected by disaster. No state or country has unlimited resources. That is why it only announces the financial reliefs/packages to the extent it is possible. When the government forms its policy, it is based on a number of circumstances, on facts, law including constraint-based governmental resources," it said.

---||World||US and Iran show no move to put nuclear deal back on track||UNITED NATIONS: The United Nations, European Union, and many Security Council members urged the US and Iran on Wednesday to quickly put the 2015 nuclear deal aimed at reining Tehran's nuclear program back on track, but neither side showed any sign of movement toward an agreement.  During six rounds of talks in Vienna, the six countries that remain parties to the agreement- Russia, China, Germany, France, Britain and Iran - have been trying to resolve major outstanding issues on how the US can rejoin.  Then-president Donald Trump pulled out of the agreement in 2018, but President Joe Biden repudiated his predecessor and said the US wants to return to the pact.  After the latest Vienna talks on June 20, the EU official who coordinated the meeting, Enrique Mora, told reporters, "We are closer to a deal, but we are not there."  Top Russian representative Mikhail Ulyanov said that "the time has come for political decisions" ahead of what is supposed to be a final round of negotiations.  But in the Security Council on Wednesday, diplomats from Iran and the US took tough stands, giving no hint of compromise during a meeting on implementation of the 2015 council resolution that endorsed the nuclear agreement.  The 2015 accord is aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, which Tehran denies it is seeking.  Under its provisions, UN sanctions that severely affected the oil-rich nation's economy were lifted, but Trump re-imposed those sanctions unilaterally and added tougher ones when the US pulled out of the pact. Iranian Ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi strongly criticised the continuing impact of US sanctions, saying they were also affecting the country's efforts to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic.  "Nothing has changed except the verbal declaration of the US of its intention to return to compliance" with the agreement, he told the council.  "In reality, until this very moment, the maximum pressure policy and the draconian sanctions against our people still continue."  He said Iran has paid "a heavy price" to preserve the deal and remains committed to it "as long as other parties put an end, completely and without any precondition or further delay, to their bullying policies."  Ravanchi said that "it is high time" for the United States and the three European parties to the agreement to make "difficult decisions" to return to full compliance. US deputy ambassador Jeffrey DeLaurentis told council members that "the last few rounds of discussions in Vienna have helped to crystallize the choices that need to be made by Iran and by the United States in order achieve a mutual return to compliance."  "The US is committed to ensuring Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon, and we believe diplomacy, in coordination with our allies and regional partners, is the best path to achieve that goal," he said.  But DeLaurentis said recent reports by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the International Atomic Energy Agency make clear that Iran is escalating its nuclear program beyond the agreement's limits, both in numbers and types of centrifuges, quantities and levels of uranium enrichment up to 60%, and producing uranium metal.  "We urge Iran to refrain from taking further steps and to return to full implementation" of the agreement's provisions, "including those related to IAEA verification, monitoring, and implementation of the additional protocol," DeLaurentis said.  Ravanchi said all Iran's steps are allowed under the deal because the US violated the agreement, and reiterated that they are reversible. A key provision in the 2015 Security Council resolution endorsing the agreement calls on Iran "not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons" - but it does not explicitly demand that Tehran do so.  Iran launched ballistic missiles and tested a space vehicle early this year, which sparked complaints from France, Britain, Germany and Israel, backed by the US. But Russia and Iran insisted they did not violate the agreement. UN political chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the council that diplomatic efforts in Vienna "offer a critical opportunity" for the US and Iran to return fully to the deal.  She echoed Guterres' appeal to the US to lift or waive sanctions and extend waivers on the oil trade with Iran. She called on Iran to refrain from further escalation, return to full implementation of the deal, and resume an agreement with the IAEA to monitor and verify its nuclear activities that expired June 24.  Calling this "a defining moment," DiCarlo said it is "critical for all parties to seize this opportunity" to put the agreement back on track.  EU Ambassador Olof Skoog warned that "what might be possible still today may prove impossible in the near future."  "We have a limited diplomatic window ahead of us that we should not miss," he told the council.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-and-iran-show-no-move-to-put-nuclear-deal-back-on-track/articleshow/84005002.cms||---
---||World||US and Iran show no move to put nuclear deal back on track||UNITED NATIONS: The United Nations, European Union, and many Security Council members urged the US and Iran on Wednesday to quickly put the 2015 nuclear deal aimed at reining Tehran's nuclear program back on track, but neither side showed any sign of movement toward an agreement.  During six rounds of talks in Vienna, the six countries that remain parties to the agreement- Russia, China, Germany, France, Britain and Iran - have been trying to resolve major outstanding issues on how the US can rejoin.  Then-president Donald Trump pulled out of the agreement in 2018, but President Joe Biden repudiated his predecessor and said the US wants to return to the pact.  After the latest Vienna talks on June 20, the EU official who coordinated the meeting, Enrique Mora, told reporters, "We are closer to a deal, but we are not there."  Top Russian representative Mikhail Ulyanov said that "the time has come for political decisions" ahead of what is supposed to be a final round of negotiations.  But in the Security Council on Wednesday, diplomats from Iran and the US took tough stands, giving no hint of compromise during a meeting on implementation of the 2015 council resolution that endorsed the nuclear agreement.  The 2015 accord is aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, which Tehran denies it is seeking.  Under its provisions, UN sanctions that severely affected the oil-rich nation's economy were lifted, but Trump re-imposed those sanctions unilaterally and added tougher ones when the US pulled out of the pact. Iranian Ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi strongly criticised the continuing impact of US sanctions, saying they were also affecting the country's efforts to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic.  "Nothing has changed except the verbal declaration of the US of its intention to return to compliance" with the agreement, he told the council.  "In reality, until this very moment, the maximum pressure policy and the draconian sanctions against our people still continue."  He said Iran has paid "a heavy price" to preserve the deal and remains committed to it "as long as other parties put an end, completely and without any precondition or further delay, to their bullying policies."  Ravanchi said that "it is high time" for the United States and the three European parties to the agreement to make "difficult decisions" to return to full compliance. US deputy ambassador Jeffrey DeLaurentis told council members that "the last few rounds of discussions in Vienna have helped to crystallize the choices that need to be made by Iran and by the United States in order achieve a mutual return to compliance."  "The US is committed to ensuring Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon, and we believe diplomacy, in coordination with our allies and regional partners, is the best path to achieve that goal," he said.

The latest discovery of graves near Cranbrook, British Columbia follows reports of similar findings at two other such Catholic Church-run schools, one of more than 600 unmarked graves and another of 215 bodies. The Lower Kootenay Band said in a news release it began using the technology last year to search the site close to the former St. Eugene's Mission School, which was operated by the church from 1912 until the early 1970s. It said the search found the remains in unmarked graves, some about 3 feet (a meter) deep. The release said it's believed the remains are those of people from the bands of the Ktunaxa nation, which includes the Lower Kootenay Band, Aq'am and other neighboring First Nation communities. The Lower Kootenay band says it is in the early stages of receiving information from the reports on what has been found, and it is asking for the public to respect its privacy. Last week, Chief Cadmus Delorme of the Cowessess First Nation said ground-penetrating radar had registered 751 ''hits," indicating at least 600 bodies were buried at the Marieval Indian Residential School, which operated from 1899 to 1997. The gravesite is believed to hold the bodies of children and adults, and even people from outside the community who attended church there. A few weeks before that, what are believed to be the remains of 215 children were found at the site of the Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia. The Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops said Pope Francis has agreed to meet in December with Indigenous survivors of Canada's notorious residential schools amid calls for a papal apology for the Catholic Church's role in the abuse and deaths. Francis had invited the delegations to the Vatican and would meet separately with three groups - First Nations, Metis and Inuit - during their December 17-20 visit. The pope will then preside over a final audience with all three groups December 20, the conference said in a statement Tuesday. The Vatican didn't confirm the visit Wednesday, but the Holy See's in-house news portal reported on the bishops' statement. The Canadian bishops said the trip was contingent on the pandemic and that the delegations would include survivors of the residential schools, Indigenous elders and youths, as well as Indigenous leaders and Canadian bishops. From the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 Indigenous children were forced to attend state-funded Christian boarding schools in an effort to assimilate them into Canadian society. Thousands of children died there of disease and other causes, with many never returned to their families. Nearly three-quarters of the 130 residential schools were run by Roman Catholic missionary congregations, with others operated by the Presbyterian, Anglican and the United Church of Canada, which today is the largest Protestant denomination in the country. The government formally apologized for the policy and abuses in 2008. In addition, the Presbyterian, Anglican and United churches have apologized for their roles in the abuse. A papal apology was one of 94 recommendations from Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, but the Canadian bishops conference said in 2018 that the pope could not personally apologize for the residential schools. Former Pope Benedict XVI met with some former students and victims in 2009 and told them of his "personal anguish" over their suffering. After last month's discovery, Pope Francis expressed his pain and pressed religious and political authorities to shed light on "this sad affair," but didn't offer an apology. Since the discovery of unmarked graves at the sites of former residential schools, there have been several fires at churches across Canada. Most of the fires have been on First Nations. There has also been some vandalism targeting churches and statues in cities. Four small Catholic churches on Indigenous lands in rural southern British Columbia have been destroyed by suspicious fires and a vacant former Anglican church in northwestern B.C. was recently damaged in what RCMP said could be arson. On Wednesday, Alberta's premier condemned what he calls "arson attacks at Christian churches" after a historic parish was destroyed in a fire. "Today in Morinville, l'eglise de Saint-Jean-Baptiste was destroyed in what appears to have been a criminal act of arson," Kenney said in a statement. RCMP said officers were called to the suspicious blaze at St. John Baptiste Parish in Morinville, about 40 kilometres north of Edmonton, in the early hours of Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/indigenous-groups-in-canada-reports-more-bodies-at-school/articleshow/84004428.cms||---

The Duke of Sussex is back in Britain and is due to join his brother, Prince William, to unveil a statue Thursday in honor of their late mother, Princess Diana, on what would have been her 60th birthday. On Wednesday, Harry visited Kew Gardens in west London for an awards ceremony for WellChild, a charity he is patron of. He was joined at the garden party by celebrities including Ed Sheeran and Ronnie Wood. He chatted with children who won awards and their families, and was seen telling some of those attending that it was ``quite a juggle'' coping with his newborn daughter, Lilibet, and his 2-year-old son, Archie. In a statement released by WellChild, Harry said the charity had ``an extraordinarily special place in my heart.'' ``Now as a father of two, I feel all the more connected, inspired and in awe of the resilience of these families, who power through indescribable challenges with the support of WellChild,`` he said. Harry and his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, stepped down from royal duties last year and the couple are now living in California with their children. He last visited the U.K. for the funeral of his grandfather, Prince Philip, in April. Harry and William commissioned the statue of their mother in 2017 to honor her legacy. The monument will be unveiled Thursday in Kensington Palace, the royals' childhood home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/prince-harry-pays-surprise-visit-to-london-charity-event/articleshow/84004864.cms||---
---||India||Average daily Covid vaccinations in June touched 40L||NEW DELHI: The average daily vaccination against Covid-19 increased to 40.3 lakh doses in June, driven by a jump since the Centre took over procurement and supplies of 75% of domestically produced jabs since June 21. The rolling weekly average of daily vaccination peaked between June 21-28 with 57.7 lakh doses given per day, which is also the highest weekly average in the world, barring China which has administered more than a billion doses. Among other countries, Brazil records weekly average of 10.4 lakh doses, 8.7 lakh in US, 8.1 lakh in Germany, 5.9 lakh in France, 5.5 lakh in Italy and 3.5 lakh in UK, government sources said. Of over 4.6 crore doses administered between June 21-28, more than 86% were first doses, underlining the expansion in Covid vaccination coverage as more people from different age groups received the jabs with Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat administering the maximum number of doses. Currently, around 45% of over 45 years population has received at least the first dose of the jabs, whereas 11% have got both. While Tripura has over 97.9% of its estimated above 45 population vaccinated with at least first dose, states like Himachal Pradesh, J&K, Ladakh, Lakshadweep, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Kerala, Mizoram, Sikkim and Uttarakhand have also covered over 60% in this segment. Among people aged 18-44 years, nearly 15% have received at least the first dose. Daman & Diu has achieved the maximum coverage so far with 73% of its population in this age band receiving at least first dose. Besides, Sikkim, Dadar & Nagar Haveli, Goa, Himachal, Arunachal Pradesh, Ladakh, Lakshdweep, Mizoram and Tripura also have over 30% coverage with first dose in this category. Coverage among health and front-line workers —which was lagging for some time despite the Centre’s repeated push — has improved recently with 87% of HCWs and 91% FLWs covered with at least first dose, whereas 62% of HCWs and 49% of FLWs are now fully vaccinated. Vaccination against Covid had slowed down significantly in May with a daily average of merely 19.7 lakh doses amid rising cases keeping many away along with a shortage of vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/average-daily-covid-vaccinations-in-june-touched-40l/articleshow/84005228.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||Business||Finance ministry curbs spending by depts to help fight Covid||NEW DELHI: The finance ministry on Wednesday imposed spending checks on several departments, ranging from education and home to telecom and power, as part of a cash management exercise due to the “evolving” Covid-19 situation and the Centre’s cash management requirements. While these departments can at best spend 20% of their annual allocation during July-September, 19 departments, such as health, pharma, fertiliser, rural development, agriculture and farmers’ welfare, road transport and railways will not face any restrictions. Coronavirus: Live updatesThe move came as the latest numbers released by the Controller General of Accounts estimated the Centre’s fiscal deficit at Rs 1.23 lakh crore or 8.2% of the full year target for 2021-22 at the end of May as tax and non-tax revenues gathered strength and spending remained under control. During April-May, revenue receipts were estimated at 19.6% of the target, compared with 2.2% a year ago when the country was in the grip of a strict lockdown. While the Centre had said that it wants to push spending, the focus is on asset-creating capital expenditure as well as priority sectors such as health and pharma. Wednesday’s measures indicate that the government expects a higher-than-budgeted spend, although its stimulus measures are estimated to have only increased the spending by around Rs 1.5 lakh crore over the budget estimates. But it signals that by checking non-essential spending, the government will try to rein in fiscal deficit at 6.8% of GDP. Last year, when its revenue flows had slowed, the government had resorted to similar measures, dividing ministries and departments into three heads. Economists said the government had so far kept a tight leash on its finances in the first two months of the fiscal year but the deficit may be impacted due to the measures unveiled to provide relief to some sectors due to the second Covid-19 wave. “On the whole, the budget has been well managed. The concerns going forward will be higher outlay on free food and fertiliser subsidy as well as other outlays under the FM relief programme,’’ said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/finance-ministry-curbs-spending-by-depts-to-help-fight-covid/articleshow/84005824.cms||---

Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary told this newspaper that all the appointments would be made in the seventh phase in the same manner in which recruitment of primary teachers was done in the sixth phase. The candidates, who had qualified in the 2011 STET, would also be eligible for recruitment. According to the details released by the department, there are 25,275 vacancies in seven subjects in secondary schools for which altogether 53,715 candidates have qualified the test. Similarly, there are 12,172 vacancies in eight subjects in senior secondary schools for which 26,687 have qualified the STET. Altogether, 37,447 teachers are to be appointed and the total number of STET 2019-qualified candidates is over 80,000. Choudhary pointed out that the process of recruitment in the seventh phase would begin after the appointment of teachers in the sixth phase. “Recruitment is a continuous process. A large number of vacancies are likely to to be announced soon after the reopening of schools and subsequent creation of posts. The validity of STET results is lifelong until the candidates’ maximum age of recruitment does not expire,” the minister added. Hundreds of STET-qualified candidates had staged a protest on Tuesday against the delay in appointments. Police had to resort to lathicharge to chase them away when they tried to gherao the education minister’s residence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-govt-releases-details-of-teachers-appointment/articleshow/83996919.cms||B K Mishra

Salons are reopening on Thursday with a new set of precautionary measures. The difference this time is the vaccination clause — only vaccinated clients will be allowed. Salon operators said that while last time clients had been nervous to walk in, the fact that they are vaccinated this time is giving them some confidence. Salons have introduced phone numbers and social media pages where bookings can be made and clients can check whether they have moved up the waiting list from time to time. “It is a new system to tackle the huge pressure. Since salons are reopening after two months, people want their hair and skin care regimen back as soon as possible. However, we have to ensure that we are only 50% full. So we have created an elaborate appointment schedule,” said Prescilla Corner, partner, June Tomkyns salons. No walk-ins will be allowed and clients cannot delay their appointments by more than 10 minutes. A gap of 15 minutes is being kept between appointments to clean chairs and the space every time a client leaves. The old system of disposable linen will be in place, it was said. “We have called in only 50% of our staff and, at any given point in time, only 50% of our chairs will be occupied. We have taken appointments very carefully to avoid overlap and we will keep communicating with clients on the waiting list,” said Julie Chung, business head of Eye Catchers salon chain that has six outlets. New stickers saying “Not in use for your safety” have been pasted on every alternate chair at A N John. “We have booked all our appointments online and we will not entertain walk-ins,” said spokesperson Amritaa Chakraborty. All salons will check whether clients have vaccination proof with themselves. Clients will also have to carry a photo ID. “We have taken very few appointments for the first day because the first calls that came to us were about hair treatment that take a long time. We are continuously getting calls and are spacing them according to the slots available. We are full till Sunday,” said Ananya Goswami Chowdhury, proprietor of an outlet of the Tony & Guy chain inside a mall in New Town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-rules-in-place-slots-full-for-a-week-salons-pull-up-shutters-after-2-month-gap/articleshow/84001118.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The party resolved to form special committees from the booth to state level to expedite the donation collection. “For this, all senior party functionaries, ministers, MPs, MLAs and MLCs will be given special responsibilities,” JD(U) media cell state chief Amardeep told TOI. JD(U) has around 50 lakh primary and 2 lakh active members in Bihar. JD(U) national president RCP Singh called upon the district presidents to make the donation collection campaign a grand success. He further asked them to give at least 33.3% posts to women in all district committees, keeping in mind the ideals of CM Nitish Kumar. He said the district presidents should try to ensure that the JD(U) district offices run from own buildings. JD(U) state president Umesh Singh Kushwaha said the party will organize state-level virtual sammelan on ‘Durable farming- happy farmers’ and ‘Employment opportunities for youths’ on July 4 and 11, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-to-launch-donation-collection-drive/articleshow/83999042.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Kolkata||Bengal: Gyms reopen, but trainers in a fix after workforce slashed||KOLKATA: Some have quit the profession and some are offering door-to-door personal training services, often at negotiable rates. Fitness trainers associated with gyms are struggling to make ends meet with a number of gyms downing shutters and others cutting down on staff and resources. The fitness industry, which had been growing fast over the last decade and is worth 97$ billion globally, was among the worst hit by the pandemic. In Bengal, the Covid-induced restrictions left them shut for eight out of the last 13 months. Even as new restrictions from Thursday allow gyms to resume operations with 50% capacity — all vaccinated and in two shifts of 6am-10am and 4pm-8pm — several trainers are still without a job. Fitness trainer Biswajit Maji is the sole earner in his family, which includes an ailing two-year-old with a monthly medical expense of at least Rs 5,000. However, with his gym shut and no other means of income, he has been going from house to house helping some customers with their workout. “I had a good income before the pandemic. After the gyms were shut, I had no income for months. I then started calling up my regular customers and offered to conduct online workout sessions. When the gyms reopened last year, I offered freelance activities and also started visiting members’ homes to train them personally. Now, the gym where I had been working recently will open on Thursday, but the owner hasn’t called me yet to join duty,” said Maji. For the majority of trainers, the shutdown of gyms meant no salary. While a number of gym trainers used to conduct personal sessions even before the pandemic, they relied heavily on the gym salary for a fixed income and self-promotion. “At present, I train two members at their homes. That somehow keeps me afloat, but I am considering another job —may be food delivery — for a fixed income,” said Avinash Silvester Pasker, who used to work at a premium city gymnasium before it shut the branch last year. Trainers like Anudip Dey, who has been recalled by his employer to start from Thursday, said he had started suffering from depression because of unemployment and had to consult a doctor. “I practically sat at home doing nothing and was under severe mental stress. Two of my colleagues have quit the industry and are selling food and veggies. I am still fighting though,” he said. Meanwhile, several gyms in the city were busy sanitizing their floors and dividing members into small batches to stick to the government protocols as they resume operation from Thursday. “We have taken all precautions as advised by the government. All our staffers are vaccinated,” said Minu Budhia, director, Addlife Gym on Camac Street.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/gyms-reopen-but-trainers-in-a-fix-after-workforce-slashed/articleshow/84001003.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

This is one of the largest domestic funds earmarked for early-stage investments. Investors in the fund include SBICap Ventures, SIDBI (Fund of Funds for Startups), Survam (Sumankant Munjal Family Offices), other marquee family offices, and UHNIs including founders of established technology companies. Launched in early 2020, the fund saw its first close at Rs 230 crore in August 2020, and aims to invest primarily in B2B/enterprise startups leveraging deep tech and innovation. The fund will invest in the pre-series A to series B rounds with initial cheques ranging from Rs 5-Rs 20 crore plus follow-on rounds based on portfolio company performance and funding stage.

Solid waste collected door-to-door will be processed at multiple locations before shifting them to the dumping yard. The project will be taken up with an estimated cost of Rs 15.4 crore. Solid waste management is a major concern for VMC. The civic body shifted the dumping yard to Pathapadu village and used compactor trucks to shift garbage to the dumping yard. As shifting garbage has become a time-consuming affair, the VMC is gearing up to establish transfer stations at five locations in the city to process garbage. “We have started distributing three dustbins to every household. We will collect segregated garbage door-to-door and dump it in the CNG vehicles. The CNG vehicle will dump garbage at the transfer station, where solid waste will be sent for recycling to Naidupet. Compostable material will be sent to composting units. Leftover garbage will be loaded into 20 metric tonnes compactor bins, and these bins will be loaded into the trucks using the hook loaded,” said V Prasanna Venkatesh, VMC commissioner. “This will save fuel and expenses on shifting garbage to the dumping yard and help us handle garbage effectively,” Venkatesh said, adding, “We are procuring 26 new compactor vehicles and 11 hook loaders to start the recycling units.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/civic-body-to-introduce-transfer-stations-for-handling-solid-waste/articleshow/83999305.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Patna||Victim’s mom & brother support rape allegations against DSP||PATNA: The CID (weaker section) has made its case strong against rape accused DSP Kamlakant Prasad after three family members of the victim, including her mother and elder brother, surfaced and recorded their statements under Section 161 CrPC, supporting the allegations in the FIR lodged with Women’s police station in Gaya on May 27 this year. The matter is four years’ old when the DSP, then posted at Gaya, had allegedly raped the victim, then a minor, inside his official quarter during Dussehra in 2017. Following the FIR, the government suspended Prasad on June 15. The matter remained unreported before Prasad’s wife Anand Tanuja approached the CID for alleged torture by her husband. The CID directed the Gaya police to register an FIR after gathering evidence and took up the case’s investigation. “They are scheduled to depose before a Gaya court under Section 164 CrPC,” a senior police officer said, adding the trio’s statements have also been videorecorded. He said they were in Gaya due to the lockdown, else it would have been tough to trace them as they work in a factory in Delhi. Sources said the elder brother, his wife and the mother knew about the rape incident soon after it took place but the victim’s younger brother had allegedly opposed them. “In the course of investigation, it surfaced that the victim’s elder brother and his wife had accused the younger brother of conniving with the DSP and his wife for exploiting the girl,” the source said. He said the younger brother had entered into scuffle with the elder one when he attempted to approach the police. “They remained silent about the ordeal suffered by the girl until now. The elder brother submitted a written complaint with Imamganj police station in Gaya three days back, citing that the three of them wanted to depose against the DSP in the case, but feared the younger brother,” a CID officer said. Though it is the younger brother who submitted a written application before the CID that his sister was raped, which led to the registration of an FIR against Prasad. “It was he who had dropped the minor sister at the DSP’s residence a day before the incident in 2017. He remained mum and deterred the other family members from approaching the police,” the officer said. He said it’s he who once again filed a petition before special POCSO court in Gaya that he and his sister were forced by the DSP’s wife to give statement against him when Prasad filed an anticipatory bail petition. “The court ordered no-coercive action against the DSP till further orders,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/victims-mom-bro-support-rape-allegations-against-dsp/articleshow/83996636.cms||Debashish Karmakar

SHO Sunil Rajak said two bike-borne criminals intercepted Nawal and one of them pumped at least ten bullets in his chest and abdomen at around 6.12am. “Nine empty and one live cartridges of 7.62mm were recovered from the spot. Nawal on his bike was going to his residence at Nayagaon under Shyampur Bhatha in Sheohar from Shahbazpur in Muzaffarpur,” the SHO said. He said as the criminals were about to intercept Nawal, a street dog started barking and chasing their bike. “The criminals first shot the dog dead before killing Nawal,” he said. Rajak said the entire incident was captured in a CCTV camera. “Nawal was accused in three criminal cases, including one of murder in Sheohar. He was evading arrest in one of the cases,” the SHO said. He said Nawal’s elder brother was shot dead during election campaign at Hathsar under Punahia police station area in Sheohar on October 24 last year. “We are investigating Nawal’s murder from all angles, including its relation with his brother’s killing,” he said. Shree Narayan was a former mukhiya of Nayagan panchayat and had been earlier associated with slain gangster Santosh Jha. He was accused in at least 30 criminal cases in Sheohar and neighbouring districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/man-dog-killed-in-muzaffarpur/articleshow/83998770.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Visakhapatnam: VMRDA draft master plan projects boost to fisheries||VISAKHAPATNAM: The draft master plan-2041 prepared by Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority has proposed seven fishery development nodes in Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram districts in areas like Revupolavaram, Muthyalammapalem, Chinnamangamaripeta, etc. The VMRDA region has a nearly 250 km coastline dotted with 80 fishing villages, which is 26% of the coast length in Andhra Pradesh. Fishing is a traditional occupation in the region. Andhra Pradesh has favourable agro-climatic conditions for the growth of fisheries and aquaculture sector. The state is contributing as much as 29.7% of national fish production. It is a major exporter of shrimp in India with a share of 40.4% in total value of seafood exports of the country during the 2019-20 financial year. The sector is providing employment to nearly 26.5 lakh people. Fisheries contribute 7.4% of the gross state domestic product of Andhra Pradesh. Hence, due importance is being given to conserve and harness this traditional occupation in the region in the VMRDA draft master plan-2041. Apart from the fishery development nodes, the other prominent suggestions given in the draft plan for this sector are to increase infrastructure facilities, employment-based allied industries, and proposal of new fishing harbours in areas like Etcherla, Kalingapatnam, Bheemili and Pudimadaka. Key objectives of the recommendations are to sustain fish production, promote fishermen welfare, address critical gaps in the infrastructure for the value chain, and to promote domestic fish consumption in the state. Skill development and creating fishing infrastructure will boost the declining active fishermen. Provisioning of mini harbours or jetties will increase the number of crafts, which will eventually increase the economy of fisherfolk. The envisaged logistic connectivity, proposed development plans, and exporting facilities would make the region advantageous for these establishments. The master plan also proposes encouraging the primary sector by adopting sustainable agricultural practices and technologies. This will conserve fertile agricultural land and help in optimum use of available resources without hindering the rural fabric. Providing required infrastructure and easy access to markets will boost the local economy and aid in easy transfer of agricultural commodities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vmrda-draft-master-plan-projects-boost-to-fisheries/articleshow/83999232.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Patna||Tejashwi Yadav, Tej Pratap take Sputnik’s dose||PATNA: RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and his elder brother Tej Pratap on Wednesday took Russia-made Sputnik vaccine shots at Jai Prabha Medanta Hospital in Patna. Hospital’s director Dr Arun Kumar said apart from the two brothers, RJD leader Shakti Yadav also took the vaccine. In a video, Tejashwi could be seen questioning Sputnik’s efficacy. However, the row over vaccination of Yadav brothers has not ended yet. Former deputy CM and BJP Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Modi said both should have opted for a government health institute to get the vaccines as this would have sent a better message to the public. “Tej Pratap had been the health minister. He should avoid the branding of private hospitals which the poor cannot afford. PM, CM and several dignitaries have taken Covid vaccines in government health institutions,” he tweeted. He also advised the two sons of RJD chief Lalu Prasad to get their parents vaccinated in case they have not, so that others could be inspired. JD(U) state spokesperson Anjum Ara mocked the two brothers for delaying their vaccination. BJP state spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel also took a swipe at them for choosing Russia-made vaccine over the one made by Indian scientists. “They do not have faith in our scientists. They have sent a wrong message.” However, RJD state spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari criticized the NDA leaders for creating an issue. “Tejashwi ji did not go to Russia to take the vaccine. Rather it was the NDA government which had permitted Sputnik in India,” said Tiwari, adding, “He (Tejashwi) thinks scientifically and any person with scientific temperament will first evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine and analyse one’s health status. The Centre should also make it clear why the companies making Covaxin and Covishield have not made public the vaccine’s efficacy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-tej-pratap-take-sputniks-dose/articleshow/83996683.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The foundation plaque was unveiled by the CM near Kondaveeti vaagu flood diversion scheme near Undavalli village while proceeding to the secretariat to attend the cabinet meeting. The new project is being taken up at an estimated cost of Rs 150 crore by Amaravati Smart & Sustainable City Ltd (ASSCL). Local legislator Alla Ramakrishna Reddy said the river bank road would be widened to 10 metres from Undavalli to Rayapudi village. The new stretch would connect N-1 and N-3 highways in the capital city area with Undavalli-Rayapudi-Amaravati seed access road, and the six-lane national highway between Chinakakani and Gollapudi. “The existing narrow road would also be widened. Construction of Kondaveeti vaagu bridge would also be part of the project. Outfall sluice gates near Venkatapalem and Rayapudi would be constructed for better management of flood water from the Kondaveeti vaagu (stream). Flood management centres would also be taken up under the new road project,” he said. Meanwhile, Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy, advisor to the state government (public affairs), reviewed the progress of Polavaram works at the project site on Wednesday, including the construction of resettlement and rehabilitation colonies for the project-displaced families. Sajjala said YS Rajasekhara Reddy launched the Polavaram project immediately after taking over as chief minister of undivided AP in 2004. “Work on resettlement colonies picked pace after YS Jagan Mohan Reddy took over the reins of the state. We have planned around 12,941 houses under the R&R package and have entrusted the work to five government agencies for early completion,” he said. Sajjala further said that 6,169 houses are ready and another 3,500 houses will be ready by end of July. “The chief minister has directed officials to focus on completion of project works along with R&R colonies. About 4 lakh acres under the right main canal and 3.2 lakh acres under left main canal would get water from Polavaram project, which will also generate about 960mw of power,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/cm-lays-foundation-for-krishna-riverbank-road/articleshow/83998871.cms||Samdani MN

Of the 164 flats built in 1980, only two were “properly allotted” while the remaining were encroached upon. BSHB’s executive engineer (Muzaffarpur section), Sujit Kumar, told this newspaper that nearly 75% of the illegal occupants had willingly vacated the flats. “The ones, which were not vacated, have been sealed by the administration in the presence of police. Now, the people, who try to break the seals, will be booked and fined,” Sujit said, adding that the poorly-maintained flats were in a dilapidated state and not suitable for anyone to live in. Earlier, Saran district magistrate Nilesh Ramchandra Deore had visited the locality and directed the illegal occupants to vacate the flats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/illegal-occupants-vacate-govt-flats-in-chhapra-town/articleshow/83996958.cms||---

The bench observed that they cannot allow school grounds to turn into market places. A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition has been moved challenging setting up of a vegetable market on the grounds of Annie Besant Municipal High School at Proddatur in Kadapa district. The high court bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya observed that though establishing a vegetable market is essential, doing so in a school ground cannot be allowed as providing the grounds for students is much more essential. The counsel for Proddatur municipality argued that the said ground does not belong to the school and the vegetable market was set up only for the time being and a permanent market is under construction. The counsel for the petitioner argued that though the high court had earlier directed not to proceed with any constructions, construction activity is going on and a statue was also erected in the same ground. He told the high court that a contempt petition is being filed with all material evidence and photographs. The bench said that it will decide the matter after filing of the contempt petition and posted further hearing after two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cant-let-school-grounds-become-marketplace-hc/articleshow/83999147.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: PIL against Tata Garden tree-cutting dismissed||Mumbai: The Bombay high court has dismissed a PIL challenging various permissions, including cutting of nearly 61 trees and transplantation of 79 at Tata Gardens, by the BMC’s Tree Authority on January 6. About 140 trees will be affected in the construction of an interchange at Bhulabhai Desai Road for the coastal road project. A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni vacated its interim stay restraining the BMC from cutting trees at the garden in Breach Candy. NGO Society for Improvement, Greenery and Nature had filed the PIL through its secretary Nilesh Baxi. Invoking Rule 7A of its PIL Rules, 2010, the bench sought a security deposit for hearing the PIL on merit. When the NGO, through its counsel Ankit Kulkarni, said it was not in a position to deposit Rs 60 crore, a fraction of the project cost of Rs 1,200 crore, the PIL was dismissed. Senior counsel Aspi Chinoy and Anil Sakhare with advocate Joel Carlos for the BMC said the PIL lacked merit and due process had been followed before the Tree Authority order. Advocate Kulkarni argued that the NGO’s objections and a proposed alternative to ensure “minimal destruction’’ of trees was not heeded by the BMC, which had issued notices for cutting trees last February and had invited objections and suggestions. The BMC relied on a 2019 HC Judgment that held that the BMC has good reason to fix the location of the interchange at Tata Garden and hence, under a bar in law, the court cannot revisit the same issue. Rule 7 A of the Bombay HC PIL Rules stipulates that in certain cases, “Court may, in its discretion, direct the petitioner to deposit a sum, by way of security deposit, in the Court, which shall be subject to final or interim order of the Court’’ and “If the Court finds that petition is vexatious, motivated or not pro-bono-publico, then the amount so deposited shall be forfeited and this shall be in addition to the exemplary costs, if any, which may be imposed by the Court.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pil-against-tata-garden-tree-cutting-dismissed/articleshow/84003801.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Business||NPST’s TimePay gets nod for third-party UPI app||Mumbai: Thane-based banking technology provider Network People Services Technology (NPST), which is seeking to list in the NSE Emerge segment, has received a third-party application provider (TPAP) registration from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) for its TimePay solution. The company aims to use this registration to acquire merchants and cooperative housing societies by providing them with an application stack that includes invoicing, payment collections and accounting solutions. TPAPs are third-party providers like Google Pay, Amazon Pay or PhonePe that generate a distinct UPI handle for their customers. Speaking to TOI, Deepak Thakur, chairman & MD and promoter of the company, said that unlike these payment giants who are focused on acquiring retail users through a standardised payment app, TimePay would harness the power of UPI to acquire merchants and cooperative housing societies in smaller cities and customise the app for them by building an enterprise resource programme for their ecosystems. NPST, which started in 2013, has been helping banks that are not the frontrunners in the digital space to compete by offering digital products around a payment switch. This enables the company to facilitate banks to provide IMPS (Immediate Payment Service), UPI (Unified Payments Interface) and the full stack of mobile banking services either as a licence or using the software-as-a-service model. Besides rural banks in Karnataka and Kerala, the bank provides digital tech support for Canara Bank and Cosmos Cooperative Bank. Now with the TPAP in place the company aims to offer digital services to its partner bank’s current account customers as well as acquire merchants directly. According to Thakur, the company’s competitive edge in merchant and cooperative society acquisition is its ability to provide multiple solutions including ones for accounting, invoicing and sending collection requests. The registration as a TPAP will enable the company to incorporate a unique QR code for every bill so that customers can pay by scanning. This will give small cooperative housing societies the billing capability of large utilities. TimePay will allow billers to give a short-term credit facility to their creditors through the equivalent of a standing instruction that debits the creditors account on a specified day. “Wherever there is a current account we should be able to digitise it and create a revenue model and generate income for banks. We already have an order book from Cosmos Bank to digitise the current account of their 130 branches across the country”, said Thakur. He added that the company will be looking to exploit other features of UPI including pre-paid vouchers that will be launched soon. Through the prospective IPO, the company is looking to raise around Rs 13 crore, which will take the valuation of the company to over Rs 50 crore. According to Thakur, although the company plans to expand operations to 25 non-metro cities, the operational cost is not going to scale up as the services will be provided online.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/npsts-timepay-gets-nod-for-third-party-upi-app/articleshow/84002513.cms||Mayur Shetty

The Jhansi DM confirmed to TOI that a proposal in this regard has been sent to the state government. According to highly placed sources in the government, the proposal is likely to be forwarded to the Centre soon for further action. “The local MP had recommended the change of the name of the railway station. We have given consent on the name-change and sent it to the state government,” the Jhansi DM Andra Vamsi confirmed to TOI. Jhansi MP Anurag Sharma told TOI that the proposal to rename the railway station was mooted about two years ago during a Railways zonal meeting, adding "the proposal was made in the presence of people's representative of Bundelkhand region.” “The decision was mentioned in the minutes of the meeting and now has gone to the state government for its views,” Sharma added. According to sources in Lucknow, acting on the proposal, the state government has decided to send it to the Central government for further action. After coming to power in 2017, the BJP government has changed names of three prominent places -- Allahabad, Mughalsarai and Faizabad. Allahabad is now Prayagraj, Mughalsarai is Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Nagar and Faizabad is Ayodhya. While names of Allahabad and Mughalsarai railway stations were also changed, Ayodhya Junction railway station already exists. Unlike Allahabad and Faizabad, there is no proposal to change the name of the city in case of Jhansi. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has been indicating that the state government would go ahead with the name-change wherever it found necessary. “We did what we felt was good. We renamed Mughalsarai after Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, Allahabad as Prayagraj and Faizabad as Ayodhya. Where there is a need, the government will take the steps required,” the CM had said in 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/proposal-to-rename-jhansi-rly-station-after-lakshmibai/articleshow/84000197.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

Kanpur is the only city in the state where Covaxin trial on children is underway. Similar trials are also in progress at six other locations, including AIIMS Delhi and AIIMS Patna. The youngest among 10 children to be administered trial dose was a two and a half years old girl child. A total of 15 children were administered Covaxin in the age category of two to six years. Five of them were administered Covaxin last week. In all, 55 children have been administered Covaxin as a part of the vaccine trial. Of these 55 children, 40 belong to six-12 and 12-17 age categories. The trial had commenced in the first fortnight of June. If everything goes well, Covaxin could be used to vaccinate children against Covid-19 in the coming months. Children who have been vaccinated are being observed and the result of the clinical trial is being shared with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Last year also, Covaxin trials were held at Prakhar hospital under the supervision of Dr JS Kushwaha, chief guide for Covaxin trial at the hospital. Talking to TOI, Dr Kushwaha said, “Vaccinating children and then securing them is never easy. However, we successfully completed the trials of this vaccine among children at our hospital. The clinical trial results would be shared with ICMR. All the children who have been vaccinated are being monitored and observed. All of them are fine.” He said that the youngest child to be vaccinated on Wednesday was a girl aged two and a half years. In all, 55 children were vaccinated in the month of June. Now, the phase II trials of the vaccine, Covaxin, are over. The second dose of the vaccine would be administered to the children when the due date arrives. He also said that a few doctors had arrived in Kanpur from Lucknow to get their children their first trial dose of Covaxin. While the vaccine was being administered to the children, the fear of getting injected was visible on their faces. Some of them even cried out of fear of injection. However, expert doctors injected the vaccine so softly that children were seen in a relaxed mood after some time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/covaxin-administered-to-10children-in-trial-phase-ii/articleshow/84000573.cms||Abhinav Malhotra

During the first six months of 2021, PE-VC investments in India grew 33% year-on-year. The first half (January-June) of 2021 saw investments of $27.1 billion (across 442 deals) compared to $20.4 billion (across 433 deals) during the same period last year, data from research firm Venture Intelligence showed. A major chunk of the total PE investments flew into IT & ITeS and healthcare, benefiting from increased digital adoption and growth opportunities in these sectors during the pandemic. The half-year period (H1-2021) also saw creation of 16 unicorns compared to just three in H1-2020. Despite a dip in May, the April-June quarter (Q2-2021) saw $14.3-billion investments across 215 deals, registering a 12% sequential increase compared to $12.8 billion across 227 deals in January-March. Q2-2021 witnessed 33 mega deals (worth over $100-million) worth $11.5 billion, compared to 12 such investments in the same period last year. As many as 11 companies turned unicorns in this quarter, attracting close to $5.1 billion worth of investments. “While April saw over $7 billion being invested on the back of mega deals in the tech sector, the intensive second wave of the pandemic saw deal value in May dip to just $2.7 billion,” Venture Intelligence founder Arun Natarajan said. “It is good to see a quick resurgence in the pace of investments in June (which saw $4.2 billion invested across 79 deals),” he added. The $2.8-billion bid by Blackstone to buy 75% stake in IT & BPO services firm Mphasis accounted for 20% of the PE-VC investment pie in Q2. The other top deals of the quarter included the $900-million acquisition of Infogain by Apax Partners and the $800-million investment in food delivery platform SSwiggy by Prosus Ventures QIA, Falcon Edge Capital and others. Sector wise, the pandemic’s impact on digitisation was a tailwind for IT/ITeS companies that accounted for $14.4 billion of the total investment pie in the first half of 2021. In the first half of 2020, IT/ITeS enterprises raised $3.3 billion. Another winner was the healthcare and life sciences sector, which attracted about $2.25 billion in H1-2021 — a 48% spike compared to the $1.52 billion invested in H1-2020. The April-June quarter alone witnessed over 10 life sciences investments, Venture Intelligence said. The sector was led by the $398-million buyout of the animal health business Zydus AH by a consortium led by PE firm Multiples in May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pe-vc-investments-grow-33-in-first-six-months-of-2021/articleshow/84000522.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Thirteen persons were arrested, including five in Arwal, in th two separate operations. The gun factory was running at Gulmahiyachak in Sabbalpur village under River police station area at Fatuha in Patna district. The carbine was bought in Gaya and being brought to Sai Chak at Beur in Patna. Eleven live cartridges of different bores, nine cellphones and the car in which the five criminals were travelling were also seized. STF sources said Mohammad Sabir of Kasim Bazaar, Ankit Kumar alias Charan Choudhary of Suturkhana, Mohammad Kasim of Pakki Gali in Betwan Bazaar, Mohammad Asgar of Hazratganj, Mohammad Yusuf of Sakin Bazaar (all in Munger), Ravi Kumar of Jagatpur in Bhagalpur and Randhir Kumar and his younger brother Sandhir Kumar of Sabbalpur were arrested for allegedly running the gun factory and smuggling arms and ammunition. Twenty partially manufactured semi-automatic countrymade pistols, one lathe machine, a drilling machine, a milling with cutter machine and a grinder were seized from the spot. River police station SHO Dharmendra Prasad said they had been running the illegal gun factory for the last two years. “On an average, they were manufacturing 10 to 15 semi-automatic pistols per day and selling them to dealers in Munger and Bakhtiyarpur in Patna for Rs6,000 to Rs6,500 each. They procured raw materials from Kolkata,” Prasad said. He said Kasim and one Munna of Sabbalpur area were the masterminds. “Raids are on to nab Munna. The factory was running in the house of one Ram Ekbal Mahto. He was being paid a monthly rent of Rs16,000. Randhir and Sandhir are Mahto’s sons,” the SHO said. In Arwal, the STF arrested Shambhu Kumar Yadav of Jamhaur in Aurangabad, Sanjit Kumar alias Chotu, Amarnath Mahto and Ajay Kumar of Danara in Bikram and Manjit Kumar of Mithapur in Patna. Kinjar police station SHO Manoj Kumar said Shambhu, a property dealer, was sitting with his four-year-old son in the car to avoid suspicion. “He was returning to his other residence in Beur after purchasing the carbine for Rs2.85 lakh from one Ramdip Sharma alias Deppi at Mau under Tekari police station in Gaya. Raid on Ramdip’s residence yielded the money. He had fled till then,” Manoj said. “Shambhu is accused in three criminal cases in Aurangabad while Sanjit, an arms smuggler, is booked in nine cases lodged with Bikram, Rupaspur, Bihta and Jakkanpur police stations in Patna district,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mini-gun-factory-unearthed-in-fatuha/articleshow/83998753.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Business||HDFC Bank sees revival in card spends||Mumbai: HDFC Bank on Wednesday said that it has started seeing green shoots of consumer spending revival and is going all-out to grow its share of credit card spending though the RBI has banned the lender from issuing new cards since December 2020. The bank said it is preparing to regain the market share it lost so that it can be ‘back with a bang’ when the central bank lifts the embargo on card issuance. The country’s largest private bank said it has already identified customers eligible for credit cards. Parag Rao, group head (payments, consumer finance, digital banking, and IT) at HDFC Bank, said the card business got hit in the first quarter, but transactions have started improving towards the end of June. Rao said that HDFC Bank has a significant play in consumption spending as a big chunk of the country’s payment activity flows through HDFC Bank. He said that the regulatory action has prompted the bank to increase investment in technology, which was already in line with global standards. HDFC Bank, the largest issuer of credit cards in the country, saw its market share drop from 25% in FY20 to 24% in FY21. However, in card spends, the bank has increased its share from 29% to 31% in the same period. Explaining the drop in the number of cards, Rao said, “If you do not eat for a week, you will lose weight.” He added that this was a temporary situation. Rao said that rather than scale down ambitions, the bank has used the period to prepare the grounds to accelerate growth when the embargo is lifted. “During the six months when we were not issuing new credit cards, we increased our merchant acceptance base, our liability franchise increased and today we are sitting on a large base of already analytically data-mined customers who have been pre-approved,” said Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-bank-sees-revival-in-card-spends/articleshow/84001836.cms||---

An order in this regard was issued by the Patna district administration and shared by the airport authorities on Wednesday. Earlier, the administration had issued a letter on April 7, stating that flyers arriving from the three states with high Covid-19 cases, had to furnish negative RT-PCR reports. A decision to revoke the previous order has come in the wake of depleting Covid cases in Bihar. Patna district magistrate (DM), Chandrashekar Singh, has asked the airport director, Bhupesh C H Negi, to implement the order across all airlines flying to the state. “Based on the revised order issued by the DM, the implementation has already been done. Apart from this, Covid-appropriate protocols, random testing, and thermal scanning will be carried out as a precautionary measure,” Negi told this newspaper on Wednesday. Frequent travellers from Punjab, Maharashtra and Kerala also shared their experiences. “I came to Patna from Chandigarh on Tuesday to look for property. The relaxation in rules made the process easier,” said Suryansh Pathak, a resident of Chandigarh. He added, “I understand that the rules keep changing. I am happy that the airport authorities are doing their best to ensure the safety of travellers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-ve-rt-pcr-report-required-for-flyers-from-three-states/articleshow/83997318.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Antibody cocktail therapy study at 4 government hospitals||KOLKATA: The state health department is set to study the effectiveness of the monoclonal antibody cocktail therapy in high-risk Covid patients. It is one of the newest drugs that counters the virus by preventing patients from being hospitalized or protects them from severe infection, and will be used on mild to moderately infected patients in four state-run hospitals — Medical College Hospital, ID Hospital, MR Bangur Hospital and Sambhunath Pandit Hospital. Antibodies are proteins the body generates against infection. But these monoclonal antibodies are artificially created to fight a particular disease. Casirivimab and imdevimab, which forms the cocktail, are produced by Switzerland-based Roche. “We are sharing the protocol with the four hospitals on type of patients, how to administer the drug and assess the outcome,” said director health services Ajay Chakraborty. The health department has about 300 vials of the drug. Earlier, only a couple of private hospitals have used the therapy on about six patients. The cost of a multi-dose pack, which can treat two patients, is Rs 1.2 lakh. “It is a cost-effective therapy,” said clinical trial specialist Santanu Tripathi. He, along with doctors Jyotirmoy Pal, Shambo S Samajdar and Shatavisa Mukherjee, will be guiding and coordinating with teams from the four hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/antibody-cocktail-therapy-study-at-4-govt-hosps/articleshow/84000946.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Vadodara||Amul's first price hike after Covid-19 hit nation||VADODARA: Citizens who are already reeling under the pressure of skyrocketing fuel prices during Covid-19 times, will now have to pay more for their daily milk as well.  The Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) which markets milk and milk products under Amul brand has decided to increase milk prices by Rs 2 per litre in all varieties of milk from Thursday morning.  With this, milk prices in Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Saurashtra in Gujarat and Delhi-NCR region will rise from July 1 while prices in other cities of the country will soar within the next couple of days. Surat-based Sumul Dairy, a member union of GCMMF, has already hiked milk prices in mid-June.  Milk prices are being revised across the country where Amul markets its fresh milk. Milk prices had last soared in December 2019 before Covid-19 hit the country and battered economy. In fact, in 2019, Amul had twice increased milk prices by Rs 2 a litre – first in May and later in December - the same year but in 2020, it kept the sensitive decision of revising milk prices untouched.  The increase of Rs 2 per litre translates into 4 % increase in MRP which is much lower than average food inflation, GCMMF officials said.  “We have not made any price revision in our fresh milk category since more than one and a half years. Since then, due to rise in costs of energy, packaging, logistics, overall cost of operation has increased. Our packaging cost has increased by 35 %. Similarly, there is 25-30 % increase in logistics cost,” said R S Sodhi, managing director of GCMMF.  “Considering the rise in input costs, our member unions have also increased farmers’ price in the range of Rs 45 to Rs 50 per kg fat which is more than 6 % over previous year,” he said, adding that currently farmers are paid procurement price in the range of Rs 680 to Rs 700 per kg fat.  “Milk price in Vadodara too will be revised from tomorrow itself,” Baroda Dairy’s vice-chairman G B Solanki told TOI after a board meeting on Wednesday.  As a policy, Amul passes on almost 80 paise of every rupee paid by consumers for milk and milk products to milk producers, said Sodhi.  “The price revision shall help in sustaining remunerative milk prices to our milk producers and to encourage them for higher milk production,” a release issued by GCMMF mentioned.  Amul currently sells 60 lakh litres milk on daily basis in Gujarat while its sales of fresh milk stands at nearly 1.5 crore litres a day. It procures 250 lakh litres milk per day from village level milk societies associated with its member unions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/now-milk-to-burn-a-hole-in-your-pocket/articleshow/83998758.cms||Prashant Rupera
---||Pune||Pune: At PMC hospitals, adding ICU beds can ease crises worries for citizens||PUNE: New Covid cases are on the decline, but the anguish brought on by second wave of the pandemic is far from over. The harrowing search for a bed in the intensive care units (ICU), the uncertainty about oxygen availability and the unease over vaccine shortage are painful day-to-day reminders. After the pandemic struck, ICU facilities were added to the PMC-run Naidu Hospital and Dalvi Hospital on a temporary basis. Now, these facilities must stay on as regular set-ups even beyond the emergency situation, the activists said. The PMC authorities should focus on expanding the existing 35-bed temporary ICU facilities to the permanent hubs of a minimum of 100 ICU beds, activists emphasized. Barring the state-run Sassoon General Hospital, the district hospital, and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation-run YCM Hospital and the rural hospitals, ICU facilities are negligible in public hospitals in Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR). “The biggest lesson we have learned from the Covid pandemic is that public health services are the lifeline of society and ensuring their full functionality is necessary,” medical practitioner and health activist Abhay Shukla of Jan Aarogya Abhiyaan said. The pandemic has exposed severe neglect of public health services in Pune city. “During the peak in both the first and the second waves, public hospitals were unable to deal with a large number of Covid patients. They were forced to seek care in private hospitals at unaffordable costs,” Shukla said. The PMC authorities must start the idle ICU facility at Kamala Nehru Hospital, the largest PMC-run hospital with 450 beds, Shukla added. The hospital has all the ICU infrastructure and the PMC has spent Rs 50 crore on its upgrade . It has been non-operational over staffing issues. Civic authorities said their recruitment drive received a poor response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/at-pmc-hospitals-adding-icu-beds-can-ease-crises-worries-for-citizens/articleshow/84001419.cms||Umesh Isalkar

She alleged that she was threatened and forced to sign the papers by the sons of her husband’s first wife. N Maruthi Mahalakshmi moved the high court on behalf of her son Govinda Swamy, seeking directions to set aside the proceedings issued by endowments special commissioner, which hands over the mutt’s management to assistant commissioner of endowments, Kadapa district. In her petition, Mahalakshmi argued that according to the will of her husband and the customs of the mutt, her elder son is the legal successor of the mutt. As her son is still a minor, she should be the temporary head of the mutt till her son attains the age of major. She further stated that the proceedings issued by the special commissioner handing over the management to the assistant commissioner and subsequent proceedings issued by the assistant commissioner directing the manager to hand over the documents are illegal and without jurisdictional authority. She pleaded the high court to set aside the proceedings issued by the endowments commissioner and to direct the authorities to recognise her son as legal successor to the mutt.

---||Patna||IAF gives nod to expansion of Darbhanga airport||PATNA: The Indian Air Force (IAF) has given its nod to expansion of Darbhanga airport, for which the state government will acquire 78 acres of land, state IPRD and water resources minister Sanjay Kumar Jha said on Wednesday. The IAF, in its letter addressed to Darbhanga district magistrate (DM) on Tuesday, has stated that state government may commence acquisition of 78 acres of civil land for Darbhanga airport outside the IAF station. The Darbhanga airbase belongs to IAF and commercial flight operations commenced here from November 8 last year following construction of a temporary civil enclave over an area of 15,000 square feet. Jha said after the expansion, total eight flights will be allowed to be parked at a time at Darbhanga airport as compared to two at present. He further said night-landing facility will also be possible following the airport expansion. The minister said around 54 acres of land will be used for construction of a bigger terminal building and remaining 24 acres will be required for runway extension and other utilities, including installation of Instrument Landing System of category-1 (ILS, CAT-1). An ILS helps pilots at the time of landing as far as identifying the position of the runway at which the touchdown has to be made is concerned. Jha attributed the developments to keen interest taken by CM Nitish Kumar. “CM Nitish wrote several letters to the civil aviation ministry for timely commencement of commercial flight operations, allowing more airlines to operate, commencing cargo and air ambulance facilities,” he told TOI. Nitish had written a letter to aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri on December 23 last year, requesting more flights, development of permanent terminal amenities and naming the airport after Maithili poet Vidyapati. The CM also demanded construction of a permanent terminal building over there. “The AAI had initially sought 31 acres of land for development of a civil enclave and other amenities. Later, they sought 78 acres of land for the airport’s expansion. Thereafter, Nitsh called a meeting to finalise the matter. Accordingly, a proposal was sent to IAF for the airport’s expansion over 78 acres of land and its nod came on Tuesday,” Jha said. Darbhanga airport has a runway of 9000ft and two aprons. The airport is presently handling three flights of SpiceJet to Bengaluru, Delhi and Mumbai daily. As per a tweet made by the airport on Wednesday, altogether 48,600 people travelled from Darbhanga airport in June by 189 flights operating to and from there during the same time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/iaf-gives-nod-to-expansion-of-darbhanga-airport/articleshow/83996604.cms||Piyush Tripathi

The move will help strengthen healthcare infrastructure at the village level by taking the physician to the doorsteps of people. The government has decided to deploy additional mobile medical units (104) to ensure availability of doctors in rural areas of the state. The mobile medical unit (MMU) — which will have a physician, nurse, lab technician and medicines — will visit each village secretariat covering a population of 1,000 at least twice a month. The team will treat the patients’ ailments at the preliminary stage while referring the complicated cases to the district and teaching hospitals depending on the need. “The scheme has been chiefly designed to help locals get familiarised with the family physician concept as he/she would be regularly meeting them to provide assistance on health issues,” said a senior health official. The state cabinet on Wednesday stamped its nod for procurement of about 539 MMUs for effective implementation of the family physician concept. “Prior to July 2020, each MMU used to cover about 1.3 lakh people every month, due to which we found it difficult to implement the family physician concept. Subsequently, additional MMUs were procured to uniformly cover a population of 54,000. However, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy wants to further increase the MMU services to ensure that a physician visits each village secretariat at least twice a month,” said deputy chief minister (health) Alla Kalikrishna Srinivas (Nani). To implement the scheme effectively, officials estimate that at least 1,215 MMUs are required to cover the entire state. With just 676 MMUs extending services, the chief minister has directed officials to procure another 539 vehicles for effective implementation of the family physician concept. Meanwhile, doctors have appealed to the government to protect them from attacks by patients’ kin and also reduce work stress. Many government doctors and house surgeons demanded that the state government should scrap GO 64, which they say would be their best gift on Doctors Day. “We stand on the frontline to save lives, still we are branded as medical mafia. Everyone comes to us when they fall sick, but they ignore our services after recovery. We always try to save lives but it is not possible all the time. We are becoming victims of physical abuse by attendants of patients. The government should protect us and take action,” demanded ophthalmology surgeon Dr N Srinivas Phani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/govt-to-revive-family-physician-system/articleshow/83998929.cms||Samdani MN

According to official sources, the ACB questioned the secretariat officials on the issuance of cheques under various schemes, ex-gratia and the mechanism involved for ground level verification. They also reviewed the tracking mechanism of the cheque disbursement process and counter filings. Employees were asked to provide data on the total number of cheques issued from 2015 till date to check for irregularities in this period. The CMRF scam came to light on September 20, 2020 when assistant secretary from the finance department, P Murali Krishna Rao, lodged a complaint with Thulluru police, claiming that the accused tried to withdraw around Rs 117.15 crore by depositing forged cheques with the same numbers at three different banks. However, the bank officials contacted the assistant secretary to verify the transactions and managed to freeze the process. Later, Crime Investigation Department (CID) sleuths took up the investigation and arrested 10 persons from Mangalore.

But on Wednesday, he joined Tata Steel’s 114th annual general meeting (AGM), surprising the company’s shareholders. In his brief speech at the AGM, which was held virtually, the octogenarian appreciated the company’s leadership for its financial performance in fiscal 2021. He said that despite Covid challenges and drop in demand, Tata Steel achieved strong results and commended the move to disburse the highest-ever dividend. Tata Steel will pay a dividend of Rs 25 per fully paid share. Shareholders, who have stood with the company, will be happy, he said. The Tata patriarch said the company holds a special place in his heart. He recalled that he began his career in Tata Steel 57 years ago, working on the shop floor for three years, and has watched the company grow since then. Tata Steel, which was founded in 1907, making it one of the oldest Tata companies, has seen several highs & lows, gains & losses throughout its history. Many Tata Steel shareholders, with some holding the stock for two generations and before, were delighted to see the former chairman at the meeting. Before Tata’s address to the shareholders, current Tata Steel chairman N Chandrasekaran said the company is at an important inflection point in its history and has the opportunity to create substantial long-term value for its stakeholders. “With a stronger balance sheet, an agile team, disciplined operating culture and a strong market environment for steel worldwide, the current financial year has the promise to be spectacularly better than the previous year,” Chandrasekaran said. Tata Steel recorded its highest-ever free cash flows and operating profit of Rs 23,748 crore and Rs 30,892 crore in fiscal 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tata-makes-agm-cameo-lauds-tata-steel-mgmt/articleshow/84001988.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Several districts have been without vaccine doses for the past four days. State health minister Mangal Pandey said the state has received 7.75 lakh doses of vaccines on Wednesday and additional 10 lakh doses will come by the end of this week. However, the Covid-19 vaccination data shared by the Union government shows a huge decline in the number of vaccinations in Bihar since June 27. As per that data, 35,135 people were given the vaccines on June 27, which was the least number of vaccinations in a day this month. On June 28, a total of 49,760 beneficiaries got the shots. On June 29, 38,164 beneficiaries received the vaccine jabs. Only 22,699 beneficiaries were inoculated till June 30 evening. Eleven districts had zero vaccination on Wednesday. There has been no vaccination in Arwal, Begusarai and Sitamarhi districts since June 27. In Darbhanga, only 50 beneficiaries were vaccinated on June 27.

The Tuesday data showed that only 10 people were given the vaccines in Lakhisarai, 24 in Gopalganj, 23 in Jehanabad, 43 in Khagaria, 69 in Madhepura, 12 in Saharsa and 50 in Sheohar. Patna, where average 35,000 people got vaccinated every day till recently, reported the vaccination of only 5,427 beneficiaries on June 27, followed by 19,701 on June 28 and 21,300 on June 29. Patna district magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh said they had got fresh one lakh vaccine doses on Wednesday — 30,000 of Covishield and 70,000 of Covaxin. Singh said they will be carrying out their routine immunization as vaccines keep coming. “There will be no issue in achieving the target. We are creating awareness and simultaneously vaccinating people,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-gets-7-75-lakh-doses-as-6-crore-vaccines-in-6-months-drive-begins-today/articleshow/83996754.cms||Sheezan Nezami

For the quarter ended March 2020, the current account was in a surplus of $600 million due to lower trade volumes. For the full year FY21, the current account balance recorded a surplus of 0.9% of GDP as against a deficit of 0.9% in FY20 on the back of a sharp contraction in the trade deficit to $102.2 billion from $157.5 billion in FY20. This is the first time that the country has recorded an annual current account surplus in 17 years. Releasing the data on Wednesday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said that the CAD in Q4FY21 was primarily because of a higher trade deficit and lower net invisible receipts than in the corresponding period of the previous year. Broadly speaking, the CAD reflects the gap between the money flowing out on account of imports and money flowing in due to exports. The current account surplus is a reflection of how competitive an economy is. The balance of payment (BoP) position improved significantly due to large inflows in the form of foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investment (FPI). Net FDI inflows at $44 billion in FY21 were higher than $43 billion in FY20.  Net FPI increased by $36.1 billion in 2020-21 as compared to $1.4 billion a year ago.“As the economy got back on its feet, there was a tendency for the trade deficit to widen. Invisibles were lower as this gets linked to the state of the global economy. We do expect the CAD to be in deficit in FY22 and are looking at -0.5-1% of GDP. However, capital inflows will continue to provide support which will ensure fundamentals remain strong,” said Care Ratings in a report. A BoP surplus ensures that the country has enough foreign exchange to meet import requirements. A large surplus is positive for the exchange rate. In the fourth quarter, there was an accretion of $3.4 billion to the foreign exchange reserves (on a BoP basis) as compared with an accretion of $18.8 billion in Q4FY20. In 2020-21, there was an accretion of $87.3 billion to foreign exchange reserves (on a BoP basis). “With activity continuing to normalise and higher commodity prices, the CAD is likely to widen in the coming quarters, in our view. In the current fiscal year, we expect India to post a CAD of $35 billion (1.1% of GDP), although robust capital flows will ensure a BoP surplus of $50 billion. Despite the rising vaccine costs, we expect the central bank to continue its strategy of accumulating foreign exchange reserves. We expect the RBI’s reserves to increase to $645 billion by March 2022,” said Rahul Bajoria, an economist with Barclays.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/q4-cad-widens-fy-surplus-1st-in-17-years/articleshow/84001890.cms||---
---||Delhi||Outgoing Delhi Police top cop lifted sagging morale of police force, restored people’s confidence||NEW DELHI: After successfully completing his tenure of one and a half years as Delhi Police commissioner, 1985-batch IPS officer SN Shrivastava hung up his boots on Wednesday amid an emotional farewell by personnel from the force. Many were teary-eyed as cops pulled his car out of the police headquarters as a gesture to see him off. Having taken up the reins at a time when the morale of cops had hit rock bottom with policemen forced to protest against their commissioner and a riot keeping the city on tenterhooks, Shrivastava managed to control the damage within a short span. One of the little talked about actions of Shrivastava was police welfare. Being liberal in giving deserving cops out-of-turn promotions and meeting and congratulating the boots on the ground after they had cracked a major crime did wonders in re-establishing the trust and confidence in the leadership. His flagship initiative of giving out-of-turn promotion for tracing a certain number of missing children proved to be a major success. On Wednesday, after inspecting the farewell parade at Kingsway Camp, Shrivastava said he was retiring with his head held high and a satisfied mind. “I was the 22nd police commissioner of Delhi. We all are temporary. We come and go, but Delhi Police is permanent, providing security and law and order to people,” he added. “It’s our responsibility to keep policemen safe from Covid-19. We have taken care of Delhi and filled all voids. We provided oxygen, medicine and food during the lockdown,” said Shrivastava. Commenting on the conduct of police during the farmers’ protests, he said policemen exercised restraint despite facing provocation. “They (policemen) had to jump from 15 feet at Red Fort, but they never lost restraint and showed impeccable professionalism,” he added. In February 2020, Shrivastava, an AGMUT-cadre officer, was repatriated to Delhi Police from Central Reserve Police Force overnight with clear directions to quell the riots and restore peace. He controlled the riots in less than 24 hours. Later, he went on to commandeer the most extensive riots investigation, which involved registration of 750 FIRs and arrest of over 1,800 people. Credited with dealing with the pandemic in an efficient manner, while ensuring that cops got the best possible treatment, Shrivastava’s leadership in handling the oxygen crisis during the second wave earned praise from all quarters. The migrant crisis was handled successfully without use of any force. The force also showed its humane side by helping lakhs of needy people during the lockdown. By adopting technology, he did away with the “morning diary” system and made manpower, time and infrastructure-consuming exercises go digital. He made PCR calls the parameter to measure crime in an area. As a result of his negotiations, the families of Delhi Police personnel will now get Rs 28 lakh instead of Rs 5 lakh in case of their untimely demise. In case of accidental death, they will get Rs 78 lakh. Asked about his post-retirement plans, Shrivastava seemed in no mood to take a back seat in life. He said this was the beginning of another chapter in life, which must be fully lived and utilised. The fitness freak added that he would talk about his upcoming plans in due course.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/outgoing-top-cop-lifted-sagging-morale-of-police-force-restored-peoples-confidence/articleshow/84001501.cms||Raj Shekhar

It was launched by the principal scientific adviser to the Government of India, Professor K Vijay Raghavan, who said that GRIP would result in the development of several innovative solutions for the society. As part of this programme, a group of students will visit communities located in smaller towns and villages to immerse in social environments for substantial time—one week to months— to study, understand and identify local needs and challenges, which can be addressed by the students when they return to the institute campus. Students will also be allowed to work on semester-long or year-long projects on finding novel solutions to grassroots problems identified by them. “There are many students who have shown interest in addressing the unmet needs in their own neighbourhoods. Further, students are enthusiastic to participate in proposing and validating novel solutions that respond to the local situation and the interests and values of the communities involved. The GRIP initiative is aimed at providing resources to the students who want to help society by solving its problems,” said IIT Delhi director V Ramgopal Rao. The institute has joined hands with Honey Bee Network to groom students as torchbearers of social and grassroots innovations through the initiative.

---||Delhi||Sputnik V shots now available in private hospitals||New Delhi: Private hospital chains Apollo and Fortis Healthcare have started administering Russian Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V, officials said on Thursday. Indraprastha Apollo in Delhi started administering Sputnik V in a staged manner from Wednesday. Around 1,000 people have been vaccinated so far, a spokesperson said. “On-spot registration and walk-in facility for Sputnik V is currently restricted. We are encouraging beneficiaries to take appointments through the CoWin app,” the official added. According to a Fortis Healthcare official, the hospital chain had started providing Sputnik V jabs last week at Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurgaon, and Fortis Hospital, Mohali. “To accelerate the vaccination drive, we are introducing the vaccine at Fortis Escorts Hospital, Jaipur, from Friday. We have received a good response, and a total of 2,193 people have been vaccinated till now,” he said. The official added that Fortis Healthcare has received fresh supplies of Sputnik V, which will help it ramp up the inoculation drive. A hospital source said there had been some delay in vaccine supply and it could be linked to rise in cases in Russia, which has started a largescale vaccination drive for its population. An official of Madhukar Rainbow Children’s Hospital in Delhi said the facility would receive Sputnik V doses from Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy’s Laboratories — the marketing partner for the vaccine in the country — in three to four days. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sputnik-v-shots-now-available-in-private-hospitals/articleshow/84049349.cms||---
---||Mumbai||How will you tackle garbage on coastline, asks high court||Mumbai: Bombay high court on Friday drew the attention of the Centre, state and BMC to the filth and garbage strewn across the state and Mumbai’s coastline and asked how they propose to deal with the problem.  “During the last few days, particularly after Cyclone Tauktae hit the coast, there were newspaper reports which said the coastline is full of filth and garbage left behind by the sea,” said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni, hearing PILs on Covid-19. “It paints a sorry picture with regard to the cleanliness of the coast. Over and above the problem to the coast, there is danger to marine life because of dumping of filth,” said the chief justice.  The judges said they are considering taking suo motu cognisance of the issue and want to know from the Union, state and corporation how they “proposed to deal with this problem”.  The judges said they have prepared a list of all news reports including TOI’s May 20 report on the sea piling 87% more trash on seven beaches in Mumbai on the day of the cyclone. They said the issue pertains to the entire coastline of Maharashtra, including beaches in Mumbai. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni sought time to respond saying there can’t be any objection to tackling filth on the coastline.  The judges said that the reason they want to deal with the problem right now is because of the monsoon. “It can’t be deferred because of Covid. It has to go side by side. We know the administration is overburdened. Even then the problem is quite serious and needs to be dealt with,” the chief justice said. The judges will take up the matter on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/how-will-you-tackle-garbage-on-coastline-asks-high-court/articleshow/84003841.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand government set to appeal in Supreme Court against HC stay on Char Dham Yatra||DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand government’s lawyers are drafting an appeal against the Nainital high court (HC) ordering a stay on conducting the Char Dham Yatra. The appeal will be filed in a couple of days in the Supreme Court, state government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal told TOI on Wednesday. The government had decided to knock the doors of the Supreme Court on Monday after the HC took strong exception to the state’s decision to start the annual pilgrimage from July 1 for residents of three districts — where the four Char Dham shrines are situated — and for the entire state from July 11. After reviewing the state’s arrangements for conducting the pilgrimage, the court said that holding the yatra at this stage — when the third wave of the pandemic has been predicted — would ‘invite a catastrophe again.’ The division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma had termed the government’s decision “not only arbitrary and unreasonable but also violating Article 14 (equality before law), Article 21 (protection of life) and several other provisions of the Constitution.” Uniyal meanwhile said that the decision to conduct the yatra had been made after detailed discussions on how all all aspects of the pilgrimage will be managed. “Fifteen days prior to the start of the yatra, the Char Dham Devsthanam Board and the district authorities had been directed to ensure all required arrangements, medical facilities and safety measures were put in place. RT- PCR negative report was made mandatory for entering the temples and our medical teams were to be stationed at different locations.” He added that “a collective limit of 750 pilgrims per day had been set for the yatra which is very reasonable.” “Last year, the yatra was started in July for everyone and the daily average pilgrim turnout was 40 at Yamunotri, 70 at Gangotri, 180 at Kedarnath and 400 at Badrinath. This was when the yatra was open for the entire country. Since we were opening the pilgrimage for only three districts, therefore a limit of 750 was set. We will be putting up all these facts before the Supreme Court” Uniyal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-govt-set-to-appeal-in-sc-against-hc-stay-on-char-dham-yatra/articleshow/83994606.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Mumbai||Will start home vaccination trial in Pune, state tells Bombay HC||MUMBAI: The state will start trials for vaccinating the bed-bound at home in Pune district soon, the advocate general (AG) told the Bombay high court on Wednesday. “We will take our own decision. We will explore this possibility (for home vaccination) on a trial basis in Pune district,’’ said AG Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, adding the state will not seek or wait for an approval from the Centre. An email address would be created right away for people to send in queries or requests. Proper awareness would be created too, said Kumbhakoni. The HC will further hear the matter on Thursday in chambers on the AG’s request to avoid any misconception. It will also hear Dr Sanjay Oak, chief of the state Covid-19 task force, and advocate Dhruti Kapadia, whose PIL for door-step jabs for the elderly, specially abled and bedridden persons is being heard. The state public health department had said in its affidavit on Monday that it would propose home vaccination for the bedridden and immobile on an experimental basis based on guidelines set out by the task force, but with mandatory pre-conditions and only after seeking state and central approval. In open court, it was rebuked on Tuesday by a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni, who said: “This affidavit dilutes the state Covid task force guidelines… This is not what we expected from the state.” The state’s affidavit had come after the HC appreciated the draft guidelines framed by the task force on June 22. It gave the state a week’s time, as sought, to finalise the norms. The conditions in Monday’s affidavit require a mandatory certificate from a person’s family doctor to show the person is “truly immobile and bedridden” and also a certificate that any adverse reaction would be unlikely and, if there is, the doctor would be entirely responsible in treating it. The proposal also seeks written consent from a family member and rounding up of 10 vaccine recipients so that a vial once opened at home is not wasted. The HC on Wednesday asked that in hospitals, when written consent is taken for any critical procedure, is the doctor required to certify his or her responsibility towards the treatment? The HC also asked Kumbhakoni if adverse reaction (AEFI) was really still the state’s concern and pointed to new reports of how in Tripura, over 80% eligible population has been vaccinated, including a 99-year-old woman with co-morbidities. Kumbhakoni said he would address the HC on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/will-start-home-vaccination-trial-in-pune-state-tells-bombay-hc/articleshow/84001511.cms||---

As the two drowned, their friends raised an alarm and officials from the Bhiwandi rural police station informed the fire brigade, which came to the spot. “A search and rescue operation was undertaken immediately, but after two hours, due to the darkness descending on the area, it was stopped,” chief fire officer Rajesh Pawar said. The heavy rain over the past week had increased the water level of the pond, attracting locals for a swim.

---||Delhi||Delhi: For Yamuna, change for worse only constant||NEW DELHI: Even as the Yamuna continues to suffer, with toxic froth accumulating on its surface and tonnes of sewage entering the river each day, its floodplain is fighting a battle of its own. While there have been many directives in the past, including a recent National Green Tribunal judgment, on the floodplain being freed of all encroachments and given protection in the form of security guards, CCTV cameras and boundary walls and signages depicting the floodplain area, unauthorised colonies and encroachments continue to chip away at whatever land is left on the course of the river. With the draft Delhi Master Plan 2041 looking at delineating the Yamuna floodplain’s zone-O into two parts and possibly allowing the existing unauthorised colonies to stay in zone O-II, experts say the river ecosystem could be at risk. TOI took a ride along the Yamuna floodplain on Wednesday and found nothing much had changed in the years since the orders to regulate activity on the designated area and to prohibit farming there. While NGT, in 2015 initially and again in 2019, banned any farming on the floodplain, citing studies carried out by different agencies about the vegetables grown there being potentially toxic due to the polluted water, TOI observed crop cultivation in Geeta Colony, Madanpur Khadar and Jaitpur. While the initial fear about the order, boosted by encroachment drives, did rid the Yamuna floodplain of scores of farmers, two years later, their anxieties have apparently disappeared. Beena Kumari, who grows cauliflowers near Geeta Colony, said it was the only source of income for their family and so they had to persist in the activity in the proscribed area. “The pandemic has made it even more difficult to earn money. We have no other source of income,” she argued. Farming is, however, the least of the floodplain’s worries. From car parkings to houses that stand three and four storeys high, the unauthorised colonies continue to thrive in the river’s zone-O. By law, no commercial or construction activity can take place in the zone-O because this poses a risk not only to the floodplain ecology, but also ups the potential for flooded. TOI found the unauthorised colonies in Jamia Nagar had now stretched all the way to the riverbanks adjacent to where Delhi Development Authority’s latest biodiversity park is located at Kalindi Kunj. According to the draft MPD41, zone O-I of the floodplain comprises 6,295 hectares and is the ‘active’ floodplain zone. Zone O-II, all 3,684 hectares of it, will be the ‘riverfront’, with regulated development. While a total of 76 unauthorised colonies had applied for ownership under the Pradhan Mantri Unauthorised Colonies in Delhi Awas Adhikar Yojana, 71 of these fall under zone O-II, possibly paving way for their legalisation. Yasir Arafat, who is in charge of the Kalindi Kunj biodiversity park, said, “Parts of Abul Fazal Enclave and Jamia Nagar now extend almost to the floodplain,” said Arafat. “We cleared garbage from near the park boundaries and a wall will be erected soon to prevent encroachment. The floodplain has also been prominently demarcated with signages.” At Jaitpur Extension, buildings stood even closer to the river, sometimes just 500 metres from it. TOI came across several newly constructed houses as well as new constructions going on. A well-demarcated boundary proved these structures were on the Yamuna floodplain. The residents, however, countered the charges. “This land is quite a distance from the floodplain. The water does not even reach the first set of houses, let alone our houses,” argued Dinesh Kumar. Manoj Mishra, convener of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, is dismayed at the lax implementation of the NGT judgment. “To my knowledge, encroachments have only been removed in Bela Estate, south of the old railway bridge, where farming was rife,” said Mishra. Some farmers were also removed from the Commonwealth Games Village, while some jhuggis near the new biodiversity park were demolished. But no action has been taken about the unauthorised colonies or the larger structures.” Mishra said the multiplicity of land-owning agencies only made it easier to pass the blame for non-action. “Jaitpur, where there are brazen violations, is under Delhi government, so DDA can easily overlook the encroachments there,” he pointed out. Similarly, north of the Wazirabad barrage, the land belongs to Delhi government, while the land along the Noida Link Road also is under the jurisdiction of the UP irrigation department. Little action has taken place in these places.” When asked about these, a DDA official responded, “Whenever encroachments in the Yamuna floodplain come to our notice, we take appropriate action pursuant to the guidelines of NGT and DDA’s commitment to removing encroachments from the floodplain.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/for-yamuna-change-for-worse-only-constant/articleshow/83999582.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Nagpur||Nagpur Municipal Corporation purchased split ACs from pharma co: Abha Pande||NAGPUR: Reiterating her earlier allegations of corruption in procurement of materials related to Covid-19 pandemic, corporator Abha Pande told the general body on Wednesday that Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) health department also purchased two split air conditioners (ACs) from a pharmaceutical company, instead of an electronics company or agency. Taking serious cognisance of the allegations, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari ordered an inquiry by a three-member committee headed by municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B and two officials from accountant general (AG) office. Tiwari had called a special meeting of general body on Wednesday over the adjournment motion tabled by Pande, also NCP state general secretary. Pande said, “NMC received crores from the central and state governments under national and state disaster relief fund for containing the spread of Covid-19 and treatment of patients. Various irregularities were done by the health department in procurement of materials. One best example is that two split ACs were bought from a pharmaceutical company at the cost of Rs2,91,500. As per norms, the department should have got these electronic items from a manufacturing company or agency,” she said. Pande added, “I had submitted a memorandum with mayor and civic chief few days ago highlighting the irregularities. But the civic chief does not seem serious towards this loss of public money and corruption during pandemic. I welcome mayor’s order of inquiry through three-member committee. But I fear for a transparent inquiry when the civic chief is chairman of the committee. Earlier, the civic chief had ruled out corruption without inquiry. He wants to save the concerned officials. Therefore, I request mayor should head the inquiry committee,” she said. Pande also said, “There were irregularities in supply of food to migrants, patients in Covid care centres, people in quarantine centres, and procurement of infrared thermometers, PPE kits, pulse oximeter, stationary etc. Materials were purchased at rate contract from small towns like Bhandara and Amravati neglecting state-owned Haffkine. Payment of Rs1 crore was made only for transportation of food to shelter homes.” Pande said, “Two different officials signed on bills in the capacity of chief medical officer on the same day. One was permanent chief medical officer and another claimed having additional charge of the post.” Some corporators from Congress and BSP supported Pande, and demanded an inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-purchased-split-acs-from-pharma-co-pande/articleshow/83994585.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Delhi||I-T notice to Atishi: AAP alleges vendetta by BJP||NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party on Wednesday blamed the BJP-led central government of playing vendetta politics after an income tax notice was served on MLA Atishi. The notice is based on the assets declared by Atishi in the affidavit filed before the 2020 Delhi assembly elections. At a press conference, AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj and Atishi claimed that it was very difficult for an educated woman without a political background to survive in Indian politics. “BJP has stooped to a new low in vendetta politics and is raising baseless allegations on Atishi’s movable assets, fixed deposits and mutual fund investments. She has been given an I-T notice of Rs 59 lakh. She started working with Delhi government in 2015 at a salary of just Rs 1. It’s very difficult for an educated young professional, especially a woman, to enter and survive in Indian politics. Most of the women in politics are there as a result of patronage,” alleged Bharadwaj. The AAP functionary added, “The notice was sent because in her election affidavit, Atishi had declared movable assets worth Rs 69.8 lakh in the form of fixed deposits and mutual fund investments.” Atishi said she was not afraid of BJP’s unfounded allegations and hollow threats. “Whenever the I-T department calls me, I’ll bring the documents they ask for, however old they may be because I have nothing to hide. BJP cannot simply tolerate educated young women in politics,” she added. “In the past 6-7 years, the Centre has been using all its agencies to harass AAP MLAs, ministers and functionaries. But they have failed to find even one mistake or sustain even a single case against any party member. This income tax notice is the next step in this cycle. BJP thinks it can scare, threaten and silence educated professionals entering politics,” said Atishi. She challenged BJP ministers to make their bank accounts and properties public, adding that AAP members were ready to do the same. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that AAP functionaries had mastered the art of playing the victim card. “If an investigative agency issues a notice to any AAP member, they all come together to raise a hue and cry as if their colleague is being illegally harassed or victimised. If there is nothing wrong with Atishi’s accounts, she should not be so distraught on getting a notice from the income tax department,” Kapoor added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/i-t-notice-to-atishi-aap-alleges-vendetta-by-bjp/articleshow/83999621.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bank plans 2 complaints against conman for using fake documents||KOLKATA: A private bank is planning to file two complaints against fake vaccine accused Debanjan Deb after an internal probe established that he had produced several fake documents to open an account in the name of ‘KMC planning department’. He had also used a fake KMC salary slip to claim a loan of Rs 20 lakh from another branch of the same bank. “For a person who managed to dodge the police radar for seven years, the filing of eight FIRs within a week says a lot about how he operated and what he was up to,” said an officer. The only time Deb was in trouble was when he was questioned by the Electronic Complex police for cheating a youth whom he had promised a job. But he was let off as no formal complaint had been filed then. The bank fraud section of the detective department is also in touch with the private bank that is planning to file the latest complaints as well as a public sector bank where Deb had opened an account. “Out of the eight accounts he operated, three accounts — two in the private bank and one in a PSU bank — are crucial. Once these banks find something amiss or establish that fake documents were used, we have asked them to lodge FIRs,” said an officer. Police said they were going through all transactions made by Deb, small and big. “We know that he made transactions amounting to Rs 2 crore during the pandemic. We need to now trace the people who got the money. This will help us identify the persons and sub-agents who supplied him tender and other sensitive documents from the IT or finance department of KMC. Each person is being summoned for examination. Apart from this, we are examining more people with whom Deb had come in contact with,” said a source. The three bank passbooks and debit cards seized from his possession are also being studied with help from the banks. “His purchases will be equally important. We do now know he was getting used to an increasingly lavish life,” said the source. Police will record the statement of Deb’s parents again to ascertain about his activities at home.

Sleuths say that thus far they have come across 800 odd vaccination cases. “We have spoken to the distributor and he has given us a total figure of vials procured from him.

---||Navi-mumbai||Maharashtra: Mangrove ‘graveyard’ now springs back to life, turns into green patch||NAVI MUMBAI: Greens have managed to save a patch of mangroves between Uran and Panvel (near Punjab CFS between JNPT and Panvel) where water to 5,000 mangroves was blocked in 2018. After environmentalists consistently wrote to the HC-appointedpanel and other departments, water supply was eventually restored this year, which allowed for green shoots of mangroves to grow again. Earlier, the sea plants were dying. TimesViewThe regeneration of a mangrove forest is the best news in an age that’s confronted with extreme climatic events. Mangroves are our best safeguard against flooding. However, over the years, mangrove forests in and around urban areas have been destroyed to make way for construction. Luckily, there is a pushback from concerned citizens and greens and in a few cases like this, a major disaster is averted.“Green groups like Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishthan, NatConnect Foundation and affected fishermen wrote to various state government agencies and the Union government to save the green, healthy mangroves which someone was trying to destroy,” said activist B N Kumar of NatConnect Foundation. The stretch which presented a mangrove graveyard is now flourishing and has lush green mangroves. The battle to save the mangrove began in April 2018 with the fishing community noticing the blocking of tidal water flow by NHAI. Environmental groups complained to the mangrove panel. An inspection was done in December 2018. In 2019, NatConnect, Shree Ekvira Aai Partisthan, Paramparik Machhimar Bachao Kruti Samiti met then Konkan divisional commissioner Jagdish Patil who assured action, but no action was taken till June and rainwater stagnated and whatever mangroves remained, rotted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-mangrove-graveyard-now-springs-back-to-life-turns-into-green-patch/articleshow/84003895.cms||Vijay Singh

"On behalf of Delhi government and the people of Delhi, I thank every doctor, nurse and paramedic staff for working selflessly during this pandemic. We are dealing with the coronavirus pandemic for more than one year now. We have faced two waves of it. The second wave was more brutal. Every family was affected by the second wave. A lot of people also lost their lives during this time. Delhi government with doctors, nurses and paramedic staff tried their best to combat the virus,” Kejriwal said, adding that group efforts are needed to beat the pandemic. Later, Jain inaugurated a new dialysis and pediatrics ICU ward at the Indira Gandhi Hospital and said that the hospital which has 1,243 beds is ready for the third Covid-19 wave. The CM also thanked Indian Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, charitable trusts, non-profit organisations and corporate sector that stepped up during the tough time and lent a helping hand to Delhi government. Health minister Jain said despite the huge shortage of medical supplies in the market, the trust provided 1,200 high-quality parameter patient monitors. “The trust also generously donated 500 high-quality oxygen concentrators,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-thanks-docs-for-exceptional-service-during-second-wave/articleshow/84049389.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The state government will have to reply by July 2. Questioning the indiscriminate use of blue and red beacons, the division bench comprising acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and justice Arijit Banerjee wondered how Deb was roaming around freely with political leaders and diplomats. The officials should have known that Deb was not a bureaucrat, the court observed. They felt that political leaders should have known who the joint commissioner is since that is a senior rank. Government counsel Anirban Roy argued that anyone from the public can go up to these leaders and take photographs with them. Deb was arrested by Kolkata Police last week for allegedly posing as an IAS officer and holding a fake Covid-19 vaccination camp in Kasba. Actress and Trinamool Congress MP Mimi Chakraborty and hundred others got themselves vaccinated at the camp. A special SIT was formed and it started investigating the case. Three persons — Sushanta Das, Rabin Sikdar, and Santanu Manna — were arrested last week in connection to the case. Three of them acted as accomplices of Deb — the prime accused. Three PILs were filed before thehigh court seeking an independent investigation by a central agency into the matter. While lawyer Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya represented Sandipan Das and Tapas Maiti, Tarunjyoti Tiwari argued for petitioner Bilwadal Bhattacharya. The petitioners sought an inquiry into the case by an independent agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hc-raises-question-on-clout-of-accused/articleshow/83999684.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

Fatalities in the state (141) were lower compared to the previous few days. As many as 9,771 cases were reported across Maharashtra and 706 in the city, compared to 8,085 and 556, respectively, on Tuesday. Maharashtra’s Covid-19 tally for June rose to 3.14 lakh, taking the total to 60.6 lakh since March 2020. Although the cases have come down from the peak, they are not declining further and have stagnated between 8,000 and 10,000 for over two weeks. In Mumbai, the June case load of 16,934 dropped to less than a third of the May tally (57,371). The city toll in June stood at 625, less than half of May’s 1,723 deaths. A BMC official said the daily test positivity rate in Mumbai had dropped to below 2 on Wednesday despite the slight rise in numbers. The number of critical patients in the city dropped to 761 for the first time in the second wave. Also for the first time, more ICU beds were vacant (52%) than occupied in the city. Nair Hospital dean Dr Ramesh Bharmal said daily admissions had dropped drastically since April. “As we are the city’s main Covid hospital, we still have 200 in-patients, but most other hospitals have fewer patients,” he said. At the state level, Kolhapur continues to fuel the Covid graph — the district reported 1,400 cases, nearly 15% of the total cases on Wednesday. Satara and Sangli reported over 700 cases. Nearly 40% of the total cases on Wednesday were reported from the Kolhapur circle, which includes districts like Kolhapur, Sangli, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri. “A close watch is being kept on these districts. The cases in these districts are not allowing the Covid graph of the state to decline further,” said an official. Health minister Rajesh Tope said with cases declining, people are staying away from vaccination centres and has appealed to them to get vaccinated. “We have to ensure that at least 70% of the population is vaccinated to lessen the severity of the third wave when it comes,” said Tope.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-records-25-deaths-highest-in-21-days-but-52-icu-beds-vacant/articleshow/84001636.cms||Malathy Iyer

---||Allahabad||Cluster plan suspended due to vax shortage||Prayagraj: The shortage of vaccines has suspended the cluster plan in Sangam city which was to begin on July 1. Officials of the health department, however, maintained that vaccination exercise will be taken up at all city-based 14 vaccination sites and 20 Community Health Centers (CHCs) in rural areas on Thursday and the date for the launching of the cluster plan would be announced as per the availability of vaccines. Pointedly, there was no vaccination at any site – rural and urban – in the city on Wednesday and recipients had to return without getting vaccinated in the city, trans-Ganga and trans-Yamuna pockets of the district due to the unavailability of vaccines. District Immunization Officer (DIO) and Additional chief medical officer (ACMO), Dr Teerath Lal told TOI that due to the unavailability of vaccines, the vaccination work was not held at any site on Wednesday. He, however, said that over 8,000 vaccine vials are supposed to arrive Prayagraj from Lucknow on Wednesday night and that the vaccination work would be taken up on Thursday at CHCs and city-based government hospitals. Dr Lal, meanwhile, said that the cluster plan would be launched in the district once there would be adequate stock and availability of vaccines. The officials of the district health department claimed to have chalked a cluster plan meant to cover more and more recipients in rural and urban areas. The cluster plan was to be launched from July 1 but the shortage of vaccines has suspended the mega event. On Wednesday, recipients who arrived at rural and semi urban-based vaccination centres returned empty-handed due to the non-availability of vaccines. Recipients approached the health staff concerned in city and dehat (rural) areas to inquire about the vaccination dates and were asked to return on Thursday. A senior health official, however, said, "Cluster plan will be launched in the city on or after July 5 in 80 wards of the city as per the availability of vaccines”. He further added that the vaccination under the cluster plan will be held on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday while there would be routine immunization on Wednesday and Saturday. The official also informed that all the 80 wards of the city have been divided into 16 clusters and as many as 10 teams would cover at least five wards in a day. The cluster plan for rural areas would be finalised shortly. As many as 8,44,249 Covid vaccine shots were administered to the recipients of all age groups, that is, those aged above 18 years, till June 30. While 7,03,921 beneficiaries have taken the first dose, 1,40,328 recipients have also received the second dose. Officials have set a target of administering around 39.87 lakh beneficiaries, including 27 lakh recipients aged between 18 and 44 and 12.87 lakh beneficiaries aged over 45.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/cluster-plan-suspended-due-to-vax-shortage/articleshow/83999748.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Doctors’ professionalism will evolve with society||Doctor-society relations exist since time immemorial. History of medical science is replete with several instances of doctors working in grave conditions trying to save the sick and the dying. The absolute first and the last event of a human are both certified by doctors. Professionalism that exists in medicine and the code of conduct that it defines has evolved over time in response to the demands and pressures of the society. This dynamic process will continue to evolve into a ‘new professionalism’. Society expects doctor to provide services of a healer — who is moral, competent, transparent, and accountable. This point is exemplified by the famous Hippocratic oath. “I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person’s family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems if I am to care adequately for the sick.” First of all, doctors in return expect to be trusted. Amongst so many other professions, doctors have managed to obtain and retain the highest levels of respect and trust from the public. And respect is a highly valued aspect of organisational and professional life. Doctors also expect society to provide by and large an adequately funded healthcare system to work in, so that optimum patient care is delivered. Also, if the society is either too distant or distrusting, too interfering, or controlling, without adequate levels of support and resources, disillusionments are bound to happen. As specialists, and also being members of the society, health practitioners carry moral values, honesty, and decency in their practice. For better or for worse, the practice of medicine also carries with it certain social status and financial implications. Largely speaking, doctors are honest, trustworthy, and want to do right things for their patients. The role of doctor continues to evolve as society changes and the medical profession has to understand that. Similarly, society must understand that doctors are endowed with immense responsibility, but humans nonetheless. The way forward for a doctor would be maintaining healthy dialogue with the patient to understand their concerns and those of the society. For the patient, believing that the doctor is doing the absolute best that they can. So, in the larger interest of mankind, both must work in already defined social terms; sensing and respecting each other’s expectations, obligations, and needs.

Four people of one community were injured while a heavy police force was deployed in the village. On the written complaint of one Siddharth Upadhyaya , police registered a case against 11 named and unidentified persons under sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapons), 307 (attempt to murder), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (whoever intentionally insults), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), 294 (sings, recites or utters any obscene song), 296 (disturbing religious assembly) of IPC. Police said two persons, Mehfooz and Suhail have been arrested in this regard. Reports said ‘Srimadbhagwat Katha’ was organized at Batkat village under Urwa area and a ‘kalash yatra’ was being taken out from Bankat. It reached Dhwaleshwarnath temple via Rouza Dargah, Dhuriyapar and Vasdevpur. As soon as the ‘yatra’ reached Dhuriyapar-Urwa road near a chicken shop, a horse rider participating in the ‘yatra’ broke a twig of a tree near the shop. Several youths, including Mahfooz, Parvez, Mehboob, Afsar, Dilshad, objected to it and stopped the rider. An argument broke out and when people participating in the ‘yatra’ tried to end the argument, the youths of the other community attacked them with sticks in which 45-years-old Siddharth, 26-year-old Rampravesh Yadav, 19-year-old Prashant Yadav and 17-year-old Varun Yadav were injured. Later, people in the ‘yatra’ blocked the Dhuriyapar-Urwa road. After getting information, Urwa police reached the spot and pacified the people. SDM Gola Rajendra Bahadur Singh and CO Anjani Kumar Pandey also reached the spot. SP (North) AK Singh said, “Instructions have been given to SO Urwa and CO Gola to take strict action against the culprits.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/four-injured-in-clash-between-2communities-during-kalash-yatra/articleshow/84000292.cms||---
---||Delhi||Nearly 1k registered for jobs on govt portal daily in June||New Delhi: Around 30,000 job-seekers have registered and over 9,500 jobs have been posted on the online Rojgar Bazaar in June. The portal was launched by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on jobs.delhi.gov.in last year to connect job-seekers and employers impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. The Covid waves and the consequent lockdowns in the capital have caused loss of many livelihood options and this portal has acted as reliable link for both parties, the government stated. “Every day in June, around 1,000 job-seekers registered and 300 jobs were posted on Rojgar Bazaar. A total of 34,212 people had registered and 9,522 vacancies posted,” it added. “Moreover, 2,500 connections were made every day between job-seekers and employers through WhatsApp, phone calls and direct applications,” it pointed out. In total, 75,000 connections were made in June. During the lockdown, the portal helped businesses hire for delivery and customer support, while the unlocking phase has seen a surge in sales and office jobs. “Rozgar Bazaar has proved to be a one-stop portal for all segments — employers ranging from micro enterprises to street vendors looking for cooks, tailors and technicians, MSMEs looking for accountants/web designers/sales & marketing personnel to hospitals looking for staff, the portal is trusted by all,” the government stated. According to an official report, the top three sectors with the maximum vacancies are customer support, delivery executives and sales and business development. Along with full-time jobs, part-time and work-from-home options are also available. About half of the vacancies — 45% — are for freshers. In terms of gender distribution, nearly 41% of the jobs are available to all, 36% to only men and 23% to only women. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia said the Kejriwal government was most concerned about the economic impact of the pandemic and had, therefore, launched the portal to provide job opportunities to unemployed youth. “Lakhs of youth had registered and found jobs last year. It is a matter of their faith and trust in CM Arvind Kejriwal that even now, thousands of job-seekers and employers are registering every day on Rojgar Bazaar. We will do everything possible to help youth find jobs at this time of crisis,” the employment minister said. The top job category on the basis of vacancies posted by employers is customer support or telecalling at 24%, followed by sales and marketing at 20%, delivery at 19%, back office and data entry at 16% and warehouse and logistics management at 9%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nearly-1k-registered-for-jobs-on-govt-portal-daily-in-june/articleshow/84049401.cms||AlokKNMishra

This happened a day after Delhi Police booked Twitter under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and Information Technology Act, based on a complaint received from National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) regarding availability of child sexual abuse and child pornographic material on Twitter. “We have sought details of the accounts circulating such media and have asked Twitter to remove the content related to child pornography. Links of these posts have also been asked for along with the details of the users of such accounts,” the officer said. Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal confirmed the development. NCPCR had first registered a complaint with Delhi Police on the same matter on May 29 and then sent a reminder on June 8, asking the force to lodge an FIR. On Monday, a total of 13 screenshots as well as Twitter handles showing content related to child sexual abuse and child pornography on Twitter were shared by NCPCR with the police after which the case was registered. During investigations, it came to fore that some handles had already removed the content and it was unavailable but investigations on the other handles are underway. The case registered by Delhi Police is the fourth registered against Twitter in less than a fortnight across different cities. The FIR had said that NCPCR had conducted an inquiry and "found evidence on the availability of such sites on the dark and deep web. In this regard, a total of 31 sites were explored by NCPCR on the dark web. Of these, five were pertaining to Indian territory, 19 were seen to be possibly of Indian region and the rest were identified as international sites."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cops-ask-twitter-to-take-down-child-porn-give-account-details/articleshow/84005953.cms||---

The state government is monitoring all those who have been given the antibiotic and they will be vaccinated by us when doctors give a nod,” the CM said. Banerjee added that BJP is trying to do politics with the issue though it is fraud by a person and none from the government was involved. She said that if BJP’s conspiracy is caught then none will be spared who had hatched it. “Their only aim is to defame Bengal,” the CM said. “Immediately after the complaint was lodged, we took action. BJP employs every agency at its disposal to trouble the state government. These frauds tend to show off and take photographs with all. It is a dangerous trend. If one steps out on road, they will click photographs and if you do not oblige, they will allege that leaders are being insensitive. “Who knows whether this has been staged? Or if photographs surface tomorrow with their leaders. I have said such frauds are worse than terrorists and whether it is political party A, B, C or D, none will be spared,” she said. According to the CM, some people are impersonating as IAS officers and doing fraud, so everyone needs to stay alert. “It is happening in various parts of India and we have to keep tabs.” She said that many people were doing well in the name of chit funds and they were still flourishing in villages. “All will have to be cautious about chit funds and I urge all to deposit only in co-operative banks or nationalized banks,” Banerjee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/keep-politics-out-urges-cm/articleshow/83999716.cms||Debashis Konar

K C Neelamegam, state advisor of Makkal Sakthi Iyakkam said that usage of one use plastics was rampant during the Covid pandemic since last year. Officials from the local body were confiscating banned plastics and imposing fine when the ban was introduced in January 2019. Lack of such measures in recent months has increased circulation of banned plastics. Stressing the state government to impose a ban once again, Neelamegam asked for awareness campaigns to sensitise people on the ill effects of plastics.

---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: One-km rule to upset RTE seat-seekers again||TRICHY: Parents applying for RTE seats in the entry level in private schools can only apply for the schools falling within one km from their residence for their children as the school education department has not announced any relaxation in the distance norms this year as well. Last year, there was a demand for relaxing the distance norm last year as many applications were rejected due to this criteria. “While it resulted in many vacant seats last year despite candidates fulfilling all other requirements, seats are likely to go vacant this year as well because of the distance norms,” says officials. The state government has issued notification calling for application from parents who wish to avail RTE seats in the entry level (LKG/class-1) in private schools. As 25 percent of seats in entry level is reserved under RTE in these schools, parents who manage to get a seat for their children under RTE need not pay tuition fee. The state and central government reimburse the fees to the respective schools. Those from economically disadvantaged section of the society too being eligible to apply for RTE seats. Out of total 4,207 RTE seats across 313 private schools in Trichy district last year, a total of 1,668 seats were filled in the first phase of admission. Since 2,539 seats were vacant, the state government decided to invite application by extending RTE admissions. While a total 810 applications were received, roughly 500 applications were rejected after they were deemed ineligible. “A sizable number of applicants were rejected for not residing within a 1 km radius from the schools. The distance norm was 2-3 km in 2019 but this year, 1 km norm was strictly adhered which brought down number of eligible candidates,” said an official from Trichy district chief education office. S Sanjeev, 35 who resides about 2 km from a popular private school in Cantonment said he wanted to try his luck for a seat in the school for his 5-year-old son. In order to secure a seat, he was planning to relocate close to the school. “However, as I lost my job during the second covid wave, I am unable to afford a house close to the school,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/1-km-rule-to-upset-rte-seat-seekers-again/articleshow/83999676.cms||Sampath Kumar

The situation has worsened during the monsoons, raising concerns about the health risk to locals. This has prompted Agonda sarpanch Badal Naikgaunkar to threaten an agitation against CMC. “Last year, the panchayat had even written to the Goa State Pollution Control Board seeking necessary action. However, it is the same situation this year,” Naikgaunkar said. Naikgaunkar said his visit to the GTP has revealed that while the old dumps are partially covered, the fresh garbage mounds are lying open. This is contrary to the CMC’s statement that the dumps have been covered, he alleged. President of the NGO, Jack Fernandes told TOI that at least on two prior occasions they had assisted the council with treating, clearing the dumps and even baling several tonnes of garbage. “Now seeing the state of affairs at the GTP and the untreated garbage we feel so bad that we have decided to petition the NGT over this issue,” he said. CMC chairperson Mario Simon Rebello said that everyone is free to do what they feel is right and that no one can stop them. However, he said that his council has been doing everything possible with regards to the garbage situation at Canacona. “The baling machine at the GTP cannot be operated during the rains, but everything will be cleared as soon as the monsoon is over,” Rebello said. Local MLA Isidore Fernandes said that he would meet the council’s chief officer and direct him to take immediate measures to stop the leachate from entering the nearby fields and water bodies from where it then drains into rivulets, the river and eventually the Arabian Sea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/canacona-municipality-faces-heat-as-garbage-plant-leachate-enters-fields/articleshow/84001710.cms||---

Several members of Bajrang Dal entered the premises of Welhams Boys' School on Tuesday, raising slogans against the school administration and accusing them of “hurting Hindu sentiments”. They also wrote to state education minister Arvind Pandey, alleging that the tender notice put out by the school was “biased” since the hostel had students from several faiths. The tender for halal meat and other supplies for the school was published in a newspaper. While halal is an Islamic way of slaughter where blood is drained from the animal, in jhatka the animal is killed instantly with a single strike. The school management told TOI that they had published ads for both types of meat separately. Mahesh Kandpal, vice principal of the school, said the institute serves both halal and jhatka meat in its campus. “We have asked them (Bajrang Dal) not to spread misinformation and communal tension. The allegations of hurting the sentiments of students from a particular religion are completely baseless,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/right-wing-group-protests-meat-ad-by-top-dehradun-school/articleshow/83994768.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Mumbai||Pandemic-induced respect for profession inspires doctors in making||MUMBAI: There are many reasons why medical aspirant Ishita Gupta should be checking her own pulse right now. Apart from the fact that the MBBS entrance exams are only a month away as per the new schedule, there’s the constant surround sound of Covid-induced pressures, risks, work hours and toll on doctors. Besides, if her anesthesiologist father, Dr Anuj Gupta, drops hints about less demanding jobs that pay just as much, her concerned mother worries aloud about the risks facing medical students who are expected to help out doctors in non-Covid wards. It’s the perfect storm for an anxious bout of career re-evaluation. Instead, the ambient uncertainty seems to have only made 18-year-old Ishita more certain. “Of course, I still want to pursue medicine,” she says. “Yes, there are risks but I’ve seen the kind of respect my dad gets.” Far from killing their dream, the pandemic, it turns out, has only made the white coat more appealing for doctors in the making. Besides the Covid-induced renewed reverence for these frontline workers shrouded in scrubs and PPE kits, what seems to have lent the profession glamour dust in the eyes of GZers—a famously socially minded lot—is the urge to contribute to the healthcare sector. “They want to be in the thick of action,” says pathologist Dr Vrijesh Kabra, who has diagnosed his 18-year-old MBBS aspirant son, Dhruv, and the 300-odd students in his batch with “even more excitement” for the prospect of becoming a doctor in these times. Watching his parents and his septuagenarian grandparents pulling long work days through the pandemic has worsened his Dhruv’s itch to get out and follow the family’s footsteps. “It’s not that youngsters don’t want name and fame but they want it by serving the society,” clarifies Dr Kabra. A considered view of the world, and not reckless optimism, seems to be the engine driving students who are acutely aware of the increased workload, risks and poor healthcare infrastructure brought on by Covid-19. “I know it’s not going to be all rainbows and butterflies all the time,” says aspiring surgeon Parthvi Parekh, adding she has “never been more sure” of chasing the dream she has been nursing since seventh grade. “Doctors have become more inspirational now,” says the MBBS aspirant whose daily routine involves eight hours of classes followed by five hours of self-study. Daunted by the competitive atmosphere, gruelling schedule and “excruciating” delays in the MBBS entrance exams that made the past year drag on “like a decade”, Parthvi had recently consulted senior passouts of the private preparatory classes she attends online for advice. They reassured her she’d be thankful for all of “the scolding and the pressures” in hindsight. “I’ve learnt to be patient. This is preparing me for what’s to come,” says Parthvi. To keep the fiery passion for the profession from extinguishing, the government should build training centres for doctors in the making, instead of investing in temporary Covid centres, says obstetrician and gynaecologist Dr Mukesh Gupta. He recalls his son Dhruv, a second-year MBBS student, wanting to volunteer in a Covid centre during last year’s lockdown. “His grandparents had to stop him,” says Gupta. Right now, though, the inability to attend live lectures is puncturing his son’s enthusiasm. The pre-recorded videos and demonstrations that comprise online practicals are no replacement for the experience of talking to patients, says Dhruv Gupta. Another dampener is the rising graph of violence against doctors following the deaths of Covid patients. “There’s less trust in doctors now,” says Ishita. Parthvi says the government should do more to improve pay and workplace safety for doctors. “Flower shower is a good gesture,” says the 18-year-old who has already inducted herself mentally into the profession. “But what we need is better pay and safety. Respect us and protect us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pandemic-induced-respect-for-profession-inspires-doctors-in-making/articleshow/84001726.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

A DCPU team headed by district child protection officer (DCPO) R Anitha identified the children by verifying records of patients who died of Covid-19. Children aged below 18 years under this category who lost both parents will get Rs 5 lakh, and one parent, Rs 3 lakh, according to the aid announced by chief minister M K Stalin. The amount will be deposited as fixed deposit in Tamil Nadu Power Finance Corporation and on maturity will be given to the children once they complete 18 years. “Our team collected the number of casualties caused by Covid-19 since the onset of the pandemic. Each and every death has been verified resulting in identifying 70 eligible children so far,” DCPO Anitha told TOI. As of Monday, Trichy district had witnessed 902 deaths due to Covid-19. DCPU got the details of deaths till June 4 from the Covid-19 war room. More than 200 deaths are yet to be verified. Of the identified children, two girls lost both their parents but their mother died a normal death before Covid-19 while their father succumbed to the pandemic. The scheme applies to this category of children too. Four children from a single family were also identified as having lost their mother to Covid-19. Two infants were also identified under this category. In both the incidents, the mothers died due to Covid-19 post-delivery. The fathers of the two children were willing to take care of the baby. Though DCPU has also been receiving applications from such children, the verification process of the claims is yet to commence. The scheme will not be applicable to children of parents who have government jobs. DCPO Anitha said the orphaned children and semi-orphans can avail of accommodation at any of the child care institutions (CCIs) in Trichy. Those willing to be under the care of guardians will also be given Rs 3,000 as monthly maintenance grant. Even those who attained 18 years of age can make use of the accommodation in the aftercare centre till they reach 21 years of age.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/70-children-who-lost-parents-identified-for-disbursing-relief/articleshow/83999723.cms||Gokul Rajendran

The crude oil spilled over from the leakage of the ONGC pipeline passing through the farm land of a farmer Sivakumar of Melapanaiyur village on Wednesday. The oil spread across the one acre land where samba paddy crop was being cultivated. The farmers, famers’ leaders including Raja and CPI MLA of Thiruthuraipoondi constituency K Marimuthu visited the spot. “I have gone for the direct sowing for the Kuruvai cultivation on my one acre of land but the sudden leakage of the crude oil devastated the cultivation. So, ONGC should provide me a compensation of Rs 10lakh,” Sivakumar said. The local people gathered on the spot and demanded corrective measures from the ONGC to stop the oil from further spreading to other lands. The farmers lamented about such frequent incidents. ONGC technicians rushed to the spot and plugged the leakage after several hours of effort. Revenue officials organised a meeting with the ONGC and farmers at the spot in the evening. The farmers stood firm on their demand for the compensation. Sources said that ONGC agreed to provide them compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/oil-leak-damages-paddy-field-in-tiruvarur/articleshow/83999759.cms||---

As soon as the fresh consignment arrived, it was distributed among those districts which are also running short of vaccine stocks. However, health department officials said that the new stock will last only a day and they are banking on another consignment of vaccines doses (Covishield), which is expected to arrive on Friday, to help them continue the inoculation drive. Talking to TOI, the officer on special duty to state health department, Sidharth Tripathi, said, “Till Tuesday morning, we had a total stock of 82652 doses, of which 47,066 were administered, leaving us with 35,586 doses in the evening. Along with the new Covaxin stocks, we have a total of 94,176 doses at the moment, which should suffice till we receive the next consignment on Friday.” Asked about the number of doses state will receive on Friday, Tripathi said, “We will be getting a total of six lakh doses on Friday and we have already communicated all the districts to ensure that their respective pick-up vans reach the state warehouse by Thursday evening itself so that they can collect the doses and reach their respective districts on time so that the drive can begin on Saturday.” Meanwhile, the state government has demanded the Centre to reduce the monthly vaccine quota for private hospitals citing their lack of coverage and poor response as the private hospitals haven’t even vaccinated 2% of the total target allocated to them. Asked about the number of doses available with the private hospitals, Tripathy said that he doesn’t have the exact figure as the vaccine is procured by the private hospitals directly as per their allocated target. He added that there are only a handful of hospitals which are carrying out the vaccination drive across the state. Meanwhile, people who came to take their second dose of Covishield had to return home empty-handed due to shortage of doses in the state capital. Surendra Prasad, a Ratu Road resident said, “I, along with my wife, had taken the first dose of Covishield on April 13 and we were told that we have to take the second dose after May 22 so I went to the vaccination centre in Sadar hospital but I was asked to come back three days later as the vaccine is available.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jharkhand-gets-fresh-stock-of-58k-doses-can-administer-vax-for-one-day/articleshow/83999724.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Bhusan, in his letter to Dwivedi dated 29, wanted “suitable and strict action” and submit a report in two days. Adhikari, in his June 25 letter to Harsh Vardhan, had written that one Debanjan Deb, impersonating as an IAS officer and working as a KMC joint commissioner, had been holding illegal vaccination camps in Kasba and similar camps were organized in Sonarpur and Amherst Street areas. “All these happened under the watch of the local administration. If these were not Covid vaccines then immediate investigation needs to be done,” it was written. “Non-issuance of certificates does lead to the apprehension of ‘fake’ camps and also raises doubts on the contents of vaccine. Such instances, if not promptly inquired into and suitably addressed, may also lead to the possibility of their recurrence,” Bhusan stated in his letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fake-vax-centre-seeks-probe-report-from-state-in-2-days/articleshow/83999773.cms||Debasis Konar
---||Dehradun||CM Rawat called by BJP top brass to Delhi, sparking speculations of early polls in Uttarakhand||Dehradun: Chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat was on Wednesday urgently summoned to Delhi to meet the BJP’s central leadership. Rawat was in Ramnagar till Tuesday to attend the party’s ‘Chintan Shivir’, a three-day brainstorming session for the upcoming assembly polls, and had just returned to Dehradun. He cancelled his appointments for the day and left for the national capital. The sudden summon led to speculations in the state’s political circles that the BJP is planning early assembly elections in Uttarakhand to bypass the requirement of having a bypoll so that the CM can be inducted into the state assembly. Rawat is currently a Lok Sabha MP from Pauri Garhwal. When he replaced Trivendra Rawat as chief minister on March 10, he was not an MLA. He needs to win an assembly seat by September 10, to be able to continue as chief minister. Opposition Congress had a few days ago claimed that there was a constitutional crisis in the offing in the state and Tirath Rawat cannot continue as CM beyond September 10. Former Congress minister Nav Prabhat had cited provisions of the Representations of People Act, claiming that a “bypoll cannot be held if elections are scheduled within a year’s time span.” He alleged that since the chief minister needs to win a bypoll in order to continue to hold the post, BJP would have no option but to change the state’s CM again before the assembly elections scheduled early next year. On being queried by reporters on Wednesday morning regarding his Delhi visit, the CM said, “Since we had a three-day brainstorming session in Ramnagar, I am going to discuss the conclusions at length with the party’s senior members.” When asked about the bypoll, Rawat said the “party leadership will take a call on that”. Meanwhile, Nav Prabhat when contacted said he did not want to comment on the CM’s visit to Delhi as “it is the party’s internal affair”. He added, “I am waiting for the Election Commission to announce its decision on the matter. But the visit does seem sudden.” State government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said that not much should be read into the CM’s visit to the national capital. “A visit to Delhi is not a very big issue. Such visits by party leaders are frequent but some people are trying to exaggerate it unnecessarily.” On the bypoll impasse, Uniyal said, “The responsibility of a government is to inform the Election Commission about any vacant constituency and thereafter the EC takes a call on the issue. We have duly informed the EC.” At present, two assembly seats – Gangotri and Haldwani — are lying vacant in the state. Gangotri seat fell vacant on April 22 after the demise of BJP legislator Gopal Rawat while Congress MLA from Haldwani Indira Hridayesh passed away on June 13.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cm-rawat-called-by-bjp-top-brass-to-delhi-sparking-speculations-of-early-polls-in-uttarakhand/articleshow/83994841.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Allahabad||Now, AU students to rate their teachers||Prayagraj: In a first, Allahabad University (AU) will felicitate its serving outstanding teachers every year during its annual convocation. The assessment of the teacher, to be selected as ‘outstanding’, would be based on the secret feedback of its 30,000 students. Though their academic and other achievements would also be taken into consideration, the feedback of the students would be a key part in the assessment. The central varsity plans to identify one teacher for each of its four faculties — Arts, Science, Commerce and Law — and then give away the award, dubbed ‘Dronacharya Award’, for the first time at its forthcoming annual convocation function that it plans to hold in September. The teachers would be assessed on the feedback of the students who would rate their teachers against various parameters ranging from enthusiasm for teaching, regularity in taking the classes to knowledge and command over latest research and developments concerning their specific fields among others. The feedback from the students would be taken online and would be kept strictly confidential. The initiative on one hand is expected to help varsity identify specific areas where it should get a particular teacher to improve while on the other motivate the teachers to take regular classes and ensure good engagement with students during their lectures. “The information regarding this has been made available on the university website. The university has also introduced a feedback form for the current students of the university on its official website — www.allduniv.ac.in . The feedback form gives students an opportunity to register their response towards the teachers who teach them in their classroom,” said AU PRO Jaya Kapoor. These inputs will help the university achieve high standards of teaching and research, she added. She said the feedback will also help to assess performance of individual faculty members and facilitate the University of Allahabad to reward high performers. It will also help the other teachers in enhancing their performance. The form finalized as part of the process is in two steps. “In first step, all the necessary directions and information has been made available and students need to fill in the basic details there. In the second, students need to mark their responses as asked,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/now-au-students-to-rate-their-teachers/articleshow/83999869.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cops seize beacon-fitted car, probe reveals owner a fake vigilance officer||KOLKATA: When a red hatchback parked on the far corner of Shakespeare Sarani-New Park Street created disturbance in the flow of traffic on this busy thoroughfare around 6.30pm on Tuesday, the officers of East Traffic Guard intervened with the intention of seizing the car. In the process though, they ended up nabbing a cheat who not only flouted traffic rules, but even impersonated as a fake senior central vigilance officer and roamed about in his own car that he had fitted with a blue beacon. Police have also found boards and printouts that announced his fake government designation, fake VIP parking passes and even the Indian flag on his car’s dashboard. The accused has been identified as Md. Asiful Haque alias Md Sadiq, a resident of Collins Street. The arrest, which has come exactly a week after police arrested fake IAS officer Debanjan Deb, has led Lalbazar to order a crackdown on those using blue beacons. “We were carrying out a special drive against illegal parking in the Shakespeare Sarani area. We had already towed some cars parked illegally on the main roads when we noticed this red car. As we were enquiring, out walked a 26-year-old man, in his bermudas, claiming that he was the chief vigilance commissioner. When we detained him and questioned him, he ran out of excuses on why he was using a blue beacon. He also behaved impolitely and claimed he should be respected as he is a senior officer,” said a cop from the East Traffic Guard. The cops said that when Haque began misbehaving and tried to get into his car forcefully, they detained him from the New Park Street area and handed him over to Beniapukur police. A case under IPC 170 was lodged. “During questioning, the accused revealed that he was an engineering dropout. He had worked in an event management firm where he witnessed the power of vigilance officers. Seeing their clout, he wanted to ape them. However, we are not fully satisfied yet with his claims and statements. There are still loopholes. We are trying to examine if he had impersonated senior officers with the motive of cheating common man,” said an investigating officer. “During investigation, Haque was arrested as he was impersonating a government official. We are investigating the case in detail,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-seize-beacon-fitted-car-probe-reveals-owner-a-fake-vigilance-officer/articleshow/83999833.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Goa||Goa: MGP takes cue from AAP, promises free water, power||PONDA: Dismissing rumours of any pre-poll alliance, Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) president Pandurang “Deepak” Dhavalikar announced on Tuesday that they would face the coming 2022 assembly general elections alone and promised free water and power as in Delhi. Stating that he would contest from Priol constituency, Dhavalikar said they have already finalised some candidates and names of others would be decided by 15 July. Dhavalikar had missed his win with a narrow margin in Shiroda constituency during the recent bypolls and it was speculated that he would try his luck once again from Shiroda, but he refused. He said “a winnable candidate” would be fielded in Shiroda. Dhavalikar also said that Jeet Arolkar would be their Mandrem candidate. Dhavalaikar had lost the 2017 assembly polls to present civil supplies minister Govind Gaude who had contested as a BJP-backed independent. Applauding the Delhi government, the president of Goa’s oldest regional outfit has contended that the National Capital Region (NCR) government in Delhi offers people free water and electricity, free bus travel to women, well-equipped schools for children, by spending just Rs 30,000 on each person. Delhi has a population of 2 crore and the government has an annual budget of Rs 60,000 crore. “On the contrary Goans do not get anything despite the state spending Rs 1.4 lakh on each person. Goa has a population of 15 lakh people with a state budget of Rs 21,000 crore,” Dhavalikar said. He promised to follow a similar model in Goa when MGP comes to office. Claiming that it was unfortunate to use SC/ST funds for general people’s projects like Banastarim Market Complex, he condemned the government for “misutilisation” of funds. That fund should be utilised to provide better housing, better schooling for the community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mgp-takes-cue-from-aap-promises-free-water-power/articleshow/84001894.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker
---||Mumbai||State to schools: Deny e-classes over fees & face derecognition||Mumbai: State education minister Varsha Gaikwad on Wednesday directed education officers to take stern action, including derecognition, against schools for harassing students over non-payment of fees by denying them access to online classes, mark sheets and work assignments. Schools of other boards can be refused the no-objection certificate from the state.Ever since the new academic year began on June 15, parents have been complaining to the state education department about children being denied online learning over non-payment of fees in 2020-21.Several parents spoke to TOI about private schools exerting pressure on them by threatening to detain students, denying access to online classes, holding back mark sheets and school leaving certificates. Parents complained schools have even begun to instill fear among students during online classes.Schools said they have reduced the fees and are asking parents to pay some amount for them to continue to function. Principals complained parents refuse to meet school managements to discuss their financial problems.Hundreds of students from an ICSE school in Bandra were denied access to online classes over non-payment of last year’s fees. The students and parents recently protested outside the school premises.A state board school in Kandivli ordered parents to physically collect the work sheets of their children and denied them to those who had not paid fees. “We were told to give it in writing the fees will be paid by the end of the year,” said a parent.Some parents complained that children were detained without their knowledge. An international school in Lower Parel detained a student in Class I over non-payment of fees. When the parent asked for the school leaving certificate, it was denied. Another parent of the same school said his son was attending Class I online classes last year. “This February, the teacher told me that my son was detained in senior kindergarten last year itself and he would stay in the same class this year too,” said the parent who has not been able to pay any fees due to job loss. Schools cannot detain students from classes I to VIII. Parents who are moving their children from unaided to aided schools have complained about being denied mark sheets and leaving certificates. Gaikwad has told schools to admit children without insisting on mandatory leaving certificates.Meanwhile, parents of an ICSE school in Lokhandwala are protesting against a 40% hike in fees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-to-schools-deny-e-classes-over-fees-face-derecognition/articleshow/84001921.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Rural schools look forward to reopening||NAGPUR: As the new academic session in Vidarbha rolls on into its first week, many schools in remote areas are hoping for a physical reopening. With online classes not being a practical approach due to lack of resources and sometimes even access to the internet, physical mode of teaching remains the only option. Rupa Borekar, principal of Eklavya Model Residential School (Devada) in Chandrapur, said teaching approach has to be adapted to the situation. “There is no way online teaching can be done for poor tribal students living in remote villages. Also, the impact of learning when it’s done in physical mode is at a different level completely,” said Borekar. In Gadchiroli district’s Bhamragarh taluka, things are no different. Vinit Padmawar, principal of a zilla parishad school in Koyanguda village, said the ground realities in their region are very different. “There are places where we don’t even get phone network, so internet access is out of the question for many of our students. These are poor tribal families who are now slowly realizing the importance of education, but for that we need to keep the children engaged in the education ecosystem,” said Padmawar. Gadchiroli and Chandrapur districts were the first ones to restart schools physically last year after the government gave the go-ahead. But for Padmawar, who heads a primary school, physical classes had never begun as permission was given only till middle school. To counter that, ZP schools in Bhamragarh started home visits and taught students. An education official, who did not wish to be identified, said, “Many government schools in remote areas are ready for reopening. Social distancing is not an issue because hardly 25-30 students are enrolled in entire school. In cities, you have more students in a single section. We had cases of schools opening up physically even before permission was granted because parents and students both wanted that to happen.” So far, the state government has not issued any instructions regarding reopening of physical classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rural-schools-look-forward-to-reopening/articleshow/83997733.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Kolkata||Bengal government ties up with Mumbai hospital for 2 cancer units||KOLKATA: The state government has tied up with Tata Memorial Hospital of Mumbai to set up two state-of-the-art cancer hospitals in Bengal — one on the SSKM Hospital campus and another at North Bengal Medical College Hospital in Siliguri. This was announced by chief minister Mamata Banerjee at Nabanna on Wednesday. The hospitals, according to health department sources, are being set up for ‘service, education and research’ and will help to stem the outflow of thousands of cancer patients from the state who flock to Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai and elsewhere every year. The one in Kolkata will be in collaboration with IPGMER (Institute of Post Graduate Medical education and Research). A piece of land opposite the SSKM Hospital’s emergency unit across the road has been identified for the project. “This will go a long way in improving cancer patient care services in Bengal. The state-of-the-art facility will let us treat patients with advanced technology and gadgets once this unit comes up. Patients will no longer need to go all the way to Mumbai for treatment,” said professor Arunbha Sengupta of Institute of Otorhinolaryngology and (head & neck surgery) at IPGMER. “The hospitals will help to reduce the patient outflow and ensure sustainable growth in cancer care in Bengal,” said a senior state health department official. “The partnership with Tata Memorial will help creation of infrastructure, development of treatment protocol and handholding in setting up two 100-bed facilities in Kolkata and Siliguri,” added the official. The CM said 25% of the cancer patients from Bengal go to Mumbai for treatment and there they often face various problems, ranging from food and lodging to difficulty in communicating their problems. Keeping in mind these multiple problems faced by patients and their relatives, the state government has decided to set up these two cancer hospitals, Mamata said, adding that the new hospitals will allow patients to get treated here. The CM added that patients in Mumbai often face problems in getting dates and appointments with doctors there and the two new hospitals will solve the issue. To be set up on a PPP model, officials expect several rounds of knowledge exchange between IPGMER and Tata Medical doctors before the launch. Banerjee had announced the plan to set up this cancer institute in mid-2019, saying the land would be handed over to SSKM (IPGMER). The land has already been handed over. While all teaching medical colleges and some district hospitals have facilities for treating cancer patients, the state so far does not have a dedicated cancer specialty hospital. Apart from CNCI Kolkata (Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute), which is an autonomous institute under the government of India, there are only a handful of cancer hospitals even in the private sector in Bengal, including Saroj Gupta Cancer Centre and Research Institute in Thakurpur, Tata Medical Centre and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Cancer Research Institute. “General oncology has to be replaced by organ-specific cancer treatment. We believe the setting up of this proposed cancer unit will enable us to strive towards that. This should take cancer treatment to the next level,” said surgery professor at IPGMER Diptendra Sarkar. “This project is going to be a game-changer for cancer treatment in Bengal,” said IPGMER head and neck onco-surgeon Sourav Datta, an alumnus of Tata Memorial Hospital Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-ties-up-with-mum-hosp-for-2-cancer-units/articleshow/83999860.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

As on June 24, the state lost 34,425 patients to Covid and 10,559 had no comorbidities such as hypertension, high blood pressure, renal disorders or any other health issue. A majority of such cases were seen in Bengaluru where 4,299 dead persons had no comorbidities. The city saw 15,537 Covid deaths till June 24. In Yadgir district, 74.7% of dead patients had no comorbidities. The district saw 206 deaths till June 24 and only 52 of the dead had comorbidities. Deaths in patients without comorbidities was 65.1% of the total Covid deaths in Kolar, followed by 59.7% in Chamarajanagar. How second wave affected patientsExperts said some patients may have been unaware of their comorbidities which went unrecorded in medical documents. According to Dr MK Sudarshan, chairperson, Covid Technical Advisory Committee, data recording on comorbidities needs to be checked. “Quality of data is better in medical college hospitals,” said Dr Sudarshan, adding that long delays in hospitalisation led to death. “Obesity is a major risk factor in Covid-19, but it has not been considered as a comorbidity in official medical records,” said another expert. According to Dr Anoop Amarnath, member, state government’s Critical Support Group for Covid treatment, the data indicates the sad ground reality. “In the second wave, there were multiple cases of young patients without comorbidities being presented with heart attacks, stroke, gastrointestinal bleed. This is a clear sign of coagulation abnormality seen with Covid,” he said. He said the contributing factor is dysglycemia (abnormalities in blood glucose levels). “Many young patients had high sugar levels. It was a double whammy as they needed steroids which, in turn, increases the sugar level,” he said. In some patients, infections like Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, caused by a fungus Pneumocustis jiroveci, were seen. “This indicates potential immune suppression nature of Covid. All these factors must be studied further,” said Dr Amarnath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/nearly-1/3rd-of-covid-19-victims-in-ktaka-had-no-comorbidities/articleshow/84006091.cms||Sunitha Rao R

---||Kolkata||Kolkata gets 40% more rain in first month of monsoon||KOLKATA: The first monsoon month in Kolkata has been exceptionally wet this season with the city receiving 40% excess rain in June. South Bengal has received 44% more rain than normal during the month, which, according to meteorologists, is unusual since monsoon usually gets off to a slow start in June in Kolkata. Since 2014, Kolkata has received more than normal rain in June just once — in 2018 when it clocked a 51% excess. The city received 332.6mm rain last month against a normal of 287.5mm. The rainfall was heavier across south Bengal with the region receiving 368.6mm against a normal of 256.2mm. Meterorologists pointed out that a short but intense rainy spell between June 18 and 22 led to the excess. “There were simultaneous low-pressure troughs and cyclonic circulations that triggered several heavy spells. It pushed the rain count up. A similar spell in 2018 had led to excess rain in June that year,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director GK Das. Often, rainfall remains scanty in the city in June due to lack of systems. “Monsoon is driven by low pressures and circulations. This time, we had a few early on. Normally, very few such systems form in June. They are more common between July and early-September, which is the wettest period in Kolkata and south Bengal,” added Das. At the end of the third week of June, Kolkata had an 108% excess rain. It was followed by a relatively dry week, though, during which the city received sporadic drizzles. “There is yet to no strong system that can trigger heavy showers. But short spells and drizzles may continue,” said Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-gets-40-more-rain-in-first-month-of-monsoon/articleshow/83999892.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Mumbai||Couple’s fraud: Money was invested in real estate firms||MUMBAI: The city economic offences wing (EOW) has arrested a husband and wife, both assistant managers working with United India Insurance Company Ltd, in a Rs 8 crore cheating case and has found that the duo has siphoned off over Rs 130 crore. Those arrested are Khushal Singh (38) and his wife Neelam Singh (33). The initial complaint was lodged against Singh and others with the Marine Drive police. The case was later transferred to the EOW. “In the FIR the cheating amount was mentioned as Rs 8.09 crore. Singh, who worked in the accounts department, was a signatory authority for the company’s account with a leading bank in this case. In 21 transactions, he diverted Rs 8.09 crore to his eight personal accounts. The money was then further diverted to other accounts,” said an investigator. Singh had been working with the insurance firm’s Mumbai office since 2016. The offence took place between November 13 last year till April 23 this year. A team supervised by joint commissioner of police (EOW) Niket Kaushik is probing the case. “We arrested the husband and wife from Pune and produced them before a court. The couple has been remanded in police custody till July 5,” said chief investigator, inspector Mandar Lad. During the course of their investigation, the police got the records of another bank account wherein Singh was a signatory authority too. “In the latest development, we found that Singh had issued more than 200 demand drafts, amounting to approximately Rs 121 crore in the name of individuals, third parties and more than 20 companies. Money was also paid/invested in real estate companies in Gurgaon,” said an officer linked to the probe. Police arrested Singh and his wife Neelam on June 28 (Monday) under Sections 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Cde. Police have written to banks and got 40 accounts frozen where money was transferred.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/couples-fraud-money-was-invested-in-real-estate-firms/articleshow/84002015.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Criminal gangs part and parcel of CPM, says K Sudhakaran||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: KPCC president K Sudhakaran here on Wednesday said criminal gangs were part and parcel of CPM and leaders like Pinarayi Vijayan, Kodiyeri Balakrishnan and E P Jayarajan are the ‘role models’ for these youngsters engaged in criminal activities in their quest for making easy money. The CPM narrative about its relation with criminal gangs were plain lies. CPM’s claims that it has expelled criminals from the party was nothing but a drama to hoodwink the public, said Sudhakaran. “Kodi Suni and Kirmani Manoj are still in CPM. I challenge chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to take action against Suni and Manoj. Suni is the de facto superintendent of Kannur jail. They get all kinds of facilities in jail. How come they get such privileges in jail? They are in possession of stinking secrets of CPM and the party cannot disown them altogether,” Sudhakaran told reporters at KPCC headquarters. The Congress state president alleged that CPM leaders like Vijayan, Balakrishnan and Jayarjan have demonstrated how to make money and the youngsters were just following them. “CPM has run out of answers to Akash Thillenkeri’s threat that he would be forced to openly react against the party. I won’t find fault with these youngsters. They are only following their role models,” he said. Reading out from the copy of a notice purportedly served by customs to Pinarayi, Sudhakaran said the CM held several rounds of talks with the UAE consul general, flouting norms and protocol. “Why should a chief minister hold a number of meetings with a consul general who got a punishment transfer to Kerala after facing smuggling charges while working in Vietnam? His former principal secretary M Sivasankar, in his voluntary statement to customs, had said that he arranged Vijayan’s meetings with the consul general when requested by Swapna Suresh, one of the prime accused in the Thiruvananthapuram gold smuggling case. CM is liable to answer to the people,” he said. CPM cries ‘conspiracy’ Meanwhile, CPM state secretariat has alleged conspiracy behind the allegations levelled against the party in connection with the Ramanattukara gold heist case. “The party has repeatedly clarified that it has zero tolerance to those involved in crimes. Despite this, a campaign is run against the party, with the support of a section of the media. This is part of a conspiracy with mal-intent,” said a CPM state secretariat statement on Wednesday. CPM has earned the trust of people for its uncompromised battle against all wrong tendencies in the society, it said. “The attempt now is to wreck this societal base of the party. CPM never took a position that helped criminal activities. CPM always tries to correct itself,” the statement said. People have already rejected the accusations against CPM and the government in connection with the gold smuggling case. The secretariat accused media for turning a blind eye on BJP leaders’ role in the Kodakara hawala money heist case and allegations against Congress leaders. The practice of projecting audio clippings and social media posts as authentic documents against CPM is condemnable, the secretariat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/criminal-gangs-part-and-parcel-of-cpm-sudhakaran/articleshow/83999969.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Guv’s letter unfortunate, without homework, says Min||Mumbai: A delegation led by leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis had called on Koshyari to demand at least a week-long session of the state legislature. The delegation said the speaker of the legislative assembly should be elected immediately and since the issue of OBC reservation is pending in Supreme Court, elections to local bodies should not be conducted at the moment. “Issues raised by the leader of opposition are very important, you take appropriate decision and inform me accordingly,” Koshyari said in his one-page letter to Thackeray. NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik described Koshyari’s letter as unfortunate and sent without having done adequate homework. “We are in the process of electing a speaker during the ensuing legislature session,” Malik said. “So far as duration of the session is concerned, it is not the decision of the government or one person, it is the business advisory committee which takes a decision. It also decides on business before the house,” Malik said. “The business advisory committee is the competent authority to take a decision. Besides the CM, the leader of opposition is also a member of the committee,” he added. On OBC reservation, Malik said, “The decision on scrapping OBC reservation was taken by SC, and the state government has little role to play in this.” Malik felt it was high time the governor took a decision on nominations to the council. “We submitted the proposal on November 6 last year, but the governor has still not taken a decision despite the fact that the matter was in his jurisdiction,” he said. Shiv Sena spokesperson Sachin Ahir too spoke of delay in making appointments to the council. “We followed the procedure and submitted the list to Raj Bhavan, but still no decision has been taken,” Ahir said. Ahir said as per legislature rules, no timeframe has been fixed for election of speaker. “Speaker is essential, but without the speaker too, the assembly functions in a routine manner. Under the rules, in the absence of speaker, the deputy speaker takes over his functions,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-guvs-letter-unfortunate-without-homework-says-min/articleshow/84002114.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra state give roadmap of health department vacancies to Bombay high court||AURANGABAD: Vacant posts of civil surgeons (CS), district health officers (DHOs) and speciality cadre, which are to be appointed by way of nomination, will be filled by end of September once the Governor’s nod is received to the amended recruitment rules in the form of an October 10, 2018 government resolution (GR), the state department of public health told the Bombay high court at Aurangabad in an affidavit filed on Wednesday. Similarly, the vacancies in these three cadres, which are to be appointed by way of promotions, will be filled within six months of the completion of an ongoing roster preparation process as the government, through letters on May 14 and 21 this year, has allowed the filling up of all these vacancies, the affidavit by Sadhana Tayade, director of public health services, Mumbai, stated. The affidavit came in response to the HC’s directives at the last hearing of a PIL by Aurangabad MP Imtiyaz Jaleel on June 18 asking the health department to present a road map of filling up of all vacant posts in the state health department. Through the PIL, Jaleel has taken up the issue of large scale vacancies in the health department, particularly in Aurangabad, affecting delivery of health services and related issues in the wake of the ongoing pandemic situation. Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni while furnishing the affidavit iterated that the state was totally committed to filling up the health department vacancies on priority. On Wednesday, the PIL was heard by the bench of Justice S V Gangapurwala and Justice Rajesh Laddha which also allowed additional government pleader Sujeet Karlekar’s plea for time till Monday (July 5) to furnish a similar affidavit on behalf of the state department of medical education, which looks after all the hospitals attached to the Government Medical Colleges in the state. Tayade’s affidavit stated that the posts of 899 Group-A medical officers will be filled by July 3. It pointed out that overall three posts of additional directors, 10 posts of joint directors, 25 posts of deputy directors, 683 CS cadre, 287 DHO cadre and 565 specialty cadre posts are to be filled either by nomination or by promotion in a ratio of 50:50. The nomination posts of CS, DHO and speciality cadre previously came under purview of MPSC but the state decided to take out these posts from the MPSC’s purview owing to the long time taken in recruitment. It issued a GR on October 10, 2018. “To fill up CS - 123 posts, DHOs - 30 posts and speciality cadre -117 posts an advertisement was published on September 4, 2019 and January 25, 2020. The process of verification of application and documents of applicants has already been completed. But at the stage of scheduling the interview it was noticed that the amendment in Recruitment Rules of these posts in the light of the aforesaid GR dated October 10, 2018 has not received the approval from the Governor of Maharashtra. Therefore, the aforesaid process could not be taken to its logical end once concurrence is received, posts will be filled September 2021,” the affidavit stated. In the promotion quota total 342 Posts of CS are sanctioned, out of which 211 posts are filled and 131 posts are vacant. In DHO cadre, total 144 posts are sanctioned out of which 45 posts are filled and 99 posts are vacant. In speciality cadre total 299 posts are sanctioned out of which 97 posts are filled and 202 posts are vacant, the affidavit stated. (GMCH Surgeon) During the course of hearing, Jaleel raised the issue alleging that since being appointed at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) in April 2018 cardiovascular thoracic surgeon Dr Ashish Bhivapurkar has neither been regular, nor performed any surgeries at GMCH and he draws salary of Rs 2.5 lakh per month. The MP demanded an inquiry against him. HC kept back the matter in the second half of the day and sought all the attendance records, when the GMCH dean filed an affidavit stating that nothing of this sort has happened and allegations are untrue. Operation theatre register, biometric record, and other records dealing with attendance were submitted before the court, and for almost an hour, the records were gone through by the HC. HC concluded that there are discrepancies and kept all the records with itself stating that it will draw a conclusion on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/state-give-roadmap-of-health-dept-vacancies-to-hc/articleshow/83995181.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Nagpur||Pak-born toddler reaches home in India on a visa||Nagpur: Ten-month-old Riyansh, who met his father Kailash Udasi for the first time last week, entered the country as a foreign citizen, requiring a visa to reach his father’s home at Jalgaon. Riyansh, whose story has been reported from time to time by TOI, crossed over from the Wagah border to India along with his mother Sonya on June 26. This was a typical case of how Covid and restrictions that followed left people separated. The child was conceived in India but born in Pakistan as borders shut after Covid cases went up. Sonya was two months pregnant when she went to Pakistan from Jalgaon in Maharashtra, and was left stranded when borders shut as part of Covid protocol. Riyansh was born during the stay, making him a Pakistani citizen by birth. Finally, after decks were cleared for his return, he entered India on a visit visa. The next step will be getting a long-term visa (LTV) for him, while citizenship will take another five years. Now, in this family, the father is an Indian citizen, while mother and child are Pakistanis. Kailash’s family was among the migrants from Sindh province of Paksitan who came into India in the recent years. Kailash had secured Indian citizenship, and he married Sonya, a Pakistani citizen. After marriage, she has been living on a LTV in India, waiting to get citizenship. She was two months pregnant when they went to Pakistan in February 2020 for a marriage and were stranded there. Kailash, an Indian citizen had to return in the first batch, meant only for Indians. This batch was repatriated in June 2020, when Riyansh was yet to be born. Two months later, the child was born in Pakistan, and technically became a Pakistani citizen. Then came the struggle of getting the documents right, which included a Pakistani passport and Indian visa for the child. “He has come on a fresh visa, which was granted for the visit. This will be followed by application for LTV and then citizenship,” said Kailash. Rajesh Jhambia, president Sindhi-Hindi Association, a group of recent migrants from Pakistani, said had Riyansh been born in India it would have made him an Indian citizen. If both the parents were Indian, the child could have still directly got Indian citizenship, even if he was born abroad. However, since the mother was still a Pakistani citizen, the child will have to apply separately. The day the mother gets Indian citizenship, even the child’s status will change, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pak-born-toddler-reaches-home-in-india-on-a-visa/articleshow/83997888.cms||Shishir Arya

Naik said that a large plot of prime land, admeasuring 2.23 acre, was with the Indian defence ministry and after continuous effort by him, then defence minister Sharad Pawar returned a part of it, admeasuring to 0.62 acre, to the Ponda Municipal Council (PMC) in 1991. Later, he said, the state government constructed a martyrs memorial — the Kranti Maidan — on it. The memorial was dedicated to public on October 2, 1996. Initially the land was taken over by the erstwhile Portuguese rulers on August 19, 1954. After Goa’s liberation in 1961, it was converted into camp 2 of the Indian military. Later, even after the PMC was formed in 1971, the defence ministry kept the land occupied for the residences of their officers instead of returning it to the civic body. Now, a major portion of the land is still with the military and the Ponda MLA wants Shripad to return it to PMC. In exchange, the state government had offered the Indian military a land admeasuring 1,6475 sqmt at Curti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ravi-naik-wants-govt-to-get-back-defence-land/articleshow/84002256.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker
---||Ludhiana||Travel safe: Autos to have UID, details can be checked on app||Ludhiana: Knowing your autorickshaw driver is just a click away now, as the Ludhiana Police has come up with a system to get all the three-wheelers registered and give them a unique identification number (UID). A mobile application named SafeAutoPb has also been launched to help people get details, including name, address and photo of the driver, on their cellphones. In the recent past, the police have busted several auto gangs that had been robbing people and creating nuisance in the city. In some cases of murder and rape too, autorickshaws were used by the accused. Commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal said, “The city police have busted several auto gangs involved in thefts, snatchings and loots. At times, accomplices of auto drivers pose as passengers and rob people. It has also been observed that many accused take an auto on rent and then use it to execute a crime. The auto owners don’t even take identity proofs of such drivers.”“It was a long-awaited project for the city. Now all auto rickshaws will be registered by the police. Anyone wanting to register their auto-rickshaw can visit the nearest Saanjh Kendra with all necessary documents. Saanjh Kendras will use the SafeAutoPB software to capture details and generate a UID, of which four reflective stickers will be pasted inside and outside the verified auto. Whenever a new driver is added to the auto, it will become the responsibility of the owner to get his details updated in the software by visiting the Saanjh Kendra. On one auto, a maximum of three drivers can be registered,” Agrawal said. The police will charge Rs 150, for which a receipt will be issued by the Saanjh Kendra. The CP said once the database of auto-rickshaws was created, it would prevent crimes as registered auto drivers would be afraid of getting identified. “People can download the application on their android mobiles. As soon as a passenger enters the UID in the application, all the details, including the driver’s and auto’s photos and its registration details will appear on her mobile screens. This will provide a sense of safety and security to passengers, especially women,” he added. Joint commissioner of police (traffic) Deepak Pareek said, “It is mandatory for every auto owner to get his vehicle registered with UID, otherwise strict action will be taken. They have been given time till August 15. The residents should prefer travelling in autos that have UID pasted on them. In case of any suspicion, a passenger can immediately call the police control room at helpline number 112.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/travel-safe-autos-to-have-uid-details-can-be-checked-on-app/articleshow/83997990.cms||Payal Dhawan

The letter that was posted from Kozhikode was received at his MLA quarters residence in the capital. The letter also mentions that this is a revenge for including the sender in the criminal list. Radhakrishnan responded that he had submitted a complaint to the chief minister, demanding a probe in the matter. He said that he does not need protection, but the origin of the letter should be traced. He also expressed apprehensions that it could be the work of those who were involved in the TP Chandrasekharan murder case who are in prison. It was during his tenure as the home minister that the culprits in the TP Chandrasekharan case were nabbed. Meanwhile, opposition leader VD Satheesan demanded a probe in the matter. “The prisons are being controlled by the culprits in TP Chandrasekharan murder case. It is they who are controlling all kinds of anti-social activities happening outside by remaining inside prison. It could naturally be suspected that it is they who are behind this. We demand that there should be a serious inquiry in the matter. The criminals are unleashing terror right under the nose of the chief minister,” said Satheesan. KPCC president K Sudhakaran also demanded a probe in this matter. “We are not confirming that it would be the culprits in the TP Chandrasekharan murder case, but one of those who were convicted during the tenure of Thiruvanchoor as the home minister. A complaint has been filed before the chief minister and there should be a comprehensive probe. Also, he should be given full protection,” Sudhakaran said. Former chief minister Oommen Chandy said that the threat against Radhakrishnan is a serious matter, and the government should take strict action against those responsible. He said that it could be suspected that those who have faced action during the tenure of Thiruvanchoor are behind this (letter), and the situation in the state is so serious that even the former home minister is facing a life threat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/former-home-minister-family-receive-death-threat/articleshow/84000062.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No pre-arrest bail as doctor played vital role in fraudulent vax drive scam, says Court||Mumbai: A sessions court, that rejected the anticipatory bail plea of Dr Manish Tripathi arrested in fraudulent vaccine drives case, has held that he played a vital role in the commission of the scam. The court said that the 26-year-old accused and others conspired to administer Covid vaccine at camps without appointing trained doctors.The police have accused Dr Tripathi of sourcing used vials or fake doses from Shivam Hospital in Kandivli, where he ran a training and placement institute.“The custodial interrogation of the applicant (Dr Tripathi) is imperative to recover the empty vials, to investigate which chemicals were used to fill the broken seal vials and to probe the financial transaction related to the vaccination. Therefore, he is not entitled to grant the anticipatory bail,” judge LS Chavan said. While the verdict on the plea was pronounced on Monday, the reasoned order was made available on Tuesday. In the four-page order, the court said that there are serious allegations against Dr Tripathi that he himself was filling N S Saline in the broken seal vials and providing them at the vaccination camps with the help of his student, Karim Ali (19).Opposing the plea, public prosecutor Usha Jadhav said Dr Tripathi’s custody was imperative and submitted that he gave fake vaccine doses in the vaccination drive at Hiranandani Heritage club house in Kandivli on May 30. “The accused also gave fake vaccination certificates with different hospital names and dates. The gravity of the offence is serious. The investigation is in progress,” Jadhav said.The defence advocate argued that Dr Tripathi was innocent and had been falsely implicated to protect the real culprits—Dr Shivraj and Dr Neeta Pataria who run Shivam Hospital. The defence also submitted that on the day of vaccination drive, Dr Tripathi was neither present at Hiranandani Heritage Club House nor contacted any person connected with it.

The list includes some of the most popular trains on New Delhi-Ludhiana-Amritsar route: 02013 Shatabdi Express will start from Thursday and 02029 Shatabdi Express from Friday. Besides these, on New Delhi-Ludhiana-Jammu route, 02461 Shri Shakti Express and 02265 Duronto Express will resume operations as well. Several special unreserved trains will also start from Thursday. Majority of the trains were cancelled from May 1 owing to low occupancy and surge in Covid-19 cases. Rajesh Aggarwal, divisional railway manager (DRM), Ferozepur Division, said, “On demand of passengers and local administration of areas under our jurisdiction, we will start the operations of 10 pairs of special unreserved trains from July 1. Decision has been taken to resume several mail express trains as well, mainly on routes of New Delhi to Amritsar, New Delhi to Jammu and Shri Mata Vaishno Devi, Chandigarh to Amritsar, Amritsar to Sarhasa, Jammu Tawi to Kathgodam.” Welcoming the development, Pradeep Wadhawan, former senior vice-president of United Cycle and Parts’ Manufacturers’ Association, said, “We are thankful to the railways for its decision to resume important trains, especially Shatabdi Express that suits the business community for going to Delhi for a one-day trip and it’s economical too. The decision to resume long-distance trains, like Jammu Tawi-Kanpur Central Express, Amritsar-Kouchuveli Superfast and Shri Mata Vaishno Devi-Gazipur will help us in going on business tours to far-off states.” Abhinav Sehgal, joint secretary of Ludhiana Business Forums, said, “With so many trains coming back on track, not only movement of people, but of goods will also be facilitated as going to the far-flung areas by road takes many days and freight charges are also high.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/life-gets-on-track-many-trains-to-resume-soon/articleshow/83997994.cms||Mohit Behl

It sounds strange, but the charm of being in the limelight has made Lal Bihari alias Lal Bihari ‘Mritak’ remarry his wife Karmi Devi. “The marriage ceremony will be held in 2022, when I will turn 28 after my rebirth in government records,” Lal Bihari told TOI on Wednesday, while he was celebrating his 27th ‘re-birthday’. He said that after remaining dead for 18 years in government records, he was declared alive on June 30, 1994. Actually, Lal Bihari is currently 66-year-old, while his wife Karmi Devi is 56-year-old. “By holding the marriage ceremony, I intend to draw the plight of the living dead in society,” he said. Lal Bihari has two daughters and a son, who are all married. They will also attend the marriage ceremony of their parents. Lal Bihari, a resident of Amilo village in Azamgarh district was officially declared dead in 1975. He struggled hard to prove that he is alive, and also added Mritak (deceased) in his name. He formed a Mritak Sangh to highlight the cases similar to his. Filmmaker Satish Kaushik also made a film on his life, which was released in January this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/lal-bihari-mritak-to-remarry-wife-as-he-turns-28-after-rebirth/articleshow/84000023.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Three masked men shoot jeweller, flee with gold||MUMBAI: Within 10 minutes of opening the shutters of his Dahisar store on Wednesday, a jeweller was shot dead by one of three masked men who arrived on a scooter and barged in a little after 10am. CCTVs in the shop captured clear images of the assailant shooting Shailendra Pandey, 37, before he and his aides looted the store. Though the men carried away several trays of gold jewellery, police do not believe robbery was their intention and said they had kept a watch on Pandey’s movements. Pandey’s family said 20-30 tolas of gold had been stolen. The incident sent shockwaves among shop owners in Rawalpada, where Pandey had been running Om Sai Raj Jewellers from rented premises for nine years. Police believe the assailants who shot jeweller Shailendra Pandey had kept a watch on his movements. “Shailendra had resumed business only four days ago,” said a relative. He was also assisted by his cousin sometimes. Pandey apparently had an electronic lock on the door of his shop and would check who was at the door before unlocking it. But on Wednesday, the assailants got in before he had a chance to activate it. Pandey was the sole breadwinner for his wife and two teenaged sons. He had travelled to his hometown during the lockdown-like restrictions to look after his ailing father and recently returned, said a relative. The CCTV cameras in his shop recorded Pandey opening the shutters of Om Sai Raj Jewellers in Dahisar’s Rawalpada at 10.06am on Wednesday. The footage shows he finished pooja and was about to clean the store, when three masked men entered, shot him and walked out at 10.14am with two heavy bags of stolen gold. Two rounds were fired in the shop. One hit him under his right eye, officials said. “I heard two shots and initially presumed the tin shed above our shops had collapsed,” said Shivam Mishra, who runs a mobile phone store next door. “There was a commotion and people started to gather. By the time I entered the jewellery store, the assailants had vanished. Pandey had slumped to the ground, his back towards us. I dialled the police emergency number 100 but couldn’t get through. So I rushed to the Dahisar police station and brought the police with me,” he added. Police said the three assailants had arrived on a scooter; the rider wore no helmet and was dressed in a white kurta and blue denims. Witnesses said the scooter’s number plate was dented. The police have started looking into all possible motives, including a property dispute or a financial feud. “Shailendra had never mentioned rivalry with anyone or being threatened. We used to talk frequently,” said a relative, K D Dubey. Pandey’s body was taken to the JJ Hospital for a post-mortem. The Dahisar police have registered a case of murder and are making inquiries with traders from whom Pandey procured jewellery for his shop. The crime branch has begun a parallel inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/3-masked-men-shoot-jeweller-flee-with-gold/articleshow/84004014.cms||Nitasha Natu

Justice C Hari Shankar asked Delhi Police to take appropriate steps to protect the woman till the matter is taken up next, noting that the petitioner is a young woman who has expressed apprehensions regarding her security. The manner in which the protection is to be given is left to Delhi Police, it said. The court refrained from issuing notice on the petition. On its part, Delhi Police told the court that the woman was not found residing at the address given in the petition and even her mobile phone was switched off due to which the police officers were unable to contact her. The woman then said that due to her apprehensions, she had to frequently change her address and added that she would email her present address to the police. The court was hearing a plea by the woman, who is working in Delhi. She is from Shahjahanpur in Uttar Pradesh and seeking protection for herself and her family as also her right to privacy, saying that because of her conversion she and her family are being targeted and malicious content is being published in the media. The plea by Renu Gangwar alias Ayesha Alvi says she converted to Islam on May 27 in Delhi and since June 23, when she was in Shahjahanpur, she started getting unwelcome attention from the local media, vigilantes and police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/interim-hc-relief-for-woman-who-wilfully-converted/articleshow/84049690.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Eventually, Chandni Chandran, an IAS officer and Arun Sudarsan, a researcher, happily married now, came to view that May 2016 chilling-out photo as presciently symbolic of how their lives would soon acquire such a fairytale cast.

I did not make it. Next day newspapers were filled with pics of toppers & The Times Of India published this pic of us!” read the tweet by Chandni, along with the photo published in TOI which has now garnered about9,000+ likes. “I took it as a sign that my photo was destined to be there in the paper filled with UPSC toppers and that I can happily walk towards any destination with someone holding an umbrella and looking out for me with love unbound when I take each step,” her tweet reads. I remember that 2016 day as a usual working day for me at the TOI office in Thiruvananthapuram when my bureau chief told me about a complaint received from a reader. Gears shifted rapidly in my head, as I tried to figure what I may have done wrong — I had seen a young couple walking down under an umbrella in heavy rain, it made for a lovely shot and I clicked it and now I was rather surprised to know that my picture had irked the couple. I explained that the couple was in public space and they never objected to me clicking and the matter was over. It turns out that Arun, who was clicked along with his then girlfriend, now his wife, also had to do his share of explanation to do on the day it was published. Arun’s father MR Sudarsanakumar who is a TOI reader happened to spot the picture and jokingly enquired with his son about where all the couple was “roaming around” the previous day. Arun who was disturbed by the "unpleasant conversation" which the published photos led to, had then called TOI to complain. But all that is in the past. The couple has now come to cherish the photo and hoard it as a souvenir. Days before Chandni compiled a thread of tweets recounting the entire episode, I received an e-mail from Arun. He reminded me of the picture and asked if there was any way he could have the photo. Since the photos are filed date wise and Arun had provided the exact date, I could help them with a copy of the picture. It was a pleasant surprise for me to learn how a casual photo taken by me had turned out to be so special for someone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/a-controversial-toi-pic-that-an-ias-officer-now-treasures/articleshow/84000137.cms||Rakesh Nair
---||Chennai||Spinning a vibrant visual tale online||For years, Chetana Charitable Trust has been working to adapt books and stories for children with disabilities. Their Accessible Reading Materials (ARM) library, which was established in 2018, has been delivering these books to the doorsteps of these young readers. But when Covid-19 broke out, this became impossible. That’s why the Trust has come out with an online library, making about 50 books available in various languages, including the Indian sign language (ISL) available.These have since been read more than 2,000 times since the library was launched in January this year. "We have always focussed on early learning for children with disabilities, and looked at learning through play. So we make different accessible play material like an early development kit that targets the first year milestones," says Namita Jacob, director of the Trust.They also created handmade books for children with visual or intellectual impairment, or motor issues, who couldn’t turn pages. "Initially, we had 15 interactive books. Then, with the help of special educators Anu Alex and Aarabhi Badri, we began creating more," says Namita. ARM library was launched with about 50 books in Tamil and English, and 10 children as members."The books were designed to be accessible to children who were blind or had low vision, intellectual impairment, attention deficit, cerebral palsy or some form of print access disability, which means the child is unable to read a regular book," says Namita.The books were also accessible. "For instance, you have the story, ‘The Giving Tree’, which is about an apple tree and a child who are best friends. The way it is written and illustrated makes it hard for a child with disabilities so, though the story, message and mood were retained, we simplified and kept the sentences short, made the pictures tactile, had large print and braille," says Namita.Many books also have items that come along with illustrations. "There is a story from Tulika, ‘A Gift From The Sea’ about a child who comes o see the ocean and collects the things she finds. So the book comes with the items she collects, like a bottle, slipper, and the conch," she says.These books were being delivered to the children, but when the pandemic broke out, it wasn’t possible. "So we went online and found sites with free books and sent it to our members, but soon realised the children were not able to follow these books. That’s when we thought of creating our own books," says Namita.With the help of the Bloom Editor software, they began creating books that could be downloaded and read on a smartphone through the Bloom Reader app or on the computer. "The software allows us to build in a lot of access features. Apart from the read aloud with text highlight feature, we can adjust font size, add audio descriptions of the pictures and sign language videos," says Namita. "The app interacts with access technology available on any android phone, like the talk back feature for the visually impaired. There are also other features that allow a child with cerebral palsy to turn pages."Vedavathi Katari, whose six-year-old, Tanmay, has low vision, says her son enjoys the online books. "He can listen to it on the phone. The pictures in the book are described in detail so he doesn’t feel he is missing out," she says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/spinning-a-vibrant-visual-tale-online/articleshow/84006265.cms||Priya Menon

Police are on the trail of the locally well-regarded NGO director who told the mother of a year-old boy, Manickam, that he died of Covid and sold him to a jeweller in the city on June 13. A two-year-old girl, Dhanam, was sold to another couple on June 16. It was social worker Azarudeen of Sekkipatti in Melur who sounded the alarm. In March, he had admitted Manickam, his mother Iswarya, 22, and her two other children in the home run by NGO Idhayam Trust, headed by G R Shivakumar. Azarudeen, who filed the police complaint, said, “Iswarya is an orphan who got married to a 65-year-old man who adopted her when she was young.” “After his death, she faced sexual harassment from the locals. Hence I shifted her to the home thinking she and the children will be safe there,” he said.The Madurai city police rescued Manickam from a jewellery store owner Kannan and his wife, who live in Ismailpuram here, and handed him over to his mother on Wednesday night. Within an hour, Dhanam was rescued from a couple, Anees Rani and Sagubar Sathik, of Kalmedu here. Both the couples are childless. Dhanam’s mother is a native of Karnataka. Tallakulam Inspector Selvakumar said that they got the information on the children’s whereabouts from Kalaivani, an employee of Idhayam Trust. She claimed innocence initially, but confessed under sustained interrogation, police said. "The couples who took the children will also be arrested. We are probing how much money changed hands,” the inspector said. Police have intensified the hunt for Shivakumar, who started the home for aged and destitute people a few years ago with the blessings of the police and the public. He used to be regularly feted for his social work, which he continued during the pandemic. Azarudeen said that on June 20, he learnt that Manickam had been separated from his mother a week before and she hadn’t seen him since. Sivakumar told him the child had tested positive for Covid-19 and had been admitted to Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH). At noon on Tuesday, Azarudeen was told by the NGO’s volunteers that the boy had died at the hospital earlier in the day and that health officials had buried him at the Thathaneri burial ground. The mother was not allowed to see the body but was taken to the burial ground to do some rituals. The volunteers showed Azarudeen a document signed by a doctor of Narimedu primary health centre referring the child to GRH, and a letter from the Thathaneri ground staff permitting burial of the child, he added. (Both documents have since proved to be fake.) However, when Azarudeen checked with GRH, he found that no such child was admitted there. Alarmed, he passed on the information to district collector Aneesh Sekhar, who ordered an inquiry, which led to the children being rescued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tn-child-trafficking-cops-rescue-2-kids/articleshow/84006743.cms||V Devanathan

Even as the incident took place on June 23, an FIR was lodged on Wednesday as initially the police were finding the case suspicious. Mukesh Kumar, 35, a resident of Sector 22-B, Chandigarh, said in his police complaint, “I work with a company that supplies gold and diamond jewellery. On June 23, I had come to Ludhiana in the company’s chauffeur-driven car. I was to deliver 10 jewellery parcels in Sarafa Bazaar here. The driver parked the car on the main road and I started walking towards the narrow lanes of Sarafa Bazaar with my backpack containing the jewellery parcels. On the way, a man stopped me and claimed he was a cop. He said his three seniors standing nearby will frisk me.” After checking him and his bag, the accused allowed him to go. “When I reached my destination to deliver the parcels, I found two packets missing,” he added. Suspecting that the men stole these from the bag while frisking it, he lodged a police complaint. Division 1 police station ASI Amreek Singh said, “The parcels contained gold ornaments of approximately Rs 12 lakh. The case was first investigated and then an FIR was lodged, as partners of the company Mukesh works with had recently separated.” Police have the footage of CCTV cameras that have captured the accused.

The labs, part of the preparations for a possible third Covid-19 wave, will be functional in about one week, health minister Satyendar Jain said on Wednesday. “We are preparing two genome sequencing labs to study the mutating coronavirus. Earlier, such samples were sent to the central government for study. Now, Delhi has this technique and it will be performed in two Delhi government hospitals,” Jain said. “The last wave that Delhi had witnessed was of the Delta variant. The coronavirus mutates continuously... There has been no case of Delta-plus variant in Delhi so far,” he added. The number of Covid-19 cases has drastically declined in the past few weeks and the government is using the time to gear up to handle up to 37,000 single-day cases. “We are aggressively preparing for the pandemic. We have not received any notice from the Centre stating that there should be a particular kind of preparation for the Delta-plus variant. Be it any variant, vaccination and using a face mask are the two ways to prevent the infection,” Jain pointed out. Though the positivity rate is down at 0.12%, people should not be complacent about the Covid-appropriate behaviour, he said . “We still need to be alert and I urge everyone who steps out of home should wear a mask. About 75-80,000 Covid tests are being conducted daily.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-hosps-to-get-genome-sequencing-labs/articleshow/84000179.cms||---

---||Ludhiana||Irani gang is back in Ludhiana city||LUDHIANA: The infamous Irani gang is back in the city after two years. Police say the fake cops, who escaped with two jewellery parcels of Rs 12 lakh from Division 1 area, are Irani gang members. The gang struck in the city for the first time in 2018 and then returned a year later. Due to the lockdown last year, it gave Ludhiana a miss. The band usually comes here when the hosiery season begins. Additional deputy commissioner of police-1 Pragya Jain says, “It was ascertained during investigation that the cop imposters were Irani gang members. Their modus operandi, physique, language and tone, all point towards it.” Police have pictures of some of the Irani gang members. “These pictures will be displayed in the markets to create awareness. We have already issued instructions that only in-uniform police personnel can stop and frisk a person. A cop without uniform should be considered off duty,” she adds. In 2018, the gang had executed six such snatchings, looting traders who had come to the city in the hosiery season. Posing as cops, the accused frisk traders and escape with cash. The then investigation had taken Ludhiana police to Maharashtra, where they had nabbed the gang leader, Laalu Khani Irani. His accomplices, however, could not be traced. In September 2019, the gang had executed a snatching of Rs 2.50 lakh. The police had identified the accused as Mohammad Ali and Baghar Ali, of Hi-tech City on airport road, Bhopal. A team of Ludhiana police had gone to Bhopal to arrest the accused, but returned empty handed. Their modus operandi The accused roam around on motorcycles in formal dresses. Usually, they target people in two groups of four members. While one group stands away, the other approaches the target. Claiming to be police personnel, they ask the target to come along to their seniors for frisking. While the prey is being checked, another accused distracts him with a conversation. After looting, the accused immediately escape from the spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/irani-gang-is-back-in-city/articleshow/83998062.cms||Payal Dhawan

Observing that the stand taken by the ministry can very well be taken as a positive move from the side of the Centre to immediately start services at AIIMS, the Madras high court on Wednesday asked the state government to take necessary steps by considering this interest expressed by the ministry as a formal request by the Centre. Assistant solicitor general L Victoria Gowri appearing for the Centre submitted that the secretary of the Union ministry of health and family welfare in the counter affidavit had stated that they are keen to start the services subject to availability of alternate space for starting MBBS classes and OPD services with faculty and other manpower. Necessary processes in this direction will be expedited in consultation with the state government. She further submitted that project cell posts for AIIMS Madurai had already been sanctioned and appointments to the posts of executive director, deputy director (administration), executive engineer and administrative officer have already been made. When senior counsel Veera Kathiravan appearing for the state submitted that no such communication was received by the government, a division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that by considering the present pandemic situation, “we are of the view that those formalities which are normally observed can be dispensed with for the present.” Hence, the judges requested the state health secretary to consider the stand taken by the Centre as a positive request or a keen willingness to provide OPD services and to start MBBS classes if alternate premises is offered by the state till the construction is completed in the site which has been allotted for Madurai AIIMS. The judges sought response from the state government in this regard and adjourned the case to July 7. The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by K Pushpavanam, a law student from Madurai district, seeking to establish a temporary campus for AIIMS Madurai to provide OPD services to the people and also sought to commence conducting MBBS courses in the temporary campus similar to that provided in other AIIMS’ in the country. The petitioner also sought to fill up the vacancies in the project cell of AIIMS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/centre-tells-hc-it-is-keen-on-starting-opd-mbbs-in-aiims/articleshow/84000162.cms||Kaushik Kannan

---||Kozhikode||Tree felling: Greens demand probe by revenue team outside district||KOZHIKODE: Greens have demanded an enquiry into the lapses on the part of revenue authorities in the felling of centuries-old rosewood trees from Cavalry estate at Thirunelly by a revenue department team, comprising officials outside the district. Wayanad Prakrithi Samrakshana Samiti made this demand when a probe by the Mananthavady sub-collector was underway in the issue. The outfit reiterated their charge that there were revenue land, excess land and reserved trees in the district and added that the reports submitted by the tahsildar and the taluk surveyor in this regard were incorrect and urged authorities to reject them as it was taluk revenue authorities themselves who had provided NOC to enable the felling of trees. WPSS president N Badusha and secretary Thomas Ambalavayal said that the survey was conducted without using the total station machine and alleged that the survey and probe was a farce aimed at protecting the officials who made lapses while granting cutting permission to fell these trees. Badusha said that the coffee board doesn’t have the power to recommend the felling of trees and the investigation should cover the officials who were repeatedly giving recommendations for shade regulation which is being misused to fell centuries-old trees from coffee estates. WPSS said that Calvary estate was located on a hill slope which is the originating point of several streams. Also the area is ecologically fragile and had witnessed a number of landslides in recent years. Forest department had maintained that cutting permits were granted to estates based on the NOC received from the revenue department that the land belonging to the estates was not part of revenue land or EFL land and that there were no reserved trees included. Begur range officer had issued a stop memo to Calvary estate not to proceed with the felling and had verbally told other estates not to proceed with the tree felling for the moment following the concerns raised by environmental organizations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/tree-felling-greens-demand-probe-by-revenue-team-outside-dist/articleshow/84000227.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Land values may see up to 200% jump in Telangana||HYDERABAD: A day after a cabinet sub-committee on resource mobilisation recommended enhancement of property registration values in the state, the registration and stamps (R&S) department is considering increasing land rates between 20% and 200% over the current registration rates. If chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao approves the proposal, the hike may come into effect from July second week instead of August 1, a senior official said. In many non-commercial areas and resdiential colonies, the hike is expected to be 100%, while it could be 200% on commercial roads and between 20% and 50% in rural and municipal towns. In Greater Hyderabad and HMDA limits, the hike might be between 100% and 200% in areas where more number of documents (transactions) are being registered. Explaining that there was a huge variation between registration (government) value and prevailing market value of land, officials said for instance in upmarket areas such as Madhapur, Guttala Begumpet and Khanamet under Serilingampally sub-registrar office, the maximum (government) land registration values were Rs 30,000 per sq yard for commercial land (main roads) and Rs 20,000 per sq yd in residential colonies. “The market rate in these areas is Rs 1 lakh per sq yard in residential colonies and over Rs 2 lakh for commercial areas. The amount is expected to be doubled now,” an R&S department official said. Similarly, in Jubilee Hills, the rates were between Rs 50,000 and Rs 60,000 per sq yard while the properties (plots) were being sold at Rs 2 lakh per sq yard. At the fastest-growing Nizampet, due to its proximity to Hi-Tec City, the land value is Rs 10,000, while in areas like Dundigal it was just Rs 2,000 while the market value is nearly Rs 20,000. In the eastern parts of the city, Uppal and Qutbullapur sub-registrar office register more documents. In Nagole, the land registration rate is between Rs 9,000 and Rs 10,000. HMDA had sold its plots in Uppal Bhagat layout close to Nagole between Rs 30,000 and Rs 40,000 per sq yard. “After Metro rail became operational, there has been a huge demand for properties in the abutting areas and the land prices are skyrocketing. At Kalyan Nagar near Uppal Crossroad, the government land value is just Rs 9,000. On the other hand, open plots are being sold for over Rs 70,000 and it is Rs 1 lakh close to the main road,” a sub-registrar said. The R&S department is proposing hike in registration charges and stamp duty from 7% to 7.5% from the existing 6%. Meanwhile the government has constituted committees at village, mandal and district level to approve the revised land registration rates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/land-values-may-see-up-to-200-jump/articleshow/84004031.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Delhi||Surge in e-delivery of govt services in Delhi||NEW DELHI: During the Covid-19 pandemic, the online delivery of services like income, caste and birth certificates has come to the rescue of lakhs of Delhiites. While till February 2020, 37 lakh applications were received across 11 districts, it increased to 55 lakh by June 2021. Similarly, till February 2020, 25 lakh certificates were downloaded while the count crossed 35 lakh by June 2021. Delhi government’s e-district project, launched in 2015 as part of AAP’s digital governance promise, seeks to make all government services accessible in a transparent, efficient manner without requiring people to visit government offices. In September 2018, the online delivery of services was launched with 40 services, and it now offers 108 services. With many departments having met 100% target, the system helps people avoid crowd, especially during the Covid pandemic. Last week, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal had asked the departments to take time-bound steps to bridge the digital divide to make the system accessible to all sections of people. “He insisted that the idea was to ensure delivery of services without physical interface, so that red tape or harassment of ordinary people could be fully avoided,” said an official. Online delivery of services can be accessed by dialling 1076. It was halted for five months last year due to the pandemic. According to the information technology department, Delhi had 31,19,095 registered users for the digital delivery in February 2020, which increased to 39,85,405 in November 2020 and to 46,75,716 by June 2021. “It indicates that people are rushing to avail of digital delivery of services rather than going to government offices to seek various services due to Covid-19 and also due to the system’s ease and transparency,” said an official. While the number of applications for digital services has increased from 37,36,078 to 55,10,657 between February 2020 and June 2021, the successful downloading of certificates has gone up from 25,08,170 to 35,22,422 in the same period. An official document prepared by the department, which was accessed by TOI, shows that the highest demand of certificates is for castes (OBC and SC) at 14,32,479, followed by income (13,31,944), registration of construction workers for welfare schemes (4,11,795), enrolment of civil defence volunteers (3,52,733), domicile proof (2,56,580), Antyodaya Anna Yojana card (1,89,280), and old age pension (1,34,381). E-district, a comprehensive service portal through which citizens can access various government services, also provides online verification of various certificates issued by multiple departments. “E-district envisions to reduce duplicity at every level in the government, thereby improving operational efficiency of the entire system,” said an official. “Our ultimate objective is to maximise citizens’ comfort, enhance operational efficiency, improve quality and provide time-bound and hassle-free services.” The departments that have achieved 100% target include the directorate of education, tourism, food supply, women & child development, transport, excise, industries, food safety, labour and forest departments, Delhi Jal Board and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/surge-in-e-delivery-of-govt-services/articleshow/84000153.cms||AlokKNMishra

A total of 2,03,035 vaccine doses were administered on June 30, of which 1.5 lakh doses were administered to youth. The speed of the second dose of vaccination is also increasing and over 37,000 people had their second jab administered on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Delhi government started four special vaccination centres for delivery agents of e-commerce platforms. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia visited one such centre and said it was important to vaccinate the delivery agents and make them safe from the coronavirus. TimesViewThis is a good move. Delivery agents have been saviours for millions during the ongoing Covid crisis. They do a tough and risky job for a low salary. Vaccinating them on a priority basis will be beneficial to them as well as to those whose goods they deliver at home.Releasing the vaccination bulletin for Wednesday, AAP MLA Atishi said Delhi had received another instalment of 4 lakh Covishield doses and the vaccination stock of 7, 64,000 doses would last three days at the current vaccination speed of 2 lakh people per day. “The speed of vaccination is increasing at a fast pace due to the vaccine supply availability for the 18-44 age group. Delhi’s youngsters want to get themselves vaccinated and with the lockdown being lifted, these are the people who need to step out of their houses to earn a livelihood for their families,” Atishi said. In the past one month or so, the speed of the second dose of vaccination has declined as the gap between the two jabs of Covishield doses has increased. “But now, those who were due for the second dose of Covishield a month ago are getting themselves vaccinated according to the new dosage gap timeline,” Atishi said. The MLA requested the Centre to maintain a regular supply of vaccine for Delhi since the pace of vaccination is increasing with each day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/4-spl-centres-to-vaccinate-delivery-agents-2l-more-get-the-jab-on-wednesday/articleshow/84000172.cms||---

Leith’s softshell turtle is endemic to peninsular India and found in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Odisha. Hingna RFO Ashish Ninawe received a call around 1.30am from a resident Gajanan Dhakulkar informing that a huge turtle was walking on the road. The feet of these turtles are round and stumpy. Though they spend most of their lives in water, they are also adapted for walking on land. Ninawe and his staff rushed to the spot and rescued the turtle and shifted it to the Transit Treatment Centre (TTC), Seminary Hills, where it is under the observation of wildlife vets Dr Mayur Kate, Dr Syed Bilal Ali, and Dr Siddhant More. “We will release the turtle in its natural habitat once vets declare it fit,” said Kundan Hate, state wildlife board member, and RFO Gangadhar Jadhav. Ninawe feared the reptile might have come out of the nearby Vena river. The colony where the amphibian was found is very close to the river. It feeds on mosquito larvae, crabs, freshwater mollusks, and fish.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rare-turtle-rescued-from-hingna/articleshow/83998132.cms||---

In an emotional adieu to the campus on which they had spent more than half of their lives, the retiring teachers said they felt fortunate to have witnessed LU turn 100 and to have taught at a place known for Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb. Tears of happiness, memories and long discussions on their LU journey continued for hours when they assembled for their farewell ceremony on the campus. Former pro vice-chancellor and biochemistry faculty Prof UN Dwivedi said, “I am retiring but not for my students whom I will teach and guide till my last breath. I am fortunate that I could witness my university turn 100.” It was also the day for four strong pillars of LU science faculty. Expert of Himalayan geology Prof KK Agarwal, x-ray and spectroscopy expert Prof Kirti Sinha, organic chemistry expert Prof Naveen Khare, and bryologist Prof Geeta Asthana said that their books of achievements was written in, at, by and for LU. Whenever a legal matter struck LU, it was former CBI inspector-turned-teacher Prof DNNS Yadav who helped it overcome the challenge. In a heavy voice, he said, “I left CBI as I had an academic temperament. I feel happy when I look back at this illustrious journey.” Six noted scholars said that LU motivated them to popularise Indian languages overseas.

---||Nagpur||Bring prices of grenades at par with private Nagpur corporations: Government to OFB||NAGPUR: In what may be one of the first steps towards conversion into a public corporation, the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) has been asked by the government to bring prices of its hand grenades at par with that offered by Nagpur’s Solar Group. Once a corporation, the ordnance factories will have to compete with private sector in supplying armament to defence forces. The ordnance factories unions have called for an indefinite strike against corporatization. Solar Group is the first-ever private company to have bagged an order to make this product. Economic Explosives Limited (EEL), the 100% subsidiary of the group, has got an order to make 10 lakh multimodal hand grenades for the Army. The first batch is expected to be despatched soon. The multimodal grenades will be replacing the World War II M36 hand grenades. Grenades are among the last resorts of defence for soldiers during combat. The new grenades, which have better accuracy and lethality, can be used for both offensive and defensive purposes. The grenades were developed by ordnance factory at Khamaria at Jabalpur and EEL, based on DRDO technology. Even as EEL got the order, passing Army’s clearance process was took time for OFB. After technical aspects were cleared, the OFB was lately asked to match the price with Solar Group, which the former has agreed to and responded accordingly. This will bring down the price offered by OFB by Rs1,500-odd. Each grenade has been priced in the range of Rs3,500 to Rs4,000, said sources. With OFB also agreeing to bring down the rates, a bulk order from the Army is finally expected soon, said a source. Earlier, the OFB was also asked to first prove shelf life of the grenade which is supposed to be at least 15 years. It had responded that under the intensive shelf life assessment (ISA) method as recommended by Army’s directorate general of quality assurance (DGQA), it would take around two years for the process. Till then the order would have to be held up. On the other hand, Solar Group has gone with the faster Isothermal Micro Calometry method, which was used the first time in the country. However, it is used by NATO countries and takes four months to give results. Now, the OFB’s stance has been accepted and shelf life testing will begin as soon as the first batch is delivered. With this, bulk production and shelf life testing will go on simultaneously. OFB has insisted that ISA is the only method in its protocol as it has to go by DGQA’s norms. It has taken a decade for the project in which EEL had emerged as the sole qualifying company for taking part in bids. In August 2019, the request for proposal (RFP) document was amended easing the norms for timings to generate an explosion. The relaxation applied for 10% of the batch. Both EEL and OFB had denied of having needed any relaxation saying that their grenades had met full accuracy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bring-prices-of-grenades-at-par-with-pvt-co-govt-to-ofb/articleshow/83998182.cms||Shishir Arya

DMA, with over 15,000 members from medical fraternity, cited 23 instances of recent attacks on doctors and healthcare workers in West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Punjab, Kerala, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh to argue that the existing laws punishing assaulters of doctors and healthcare workers have not proved an effective deterrent. Quoting a study by famous and one of the oldest medical journals, ‘The Lancet’, the petitioner through advocate Sneha Kalita said “nearly 75% doctors in India have faced either verbal or physical violence during their lifetime.” DMA said the state laws, which punish those assaulting doctors, do not provide a preventive security mechanism for doctors or creation of a safety room in the hospital where the targeted doctor or health worker could retreat in the face of an impending assault. “There is no central policy for compensation by the government to the injured doctor/healthcare personnel or their kith and kin, if they succumb to injuries caused by the assault from relatives of the patients,” the DMA said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dmas-plea-in-sc-to-protect-docs-against-rising-violence/articleshow/84000287.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The court was hearing the petition filed by P Jeyasekhar, a resident of Melur, who sought to permit the members of his organisation to participate in the memorial event at Melavalavu village. The petitioner stated that while the authorities had allotted different time slots for various political parties to participate in the memorial event, their representation seeking to participate in the event was rejected. Taking into consideration the fact that the people belonging to the organisation are not affiliated to any political party and they were the ones assisting the lawyers in getting justice for the victims of the Melavalavu massacre incident, justice N Anand Venkatesh observed that they deserve to be given a slot and time in order to pay their respects. Hence, the judge directed the authorities to permit the representations of the organisation which shall be limited to 10 people, to visit the spot and pay respects from 10am to 1pm on July 1. The judges said that the members who attend the memorial event should strictly maintain Covid-19 protocol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-allows-outfit-to-attend-melavalavu-memorial-event/articleshow/84000201.cms||---

A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi passed the order by taking into account the submission of the state that the authorities can take action as per provisions of the Tamil Nadu Anatomy Act, 1951 and Tamil Nadu Anatomy Rules, 1951. The state also submitted that continuance of the body remaining in the hospital should be deemed a nuisance under provisions of the Tamil Nadu Public Health Act. The local authority has got the power to abate the nuisance as per relevant provisions. The judges said that they are only concerned about what has to be done with the body which is lying in the mortuary of the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital for more than 60 days and they are of the view that the court needs to issue appropriate directions as it cannot lie any longer in the mortuary. The judges said that at the request of the petitioner’s counsel they will defer the order till 3pm on July 2. If the petitioner fails to receive the body on the said date and time, the authorities can take steps in terms of the relevant statutes by 7pm on July 2.

Although DMRC is running maximum numbers of trains, passengers have to wait outside the stations because of the restrictions with the carrying capacity of the Delhi Metro being in the range of only 10-15% of its usual capacity.On Wednesday evening too, the average waiting time to enter the Rajiv Chowk Metro station was 50 minutes at 7 pm and was one hour a day before. Recently, the waiting time to enter the station had clocked 80 minutes. DMRC had recently requested DDMA to allow standing passengers in its trains but no relaxations were provided in the latest unlock guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/glitch-mars-services-on-blue-line-again/articleshow/84000195.cms||---

The government has taken up the Palle Pragati and Pattana Pragati programmes with an objective to make villages and towns clean and green and resolve the local issues. The programmes were first rolled out in September 2019 and have completed three phases. Officials said chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is not only giving special emphasis to the programmes but also granting special funds to implement them. Telangana had won the Swachh Sarvekshan award on Novembers 20, 2019, for better sanitation methods and other awards also. Initially, the government had launched Palle Pragati and later the same programme was taken up in towns and municipalities under Pattana Pragati.

In a letter to chief secretary Vinni Mahajan, he wrote, “I am highly grateful to the board and the government for reposing faith in me and deciding to re-appoint me as the vice-chancellor of PAU for a month. I feel greatly honored. I wish to inform that due to family circumstances, I will not be able to continue to shoulder the responsibility of vice-chancellor of PAU. I regret this inconvenience and request the members of the board to excuse me for this decision. I wish to place on record my gratitude to the board of management, the state government, faculty, staff, and students for wholeheartedly supporting me and PAU during my tenure as its vice-chancellor, which enabled the university to attain newer heights.” The letter has also been marked to Punjab additional chief secretary (development) Anirudh Tiwari. Dhillon was appointed as the PAU VC in 2011 for four years. He was again given the charge in 2015 for another four years up to 2019. Thereafter, his term was extended by two years. PAU Teachers’ Association secretary KS Sangha said, “We appeal to the government that a new VC be appointed with a modern and futuristic vision and applications be called from eminent scientists and academicians to take PAU to greater heights in this phase of crisis when research needs reorientation and income of agitating farmers must be enhanced.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/dhillon-refuses-to-continue-as-pau-vc/articleshow/83998189.cms||Mehak Jain

BJP national party president JP Nadda, who is likely to inaugurate the meet, may also be present in some of the sessions. Sources said it might be a one-day meeting and the sessions would be planned by the state leadership. Some sessions of the meeting may also be actual as there might be discussions held in the party office. It is not the first time that UP BJP will focus on the roadmap for state assembly elections. The party is already in the election mode and with the executive meeting, the think tanks will come together on one platform. The executive meeting which was held in March also had its focus set on elections, though much of the focus was on panchayat polls. The executive meeting which will have participation from the party office-bearers and workers from all over the state may have some feedback and suggestions coming the state leadership's way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-state-executive-meet-likely-to-be-held-on-july-7/articleshow/84002310.cms||Neha Shukla

Revanth, who is also Malkajgiri MP, alleged misappropriation of funds in the construction of the upcoming martyrs’ memorial at Tank Bund. He said he will come out with details soon. “Keep your visuals of the under-construction martyrs’ memorial ready. You will need them,” he advised the media, charging chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao with even exploiting the memorial for financial benefit. Speaking at a meeting with presidents of District Congress Committees (DCCs) in the city, he said the original cost was Rs 63 cr, while the escalated cost was Rs 80 cr and now the proposal was to sanction more money, make it Rs 100 cr. Revanth said though elections were two years away, KCR was an unpredictable man, having the tendency to resign having his own calculations in mind as he had done before. “The earlier KCR chooses to go for elections the better it will be for the state,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/martyrs-memorial-funds-misused/articleshow/84004065.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Madurai||Bride performs ‘Surul Vaal Veechu’, enthrals onlookers||Tuticorin: Minutes after marrying her groom on Monday morning, 22-year-old P Nisha in her silk sari took out her sharp flexible blade to perform ‘Surul Vaal Veechu’, ‘Rettai Kambu’ (using two silambam sticks) and ‘Adimarai’ on the cement road in front of the wedding hall in Thirukolur village. Her 30-minute performance following her wedding was to create awareness among girls to learn self-defence. The video of her performance shot by villagers went viral on social media. “It was not easy to perform in a sari and with heavy make up and accesories as a bride. I used to practice martial arts in a t-shirt and track pants,” the bride told TOI. She also fought with her fellow student as a part of the performance. “My husband Rajkumar Moses, 29 who is also my maternal uncle and aasan (coach) Mariappan asked me to focus on my skill and nothing else,” she said. Nisha who aspires to become a police officer is a B.Com graduate. Her fellow students performed martial arts for an hour, thereby keeping the wedding guests and villagers entertained for around 90 minutes. She started learning traditional martial arts such as silambam, surul vaal, adimarai, kalaripayattu and theepantham (fire ball) three years ago as a final year college student. It was on the motivation of her mother Mani, 45, that she continued pursuing the self-defense art forms. Nisha is one of 50-year-old Mariappan’s 80 students who are coached free of cost. After winning many local silambam competitions, Nisha won the first prize in the district in silambam last year and came third in the State level competition in Tirupur. Rajkumar, a diploma holder and farmer, was supportive of her martial arts and wanted her to use their wedding as a platform to showcase his wife’s martial art skills. “We wanted to replace cultural events with the martial arts performance to create awareness among girls, so that incidents such as the Pollachi sexual harassment scandal and suicides would not take place,” he said. According to him, girls can be mentally strong if they practise these art forms and also gain the confidence to face challenges in life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/bride-performs-surul-vaal-veechu-enthrals-onlookers/articleshow/84000224.cms||M K Ananth

Similarly, Varanasi cops also caught a consignment of smuggled liquor of over Rs 20 lakhs. SP Ballia Vipin Tada said, “acting on a tip-off, a team of Kotwali police led by inspector Balmukumd Mishra raided a compound behind a beer shop and seized 2,800 litres of spirit kept in 14 drums. It was followed by another raid in the Sahaspali area where the manufacturing and packing unit was being run by hooch makers.” He added, “1,200 litres of spirit kept in six drums, 51 boxes containing packed liquor bottles, 56 boxes full of bottles with homeopathic chemicals, 120 litres of chemicals used in making hooch, wrappers, empty bottles and other packaging materials in huge quantities were found.” Tada said that four hooch manufacturers — Manoj Chaurasia, Deepak Pasi, Aditya Kumar Gaud and Satish Kumar Verma — were arrested in this connection. To boost the morale of the police team for this achievement, the DIG Azamgarh range gave them a cash reward of Rs 10,000. Meanwhile, in Varanasi Rohania police succeeded in intercepting a truck of liquor smugglers in Khushipur area on national highway-2. SP Varanasi (Rural) Amit Verma said that on getting intelligence inputs regarding movement of liquor smugglers, the cops had launched a massive search drive in the Khushipur area. “During the drive, they stopped an egg-laden truck. When the truck was checked its number plates were found fake after which men in khaki checked the truck thoroughly and boxes of liquor were found hidden beneath eggs,” Verma said. He added, “The driver of the truck, Jasbir Khan of Patiala in Punjab was arrested. Police recovered over 4,500 bottles of liquor packed in 215 boxes from this truck. The cost of recovered liquor was estimated as Rs 20 lakhs. Khan divulged that liquor had been procured from Haryana to deliver in Bihar.” Police are on extra alert in this region of east UP following recent hooch tragedy on Azamgarh-Ambedkarnagar border. After Bihar was declared as a dry state in 2016, the menace of liquor smugglers and hooch manufacturers has increased massively in almost all bordering districts, especially Ballia and Chandauli, of this region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/ballia-varanasi-police-seize-illicit-liquor-4-held/articleshow/84000246.cms||---

He said industrialists have shown an overwhelming response to set up food processing units in the state. The state government has recently decided to set up food processing zones (special economic zones) in every district in an extent of 250 acres. District collectors have been asked to identify land in their respective districts. The committee on food processing zones led by KTR, agriculture minister S Niranjan Reddy, civil supplies minister Gangula Kamalakar and chief secretary Somesh Kumar held a meeting on the food processing units on Wednesday. Officials said basic infrastructure facilities such as roads, electricity, drinking water and common effluent treatment plants would be provided in the food processing zones. Units would be encouraged in paddy, chili, turmeric, millets and edible oils. Processing and storage of fruits and vegetables and marketing facilities would also be provided, TSIIC officials said. KTR said the industries department has prepared a food map for each district based on cultivation of various crops in the respective districts and regions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/good-response-to-food-processing-units-from-industrialists-ktr/articleshow/84004058.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Madurai||Madurai cops look for NGO director as boy goes missing; child trafficking suspected||MADURAI: Police have launched a hunt for the director of a Madurai-based NGO running a home for elderly people who is suspected to have been involved in child trafficking. This follows a police complaint filed by a social activist alleging that the one-year-old son of a destitute woman inmate of the home was sold without the knowledge of the mother after forging documents to show that he had died of Covid-19. A subsequent inquiry by Madurai corporation has found that documents have been forged to make it appear that the boy was buried at the Thathaneri burial ground. Meanwhile, an inquiry by revenue, police, child protection unit and child welfare committee has found that another child, the two-year-old daughter of a destitute woman from Karnataka, has also been missing from the home since June second week. Police teams are looking for the officer-bearers of Idhayam Trust including its director G R Sivakumar. The missing child, Manickam, is the son of Ishwariya, 22, of Sekkipatti in Melur. It was Azarudeen, a social activist from the same village, who admitted her along with her three children to the home run by the trust at Armed Reserve Police ground in March. Azarudeen, who has filed the police complaint, said, “Ishwariya is an orphan who got married to a 65-year-old man who adopted her when she was young. After his death, she faced sexual harassment from the locals. Hence I shifted her to the home thinking she and the children will be safe there.” On June 20, he learnt that her third child Manickam was separated from her a week before and she had not seen him since then. When he contacted Sivakumar, he said that the child tested positive for Covid and was admitted to Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH). On Tuesday noon, Azarudeen was told by the NGO’s volunteers that the boy had died at the hospital in the early hours of the day and that health officials had buried it at Thathaneri burial ground. The mother was not allowed to see the child one last time, but she was taken to the burial ground to do some rituals. The volunteers showed a document of a doctor of Narimedu primary health centre referring the child to GRH, and a permission letter purportedly given by Thathaneri burial ground staff to bury the child, he added. However, when Azarudeen checked with GRH, he found that no such child was admitted there. Alarmed over this, he passed on the information to district collector Aneesh Sekhar, who ordered an inquiry by district child protection unit and Madurai North tahsildar on Tuesday night. A police team led by Tallakulam police inspector Selvakumar joined the inquiry late in the night. Selvakumar said a child missing case was registered on Wednesday based on a complaint from Azarudeen and an inquiry is under way. They suspect that the child was sold to someone after forging documents to show that it died of Covid-19. A team consisting of additional deputy commissioner of police Krishnamoorthy, city health officer Dr Kumaragurubaran and child welfare committee member B Pandiaraja conducted an inquiry at the burial yard. Kumaragurubaran said the document at the burial ground and doctor referral certificate are fake. A complaint has been lodged on behalf of Madurai corporation for forging documents. He said that a girl child was buried at the place where the boy was said to have been buried. Police sources said that an inmate had seen a document made ready for illegal adoption of children. They suspect that Sivakumar and his trust employees could have sold the children. Further information will come out only after arresting Sivakumar, they said. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Timeline - Ishwariya, her three children including missing child Manickam were admitted in home on March 20 - Manickam was separated from his mother on June 13 - NGO said that Manickam died of covid-19 early on June 29 morning - Azaruddin and the child’s mother were informed of the death in the noon - NGO director Sivakumar’s phone switched off at 10.40 pm - An inquiry by officials revealed that two-year-old child also separated from her mother||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cops-look-for-ngo-director-as-boy-goes-missing-child-trafficking-suspected/articleshow/84000229.cms||V Devanathan

A government spokesperson said the complaints received from people were attended to through an integrated grievance redressal system (IGRS). This helps the government to ensure quality check and make it easy for the people to track their complaints. “The CM office has laid emphasis on consumer feedback. During an assessment, it was found that some officials were not doing their work properly. They had not gone into the depth of issues and closed complaints without satisfactorily addressing them,” the spokesperson said. “The CM has said that review of feedback will continue and strict action will be taken against those who are found to be careless in their approach towards complaints being received through the CM Helpline and IGRS,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/cm-asks-why-complaints-of-people-not-addressed/articleshow/84007279.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Two more FIRs filed in fake vaccine scam; Andheri trading unit submits complaint||MUMBAI: Even as two FIRs were recorded in the fraudulent vaccine drive scam on Wednesday, a gold jewellery trading unit from Andheri (E) has written to the police to verify whether a Covid inoculation camp held on its MIDC-Seepz premises for 1,000 staffers was genuine or not. The BMC will carry out an inquiry and accordingly decide to press formal charges. “The trading unit approached us with a written application after reports surfaced in the media about fake vaccine drives. Only 40 of the employees who took shots got certificates, while the rest haven’t even three weeks after the camp. The name of a doctor is cropping up in the probe,” said an officer. BMC officers will check if an MoU was signed between the camp organiser and private Covid vaccination centre as per norms. “We have received a request from MIDC police station and have sent our health staff to the location to verify details,” said Prashant Sapkale, assistant municipal commissioner, K-East ward. If the BMC concludes this drive to be bogus, the total number of fraudulently vaccinated citizens will cross 3,600. On Wednesday, Amboli police registered an FIR in connection with the ‘vaccination’ of 218 employees of Kwan Talent, a talent management platform, on June 4. “Each individual was charged Rs 1,410. No doctors were present for the drive and no vaccine certificates were generated,” said senior inspector Someshwar Kamte. Rajesh Pandey, a former employee of Kokilaben Ambani Hospital, is the prime accused in the FIR. The complaint filed by Kwan Talent’s marketing executive Avinash Bidaye said the accused collected Rs 3.07 lakh between June 1 and 8. On the same day, Samta Nagar police filed an FIR in connection with 618 employees of four different companies being given the jabs in Kandivli (E) on April 23, 24 and 28. TOI had reported about the BMC’s plan to press charges in this case. The police have booked Dr Manish Tripathi, his two students Roshni Patel and Kareem Ali, and another doctor, only identified as Anurag. In the remand application before a magistrate’s court, police said they had found two empty vials of Covishield and one of Covaxin while carrying out a panchnama at Shivam Hospital. The police said they intend to bring Shivam Hospital owners, Dr Shivraj and Neeta Pataria, face-to-face with Tripathi to establish how the vaccines were obtained, where they were stored and where all they were administered. The trio has been sent to police custody till July 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-more-firs-filed-in-fake-vaccine-scam-andheri-trading-unit-submits-complaint/articleshow/84002385.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Goa||62% of Goa’s eligible population has got 1st dose, 15% of them both, says epidemiologist Dr Rajendra Borkar||PANAJI: With an average of 20,000 persons receiving the Covid-19 vaccine every day, the state has already administered the first dose to 62% of its 18+ population, said epidemiologist Dr Rajendra Borkar. Goa has an eligible population of around 11 lakh persons, of which the 62% have received the first dose. “Fifteen percent of them have been fully vaccinated, the response is very good,” he told TOI. The state plans on covering its entire eligible population with the first dose by July 31, he said. The government has enough vaccination centres, and doesn’t plan on adding more. “Ours is not a large population. We already have 46 permanent vaccination centres and 198 satellite centres up to the last point. The centres have enough capacity to vaccinate the people,” he said. “We just need people to come, and elected representatives to bring people out,” he said. “If we find that there are 50-100 persons in a very remote area, we will go and vaccinate them,” he said. Vaccine hesitancy is also being tackled. “We are constantly in touch with religious leaders and opinion makers, trying to convince people to take the vaccine. There’s nothing to be afraid of. Around 32 crore doses have been administered across the country. This should be enough to convince people. It is not a small number and they are doing well. There’s no reason to worry,” he said. During the second wave, a majority of the Covid-19 deaths were unvaccinated. “We found that the severity of the infection in those who were vaccinated with both doses was very low, hospitalisation was also low, and deaths were minimal. This is not just in Goa, but all over India and the world. This has been proved with data,” he said. Vaccination of old-age homes is being conducted by the respective health centres, he said. The issue of door-to-door vaccination for senior citizens or persons with disabilities who are unable to access vaccination centres was raised in the high court when it was hearing a PIL on Covid and preparation for the third wave. The advocate general assured the court that it will see how the issue could be addressed, and will respond before the next hearing on July 12. The high court has directed state authorities to make all-out efforts and ensure that most of the population is vaccinated as early as possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/62-of-states-eligible-popn-has-got-1st-dose-15-of-them-both/articleshow/84002347.cms||---

---||Kochi||Murder accused acquitted after about 21 years||Thrissur: In a significant judgment, Irinjalakuda additional sessions judge on Wednesday acquitted the accused in the murder of an RSS activist, after about 21 years. Judge K S Rajeev acquitted Vinod, 42, who was alleged to have killed RSS leader Rajappan in 2000. The murder took place on October 10, 2000, at Karalam MLA Road, Thrissur. The prosecution alleged that Vinod and Rajappan had gone together to murder one Rajeesh Mupparathy, due to some pre-existing enmity. The prosecution alleged that in the darkness, mistaking Rajappan to be Mupparathy, the accused had allegedly stabbed Rajappan with a sword. According to the prosecution, after the incident, both Vinod and Mupparathy absconded. Rajappan died due to bleeding from his stab injury before reaching a hospital. The case was initially investigated by local police who named Mupparathy as the first accused, Vinod as second accused and one Jobson as the third accused. However, after the CB-CID took over the case, Vinod was made the sole accused and the others were removed from the array of accused. CB-CID arrested Vinod on December 13, 2015, and charged him for murdering Rajappan. The case was registered at Kattoor police station. Later, the case was handed over to a team of 19 officers, including a sub-inspector, three circle inspectors, five DSPs, and ten detective inspectors from CB-CID. The prosecution examined 32 witnesses in the case. Though there were no eyewitnesses to the actual incident, the prosecution examined witnesses who deposed about seeing the accused coming with a sword and later leaving with one. The sword, which was alleged to have been used in the crime, was produced by the prosecution. During the trial, it was revealed that a knife was also recovered from Mupparathy, one of the main witnesses, and this became one of the crucial turning points in the case, said advocate Sarath Babu Kottakkal who had appeared on behalf of the accused. The judge said the prosecution was unable to prove the accused’s guilt beyond doubt and acquitted him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/murder-accused-acquitted-after-about-21-years/articleshow/84000289.cms||T Ramavarman

It would be silly to shut Tito’s as a brand. It has a long and rich legacy,” Ricardo told TOI. He said Club Tito’s—one of the most popular party destinations in the country and an iconic hospitality brand of the state—and Café Mambos would reopen as soon as the pandemic permitted. Ricardo said the family-run group will continue to hold the Tito’s brand and would diversify into alcohol and confectionery market. “We will take Tito’s pan-India and globally,” he said. “I wanted to keep my hands free. There is harassment from police, officials, TCP (town and country planning) and the collector’s office. The staff were being threatened with arrests,” he reiterated. Ricardo and his brother David were running Club Tito’s, Bollywood Discotheque, and Café Mambo—all part of the Tito’s brand—and were also the directors of Tito’s Resorts and Entertainment Ltd, along with their mother Lucille D’Souza. Ricardo said they were exploring production of chocolate in Gujarat, while alcohol would be manufactured and bottled in Goa and Madhya Pradesh. “It will all be under Tito’s Goa brand,” he said. The group already sells Goa’s heritage drink feni under this brand. He also said they have plans to set up shop in Dubai, the UK and Africa, and were exploring the franchise business model for the rest of India. Ricardo dodged queries over who would be the new owners. “The owner doesn’t want to be identified as of now. I can assure everyone that it is not a Punjabi businessman,” he said. He also clarified that none of the employees would lose their jobs as the new management had assured to retain the workers once operations resume. Established by Tito Henry de Souza in 1971, Tito’s Goa was a popular spot for hippies and world travellers looking to escape the chaos of the world. As international tourists flocked to Goa in search of Tito’s, domestic tourists followed, firmly planting Tito’s Goa as the party destination. Over the past two decades, Club Tito’s became the place to be for everyone looking to party the night away on a beach. The move to exit the business came as a surprise to many. Meanwhile, Club LPK owner Nandan Kudchadkar took to social media to announce an “iconic acquisition” which would take it to greater heights. The post sent social media abuzz for the second time this week and prompted many to question whether Kudchadkar had acquired the operations of Club Tito’s and Cafe Mambos. “It is a business transaction and I don’t want to comment,” Kudchadkar told TOI, refusing to confirm or deny the speculation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/titos-brand-to-continue-only-sold-goa-ops-says-co-owner/articleshow/84002377.cms||Newton Sequeira

On Wednesday, party president Jayant Chaudhary set up the election committee which will be headed by Pravin Kumar Singh. Chaudhary said that there is a need for the party to take its work to the people, especially its vision and struggles for the people’s issues. “Many senior people from other political parties are joining RLD. While the joining of established leaders is establishing the political direction of the party, it is also necessary to strengthen the party at the booth level if we have to fight against anti-farmers and anti-development forces,” he said.

Madurai produces the largest amount of loose flowers, which are used in garland making and other forms of decorations. Assistant director of horticulture M Kokhila Sakthi said that the centre plans to promote the cultivation of traditional flowers such as jasmine, ixora, tube rose, nerium, roses, coxcomb and chrysanthemum through demonstration and training processes. Imparting farmers with techniques that would help them produce flowers during non-seasonal periods is part of the plan. For example, if the jasmine farmers were able to produce flowers in November and December, they could benefit in many ways. Madurai district has 2,100 hectares of flower cultivation, of which jasmine is cultivated in 370 hectares in the Thiruparankundram block. A jasmine concrete extraction unit, for demonstration purposes would also be established here. Jasmine concrete was one way in which the farmers could reap benefits, as the unsold flowers could be used for concrete extract. The centre will help farmers learn about the different varieties of the same species of flowers. A vermicompost unit, bio control lab that had produced its first batch of azospirillum and phospho bacteria were the other highlights of the centre, which would be a boon to flower farmers in the region, Kokhila Sakthi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/collector-inspects-centre-for-traditional-flowers/articleshow/84000304.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana HC seeks affidavit on police harassing tribal family||HYDERABAD: Taking a serious view of a complaint of high-handed behavior of Mulakalapalli police on a tribal family that was referred to it by the governor, the Telangana high court on Wednesday directed the state home department and the SP of Bhadradri Kothagudem district to file an affidavit on the episode. The complaint was made by Konduru Eswaramma of Pusugudem hamlet in Mulakalapalli charging the SI of Mulakalapalli with harassing her husband and father-in-law over the ownership of a six-acre land in the village. Stating that though they have absolute rights over the land along with a decree of a civil court, she said police were acting at the behest of their rivals and detaining them for long hours in the police station in a complaint to the governor. “The SI was threatening us at gunpoint to relinquish rights over our land,” she complained. The governor referred the matter to the high court which converted this into a writ petition and appointed senior counsel D Prakash Reddy as an amicus curiae to look into the issue and assist the court. The bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy sought to know from the parties the ground realities in the case. Prakash Reddy contended that there were serious discrepancies between the facts of the case and the contents in the general diary of the police. “The allegation that there were threats by police seems to be correct,” he said. The bench too said that they can make out from the record that the SP who initially was disinclined to interfere in this dispute which is civil in nature had later interfered. “The SI too was frequently calling the family members of Eswaramma but not the ones who made the rival claims on the same land,” the bench said. The case was posted to September 1 for further hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-seeks-affidavit-on-police-harassing-tribal-family/articleshow/84002394.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Hyderabad||Why can’t assembly seats go up in Telangana on the lines of J&K: TRS||HYDERABAD: With the Election Commission of India (ECI) taking up the exercise of increasing the number of assembly constituencies in Jammu and Kashmir, the TRS is also raking up the issue of enhancing the number of assembly seats in Telugu states as per the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has been demanding the Centre to increase the number of constituencies in the state from the existing 119 to 153. He had even broached the topic with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah during his earlier visits to Delhi and written letters to the ministry of home affairs to take the initiative to increase the number of seats. But, the Centre has been reluctant arguing that the next delimitation exercise is due only after 2026. “The Centre talks about ‘one nation-one rule’ but takes up the delimitation exercise in J&K. Why cannot they apply the same yardstick to Telangana and enhance the assembly seats which is a long-pending demand,” Telangana State Planning Board vice-chairman and former MP B Vinod Kumar sought to know. Official sources said as per section 26 (1) the Reorganisation Act, the number of seats in the legislative assembly of the successor states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana should have been increased from 175 and 119 to 225 and 153 respectively. As per the exiting provisions, delimitation of constituencies can be taken up after 2026 census. For taking up the exercise now, the Centre will need to carry out amendments to Articles 82 and 170 of the Constitution. Congress senior leader Marri Shashidhar Reddy has also found fault with the ECI. “The commission had transferred seven mandals of Telangana to AP in 2018 just before the assembly elections, which was unconstitutional. Without carrying out a delimitation exercise, how can the ECI transfer voters of one state to another before an election. It was mainly to benefit KCR in the 2018 elections,” Shashidhar Reddy charged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/why-cant-assembly-seats-go-up-in-t-on-the-lines-of-jk-trs/articleshow/84004139.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Madurai||Home in Madurai under lens for child trafficking was unregistered||MADURAI: The home for elderly run by Idhayam Trust, which is under the lens of authorities following charges of child trafficking, did not have the mandatory approval of the social welfare department. Though situated in the heart of the city, in a building owned by Madurai corporation, its inmates were lodged in cramped rooms and in unhygienic circumstances. The inmates are now being shifted by the social welfare department to other homes in the city. There were 73 inmates of all ages including 35 women and seven children at the home. Social welfare department officials said except for 25 inmates, who require special care due to old age and health-related issues, others were shifted. They are looking for beds for the remaining people in suitable homes who will also be treated in government hospitals before shifting. Officials said there were only a few rooms at the home but they accommodated about 80 inmates. There were five toilets though ideally there should have been eight. Many who required medical attention were not taken care of. “We could not spend much time inside the building due to the stink emanating from the rooms where the inmates stayed. They were forced to stay in cramped spaces and sleep very close to each other. Most of them slept on the floor and under the beds,” said an official. An inmate from the home said, “We are not allowed to go outdoors. We were not supplied with proper food and often only porridge was provided. Sometimes volunteers and staff working with the NGO also beat those who wanted to go out”. There were five staff at the trust, who were paid between 8,000 and 12,500. The NGO has received donations from people in Madurai and outside to run it. Two of the volunteers had received the Chief Minister’s State Youth Award recently. The city police have seized the trust’s attendance register, computers and a bunch of permission slips provided at burial grounds and crematoriums in connection with the child missing case. Social welfare department officials said only three homes run by government and 12 run by private people have licence. Many homes are functioning without licence or renewing their licence. A drive would be conducted soon to check them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/home-under-lens-for-child-trafficking-was-unregistered/articleshow/84000290.cms||V Devanathan

They are meant for use in heavy water reactors for the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd , said a senior AM/NS official. In line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ vision, this has been developed in collaboration with Larsen & Toubro Ltd, the official said. These special steel plates were shipped after a flagging-off ceremony at AM/NS India’s Hazira steel plant on June 29. “This is the first time that a domestic supplier has been able to meet the high raw material and manufacturing criteria laid down by NPCIL for critical-class equipment of this grade. Previously, such plates were acquired from overseas.”  He added: “Due to a historical lack of specialist manufacturing capability among domestic plate mills, India’s nuclear programme has always imported critical alloy steel grades from Europe.” 16Mo3-grade plates are among the most critical internal components of steam generators, operating under extreme temperature, pressure and radioactive conditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/first-indigenous-alloy-for-n-plants-ready/articleshow/84000297.cms||---

The victim was identified as Shalom Sheeba and the accused, Marimuthu, 45, a shepherd. The family had converted to Christianity a few years ago. Sheeba fell in love with S Muthuraj, 22, a daily wage worker of the same village. Though both of them belong to the same caste, their parents opposed their affair due to their different faiths. Nevertheless, they got married last year after the girl turned 18. Though the couple lived separately, Sheeba used to visit her mother once in a while when her father was not at home. Marimuthu was upset as family and friends made fun of him over his daughter’s elopement and marriage. Unable to bear the criticism he asked his daughter not to come to his house. On Tuesday, there was a temple festival in the village till late in the night. Sheeba informed her husband that she wanted to see her family and went over to her parents’ place around 3 am. An argument broke out between the father and daughter and, in a fit of rage, he attacked her on the head and hand with a machete. Horrified over the incident, others raised an alarm and alerted villagers. The girl was rushed to the Tirunelveli government medical college and hospital and was under intensive care for a few hours before she died. Uthumalai police secured Marimuthu and booked him for attempt to murder initially which was later altered to murder under section 302 of IPC. He was produced before a judicial magistrate in Tenkasi and remanded at Palayamkottai central prison in Tirunelveli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/man-hacks-daughter-to-death-over-inter-faith-love-marriage/articleshow/84000323.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Schools citing excuses to deny entry to EWS kids, say parents||NEW DELHI: Although deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia has asked schools to admit children under the economically weaker section (EWS) category, parents are having a tough time. Schools are often refusing these children citing spelling mistakes in the admission form, problems with date of birth and absence of income certificates despite submitting BPL ration cards. Some schools are also turning them away saying no general category admission has taken place yet. Mamta, whose child has been admitted to a senior secondary school in Mayur Vihar, had submitted the BPL card as the proof of income, but the school insisted on an income certificate. “I have even applied for the certificate, but it takes time. I told the school to accept my application with an undertaking, but they are not agreeing,” said Mamta, a resident of Trilokpuri whose husband works as a labourer. The school has also asked for a medical certificate of the child. A circular issued by the directorate of education for admissions categorically states, “The school shall not ask for income certificate from those EWS category parents who submit a copy of BPL/AAY/food security card issued by the food and civil supply department, GNCT of Delhi.” Amir, a vegetable vendor, can’t admit his child to the nursery class at a private school in Vasundhara Enclave as there is a mistake in the form. “I can’t use a computer and the form was filled up at a camp set up by an NGO. Instead of 2017, my child’s date of birth was typed as 2018. Now the school is saying that my child does not fit the age criteria. I have the birth certificate, still they are saying the admission will be cancelled,” said Amir. As per the circular, the school can only cancel an admission if a valid proof of date of birth is not submitted. Azad’s story is no different. The resident of Mehrauli, who works at a small shop, has been visiting a school in Vasant Kunj for several days as his child has been allotted a seat in the nursery class. Every time he is told that he would have to wait till the general category seats are filled. “First time I went they said they had just six general category admissions, then two days ago, they said it was eight. I don’t know if my turn will come at all,” said Azad, who has been taking breaks from work to visit the school. Ekramul Haque of NGO Mission Taleem, who has been helping such parents, says the government needs to create a monitoring committee to check violations. “It should not be difficult to constitute a district committee to look into these violations,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/schools-citing-excuses-to-deny-entry-to-ews-kids-say-parents/articleshow/84049996.cms||Shradha Chettri

Senior officials in the Madurai railway division said that train movement was suspended on all three occasions as the sensors installed on the bridge by IIT Chennai to check its stability indicated undue stress on certain portions of the metal structure. However, they turned out to be false alarms on all three occasions. Traffic was first suspended on June 17 and 18. It was suspended for the second time on Tuesday before train movement resumed that night. The third suspension was announced on Wednesday morning and will be in effect till Thursday evening. “It turned out to be a false alarm on all three instances. But we cannot take any chances for any alert. So our high level team and experts from IIT inspected the bridge and found that there was no undue pressure,” said a senior official. Officials said that the sensors send data to the server in IIT Chennai, where it is analysed and alerted to the railways. They suspected that the alert could have been triggered due to a reporting problem from the sensors to the server in Chennai. The alerts were in a different member of the track in different spans on the bridge. Physical verification showed that there was no undue stress, following which train services resumed. On Wednesday, the division announced suspension of rail services between Pamban and Mandapam. Train no. 06849 and 06850 Trichy – Rameswaram – Trichy and Train No. 06852 Rameswaram – Chennai Egmore on Thursday will be operated only from and till Mandapam.

---||Ahmedabad||Refund development fee: HC to power cos||Ahmedabad: The power companies in state may have to refund huge amounts to consumers, which were collected between 2011 and 2014 towards infrastructure development. This is because the Gujarat High Court on Wednesday allowed appeals and upheld a decision of electricity ombudsman that collection of such infrastructure development charge was not legal. One of the appellants was Sola’s Ashwamegh Cooperative Housing Society Ltd, which paid Rs 16.55 lakh to the Uttar Gujarat Vij Co Ltd in 2013 when the developers launched a scheme of bungalows. The consumers had to obtain power connections because the development of projects was not possible without it, and the power companies used to charge for providing connections. Later, many developers challenged the levy on the ground that the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission had prohibited it. The Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum rejected such challenges, but the electricity ombudsman held that the power companies could not have charged so and directed for refund. The power companies approached the high court which quashed the ombudsman’s order for refund. The issue was taken before a division bench, which quashed the single judge’s order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/refund-development-fee-hc-to-power-cos/articleshow/84000375.cms||---

Exactly 11 months after clearing a Rs 10,000 loan taken under the Prime Minister Street Vendor’s Atmanirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) scheme, Pasha has not only been promised another Rs 20,000 to his account, but will also get a rare opportunity to interact with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the radio programme, ‘Mann Ki Baat’ soon, officials said. Pasha, who lost his livelihood during the pandemic, applied for the loan in August and once it was cleared, set up a tea stall. “They called me last Saturday and I shot back, why are you asking me about the loan, I have already cleared it. So please don’t harass me. But they in turn asked me to make a video and send it,” Pasha, a junior college dropout told TOI. Within a few minutes, officials from the Mission for Elimination of Poverty in Municipal Areas (MEPMA) of Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation (GWMC) visited his tea stall and asked Pasha about a possible call from the PMO office. “They informed me that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will interact with me.

Today, even as consulting physicians with MD degrees are present in all corners of the city, hundreds still visit these small clinics that has the bare minimum furniture: a table, a couple of chairs, and an examination table hidden behind a white curtain. These health facilities are run by MBBS doctors who braved all hardships during the pandemic to serve people in some of the most underprivileged neighbourhoods. Dr Jaswantsinh Darbar, a GP from Maninagar and former president of Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA), said that there might be about 250-odd GPs above 55 years still practising in Ahmedabad. “We have been working without break ever since the start of the pandemic.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Average maximum temperature in June lowest in last four years||NEW DELHI: After Delhi witnessed drizzling, partly cloudy skies and easterly winds on most of the days of the month, this June recorded the lowest mean maximum temperature at 38.3 degrees Celsius in the last four years. The average monthly temperature remained below the normal temperature, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD). However, a delayed monsoon led to a rain deficit of 47% in June. A total of 34.8 mm rainfall was received in the month while the normal rainfall for June is 65.5 mm. The normal mean maximum temperature for June is 39.2 degrees Celsius. The mean minimum temperature was recorded at 25.9 degrees Celsius. IMD data shows that at 37.7 degrees Celsius, the mean maximum temperature in June 2017 was lower than June 2021. A weatherman said the mercury largely remained below normal in June and the temperatures witnessed a rising trend in the past four days. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD, said, “Safdarjung station, the city’s base station, recorded seven rainy days in this month while some stations witnessed slight rain on other days too. Due to very light rain, partly cloudy skies and easterly winds, the maximum temperatures mostly remained below the normal. As the adjoining areas of Delhi received rain, the temperature did not rise because of the cloudiness. Due to the delay in monsoon and clear skies, the mercury started rising in the last four days.” IMD had earlier predicted that the onset of monsoon may happen in Delhi on June 15. However, the onset of monsoon slowed down and crossed its normal date of arrival of June 27. IMD on Wednesday said the arrival of monsoon was unlikely to happen over the next six-seven days. Though the meteorological department had been predicting rain on some days in the second half of the month, isolated drizzle activity has been mostly reported in the last few days. “The delay in the onset of monsoon affected the rain activity. There has been a rain deficit as the monsoon did not progress as expected,” said a Met official. In June 2020, 81.8 mm rainfall was recorded after an early onset of monsoon. The rain in June last year was a surplus of 25% and 13 rainy days were recorded. The monsoon arrived in Delhi on June 25 last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/average-max-temp-in-june-lowest-in-last-four-years/articleshow/84000557.cms||---

This was when medical experts of every field rushed in offer their services selflessly to help the poor and needy patients at government hospitals. Around 60 surgeons and super specialists have been taking a couple of hours off daily from their scheduled private practices to dedicate their services in New Civil Hospital (NCH), Surat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research (SMIMER) and Samras Hostel. While already being preoccupied with their responsibilities in different private hospitals, these ‘saviours’ wanted to do a little extra by serving at the public hospitals. The endeavour didn’t end with the ebbing tide of the second wave, but have assured of continuing to support the government hospital even if another wave happens to hit. “We were discussing in a group that we should do something to help people. We discussed this with senior doctors in government hospitals and they accepted our offer,” said Dr Nisarg Patel, a gastroenterologist. Many such small groups of doctors approached the government hospitals and offered their services when Covid cases started to rise uncontrollably, practically keeping the doctors on their feet for over 25 days while trying to arrest the rapid spread of infection. “We divided the group of doctors into core and non-core groups. They were given duties as per their experience and expertise,” said Dr Bhavin Bhuva, a surgeon. Bhuva along with few other doctors associated with RSS formed the group to organise the activity. The group of doctors were assigned different work at the hospitals as per their area of work. The doctors also started to counsel patients who were panicking due to the prolonged treatment. “We not only examined patients, but also shared knowledge with junior doctors. We tried to share information about the latest treatment methods,” said Dr Bhavesh Kacha, an anesthetist. “Like other doctors in the group, I went to the hospital daily for two hours and helped other doctors and patients. All doctors willingly contributed for a good cause,” said Dr Jinesh Purohit, a nephrologist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/leading-docs-to-go-on-serving-in-govt-hosps/articleshow/83996112.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Shot jeweller was out of town, reopened store four days ago||MUMBAI: In less than 10 minutes of opening the shutters of his Dahisar based jewellery store on Wednesday, a jeweller was shot dead from close range by one of three masked men that had barged in. Though the men carried away several trays of gold jewellery with them, police do not believe robbery was their intention. CCTVs in the shop clearly captured the assailant fire at jeweller, Shailendra Pandey, 37, before he and his aides could loot the establishment. The incident sent shockwaves among shopowners' at Dahisar's Rawalpada where Pandey's Om Sai Raj Jewellers is located. Pandey was running the shop, largely alone, in a rented premises for the past nine years. His cousin would assist him sometimes. At 10.06 am on Wednesday, as captured on camera, Pandey opened the shutter and stepped into the shop. He finished a pooja and was about to clean the store before starting business. Minutes later, three masked men entered inside, shot him and walked out at 10.14 am with two heavy bags of stolen gold. "I heard two shots and initially presumed the tin shed above our shops had collapsed," said Shivam Mishra, who runs a mobilephone store next door. "There was a commotion and people started to gather. By the time I entered the jewellery store, the assailants had vanished. Pandey had slumped on the ground, with his back facing us. I dialled the police emergency number '100' but couldn't get through. So I rushed to the Dahisar police station and brought the police with me," Mishra added. Relatives said about 20 to 30 tolas of gold was robbed. Pandey apparently had an electronic lock on the door of his shop and would check who was at the door before unlocking it. But on Wednesday, the assailants got in before the jeweller had a chance to activate the electronic lock. Police said the three assailants had arrived on a scooter; the rider wore no helmet and was dressed in a white kurta and blue denim. Witnesses said the scooter's numberplate was dented. The police have started looking into all possible motives including a property dispute or a financial feud. "Shailendra had never mentioned rivalry with anyone or being threatened. We used to talk frequently," a relative, KD Dubey, said, adding that Pandey was a sole breadwinner. He is survived by his wife and two teenaged sons. Police believe the assailants may have kept a watch on Pandey's movements. "Shailendra had resumed business only four days ago. He had travelled to his hometown during the lockdown-like restrictions to look after his ailing father," said a relative. Pandey's body was taken to the JJ Hospital's post mortem centre for an autopsy. Two rounds were fired in the shop; one hit him under his right eye, officials said. The Dahisar police registered a case of murder and are making inquiries with traders from whom Pandey procured jewellery for his shop. The crime branch has begun a parallel enquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-shot-jeweller-was-out-of-town-reopened-store-four-days-ago/articleshow/84002571.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Mukul Goel new DGP, may take charge today||LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday appointed Mukul Goel as the new director general of police (DGP). He succeeds Hitesh Chandra Awasthy, who retired from the service on Wednesday. Goel, a 1987-batch IPS officer, was on the central deputation, serving as ADG, Border Security Force (BSF), before taking over the top post in UP Police. He served as ADG, Law and Order, during Muzaffarnagar riots, replacing Arun Kumar in September 2013. Sources in the home department said Goel left for Delhi in the evening to hand over the charge of the ADG (BSF) and is likely to assume office on Thursday. As reported by TOI on Wednesday, the UPSC has sent a panel of three names, including Goel, Nasir Kamal, who is posted as director, National Institute of Criminology and Forensic Science, New Delhi; and RP Singh, DG, Economic Offence Wing (EOW) in UP. As expected, the government selected Goel to head one of the biggest police forces in the world. Earlier, the outgoing DGP handed over the charge to ADG, law and order, Prashant Kumar as the final formality of his retirement. A tweet from the CM’s office said DGP Awasthy retired after a successful service of 36 years. During his long tenure, the officer showed good leadership skills and righteousness, the tweet said and appreciated his contribution in Covid-19 management in the state. His contribution as a member of Team-9 has been commendable, the post said. Goel, a BTech in electronics from IIT-Delhi and an MBA, has handled communally sensitive districts during his stints as the police chief of Saharanpur, Meerut and Azamgarh. He has also served as deputy inspector general of police (DIG) in Agra and Kanpur range. During the SP regime between 2003-2007, Goel, as DIG, Agra range, Goel was the head of police recruitment board there. However, the entire recruitment exercise in 2005-06 for appointment of over 22,500 constables landed in troubled waters when Mayawati took over as the CM in 2007 and ordered a probe into the recruitments. In all, 14 IPS officers had been indicted in the case. After coming to power in 2012, however, the SP government withdrew all the cases related to the alleged scam. Goel replaced then ADG (law and order) Arun Kumar when he sought central deputation in September 2013.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mukul-goel-new-dgp-may-take-charge-today/articleshow/84002561.cms||---

The incident came to light after Christuraj, one of the owners of the dog, released the brutal video of the dog being clubbed to death on Facebook. The video shows the dog, tied by its neck to the hook of a boat’s fishing bait, being beaten with heavy sticks by three persons. The incident happened on Monday morning. Inspector G Ramesh, station house officer, Vizhinjam police, said that the police have registered a case invoking relevant sections pertaining to cruelty to animals. “However, we have not taken the accused into custody yet as it turns out that the offenders, the youth seen in the video attacking the dog, are all under the age of 18 years,” the inspector said. The dog, a black labrador named Bruno, was jointly raised by eight siblings who resided in houses next to each other. The complaint was filed by Sony P, sister of Christuraj. They brought up the dog together for the last eight years. Sony said that they were devastated by what happened to Bruno. “He had been with us for eight years. Our kids played with him and he would eat from all our houses. He was family to us. It was recently that he started going to the beach. Usually he would go and return by noon,” said Sony. Martin, one of the siblings, bought Bruno at the age of one. Since then, he had been with the family. Sony said that his leash would break easily and they were planning to buy a new one once the lockdown was lifted. When Bruno went missing on Monday morning, Andrew, Sony’s brother-in-law went in search of the dog. He found their pet being clubbed by a group of youths at the beach. He couldn’t confront them as he was outnumbered. He was told that Bruno came running from the beach and lay under the fishing boat and they beat the dog. As Andrew looked on, the youths hurled the dead dog into the sea. Although the complaint was filed on Tuesday, police have not taken any action, Sony said. “We came to know that they were burying the matter with the help of one of the relatives employed at coastal police station nearby. We felt we wouldn’t get justice and we took to Facebook so that everyone would know what happened to our Bruno,” said Sony. After they filed a police complaint, the youths came to their house with iron rods and threatened them that they too would suffer the fate of their dog, she added.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana high court seeks report on waqf assets||HYDERABAD: The high court on Wednesday directed the Waqf Board and Rangareddy district collector to conduct a joint survey of waqf properties to ascertain the extent of encroachment in the district, where most waqf assets were under the occupation of encroachers, and submit a report by August 18. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy gave this direction while hearing a PIL filed by Mohd Babar Qureshi of Hyderabad, who contended that the waqf officials along with the authorities of the minority welfare department were keeping mum over slipping away of waqf properties into the hands of outsiders. “There is a House committee report that says that most waqf assets in Rangareddy district need to be recovered from the third parties and restored to the Waqf Board,” the petitioner said, seeking implementation of the recommendations made by the committee as early as in January 1997. However, in a strange turn of eventsss, the petitioner’s counsel sought permission from the court to withdraw the case in the last hearing. The bench did not allow it. It also asked him to make revenue and other relevant departments as parties to the case because they have to assist the board in getting its assets back.  Revenue department’s counsel C V Bhaskar Reddy informed the court that the petitioner did not serve even copies of his petition to him so far. On Wednesday, when the matter came up again, the counsel for the petitioner sought time to implead the revenue department. The bench reminded him that it asked him to do so in the previous hearing itself. Waqf Board counsel Abu Akram told the bench that they wrote five letters to the Rangareddy district collector to help them in this regard, but did not get any response from him. The bench expressed its despair over the state of affairs and directed the revenue and Waqf Board to conduct a joint inspection and furnish them a report by August 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/survey-waqf-assets-in-rr-submit-report-by-aug-18-hc/articleshow/84000459.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

---||Surat||Inform about Covid symptoms or face action, Surat doctors told||SURAT: Even as the number of Covid-19 cases are decreasing, the Surat district administration is gearing up to tackle a possible third wave. District collector Aayush Oak has directed all medical practitioners to make a flu corner to screen every patient having suspected Covid-19 symptoms and submit details of such people with the health officials. The circular issued by the collector warns of legal action against doctors who don’t follow the directive. Those doctors not adhering to the notification will be booked under IPC section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and section 269 (unlawful or negligent act likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life). The control room of the district health department will monitor the data being submitted by private practitioners that include homeopath and Ayurveda doctors. “All registered medical practitioners (including allopathic, Ayurveda, homeopath and other practices allowed by AYUSH ministry, Government of India) have to establish a flu corner and details of every patient coming to their clinic, hospital or dispensary should be medically screened and his/her record should be maintained as per format given,” the notification states. It further states that irrespective of whether the patient mentions symptoms associated with Covid-19 or not, any person having travel history outside the district or body temperature more than 37.7 degree Celsius or pulse rate more than 85 per minute (with clinical correlation) or SPO2 less than 93% should be reported to local health authorities immediately. All medical practitioners have been instructed to share the information to district surveillance officers through e-mail within 24 hours of screening of patients. The order also authorizes chief district health officer (CDHO) and police officer above the rank of police sub-inspector to take necessary actions. The collector claimed that the directives issued to set up flu corner are as per the government’s orders. “Every doctor is supposed to follow it strictly. This will help us identify a patient early, treat him and isolate to prevent spread of infection,” Oak told TOI.  “Administration will take legal actions if anyone is found not complying with the orders,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/inform-about-covid-symptoms-or-face-action-docs-told/articleshow/83996256.cms||---

He has also trained 100 doctors for Telangana Covid-19 task force. Dr Luqman Ahmed Khan has also been preparing awareness videos on Covid-19 and posting them on social media. He has taken up epidemiological studies too. Dr Luqman, a family physician, explains to his patients in detail the do’s and don’ts one should do when infected by the coronavirus and when to seek hospitalisation. His videos have become quite popular on social media. An expert in diagnosis rare diseases and end stage disease management, Dr Luqman has given free medical counselling online to at least 4000 patients so far. “As a doctor, my experience has been not only vividly clinical but also dishearteningly social, especially after personal retrospective, while analysing types of cases, causes of death and their social impact,” Dr Luqman told TOI. Explaining the types of Covid-19 cases he encounters often, Dr Luqman said while Covid-19 cases with common symptoms are diagnosed earlier and treated well, patients with no usual signs and symptoms of Covid-19, though less in number, end up with severe complications leading to death. Dr Luqman saved many such patients by identifying the symptoms early. “In my view from the perspective of epidemiology these asymptomatic carriers are mainly spreaders of coronavirus and with varied variants of the pathogen too. Identifying them at the early stage will help save lives,” he said. He adds that diseases don’t wear watches, even though normal course of disease timings and reports are documented in textbooks. Relying on them is maturity, but blinding other factors is not judicious.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/physician-lends-healing-touch-online-to-thousands-across-india/articleshow/84001251.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Hyderabad||Covid warrior doctors sacrificed their well being for patients||HYDERABAD: While most professionals are taking a break to recover after a bout of Covid-19, several doctors have continued to serve patients over the past one year, even when they are on quarantine. Many doctors remained in touch with their patients, provided counselling to patients and their attendees, oversaw their treatment, or gave a second opinion as and when it was required even when they themselves were down with Covid-19. “I was aware that people can’t wait to get advice and treatment as they are suffering. So, I was available for the first four days after testing positive for Covid-19,” said Dr Ahmed Abdul Khabeer, associate professor, Gandhi Medical College and added that with Gandhi Hospital being the nodal centre for Covid-19, they had hundreds of patients who needed advice, opinion, or wanted to discuss their treatment. Dr Khabeer said that doctors knew they might eventually contract infection despite taking all precautions as they were working closely with patients. “It was a difficult phase. All my family members—including my elderly parents, wife, and my kids tested positive. After the fourth day, my condition deteriorated and I was admitted to ICU... I was discharged after two weeks and tested negative on day 17. The next day, I resumed work as I did not want to take a break,” he added. Doctors said that patients start forming a bond with their doctor as any change could make them tense and have a psychological impact. “I started showing symptoms on Ramzan. I got tested and was Covid-19 positive. By then, I had 12-15 patients under my care, some of them in ICU. I immediately got in touch with my patients and their attenders and conveyed to them that their treatment will not get affected in any way,” said Dr Aftab Ahmed, senior consultant physician, Apollo Hospital, Secunderabad, adding that he had a mild infection and continued to oversee his patients’ treatment while recovering. Dr Sarika Pandya, consultant neurologist at Asian Institute of Nephrology and Urology, Banjara Hills said that she continued to be available for her patient on phone adding that in case she felt any of her patients needed to go to hospital, she referred them to her colleagues. Doctors, who were down with severe infection, meanwhile, had no option to treat patients. “I was in ICU for 15 days and in hospital for 20-25 days as I had severe Covid-19,” said Dr Satish Rao, cardiologist at NIMS. “Soon after I recovered, I joined back as I know that I will be able to help patients as I have a better perspective now and know exactly how it feels to get Covid-19 and aware of challenges during treatment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-warrior-docs-sacrificed-their-well-being-for-patients/articleshow/84001124.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Dr Anand Ahuja, a cardiologist, would sometimes throw up his hands in despair as the number of patients kept growing with every passing day. While many doctors retired for the night after a tiring day, Ahuja let his creative juices flow to regain his energy. He took solace in poetry and penned down short stories too amid the Covid wave between May and September last year. Moreover, his books on collection of poems and short stories got published and hit the book stores recently. “It was one of the gloomiest times as I saw people suffering and crying in the hospital as they had to stay away from their loved ones for many days. I had to remain optimistic to perform my duty,” Ahuja told TOI.  “So, I started penning down poems on romance and desire. After working for about 15 hours a day, I used to return home and spend some time with my parents. Then I spent nights writing poems and short stories,” Ahuja said. When asked if he didn’t feel exhausted, 42-year-old Ahuja said, “No. Even a few hours of sleep was enough for me. After penning down some gripping stories and romantic poems, I used to be full of energy the next day.”  “In fact, the positivity and spirit of poetry helped me in fighting off the virus and treating my patients effectively,” Ahuja, who is a director in Rhythm Heart Institute, added. While Ahuja’s book on his collection of 34 poems is named Dusty Memories Unfinished, the book on short stories is titled ‘A Story to Tell’. Much to his joy, Ahuja’s book Dusty Memories Unfinished also made it to the fifth position in the national list in poetry category on Amazon. “The poems are about unrequited love, romance and longing for someone whom we once loved a lot but couldn’t be together with. The stories have some thrill and drama. In fact, one of the stories is of a Covid patient in the US who dreamt to be buried next to his ex-lover,” Ahuja revealed. But he isn’t done yet. Ahuja is coming up with the second edition of his book ‘A Story to Tell’ later this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/poetry-propelled-this-doctor-to-combat-covid-pandemic/articleshow/83998786.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Hyderabad||Revive family doctor system as point of first contact to ease burden on hospitals||The once upon a time ubiquitous ‘family doctor/general practitioner (GP)’ concept has almost disappeared and become extinct in the country. Most ‘worried well’ who are asymptomatic, and equally, those with minor common ailments rush to hospitals, which are already overwhelmed with sick patients. According to a report published by the Medical Council of India in 2020, around 44,000 postgraduate seats are available for 55,000 doctors who graduate every year. In other words, the vast majority will become specialists. It is indeed an irony that the new MBBS curriculum does not even include a mention about the family medicine/GP concept in its voluminous 890 page document. There are not many applicants for the family medicine DNB postgraduate courses conducted by the National Board of Examinations because the number of centres accredited to train doctors wishing to pursue a career as a family physician, are few and far between. The concept of visiting the family doctor/GP before a patient sees a specialist is the standard practice in the UK’s National Health Service (NHS). The GP is the principal treating doctor who manages most minor issues sensibly based upon evidence and refers patients to specialist centres only when needed. An effective primary care sorts the serious from the non-serious by speedy and accurate diagnosis, directs hospital referrals to the most appropriate specialty and ensures that expensive hospital resources are expended on those who will benefit the most. The ongoing pandemic has brought to sharp focus the huge inadequacies in our already fragile healthcare system. India must invest in training GPs in addition to popularising and sensitising young impressionable students who have joined MBBS course about the family medicine concept. Furthermore, primary healthcare infrastructure in rural India (where more than 70% of our population resides) must be strengthened so that more patients are served locally by GPs, thus obviating the arduous and time consuming task of traveling long distances for assessment or treatment. It is time to make primary health care in India more innovative, inclusive, collaborative and sustainable. General practitioners must be “gatekeepers” of our healthcare system. They should be the first point of contact for patients for any sickness or preventive visit. The UK’s NHS model of providing universal primary health care through public-private partnership (PPP) may be appropriate for adaptation in the Indian context. Most healthcare in India is provided by the private sector and there is a robust potential for private sector involvement in improving primary health care delivery in the country. On Doctor’s Day, it is my heartfelt desire that the Government of India and powers that be initiate concrete and implementable measures to ensure that ‘Family Doctor’ concept is revived. An important component of the Hippocratic Oath is to “keep the good of the patient as the highest priority” and this landmark step would pave the path in this direction by ensuring well controlled uniform effective healthcare to the citizenry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/revive-family-doctor-system-as-point-of-first-contact-to-ease-burden-on-hospitals/articleshow/84001167.cms||Dr P Raghu Ram

---||Hyderabad||Health experts call for more RT-PCR tests in Telangana||HYDERABAD: Telangana’s impressive testing is more dependent on rapid antigens kits, which doctors say is a less accurate method of testing and have called for more RT-PCR tests. Raising an alert on the need to ramp up the more reliable mode of testing — RT-PCR — experts said that Telangana is at a crucial junction now with all lockdown restrictions being lifted. “RT-PCR test is considered to be the gold standard because it has a miniscule chance of a false negative. We have asked the government to increase RT-PCR tests several times since the pandemic started but it is yet to happen. The state needs to increase this method of testing to ideally 50 per cent to have more accurate results,” said Dr K Mahesh Kumar, president Healthcare Reforms Doctors Association (HRDA). An analysis of the Covid-19 tests done in the first three weeks of June, shows that 91 per cent of the total 24.6 lakh tests done were rapid antigen tests (RAT) and only 9 per cent were RT-PCRs. In fact, in certain districts up to 99 per cent of tests were done by RAT method. This was revealed in a report by the state health department. Since RAT tests can give immediate results (within an hour) and has correct estimation of positives but a high number of false negatives, the testing method was promoted to find the positive cases quickly. While recent guidelines from the Centre have asked states to rely more on RAT tests in rural areas, symptomatic patients testing negative are required to be tested again by RT-PCR. This is also the state’s SOP but has not been put into practice so far. The report further showed that among all the districts in the state, Nirmal — with 99.45 percent RAT tests had highest percentage of such tests. The district has only 0.55 per cent RT-PCR tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/health-experts-call-for-more-rt-pcr-tests-in-telangana/articleshow/84001363.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||Lucknow||Genome sequencing begins at KGMU to track Covid mutations||LUCKNOW: The King George’s Medical University (KGMU) has started the process of genome sequencing to find out if mutations of novel coronavirus are circulating in the state. The technology to conduct sequencing has been outsourced to an international company which is an expert in the field. The programme was officially launched virtually on Wednesday. Once completed, the outcome will help the state government make preparations to combat mutated strains of the virus and find out how medical drugs and vaccines can be effective against it. However, this area will not be covered by KGMU, as of now. Headed by KGMU’s microbiology department, the process for sequencing began on Saturday. “The objective is not to find a specific thing in novel coronavirus and its variants, but look for everything around mutations,” head of microbiology department, Prof Amita Jain, said. Since the number of probable Covid-19 positive samples has gone down recently, the number of samples to be used for genome sequencing has not been decided. There is, however, a scientific process to evaluate which sample should be sent for best results. “Whatever samples come to our lab, we will send them to the international service provider for technological process. We will, however, samples against a scientific evaluation protocol. Currently, CDRI is also undertaking genome sequencing in the state to find out the number and nature of mutations prevalent,” she added. The process is not time-bound since the frequency of samples to be tested cannot be fixed in the current downward Covid-19 trend. Genome sequencing is an advanced technology which helps scientists identify mutations in a virus, how that mutation changes the characteristic of a virus and how the knowledge of DNA and genes of a virus can be used for better treatment and other medical implications. It has previously been used to study other virus mutations, to know different changes in cancer and its progression and in studying human DNA and genetic diseases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/genome-sequencing-begins-at-kgmu-to-track-covid-mutations/articleshow/84002654.cms||---

Under Mission June, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had set a target of inoculating at least 1 crore people. The target was met on June 24. In the remaining six days, more than 21.7 lakh Covid-19 vaccinations have taken place. Now, the state has set the target to vaccinate 10 crore beneficiaries over next three months. That would take around 10-12 lakh vaccinations per day. The numbers could have been much higher but for a dip in the vaccine supply towards the end of the month, say health department sources. After June 24, when 8.63 lakh vaccinations were done, the number went down to 5.54 lakh the next day. The drive picked up again on Monday when 5.23 lakh vaccinations were undertaken but went down again to just 1.88 lakh on Tuesday. Just 67,000 persons were inoculated on the last day of the drive which had maintained a good pace over the first three weeks. Meanwhile, the total number of vaccinations undertaken in the state so far reached 3.12 crore. Over 2.67 crore of them have taken the first dose while 44.88 lakh are fully vaccinated. In terms of the age group, 1.17 crore persons in the 18 to 44 years have taken the vaccine while 1.13 crore persons have taken the vaccine in the 45 to 60 year age bracket.

With the monsoon not expected to arrive in the next six days, it is expected that the power demand in the capital would soon breach the 7,000MW mark after two years. The delayed monsoon and the hot and humid weather have resulted in a surge in the demand. The monsoon is not expected in Delhi till at least July 7, according to a forecast of India Meteorological Department on Wednesday. Officials believe that the peak power demand in Delhi could go beyond 7,000MW very soon. The gradual unlock process in the capital has also led to a rise in the demand, with all standalone shops, markets, malls and offices reopening. On Wednesday, at 3.10pm, Delhi’s peak power demand not only clocked this season’s highest till now at 6,921 MW but also crossed the season’s previous peak of 6,592 MW, recorded just a day earlier on June 29. On Tuesday, too, the capital had recorded the season’s highest — till then — around the same time, 3.30pm. The peak demand has increased by around 5% in 24 hours, an official said. Officials said that this summer, Delhi’s peak power demand has already crossed last year’s peak of 6,314MW on five occasions — June 30, 29, 28, 24 and 23. “Because of the lockdown, Delhi’s peak power demand of 6,314MW recorded last year on June 29 was lower than the all-time high of 7,409MW recorded on July 2, 2019,” an official said. Last June, Delhi’s peak power demand had crossed the 6,000MW mark only on June 18, clocking 6,193 MW, while the figure was reached in the first 10 days of June 2021. “Last year, the peak power demand in June was 6,314MW on June 29,” he said. On June 7, Delhi’s peak power demand crossed 5,000MW for the first time this season, clocking 5,559MW at 11.19pm. From June 1, the peak demand has increased by over 40%. Because of the lockdown and the weather, Delhi’s peak power demand this year is expected to be in the range of 7,000MW to 7,400MW, though the original estimates were around 7,900MW, the official said. The discoms seem to be ready to meet the demand. “Ensuring reliable supply in any season is as much the function of proper power arrangements as also of accurate demand forecasting and robust distribution network. BSES discoms are fully geared up on all these aspects to meet the power demand,” a BSES spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/citys-peak-power-demand-inches-close-to-7000mw/articleshow/84000571.cms||Sidharatha Roy

But at a time when the Covid-induced pandemic had fuelled lot of rumours on social media, Shah took the onus of solving simple queries of people. His videos on YouTube have crossed 5 million users mark in the last sixteen months – the time during which he resolved simple queries of Covid treatment to the ongoing vaccination drive. Shah started making videos in Hindi and English right from the onset of first wave of Covid-19 to reach maximum audience. And till date he replies to around 40 queries a day that viewers post in the comment section. “When Covid-19 entered our life, it was necessary to translate science in layman’s language. I started this by using YouTube,” said Shah. “All I wanted was to ensure that before people turn victim of myths, I equip them with facts, be it related to World Health Organization or health ministry’s guidelines or medical jargons and terminologies,” he said. Shah also organises discussions with experts and his doctor friends from US and UK on other social media platforms. He has listeners from 70 countries including India and his viewers include even fellow doctors apart from nursing staff and medical students. In the initial stage, he made videos for doctors and nursing staff describing how to wear PPE kits. These videos were circulated by the state government. “Since the beginning, people have lot of confusion and questions related to Covid. Some of them are even silly. At times, I am asked whether masturbating after vaccination has side effects or a person allergic to insect bite can take a jab.

With a completely exhausted stock of Covishield, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) was planning to administer limited doses of Covaxin at only a few centres on Thursday. AMC immunization officer Dr Smita Nalgirkar said the temporary lean phase of vaccine spanning over three days was expected to get over shortly. “We have already placed an order for a fresh supply of vaccines but technical issues might have hindered the supply. Beneficiaries are requested to show patience as the supply is expected to become smooth soon,” she said. When contacted, Dr Swapnil Lale, the deputy director of health for Aurangabad division, said AMC would receive a fresh supply of vaccine within the next 24 hours. “The supply of vaccine is routed by the Centre to districts through the states. Aurangabad had reported relatively more consumption of vaccines as compared to other cities due to rigorous vaccination drives undertaken by the civic administration,” he said. No other city from Aurangabad division was facing a vaccine shortage as acute as Aurangabad. Unlike municipal limits of Aurangabad that witnessed limited vaccination, rural areas have not been facing much dearth of does.  The total number of vaccinations in Aurangabad reached 8,54,758 by Wednesday, including 6,95,204 first doses and 1,59,554 second doses, show official data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/vax-shortage-in-aurangabad-city/articleshow/83996301.cms||---

They also said that no other car driver was racing with the accused. Shah, 22, a resident of Mithakhali, who works for a private firm and also works for the women’s clothing business of his father, Shailesh Shah. He allegedly mowed down the footpath dwellers in the Bimanagar area near Shivranjnai Crossroads in the wee hours of Tuesday. DCP, city traffic, Tejas Patel said the cops identified another car driver, who was said to be racing with Shah, and found that he did not know anything about the matter. “The other car driver, who was driving a sedan captured on CCTV footage, was identified and was called to the N division traffic police station for his statement. We came to know after questioning him that he had nothing to do with the accident,” said Patel. Patel added, “Shah was responsible for the accident, which is why we have now booked him under IPC Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder). The other driver was speeding because the roads were deserted, and it was night. They were not racing.” On why the other driver, whose identity has been concealed by the cops, was not booked for a breach of curfew, Patel said, “He had gone out due to some urgent and work with a proper reason.” About what the urgent work was, Patel said, “He must have given the reason to the officer concerned and I do not not know it.” The investigating officer of the case and in-charge PSI of N division traffic police, B B Vaghela said Shah was returning from a relative’s home in Thaltej, drove negligently and ran over Satu Bhabhor, 38, her husband Babu Bhabhor, 40,and their children, Vikram, 7, and Jetan, 5.

That’s the indication from a genome sequencing report where every sample sent from MP last month was found to have been Delta — the mutation causing worldwide concern now. Delta’s share in tested samples from MP rose from 57% in April to 69% in May and a whopping 100% in June, shows the report from National Centre of Disease Control (NCDC).

But since then, Delta has been the biggest factor behind the spike in Covid infections in Madhya Pradesh. Of the 1,332 reports MP has received from NCDC, 458 (34%) were found to be Delta, the report said. “Delta is the predominant variant in the state for the last three months and Delta-plus has been detected in only eight cases in MP,” health commissioner Akash Tripathi said.

Police said before ending his life, victim Chandrapal Gangwar of Sanjarpur had shot a video in a field and also left behind a suicide note in which he named three Bareilly residents of “forcing him to pay more money, even though he had paid more than the amount he had borrowed from them”. Police said the man was rushed to the district hospital, where he succumbed during the treatment on June 30. The victim’s family told police that Chandrapal had gone missing on June 26, and they had been searching for him since then and found him lying unconscious in a field in a village in Mirganj. They rushed Chandrapal to the district hospital where he succumbed after being treated for four days, said the family. Police, meanwhile, said that Chandrapal had shot the video after consuming poison. In the video, the victim alleged that he was taking the extreme step after the accused — Gudiya, a cosmetic shop owner in Basant Vihar area, Pappu, alias, Santosh, a gambler, and Premnagar-based garment businessman Kapil Chabra — repetedly forced him to pay more money than he had borrowed, said police. The victim accused them of threatening him to kill his wife while demanding more and more money, said police. In the video, Chandrapal urged police to take strict action against the accused, saying he had “cleared all the dues, yet they were threatening me. They are responsible for my death”.

To meet this target, farmers have been provided with a variety of paddy seedlings, vegetable seeds and cuttings. “In Bicholim, the annual output of paddy in the kharif season is about 20,000 quintal and for the rabi season, it stands at about 62,000 quintal. This year too, the monsoon has got off to a good start and the environment is conducive for agriculture,” Bicholim zonal agricultural officer Nilima Gawas said. Apart from paddy cultivation, farmers have also been asked to target growing 500kg of suran (elephant yam), 4,000kg of turmeric and 500kg of ginger. Targets have also been set for cashew nuts plantation in 7,800 hectare of land, coconut saplings in 1,568 hectare and mango saplings in 1,140 hectare. Various agricultural experiments are being carried out in Bicholim under the guidance of agricultural officers, Gawas said. Most heartening, Gawas said, has been the response from the younger generation. An increasing number of youngsters from Mayem, Surla and surrounding villages are taking active interest in agriculture,, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bicholim-farmers-given-paddy-seeds/articleshow/84002845.cms||---
---||Salem||Speed radar gun installed on Thoppur ghat road||Dharmapuri: The district administration has installed a speed radar gun to spot the speeding vehicles on Thoppur ghat road, which is an accident-prone area. District collector S Divyadharshini hoped the move would help reduce accidents on the 8km-long stretch on the Salem-Bengaluru National Highway by penalising the speeding motorists. The stretch is dotted with bends and steep inclines for 4km. The district administration had earlier convened a meeting with the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and transport department officials to discuss ways to reduce accidents on the ghat road. The transport department officials had installed 100 solar lamps and 12 solar blinkers on the ghat road, especially on the crucial 4km stretch. The collector said the accidents, including the fatal ones, had reduced drastically on the stretch after installing the solar lamps and blinkers. “We installed the speed radar gun on Monday and registered 259 speeding till Wednesday evening. We have collected a fine of Rs 1.03 lakh from the violators.” District regional transport officer D Damodharan said the permissible speed limit on the ghat road was 30kmph. “Vehicles exceeding the speed limit will be fined.” According to him, the speed radar gun would spot the speeding vehicles and send the e-challan to the vehicle owner’s registered mobile number. “The vehicle’s insurance renewal, permit renewal and other process will be cancelled if the owner fails to pay the fine,” he warned. Damodharan said they had made arrangements to inform motorists about the speed radar gun at Thoppur toll plaza in English, Tamil and Hindi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/speed-radar-gun-installed-on-thoppur-ghat-road/articleshow/84000577.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Private hospitals lower jab count to sustain drive||KOLKATA: Low on vaccine stock, many private hospitals in the city have decided to stay away from off-site vaccine camps for the time being and focus on vaccination at their hospital centres. After the government framed fresh SOP to stop fraud, private hospitals are required to take permission from the local police and the health or municipality authorities to hold off-site camps. Also, site inspections have become a must. Given so many permissions, the private facilities have already cut down on off-site camps by half this week. Fortis Hospital, which had been conducting off-site camps extensively, have now restricted itself to the drive on its hospital premises for about a week now. The hospital is now left with so few vials that they can now administer around 200 doses a day where from its two hospital centres, one at Anandapur and the other on Sarat Bose Road. They were inoculating about 800 doses a day. “We are left with only a few vials, as a result of which we are restricting the number of doses. We are expecting 50,000 doses of Covishield by the weekend or early next week. We have also received the confirmation for 20,000 Covaxin doses. Once we get the next consignment, we will scale up our drive again,” said Richa Singh Debgupta, chief of strategy and operations at Fortis Healthcare. Charnock Hospital has run out of its Covishield stock and has only about 500 doses of Covaxin. “Given the kind of stock that we have now, we cannot go beyond 100 doses of Covaxin a day at our hospital centre. We can plan to escalate the drive only when we get our supply for June which is still due. We have also requisitioned another consignment of 18,000 doses,” said Ipsita Kundu, CEO, Charnock Hospitals. At Medica, the number of inoculation has been reduced to almost half of what it was being done earlier. “We have enough stock and want to fan out in districts. But after the new SOP was formed, according to which approvals are required from local police and local health or municipal officials for off-site camps, the drive in districts will slow down. We are forced to inoculate about half the number of people we were vaccinating earlier,” said Medica Hospital Group chairman Alok Roy. RN Tagore Hospital is expecting to get 9,500 Covishield doses, for which payment has been made. Since the hospital is not conducting any off-site camp now, the stock it has is likely to last about 12 days. “Initially, we had procured a sizeable stock. We now expect 9,500 Covishield and 2,500 Covaxin doses soon. We should be able to start more off-site camps by next week after getting clearance from health officials. Till then, we are stuck at 1,000 doses a day at the hospital,” said Narayan Health regional head (east) R Venkatesh. “We plan to add three more vaccination sites in the hospital. Since we started late, we still have doses to expand the drive,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/private-hosps-lower-jab-count-to-sustain-drive/articleshow/84000578.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

During a raid, Rs 14 lakh and several SIM cards used in the crime were recovered. Additional deputy commissioner of police (crime) Rupinder Kaur Bhatti said, “The call centre had been running for the past few months. The fraudsters targeted foreign nationals. They used to purchase personal information of their targets, like National Identification Number (NIN), and called them saying they have a complaint against them or that they have to repay taxes. In one such case, they had cheated a person of Rs 12 lakh.” The call centre staff of at least 20 people included four Nigerians.

---||Delhi||Ban on plastic waste may put them out of circulation: Report||NEW DELHI: Waste pickers are deeply dependent on plastic waste that forms a major part of their income, ranging from 40% to 60%, says a report on plastic waste titled ‘Plan the Ban’. The report, which was released by NGO Chintan on Wednesday, says some plastics are more valuable than others. For instance, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the highest value plastic for waste pickers. According to the research, they were found to collect around 20 to 25 kg of plastic waste daily, of which around 50% to 60% was PET plastic. Low-density polyethylene, especially used in items like garment and textile packaging materials, is also valuable. In third place were mixed hard plastics and transparent polypropylene. As India aims to completely phase out single-use plastics by 2022, Chintan conducted a research in four cities—Delhi, Pune, Indore and Nainital—on types of plastics leaking into the environment, the extent of dependence on plastic waste by waste pickers, plan for preventing from plastic pollution from such plastics and the alternative livelihoods for waste pickers as single-use plastics are banned. The NGO collaborated with multiple partners to conduct the research. The report does not recommend the banning of PET plastics as they form about 29% of the total average income of waste pickers (about Rs 226 per day), followed by PE at 20% and PP at 10%. During a roundtable discussion, Chitra Mukherjee, head, advocacy and policy, Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group, said, “Waste pickers are interested in working in the waste area. They retrieve materials that can be reused or repaired and some people buy repaired goods, which are sold at local places. We recommend that resale and repaired goods should be actively encouraged and space should be provided for such local markets. We also need training for waste pickers to learn to repair the goods in a modern way.” For expanding livelihood options for waste pickers dependent on plastic waste, Chintan suggested that municipalities should mandate at least 50% identified waste pickers on the team of housekeeping companies. It was found in the research that many groups of waste pickers, including women, prioritised housekeeping services as an extension of their work. It also proposed that municipalities can contract waste pickers’ organisations to collect and compost horticulture waste at spaces the municipality allocates for the purposes. Jaiprakash Chaudhary, general secretary, Safai Sena, said, “When single-use plastic is phased out from the country, it would lead to a decrease in our income. The government should give us training and we can do better work like reuse or repair of plastic or making compost from wet waste.” To achieve the balanced outcome of environment and poverty, the report recommended that Plastic Waste Management Rules must be amended to reflect the plastics for banning and extended producer responsibility. It also proposed that the MSW rules should be amended to reflect the alternative livelihoods in the waste processing space.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ban-on-plastic-waste-may-put-them-out-of-circulation/articleshow/84000585.cms||---

Police arrested one Manish Patel for allegedly supplying the pistol to a couple, Yogita and Bharat Gohil. The duo were nabbed during an attempted robbery at a jewellery showroom on the Nikol-Naroda road. Krishnagar police inspector A J Chauhan said that during the investigation of the robbery it emerged that the couple had got the country-made pistol on rent of Rs 500 which they were to return after the robbery. “We have arrested the person who supplied the pistol to the couple,” said Chauhan. The couple’s misadventure played out on Sunday afternoon at a jewellery shop on the Nikol-Naroda road. Yogita and Bharat Gohil began their heist protocol but faced resistance from the showroom’s owner, Haresh Modi, and his staff. The couple were held in confinement till the cops arrived. Police officers said Yogita and Bharat run a tailor shop in Nikol. They were facing money problems and planned the robbery after watching “some action films from the South”. Police said Yogita lived extravagantly and had 100-odd dresses and pairs of footwear. The couple planned to go to Delhi after the robbery. When police questioned Yogita’s in-laws, they said she would quarrel with them and on several occasions had threatened them with a knife.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cops-arrest-man-for-renting-firearm-to-couple/articleshow/84000580.cms||---

After invoking Section 304A of the IPC while registering the FIR, the traffic police submitted a report in the court stating that the alleged offence actually invites charges under Section 304 of the IPC. Section 304A is for causing death by criminal negligence which has provision of punishment up to two years in jail and is a bailable offence. Section 304 is for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and it has provision of punishment up to 10 years in jail. According to additional public prosecutor D J Parmar, the police relied on the CCTV footage and statements of eye witnesses to press for severe charges.

The assistance will include employment, skill development, financial help and linkage with various development schemes. “The mission will address concerns of women who need help from government. It will be framed on the lines of the recent scheme for kids who have lost parents or the earning member of the family to Covid-19,” a government spokesperson said.The department of women and child development has been tasked with structuring the mission. Director, department of women and child development, Manoj Rai said, “Work has already started and the outline of the programme should be ready this week. Work under the mission will take place in two phases. We will identify women who have been widowed due to Covid-19 and need assistance. Simultaneously, we will also identify schemes being implemented by all departments to which these women can be linked. The programme will work on convergence mode,” he said. The second phase of the programme will look at specific needs of the beneficiaries and how they can be assisted. “Women will be provided help in finding employment and will be linked to schemes which can help them financially. The revenue department will also help in identifying such women and ensure that they get family succession benefits at the earliest,” he added. Meanwhile, the CM also asked officials to hold special camps at block and nyay panchayat levels for distribution of pension for destitute women.

According to Yadav, his team had seized 4kg of high-grade heroin apart from Rs 1.5 lakh cash from the accused. The cartel was busted after sleuths from northern range of the cell received a tip-off regarding this syndicate active in states like Punjab, Haryana apart from Delhi NCR. This information was further developed through technical as well as human surveillance to gather intelligence on the members of this gang. Recently, police received specific information that two key members of this cartel would come to receive supply of huge consignment of drugs from African nationals near Uttam Nagar. Accordingly, a raiding party was formed and a trap laid which led to their arrest. The accused disclosed that suppliers of heroin procured them from Afghan nationals and sent their consignments to other countries like England, France, Italy, Canada, South- Africa and Nigeria etc, through courier companies. The couple used to procure supply of heroin from Nigerian nationals residing in Uttam Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/heroin-worth-rs-16-lakh-seized-four-drug-traffickers-held/articleshow/84000615.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Municipal Corporation clinics start giving second dose, restrict drive to 40 shots a day||KOLKATA: Vaccination clinics, run by the KMC, started administering second doses of Covid vaccines from Wednesday, when no first dose was administered from these facilities. Also, a majority of the places restricted the number of doses—most of them Covishield—to merely 40, given the acute shortage of vaccines since Tuesday. Many recipients had to return disappointed in spite of waiting in serpentine queues for hours as by the time their turn came, vaccines were already over at those centres. The Covid vaccination drive at KMC clinics started around 2pm, only after immunization programmes for children were completed. Bansdroni resident Susanta Pal, who is a bank employee, arrived at a KMC vaccination clinic located close to his house by noon. On seeing less than 100 people waiting in the queue, he was sure to get the shot. But when the registration counter opened, a civic official announced than only 40 people should wait for their vaccine and the rest were advised to visit the clinic on Friday. “My date for the second dose of the Covid vaccine is due and I desperately need it as I suffer from multiple co-morbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension. If the supply of vaccines keeps dipping, it becomes difficult for people like me, who can’t afford to wait any longer for the second dose,” Pal said. A KMC health department official pointed out that the crisis deepened on Wednesday as most mega vaccination centres—community halls being converted into vaccination centres—remained shut. According to sources in the KMC health department, most civic vaccination clinics were allotted around 40 doses of Covishield for those who needed their second doses. But some clinics in the Bhowanipore belt were allotted more vaccines and there, people in large numbers were inoculated. Going by what the chairman of the KMC Board of Administrators (BoA), Firhad Hakim, indicated on Wednesday, more trouble seemed to be in store for recipients of Covishield second dose. “The supply of vaccines is so low that we feel the normal functioning of the KMC vaccination clinics is going to be affected for this entire week. We are trying to normalize the vaccination process from early next week,” Hakim said. Debasish Bhar, a karate instructor and a resident of Bijoygarh, was one of the lucky few to get his shot on Wednesday. In fact, he was the last person in the queue at KMC’s Layelka clinic, who could be inoculated. “After I waited in the queue for several hours, I was allowed to enter the vaccination centre. It turned out that I was the last person at the centre who could receive the shot on Wednesday,” Bhar said. Anjana Gupta, a homemaker and resident of Sealdah, beamed as she walked out of a KMC vaccination centre. Gupta said she had booked a slot for the second dose of Covaxin and felt satisfied that she managed to get the shot in time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-clinics-start-giving-2nd-dose-restrict-drive-to-40-shots-a-day/articleshow/84000587.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Aurangabad||Minister announces new Babasaheb Ambedkar technological university centre in Aurangabad, unaware of earlier unit’s fate||AURANGABAD: Maharashtra higher and technical education minister Uday Samant on Wednesday announced that a regional centre of the Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Technological University (Batu) would come up in Aurangabad. The announcement had raised many eyebrows as one such dedicated centre was earlier set up in Aurangabad, but it was abruptly closed in the first half of 2020. Samant, who was on an official tour of Aurangabad, announced that the “new facility” would come up at the Government Engineering College here, which was the place of operation for the scrapped centre as well. The earlier regional centre was later shifted to the Marathwada auto cluster in Waluj. Pralhad Lulekar, a retired faculty member of the Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University (Bamu), was in charge then. While Lulekar stepped down from the post due to the alleged apathy of the Batu administration in empowering the centre, the technological university later shifted the available workforce to its headquarters at Lonere in Raigad district. Local Shiv Sena leaders defended Samant saying that he only responded to the demand raised by a group of principals from the city-based engineering colleges that are affiliated to the Batu. “The college principals met the minister and discussed their demands. The principals must have given a wrong briefing to the minister that Aurangabad does not have a regional centre,” Tukaram Saraf, the head of Sena’s student wing, said. When contacted, Ulhas Shiurkar, one of the principals who met Samant during his official tour, said the minister was handed over a detailed memorandum of demands regarding the strengthening of the Batu. “The memorandum had a mention of the status of regional centres of Batu and the demand for filling up posts. The minister has assured us that he would look into our demand and announced a fresh start by setting up the regional centre at the Government Engineering College here,” he said. Among other announcements, Samant promised revival of the Sant Vidyapeeth at Paithan in Aurangabad district and starting of new courses at the Government Polytechnic here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/minister-announces-new-batu-centre-in-aurangabad-unaware-of-earlier-units-fate/articleshow/83996463.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Nagpur||Genome sequencing: Nagpur can gain a lot from Neeri expertise||NAGPUR: While the fate of setting up genome sequencer at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) remains in limbo, the CSIR-Neeri delivering genome sequencing results of 8 samples of Umred family within 8 days makes a strong case for the institution now becoming first choice for such studies. Already in the limelight for implementation of CCMB’s dry swab testing method in the city and for innovating the saline gargle RT-PCR test, CSIR-Neeri had also been asked by the high court to conduct a retrospective study on plasma therapy to ascertain if it was the cause of possible mutations of nSarsCov2. Even as it delivered results of the latest eight samples, the high court again requested the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) to conduct a study on effects of steroids on Covid-19 and mucormycosis patients, if any, on Wednesday. Neeri is the only lab to implement the dry swab technique and had processed over 55,000 such samples. As the technique gained popularity, people from different places in the region have preferred NMC’s RPTS centre from where samples are sent to Neeri. Through saline gargle method, a gamechanger innovation of CSIR-Neeri, over 5,000 samples have been collected and processed. This method was well recognized and appreciated by Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan. On the other hand, public health and medical college officials surprisingly have so far failed to take advantage of the Neeri's capability in the last one year. On June 30, TOI had reported how results of district Covid samples sent to other institutions like the National Institute of Virology, Pune, or National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) have not been known to medical colleges and administrative officials in a timely manner. While medical colleges still remain averse to seeking assistance of Neeri, administrative officials and public health department are now convinced that the premier institution’s involvement can be a boon in conducting clinical research studies. Surprisingly, the samples of two more patients from the Umred chain are yet to be shared with Neeri though it had been decided that a parallel study would be carried out by the NIV. In fact, Indira Gandhi Government Medical College & Hospital (IGGMCH) and GMCH are yet to send the 10 Umred samples to the NIV. Viral Research and Diagnostic Lab (VRDL) officials from both medical colleges didn’t respond to TOI calls and SMS. In December, the GMCH’s move to set up a genome sequencer had inspired lot of hope among research bodies, civic authority and hospitals who depended for genomic sequencing, in-depth analysis of viral diseases or virus culture on Pune-based NIV. Then GMCH dean Dr Sajal Mitra had said the proposal is part of Phase II expansion of the state-level VRDL set up at the medical college nearly a year ago. The 8-capillaries genomic sequencer would process 80 samples at a time. It would be procured at a cost of Rs1.41 crore through Haffkine Institute for Training, Research and Testing at Mumbai. The Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) too has approved both the proposals. The GMCH had forwarded the proposal in mid-December and it is now awaiting administrative approval from the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/genome-sequencing-dist-can-gain-a-lot-from-neeri-expertise/articleshow/83996448.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt gives nod to redevelop slums located on Mumbai airport land||MUMBAI: The state government has given the green signal to Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) to carry out redevelopment of slums on the Mumbai airport land. MIAL is a joint venture between Adani Airports and Airport Authority of India, that operates Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport.  The state urban development department on Tuesday issued a notification allowing it to redevelop slums on airport land. Mumbai airport covers an area 1,875 acres and was given to MIAL on a 30-year lease in 2006. Rehabilitation of slum-dwellers will free 200 acres for aeronautical and commercial development. The Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport Notified Area (CSIANA) comprises large areas under slums which officials say pose security threat being in close vicinity of airport operations. In 2014, the civil aviation ministry had given in-principle approval for in-situ rehabilitation of slums and requested for an airport-specific slum rehabilitation scheme. A new regulation allows MIAL to carry out redevelopment through slum rehabilitation schemes. Eligible hutment dwellers may be rehabilitated by being shifted to another location within the airport land or outside “as far as possible within the limits of Greater Mumbai or Mumbai metropolitan region”. It is estimated there are over 80,000 slum households on the airport land. It adds that MIAL’s decision will be final and binding on everyone regarding proportion and location of the land area used for rehabilitation component and amenity component. The maximum floor space index (FSI) allowed for the slum scheme is four or the maximum required for rehabilitation. FSI is the ratio which defines how much can be built on a plot.  MIAL shall be eligible for land TDR (Transfer of Development Rights) two times the land used for ex-situ rehabilitation. The TDR will be released in four tranches after various levels of construction are completed. Only the actual occupant of the ground floor structure shall be eligible for free housing consisting of a 300-sq-ft carpet area tenement. However, the already constructed 269-sq-ft tenement will also be offered and those opting for these will not be compensated for the difference in area, reads the regulation. Pavement dwellers, slums on land required for airport development, open spaces shall not get in-situ rehabilitation. Also, commercial godowns, scrap godowns, cow sheds, hazardous units will not be rehabilitated in-situ. A senior bureaucrat said it would be a challenge to get the slum dwellers to accept rehabilitation even outside the airport, let alone relocate in the MMR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-gives-nod-to-redevelop-slums-located-on-airport-land/articleshow/84002770.cms||Clara Lewis

The complaint was filed with Women’s Police (West) on Tuesday. She said her torment became more severe when they had to leave London. She told police that she married in 2004 and settled in Vadodara with her husband and in-laws. She said that her husband used to abuse her if she tried to pacify the members of her in-law’s family when they quarreled among themselves. She said that she was assaulted by him regularly. In 2008, after the birth of her daughter she went to London. Later, her husband joined her in London, bringing their daughter along. The woman said her husband used to beat her in London too. In September 2009, the couple had to return to India as their visas were not extended. Her husband held her responsible for that. After returning to India, the complainant went to her father’s home in Mumbai and sent a notice to her husband. But her in-laws mollified her and the couple started living together again. In 2013, she said her husband pressured her to have another child. In 2015, she gave birth to a boy. The complainant stated that her husband, who was running tuition classes, forced her to work with him even when she was pregnant. The complainant said that on Monday her husband abused and beat her again. Her daughter called the husband’s sister. The woman later went to her sister-in-law’s home where her husband arrived and thrashed her yet again. The complainant said that she then went to her sister’s home in Ahmedabad. Eventually, she filed a police complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-uk-visa-extension-man-batters-wife/articleshow/84000612.cms||---

May be out of their love for the accused, they have not supported the prosecution story, but because of their non-supportive attitude, the prosecution story has collapsed,” the court said. The court held that while the police officer supported the prosecution’s version, she was neither the “victim nor the eyewitness”. It was the prosecution’s case that the children were aged 11 and 14 years when the incident came to light in 2018. It was submitted that the mother told the police that the girls had told her the accused had sexually assaulted them. However, in court, the mother denied making allegations.

---||Kolkata||Full fleet of Bengal govt buses to make up for absence of enough private buses||KOLKATA: The state government will run its full fleet of buses so that commuters do not face any inconvenience from Thursday when public transport will be back on roads. The government took this decision as the operation of private buses is still in question. “We will run 800 buses in the city and 3,000 in rest of the state. I have urged private operators to run their buses as the fare revision issue is being considered at appropriate level,” said Bengal’s transport minister Firhad Hakim. Times ViewThe transport sector, particularly, is going through stressful times. The entire pandemic season has been difficult for both users and service providers. There is no easy solution but any policy decision and change to give the sector a leg-up should be fair to both commuters and transporters.But the exact passenger demand may not be realised on Thursday, with government offices remaining closed for Doctors’ Day. “We hope to facilitate smooth ferrying of 50% commuters,” said an official. The resumption of bus services is bringing relief to commuters who had to pay almost five times than usual. “I often had to pay Rs 700 for commuting from my home at Dhakuria to my office at New Town. Normally, my commuting cost does not exceed Rs 100 a day,” said Abhigyan Dasgupta, who works in an e-commerce company warehouse.  However, not more than 5% of private buses are expected to be on the road. “A majority of bus operators said that they have exhausted all resources to run buses with old fare structures. It is high time the fare is revised as the diesel price is hovering around Rs 93 and in no time it will cross Rs 100 a litre,” said Tapan Banerjee, secretary, joint council of bus syndicates. The maintenance staff at the depots of West Bengal Transport Corporation were found working overtime to ensure that the buses ply without glitches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/full-fleet-of-govt-buses-to-make-up-for-absence-of-enough-pvt-buses/articleshow/84000617.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

In her complaint with the Women’s Police (East), Maninagar resident Vrunda (name changed) said that she and her current husband Nitish (name changed) used to study together. However, they both got married to different partners. Vrunda, in the complaint, said she stayed in touch with Nitish who got permanent residency in Canada. However, differences developed between Nitish and his wife. The couple returned to India and began living in Ahmedabad. Vrunda and her brother tried to mediate betwen Nitish and his wife. However, Vrunda fell in love with Nitish and they began to live together. “Nitish’s parents were against this relationship and even published an advertisement against me in a newspaper,” she alleged. After the two divorced their respective partners, they got married to each other in 2018. She claimed that her in-laws disliked her and used to frequently pick fights with her. Vrunda and Nitish soon moved to Canada. “When I was pregnant, Nitish got a dog. My in-laws said my baby will be like a dog if I played with it. This played on my mind so much that I had a miscarriage. When I got pregnant a second time, my in-laws came to Canada. When the sonography revealed that I was carrying a girl, they began torturing me. They asked me to return to India as I was carrying a girl child. My husband would dance to their tunes and harass me too. This affected my health. I returned to India this May and have been taking psychiatric treatment,” said Vrunda in her complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/woman-accuses-in-laws-of-harassment/articleshow/84000616.cms||---

---||Kolhapur||Over 18,000 from Kolhapur city await second vaccine dose||KOLHAPUR: Over 18,000 beneficiaries, mostly frontline workers and healthcare workers, from Kolhapur city are yet to take their second dose of the Covid vaccine. In the district, the number of beneficiaries with the second dose due is almost four times more than the number of the people with the second dose due in the city. The number of people in the distric,t who have received the first jab, has crossed the 10 lakh- mark. In the last three days, the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC)-run vaccine centres have run out of vaccine stock. There are fewer chances that the vaccine stock will arrive in a day or two as the state government announced on Wednesday that there will be no vaccination for the next two days due to vaccine shortage. Rajesh Tope, the health minister, said since the central government has taken over the vaccination drive, the state has no role to play in making vaccines available. Amol Mane, the vaccination nodal officer of KMC said, “We desperately need vaccines as over 18,000 people are yet to take their second dose. We are approached by thousands of beneficiaries every day and we are sending them back. To avoid chaos at vaccination centres, we have announced the closure of the centres temporarily. We received just 1,500 doses for the week as against our demand of 20,000 per day.” The district administration received 17,000 vaccines a week ago, which was the highest in recent months. There is a shortage of vaccines in private hospitals too. Many from Kolhapur district, who have their second dose due, are visiting the centres in nearby districts. “We utilised the stock completely as and when received. We have the largest turnout for vaccination in the state and therefore have no previously supplied stock with us,” said Mane.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/over-18k-from-kolhapur-city-await-second-vaccine-dose/articleshow/83996518.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Now, Uttarakhand minister Rekha Arya urges health secy to remove Almora Medical College principal for attending phone call during meeting||ALMORA: Rekha Arya, minister of state for women and child development, has stoked fresh controversy with her letter (dated June 25) to health secretary Amit Negi asking for the removal of Dr RG Nautiyal from the post of the principal of Almora Medical College. In her letter (a copy of which is available with TOI), Arya has said that Dr Nautiyal stopped a presentation during a Covid review meeting in Almora to attend a phone call. She added that his telephonic conversation went on for three minutes, leaving all the ministers present in the meeting waiting for him to resume the presentation. She claimed that Dr Nautiyal breached protocol with his ‘unprofessional behaviour’ and after the meeting, he made unwarranted remarks against the state government in a media briefing. The minister went on to accuse Dr Nautiyal of being negligent towards his duties while pointing out that the 46 ventilators provided by the state government to Almora have not been put to use as of yet. In the letter, Arya also alleged that Dr Nautiyal has been monitoring the functioning of the Almora Medical College while staying put in Haldwani. Meanwhile, Dr Nautiyal in his defence said that he received a call from Raghunath Singh Chauhan, the deputy speaker of the Uttarakhand assembly during the meeting and picked it up just to tell him that he is in a meeting. He added that Chauhan holds a constitutional post and he picked up the call out of respect. Notably, Arya had stoked controversy a few months ago as well when she wrote to the then Dehradun SSP alleging that a senior IAS officer who was the secretary of her department ‘had gone missing and may have been abducted’ as she could not contact him for the past two days. She also alleged that the officer may have “gone underground to save himself from irregularities found in the recruitment process which was going on in the department.” However, later it was found that the officer was in home quarantine and had informed his senior officials about it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/now-ukhand-minister-rekha-arya-urges-health-secy-to-remove-almora-medical-college-principal-for-attending-phone-call-during-meeting/articleshow/83996482.cms||---

The deceased included station master, train guard, pointsman and other staff of Agra division of Indian Railway. The initiative was taken by senior divisional operations manager (SrDOM), Akanshu Govil (IRTS), who appealed the railway staff of all grades to extend monetary help for the families of Covid-19 victims. Total of Rs 20.6 lakh was collected and each family was given Rs 2.06 lakh. “We lost our dear ones in the pandemic but railway staff of Agra division stood by us in the need of hour. They raised money for us and helped us in documentation for compensation and pension —that too in just one day,” said former rail guard Rashid Beg, whose son Ahmad Beg (42), a train guard at Agra Cantt station, died of Covid-19 on April 20. He is survived by his wife and three minor children, including two daughters. Similarly, deputy station superintendent of Agra Cantt, CP Singh (44), passed away in ambulance while waiting for a ventilator-supported bed. His father-in-law, Bijendra Singh, said: “The death of my son-in-law was a big trauma for us, especially for my daughter Krishna Singh. We were overwhelmed by the support by railway staff.” He thanked SrDOM Akanshu Govil for the initiative, Bindu Yadav for compiling documents for pension and Agra Cantt station master Mukesh Kulshrestha and colleagues for their support. Talking to TOI, SrDOM Akanshu Govil said, “The second wave made a huge impact on our staff and their families. Therefore, we started a fund-raising campaign in which everyone, from Class A officers to Grade IV employees, contributed. Last year too, we raised Rs 3.8 lakh for the family of station master who succumbed to coronavirus infection.” The victims included station manager of Pithauli station NK Roy, deputy station superintendent of Agra Cantt CP Singh, train guard Ahmad Beg, pointsman at Agra Cantt Subodh Kumar, shunting master Shrikrishna, deputy SS Bansi Paharpur station Bharat Raj Meena, deputy passenger guard Manikant Singh, deputy SS Agra Fort station Ashok Kumar, deputy SS of Mirhakur station Shyam Singh and CHC, Agra Cantt, Rajesh Shukla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/agra-rly-staff-raises-rs-20l-for-kin-of-covid-victims/articleshow/84002829.cms||Arvind Chauhan

Within a span of just two months, 87 Covid patients admitted to the Miraj-based hospital had succumbed. Preliminary investigation by the Sangli police revealed that the hospital, run by plastic surgeon Mahesh Jadhav, was ill-equipped. Also, the patients were charged for the services that were not provided. On Wednesday, a local court granted judicial custody of Mahesh Jadhav. His brother Madan Jadhav, a neurosurgeon, too was arrested. So far, 10 people have been arrested. Ashish Kori, a Sangli-based activist, said: “Despite knowing that there is only one ventilator and no qualified staff, permission was granted by the Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad Municipal Corporation officials. The SIT should investigate this matter to bring the officials responsible to the task. Also, top government lawyers should be given the case for stringent action against those responsible.” The civic officials had said that proper visits and checks were done before the hospital was given permission. The activists, however, said the officials are covering up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/activists-demand-sit-probe-into-sanglis-87-covid-deaths/articleshow/83996544.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: App cab operators hike fares a day before public transport resumes operation||KOLKATA: The app cab fare in the city was raised on Wednesday, a day before the resumption of public transport for people. Uber, one of the major app-cab aggregators, raised its fare by 15% while the other aggregator Ola has also appealed for a similar hike in the fare structure due to the ever-rising fuel costs. The new fare structure received by the Uber operators on Wednesday showed that the base fare remained unchanged while the distance fare rose from Rs 10 to Rs 14.7 per kilometre. The time fare or ride-time charge was marginally reduced from Rs 1.58 to Rs 1 per minute. For instance, if one books an Uber-go cab from Rashbehari to Md Ali Park and the trip’s duration is 30 minutes, the new fare will be Rs 225, as against the old fare Rs 195. Though Uber officially did not respond to the query of TOI, sources said that the hike in diesel price turned the operation unviable and forced many cabs to go off the roads. The revision of fare will bring those cabs back on the road. However, Bengal’s transport minister Firhad Hakim said, “We have already shot a letter of caution to the aggregator. They have taken the licence of operation from us. So, they should have told us before raising the fare. We have asked them to meet us.” However, a senior transport department official said, “The current legal framework that allows the operation of app cabs does not have much scope for intervention of the government. But the new regulation that is being brought about shortly in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules (CMVR) will make them accountable to the transport department.  “There is no point in running a cab, if we cannot run our families with our earnings. But at time the fare appeared to be less than the cost of fuel,” said Gaurav Mahinder, an app-cab operator. Indranil Banerjee, secretary of Online Cab Operators’ Guild, said, “There is nothing to be excited about the rise of fare. The new fare is just neutralising the effect of costlier fuel. It cannot increase our earnings.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/app-cab-operators-hike-fares-a-day-before-public-transport-resumes-op/articleshow/84000624.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Lucknow||Lucknow records fastest vaccination in six months||LUCKNOW: The last eight days of this month have recorded the fastest vaccination rate in Lucknow in six months of the Covid-19 immunisation campaign which took off on January 16. An extra push from now onwards can cover eligible adult population of Lucknow with at least single dose by September-end, when the third wave is expected to hit the city, according to a rough analysis by TOI. The adult population of Lucknow is around 35.8 lakh. Total 14.1 lakh doses have been administered in 165 days from January 16 till June 29. About 2.8 lakh people have completed two-dose vaccine course (total 5.6 lakh doses) which means that 8.5 lakh people have got a single dose so far. These people will be eligible for second dose after completing the time gap required for the course. About 24.5 lakh eligible people have not received any dose so far. To inoculate this segment, the health department will require to administer 27,000 doses daily. Simultaneously, an increasing number of people will become eligible for a second dose. Covidshield is given 12-16 weeks apart while Covaxin is administered after a gap of 4-6 weeks. According to an estimate, 9,500 people will qualify daily for the second dose which means that about 36,500 doses will have to be administered daily till September-end to inoculate every adult with at least one dose. However, on an average, about 10% of the people are ineligible for vaccination because due to issues and medical reasons. This brings down the figure of doses to be administered daily to 32,850. Over 1.78 lakh doses were administered since June 21 at an average of 22,250 daily at various vaccination centres. Highest 28,131 doses were given on June 25. Experts said if the health department, with the support of private sector, improves a bit on its June 25 performance, the goal to vaccinate all eligible adults by September-end can be met. The task will be easier with the availability of Russian vaccine Sputnik in private hospitals. Former head of the microbiology department, Institute of Medical Sciences, BHU, Prof Anil Kumar Gulati said even if 80-90 % of adult population gets vaccinated with one dose by September-October, the impact of the third Covid-19 wave would be considerably less than the second. Head of medicine department at KGMU, Prof Virendra Atam, said studies have shown that a single vaccine shot can prevent severity by 60-70% even in Delta variant of novel coronavirus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-records-fastest-vaccination-in-6-months/articleshow/84002877.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Traffic violations went up as curbs were relaxed in last 15 days||KOLKATA: The traffic police, which carried out checks for close to 18 hours a day for the past 45 days of restrictions, said most motorists stayed off roads in the initial days but violations began as timings for markets and shops were relaxed in phases. All public transport, including buses, trains, Metro and ferry, were stopped from May 16, while private vehicles were allowed only for emergency and essential services. While May saw the city maintain discipline, flouting of the rule started as June approached, police said. After a gap of one-and-a-half months, public transport—barring trains and Metro—will resume operations from Thursday with 50% occupancy. “Now, we will withdraw our regular checks. But surprise raids will be held to ensure public vehicles do not carry more than 50% passengers of their capacity,” said a senior officer. DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha said they would focus on night restrictions. “Naka checking at night will be increased,” said Sinha. The total number of vehicles seized or their drivers challaned for breaking Covid restrictions stood at 37,319 between May 16 and June 15. But when the government relaxed some curbs, the number shot to 50,559 between June 16 and June 29. . Motorists and bikers started violating night restrictions between 9pm to 5am with vengeance with 3,537 vehicles being seized in May but the figure going up to 7,437 in the past 15 days. “The night curb is still on but people seem to have forgotten about it,” said an officer. Traffic guards at city centre and on the fringes witnessed maximum violations. “South and North 24 Parganas and Howrah saw an influx of vehicles in the absence of local trains,” police said. The lowest violations were reported from James Long Sarani traffic guard (567 cases), Kasba (808) and Bhowanipore traffic guards (1,229).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/traffic-violations-went-up-as-curbs-were-relaxed-in-last-15-days/articleshow/84000646.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Traders’ representatives from Kolhapur met chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday. The traders said Kolhapur city and the villages under Kolhapur Urban Area Development Authority (KUDA)should be considered a single administration to fix the level of Covid restrictions. The traders said the city limits and the KUDA have a low positivity rate and therefore it should be put in level 3, as per which the non-essential shops are allowed to open. Sanjay Shete, the president of Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries (KCCI), who led the traders' delegation, said, “The CM immediately referred the proposal sent by the district administration for remarks to disaster management officials. We found the CM in favour of our demand so to keep faith in him we will wait till Thursday. Whatever the outcome, we will open shops from Friday.” He said the CM allowed to present their views and then he discussed the issue with district guardian minister Satej Patil and city MLA Chandrakant Jadhav. The proposal sent by the district administration has a major flaw. The positivity rate for the KUDA villages is not mentioned and it is still unknown whether the two limits qualify for level 3 together or not. “We expect the flaw to be pointed out by disaster management authorities. However, we expect the government to decide it as a special case,” he said. Meanwhile, KCCI has started the drive to collect throat swabs of traders and staffers for RT-PCR testing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-traders-to-wait-till-thursday/articleshow/83996615.cms||---

Since the start of the financial year from April 1 to June 29, the KMC has generated Rs 15.6 crore in property tax which is one of the highest in first three months of any of the previous financial years. The property tax bills are issued at the start of the financial year. Property owners get 6% concession if the amount is paid in first three months, 4% concession is given if paid in later three months and 2% if paid before December of that financial year. The concession is given to woo property tax payers and thereby increase tax collection. The total amount collected from property so far this year is around 25% of the annual target set by the KMC. The officials claim that the tax collection by June 30 would have been much more as the traders hoping to get the deadline for availing concession is extended by at least a month. Director of Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries (KCCI) Ajit Kothari said, “We had put forth the proposal to extend deadline since the traders are facing severe financial crirs and can pay taxes only after their business is rolled on. Currently, the shops are shut for last three months. We are told by property tax officials that for some day the collection will be stopped to take the decision over our demand.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kmc-collects-rs-1-5cr-property-tax-in-1-day/articleshow/83996589.cms||---

The accused had promised her marriage after befriending her through a matrimonial website in March and then claimed to have sent her a parcel and his aide lured her into paying ‘custom duties’ to claim it. As per the FIR, on March 25, the engineer, who works for a PSU, was searching for an alliance on the matrimonial site, and liked the profile of Advik Kumar. Later, both spoke over WhatsApp calls. Kumar claimed that he was an engineer and lived in the UK. The next day, he told her he was going to Canada for 15 days and on his return would marry the victim and permanently settle in India. On March 27, Kumar sought her address to send his things to India. The next day, he sent the victim a courier company’s tracking code. When she tracked the parcel, she found that it had reached the Delhi airport’s cargo department. On March 30, a woman, who posed as a staffer at Delhi airport’s cargo department, called the victim on her mobile phone and told her that Kumar’s parcel has arrived from the UK and that she needs to pay Rs 32,900 as import duty. The victim contacted Kumar, who told her to pay and he would repay her later. The woman aide gave the victim two bank account numbers and the latter transferred the payment online. The next day, the woman aide told the victim that the parcel contains 95,000 and to claim it she would have to pay Rs 1,21,500 as GST. When she contacted Kumar, he told her that the UK pounds was gift for her. Thereafter, till April, the victim was made to gradually transfer a total of Rs 56.6 lakh to different bank accounts under the pretext of payment for currency conversion charges, delivery charges, insurance and security room charges. The victim did not receive the parcel for two months, while Kumar and his aide went incommunicado. She lodged a complaint with Panvel city police on June 23. An FIR was registered on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-engineer-cheated-of-rs-57-lakh-in-matrimonial-customs-duty-fraud/articleshow/84002938.cms||George Mendonca

The recent announcement by the union urban affairs ministry shows that Surat has the highest five-star ratings under the Climate Smart Cities Assessment Framework 2.0. The ratings were under Urban Planning, Green Cover and Biodiversity and Waste Management categories and four-star ratings under Energy and Green Buildings, Mobility and Air Quality, and Water Management categories with an overall rating of four stars. While Surat has bagged the top rank, Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Rajkot and Gandhinagar too managed to grab top 10 slots in the country. Officials of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) said that 50% of the assessment was done based on urban planning, green cover, biodiversity, and energy and green buildings. “What worked in our favour was conservation of open areas, green cover, reliance on non-conventional sources of energy among other factors,” said an SMC official. SMC has generated 8.1 crore kilowatt hour electricity through green energy resources like wind, solar and waste to energy. “At least 30 to 32% of our electricity needs are covered by these non-conventional sources of power,” said CY Bhatt, deputy municipal commissioner. The city has also introduced 22 electric-run buses on its BRTS and city bus routes, while the tendering process is underway for 150 more such buses, Bhatt added. SMC’s capability to manage the 1,800 tonnes of daily waste too added weightage in the assessment. The civic body generates organic compost and recycles waste plastic which can then be used in manufacturing buckets, pipes and packaging products. “SMC has undertaken these projects to give better quality of life to people of Surat and we plan to introduce better projects for future too like the biodiversity park, adopting new technologies and relying more on renewable energy sources,” said Banchhanidhi Pani, SMC commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surat-adjudged-the-best-climate-smart-city-in-india/articleshow/83996629.cms||---

After the arrest, the youth, identified as Vikas Singh, confessed and said he was "left with no choice and had to neutralise the baba's sexual advances." He, however, said that his intention was not to kill him and had even sought help from his friends in the village to take him to a doctor. According to police sources, a few men along with the sadhu, Chandrapal, had consumed liquor on Monday and later took bath near a tubewell. In the evening, they again started consuming liquor and were joined by Chandrapal too. Later at night when everyone had left, Chandrapal allegedly made advances towards the youth after which he hit the ascetic repeatedly with bricks. On Wednesday, SP (Rural) Keshav Kumar said, "An FIR had been filed against the accused under IPC section 302 [murder] and later 202 [intentional omission of information regarding an offence committed] was added."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/youth-20-held-for-killing-sadhu/articleshow/83996633.cms||Sandeep Rai

Senior officials of almost all the police stations have put up checkpoints in their respective jurisdictions. As per the new orders issued by police commissioner Deepak Pandey on Monday, while no one would be allowed to move on the roads unnecessarily from 5 pm to 5 am, assembly of five or more people has been prohibited from 5 am to 5 pm. Shops and other non-essential commercial establishments will be allowed to operate only between 7 am to 4 pm. Those found operating beyond these hours would be fined. The police said while they have started checking people who are not following Covid appropriate behaviour on the streets, the flying squads would also keep a check on various markets places.  Once the markets are barricaded by the civic body and the coupons are prepared, the work of regulating the flow of people would also begin. Those visiting the markets would be given coupons, free of cost and it would have the entry time of the person concerned. The person will have to returns from the market within an hour or pay a fine of Rs 1,000. The police are also raising awareness about the new restrictions that have come into force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/police-put-up-checkpoints-in-nashik-city/articleshow/83996639.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Dehradun||High Court gives state two more weeks to respond to petition challenging ban on slaughterhouses in Haridwar||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday gave the state government two more weeks to file its response to the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) challenging the ban on animal slaughter in the entire district of Haridwar. The court has said that this is the last opportunity for the state to file its reply failing which it will lose its right to file its counter in the case. The directions came from the bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma. The court had heard the case initially on May 12 and gave the state government, urban development department as well the DM and several municipal councils of the district four weeks to respond. The case was then heard on June 23 when the government sought some more time to file its response. The case was thereafter heard on Wednesday when the government counsel sought two more weeks to respond. “The government counsel said that the DM has already filed his response but since the order of the state is under challenge, their reply is important in the case. The court therefore gave two more weeks,” said an advocate present in the hearing. Meanwhile, Arvind Vashisht, the counsel for the petitioner, informed the bench that Bakr-Eid is scheduled for July 21 and slaughtering of goats is an essential religious practice for the Muslim community on the day. The court has now said that it has listed the case on July 14, a week before the festival, and after going through the arguments will decide the matter after the hearing. The plea has been filed by Manglaur residents — Iftakhar, Mahtab Alam, Saddam Husain and Sarfaraz. The plea argues that even though the functioning of any slaughterhouse in the Haridwar municipal area was already prohibited, the state government issued an order in March cancelling the NOCs for slaughterhouses even in the jurisdictions of smaller urban local bodies in the district. The petition also challenges the constitutional validity of section 237-A which was inserted by the state government into the Uttar Pradesh Municipalities Act. The section gives the power to the state government to declare any area under a municipal corporation, councilor, or nagar panchayat as a slaughter-free zone. The petition adds that in absence of any legally-run slaughterhouses, meat is being supplied to the residents from illegal establishments and therefore, the order is effectively supporting illegal slaughter. The petition added that the order is not only arbitrary but even violates Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Indian constitution by denying hygienic and fresh non-vegetarian food to people of Haridwar, across the limitations of religion and caste.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-gives-state-two-more-weeks-to-respond-to-petition-challenging-ban-on-slaughterhouses-in-haridwar/articleshow/83996662.cms||Prashant Jha

The couple is employed with United India Insurance Company Ltd. The man, Khushal Singh (38), has been accused of diverting money from the company’s accounts, and his wife, Neelam Singh (33), is mentioned as a beneficiary. Jaideep Sinha, deputy general manager of United India Insurance, lodged a complaint against Singh and others with the Marine Drive police. The case was later transferred to the EOW. “In the FIR the cheating amount was mentioned as Rs 8.09 crore. Singh, who worked in the accounts department, was a signatory authority for the company’s account with a leading bank in this case. In 21 transactions, he diverted Rs 8.09 crore to his eight personal accounts. The money was then further diverted to other accounts,” said an investigator. Singh had been working with the insurance firm’s Mumbai office since 2016. The offence took place between November 13 last year till April 23 this year. A team supervised by joint commissioner of police (EOW) Niket Kaushik is probing the case. “We arrested the husband and wife from Pune and produced them before a court. The couple has been remanded in police custody till July 5,” said chief investigator, inspector Mandar Lad. During the course of investigation, police got the records of another bank account wherein Singh was a signatory authority too. “In the latest development, we found that Singh had issued over 200 demand drafts, amounting to approximately Rs 121 crore in the name of individuals, third parties and more than 20 companies. Money was also paid/invested in real estate companies in Gurgaon,” said an officer. Police arrested Singh and Neelam on June 28 (Monday) under Sections 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Cde. Police have written to banks and got 40 accounts frozen where money was transferred.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/couple-on-insurance-co-rolls-held-for-rs-130cr-con/articleshow/84004645.cms||Mateen Hafeez

The couple, who had left their home about 10 months ago and returned Wednesday, were soon booked under CrPC section 151 (a police officer knowing of a design to commit any cognizable offence may arrest, without orders from a magistrate and without a warrant, the person so designing, if it appears to such officer that the commission of the offence cannot be otherwise prevented). Police can arrest anyone under this section without a warrant if it fears an urgent threat to public safety or order. The woman, who is a grandmother of two children, fell in love with the son-in-law who was half her age. After facing protests from the family members, they had fled from the house in Muzaffarnagar’s Mudbhar village. On Wednesday, the couple returned to the village and told the family members that they had registered their marriage in a court and now wanted to live together. Soon, a fight erupted. Not only the family members, but villagers joined the protest too. After getting information about the ruckus, a police team from Bhora Kalan area reached the village and took the couple into custody. Station house officer (SHO) Jitendar Tevatia said, “To prevent a clash, the couple were booked and sent to jail. A case was registered under section 151 of CrPC. Further investigation is on into the matter.” According to the provision of the section, police will have to produce the accused before a magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-mom-in-law-who-eloped-got-married-arrested-as-up-cops-fear-threat-to-public-order/articleshow/83996665.cms||Mohd Dilshad

In a directive dated June 29, the department has said if demolition is carried out during the monsoon, residents become homeless and they have to be housed in shelter homes. This adds to the pressure on these shelter homes, hence demolition of illegal structures and slums must not be carried out in the monsoon. The circular said the state level committee for control of homeless persons had also made these recommendations. The directive issued by deputy secretary, Shankar Jadhav, of the UDD refers to an earlier circular issued by the state revenue and forest department in 2001 which had asked local bodies to stop demolition of illegal slums, structures and encroachments during the monsoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/dont-demolish-illegal-bldgs-in-monsoon-state/articleshow/84003006.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The positivity rate of the city had increased to 40% in April but started dropping thereafter. The officials of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) said they are still conducting around 6,000 to 7,000 tests per day but the positivity rate has reduced significantly in the last month. According to Avesh Palod, NMC’s Covid officer, the infectivity of the coronavirus has reduced. Around 6,000 Covid tests are being conducted per day on an average.  The third wave of Covid is projected in the coming few months. Hence, the city residents need to maintain the Covid appropriate norms,” he said. Currently, the city has around 1,253 active patients, including 593 patients undergoing treatment in civic and private Covid hospitals. There had been a spike in Covid cases in September last year as the city had registered over 850 new cases per day on an average. The positivity rate was 40%. But then there was a continuous drop in the number of new cases. The positivity rate had reduced to 10% by January-end. But in March 2021, the city started recording 1,087 cases per day on average. In April so far, the city reported over 2,600 cases and the positivity rate had also increased to 40% in the first half of April. But both the number of cases and the positivity rate started reducing from the second half of May. The positivity rate had reduced to 7% by the first week of June. Of 6,294 Covid tests conducted in the city on Tuesday, only 39 of them, tested positive.

NMC had inspected over 1,500 bills of Covid patients from these nine hospitals and had found inflated bills, amounting to Rs 4.5 lakh, were issued to about 50 patients. The civic body has given an ultimatum of seven days to return the excess bill amount to the patients concerned. B G Sonkamble, the chief auditor of NMC, said they had collected over 1,500 bills of Covid patients from these nine hospitals, but we have found an excess amount charged from 50 patients. “We have served show-cause notices to these nine private Covid hospitals in the city,” said Sonkamble. NMC started a pre-audit of Covid patients’ bills in August last year. Since then, NMC appointed auditors have saved excess bills of Rs 5.84 crore of around 24,200 patients undergoing treatment in private hospitals. Pre-auditing of bills were made mandatory for private hospitals through the auditors before handing it over to the patients at the time of discharge. So far, the auditors have inspected around 57,000 bills and have found overcharging in over 24,200 bills. Since January, NMC auditors have saved excess bills of around Rs 2.18 crore. During the first phase of Covid, there were only 75 private Covid hospitals in the city and NMC had deployed auditors at all private Covid hospitals. The number of private Covid hospitals had increased to over 150 during the second wave. Hence, deploying auditors in the private hospitals was delayed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/9-pvt-hosps-get-show-cause-notices-for-overcharging/articleshow/83996671.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Kolkata||Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee launches student credit card, says scheme to help lakhs||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday launched the Student Credit Card scheme, which she described to be the biggest such project in the world. With this credit card, any Indian student staying in Bengal, who studies in Class X and above, can apply for loans at a low interest rate to pursue higher studies in India or abroad. The loan has to be paid back within 15 years. “The students can get Rs 10 lakh loan at one go or in phases as per their need and no guarantor will be needed for that. Because, the state government will stand as guaranteer,” the chief minister said while launching the scheme. “Anyone can apply to pursue a course so that the parents do not have to bother. It will help students to turn their dreams into reality.” Lakhs of students will be benefited from the scheme, she added. Students of Class X and above — to graduation, PG, PhD and post-doctoral level — may get loan under this scheme. Students can get the loan to prepare for competitive exams, for pursuing diploma courses and even for professional courses like MBBS. The CM said the nationalized banks and cooperative banks will provide the loan without any collateral security. The interest rate will be 4% and if paid during the study period, there will be a further rebate of 1%. Students can pay the course fee, tuition fee, examination fee through this card and it will be directly credited to the institutes. Up to 30% of the total sanctioned amount can be used for non-institutional purposes like purchasing books, computers and for study tours. The chief minister, however, asked the students to be cautious so that no fraud happens with the Student Credit Card. She advised them to visit only the Bengal government’s education department website or Egiye Bangla site for online application and not to approach any unauthorised person. The CM said it was one of her poll promises. "Students from Class X onwards will be eligible for this scheme." She said the state government had already implemented Taruner Swapno scheme and Rs 10,000 had been transferred to the bank accounts of 8.7 lakh students of Class-XII for buying tabs or mobiles to continue their studies online. This year, around 8.9 lakh students would be promoted to Class-XII level and they too would get the benefit. She said 70 lakh students enrolled under the Kanyashree project would be entitled to get this card. “There is no economic criteria for the students to get this card. All students can apply to be self-sufficient.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cm-launches-student-credit-card-says-scheme-to-help-lakhs/articleshow/84000664.cms||Debasis Konar

---||Lucknow||Vaccination, masks a must as the Covid enemy is devious||The Covid-19 pandemic has shaken the world with significant morbidity and mortality, affecting more than 18 crore people and killing more than 39 lakh in over 90 countries across continents. When a person gets affected, cells producing pathogen-specific antibodies multiply and increase proportionally, protecting humans from repeat infection. But antibodies produced naturally due to exposure may not provide 100% protection. With the virus changing its form again and again, augmenting the defence against it is common sense. Vaccines can help in fortifying the body’s response to new versions of the virus. A number of vaccines which have good-to-strong immunogenic response and are quite effective against the Covid-19 virus (SARS CoV-2) with an efficacy of 65% to 95% (depending on the type of antigenic material and basic constituent used in it) are available. Despite the risk of infection and complications post-exposure, a number of people remain reluctant to vaccines and ignore the importance of Covid-appropriate behaviour. Mutations are characteristic to viruses and more common in the type (RNA- based) to which Covid-19 belongs. Evidence suggests that RNA viruses have a greater tendency to mutate and are likely to have a number of mutations over time. No wonder multiple variants of SARS CoV-2—from alpha, to beta, gamma, delta and now delta plus—make headlines. Each new form has a good chance of being more contagious and lethal than the predecessor though the probability of the opposite is equally strong. Probably, people in general fail to understand that they were making it much easier for the virus to mutate and come back stronger and wreak havoc. The mortality and morbidity caused by delta variant in India for instance were much higher than that attributable to alpha. Likewise, delta plus is supposed to be more infectious and resistant to cocktail immunoglobulin antibodies. Adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour and getting vaccinated is something each one must do not just for individual benefit but also for the larger good. And unless the majority pitches in, the virus will continue to mutate and come back to haunt the human race. The government and healthcare workers are doing an excellent job with a target to vaccinate the maximum population at a very good pace. Once more than 60%-70% population is vaccinated and develops immunity, the risk of getting the infection will decrease. This will curtail the spread of the virus as well as minimize the risk of mutation. Covid-appropriate behaviour, on the other hand, is an equally effective tool to curb the virus. By simply wearing the correct mask, following social distance and washing hands with soap several times a day, one can prevent the entry of all types of corona variants in your respiratory passage and therefore, the infection. (The writer is consultant in charge ICU & chairman of the Covid containment committee at SGPGIMS) KNOW THE VIRUS What is natural immunity to Covid-19? After a person gets infected, the human immune system produces pathogen-specific antibodies which multiply and increase proportionally. Are natural antibodies enough? Not as of now, as coronavirus is fast changing its forms. The antibodies present in a person may not be strong enough to counter the new version. Can vaccines augment the impact of natural antibodies? To a good extent, as they trigger the same mechanism in which natural antibodies are created. How do vaccines protect from Covid-19? The vaccine contains antigen and when it is injected in the body it produces immunogenic response as a result of which antibodies are produced (through the B cells). How do mutations take place? Viruses tend to replicate or multiply and in this process their genes may undergo random “copying errors” which are called genetic mutations Why is Covid-19 virus changing so many times? Mutation is natural to viruses but is more common in RNA type viruses—the group to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs. As there are four or five variants of novel coronavirus, there is a good possibility of re-assortment and developing a new subtype of virus with antigens that are a mixture of the original strains. Can masks save one from new variants? Yes, to a large extent. They can check the entry of all types of corona variants in your respiratory passage and therefore, the infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vaccination-masks-a-must-as-the-covid-enemy-is-devious/articleshow/84003044.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Chamoli disaster: We did not act in a callous manner; state govt, disaster dept submit in court that they||Nainital: The Uttarakhand government and disaster management department on Wednesday filed an affidavit in the high court (HC) arguing that it is wrong to claim that they have not paid heed to the guidelines of the national disaster management policy of 2009 or that they acted callously which resulted in deaths of more than 200 people in the Rishianga flash floods in February. The 2009 policy states that it is essential to establish and modernise the early warning systems for all types of disasters. It adds that the nodal agencies responsible for surveillance shall identify technological gaps and plan for their upgrade in a time-bound manner. The affidavit was filed by the secretary, disaster management, SA Murugesan, in response to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) which alleged that many of the hydel projects in the upper Himalayan region lack early warning systems. The plea demands a stay on those projects which lack warning systems. The petition also alleged that many of the workers who died in the disaster are yet to be paid compensation. The state government agreed that the upper reaches of the Himalayas lack real-time monitoring and early warning systems and after the Chamoli floods, a need has been felt to address the gap. The affidavit said that the department has approached Central Water Commission (CWC), Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Defence Geoinformatics Research Establishment (DGRE) for installing these systems in the Dhauliganga and Rishiganga valleys. Meanwhile, NTPC informed the court that around 140 of its employees lost their lives in the floods and so far, it has deposited the compensation amount for 84 of them with the CJM Chamoli. “We are committed to paying compensation to the families of each of our employees. However, a certificate has to be sent by the administration of the district where the worker lived, certifying who is the legal heir of the person. We have written to the respective DMs and as soon as the responses come, we will pay the required compensation,” said Kartikey Hari Gupta, counsel representing NTPC. The central government is yet to respond to the petition. The court has now given them two more weeks to file a reply in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/chamoli-disaster-we-did-not-act-in-a-callous-manner-state-govt-disaster-dept-submit-in-court-that-they/articleshow/83996708.cms||Prashant Jha

Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay in his order said the allegations required thorough checking. It appears that the respondents concerned are under thorough misconception about the law of recruitment for the school teachers, the order stated. The petition filed in the HC alleged that prescribed rules were not being followed in the case. It also alleged irregularity in the distribution of marks by the SSC. Appearing for the petitioner, lawyer Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said several other petitions are pending with similar allegations against the SSC. The SSC counsel argued that the marks granted to the candidates could not be considered for the fresh selection process, which has been initiated following the HC order of December 11, 2020. The HC said it fails to understand how the marks against educational qualifications of the candidates can be altered as the selection process was set aside.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hc-stay-on-ssc-appointments/articleshow/84000682.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

While number of active cases of Covid across Nashik rural is now hovering at 1,150 there has been a spurt in hospitalization cases in Chandwad taluka which the health authorities have taken note of. “We are closely monitoring the patients in the rural areas. Every single spike or trigger is being looked into to ensure the spread of the disease remains confined to small pockets. In Chandwad, there is rise in hospitalization cases and we have called for the reports,” Bansod said. The number of Covid cases were in the higher range of two digits in the taluka given that the large number of positive cases were found through the Rapid Antigen Testing (RAT) carried out before vaccination. “The concern is that the number of people admitted to the Dedicated Covid Health Centres (DCHC) jumped from two to 17 in a span of seven days, while several others were admitted in Nashik city hospitals,” Dr Kailas Bhoye from District Health Office said. After enquiry the health teams noted that there were marriage celebrations in the taluka and had guests in large number. Bulk of the cases reported were from such celebrations and required hospitalization as they only came to fore after they reported symptoms. Many others who were also found positive are under home isolation. Two FIRs registered Meanwhile, rural police have also taken the note of the rise in the hospitalization of the cases. “We cannot overlook the rise in the cases when experts are warning about the third wave and the health department is doing its best in vaccinating the people. We have registered two cases in which more than 50 people have been booked,” superintendent of police (rural) Sachin Patil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/zp-ceo-calls-for-report-on-rise-in-covid-patients-in-chandwad/articleshow/83996736.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Not enough proof to keep Khar murder accused in jail, says court||MUMBAI: In a detailed order granting bail to 18-year-old Santacruz student Diya Padalkar, arrested in the New Year party murder of her childhood friend Jhanvi Kukreja, a sessions court observed that her mere presence at the spot and inability to explain her lip injury were not sufficient circumstances at this juncture to conclude that she committed the offence. “In my opinion, considering the facts and circumstances of the case…is not proper to keep the applicant (Padalkar) behind bars solely by way of punishment, as the entire case of the prosecution rests on the circumstantial evidence against the applicant,” judge M M Umar said. In contrast, rejecting the bail plea of her co-accused Shree Jogdhankar (22), the court said his role appeared to be “totally different” and there was material evidence against him. “…it appears that there is ample material even at this stage, prima facie, leading to an inference of there being reasonable grounds for believing that applicant (Jogdhankar) is guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life,” it said. The court refuted Jogdhankar’s claims that he too was attacked. “At this juncture, there is no material on record to show that someone entered the building, Bhagwati Heights, and assaulted the applicant from his back,” it said. The court said that investigations disclosed that Jogdhankar was aggressive and hot-tempered. “Thus, considering the conduct, attitude and nature of applicant, and material on record, apprehension of prosecution (that he will tamper with evidence and influence witnesses) appears reasonable and proper,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-not-enough-proof-to-keep-khar-murder-accused-in-jail-says-court/articleshow/84003053.cms||Rebecca Samervel

A few motorists said the work seems like it has been done without any supervision of the department concerned. When no speed breaker has been marked with proper signage, how is such a thing allowed by the PWD, who must have given the permission for road cutting, said a two-wheeler rider. The locals who spoke to TOI from this place said that this work has been done in a haphazard manner and hence this hump is created. Work has been done in a similar manner in three other places within 3kms on the way to Margao from here. In other two places, depressions have been created, as the sand has settled and the cement concrete has depressed creating hunches. When TOI spoke to PWD NH66 assistant engineer Subhash Pagi, he said that permission for laying of pipes for the JICA-funded work was allowed and they were told to rebuild the cutting to its original position.

The vaccination for lactating mothers started about one-and-a-half weeks ago and since then, the pace is steadily increasing across the district though hesitancy still exists in rural areas. “Vaccination of lactating women was initially not allowed. As a result, this group did not get the shots even when vaccination was okayed for beneficiaries above the age of 18. As the government has now allowed the same, we have asked all our officials to start vaccinating lactating mothers,” Dr Ajita Salunkhe, vaccination coordinator for Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), said. The response from lactating mothers in the rural areas is still on the lower side and health staff are trying their best to convince them, but it is consuming a lot of time. “We have started awareness campaigns in rural areas. Initially due to the misinformation, the lactating mothers would not turn up to the vaccination centres. But when some of the lactating mothers, who were also self-help group (SHG) members, were counselled, they came forward for vaccination. Since then things have started changing in bigger villages – especially those having the primary health centres,” additional district health officer Dr Ravindra Chaudhary said. Vaccine only in tribal blocks Meanwhile, after having carried out vaccination at a large scale during the past several days, the vaccination stock has depleted as a result of which none of the vaccination centres operated on Wednesday except for the ones in tribal areas. “Now the vaccines are being delivered as per population size. Since the people in tribal areas have not been taking vaccines, they have enough stock with them and vaccination is being carried out in those blocks,” Chaudhary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-dist-more-than-400-lactating-women-vaccinated/articleshow/83996723.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Vaccination Express of Muzaffarnagar wheels in accessibility||When the process of Covid-19 vaccinations began in January, apart from hesitancy, the problem of accessibility was the major hindrance to the drive. While the health department, administration and agencies assisting in the campaign worked hard, it took some time before numbers started to rise. Administration and health officers in all districts were brainstorming daily on steps to be taken to ramp up vaccination, especially in small towns and rural areas. It was in one such meeting in Muzaffarnagar district that the idea of Vaccination Express came up late in March. A feeder service between people and vaccination sites, it took care of one major hurdle. “We could see that for senior citizens living alone or people in villages, the commute to a health centre or camp meant taking public transport, spending money or walking for long stretches, which was not feasible. The answer lay in a bus service and Covid-19 Vaccination Express took off,” district magistrate Selvakumari Jayarajan told TOI. The service began in the city for senior citizens but has been extended to rural areas. Vaccination Express bus picks beneficiaries from their doorstep, takes them to the vaccination site and drops them back home after the jab. It is a simple solution but has helped immensely, said the DM. The beneficiaries were identified with the help of ASHA and Anganwadi workers who conducted surveys and made a database of citizens who needed help. School buses were put on the job and decorated with flowers and balloons. A banner identified the bus as ‘Covid-19 Vaccination Express’. A follow-up visit was made for the second shot in the same way. The service was inaugurated on March 22 by Union minister of state Sanjeev Baliyan, minister of state and Muzaffarnagar MLA Kapil Dev Aggarwal, district magistrate Jayarajan, chief medical officer Dr Mahaveer Singh Faujdar and health officials. “About five buses are plying at the moment and make 10-12 trips daily, depending on demand. Village heads have shown great response to the service as it is easier to convince people now,” said Tarannum, district mobilization coordinator for UNICEF, which is assisting the government in the vaccination drive. About 20,000 people have benefited from the Vaccination Express service till now, she said. The service also ensures optimum use of resources and reduces wastage, added Jayarajan. “All buses have been full since the beginning of the campaign. The health team is also aware that these many people are coming and they are prepared accordingly. This helps reduce wastage of all kinds,” said the DM. With increased awareness and more vaccination booths since June 21, the service has been even more localised. “At the village level now, instead of buses, we are using e-rickshaws where distance is short,” said the DM, adding that this has helped cater to a larger number of people in day. “About 13,000 vaccinations are being done in a day and we plan to increase the number further,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vaccination-express-of-muzaffarnagar-wheels-in-accessibility/articleshow/84003101.cms||Rashi Lal

From donating medical supplies to distributing ration packets, religious groups and spiritual centres are helping people regardless of their faith. The officials of the gurdwara, situated in Race Course, Dehradun, have been providing people with free food since the outbreak of the pandemic and during the second wave of the virus, they also started providing oxygen cylinders to the needy. Jusbir Anand, who comes for volunteer service at the gurdwara, told TOI, “A group of 15 people who come to this gurdwara has been distributing ration, sanitisers, sanitary pads, medicines and other such items to the people in need.” The Shiv Shakti Mandir in Dehradun is also reaching out to pandemic-hit households. “We have been distributing sanitisers, masks, ration kits, oximeters, steam inhalers, and thermometers, among others, to the needy," said Ashish Thapa, a member of the Shiv Shakti Mandir board.Similarly, Mustaqueem Hasan, the principal of Dehradun-based Abdul Kamal Azad madrassa and a local qazi (adjudicator), Ahmed Qazi, have jointly set up a Covid care facility in the Majra locality of the state capital. A group of 15-20 volunteers is helping with this initiative. “So far, we have provided free treatment to nearly 100 patients. We also conducted a drive under which medical consultation was provided to Covid-affected families,” Hasan told TOI. The Shiv Shakti Mandir in Dehradun is also reaching out to pandemic-hit households. “We have been distributing sanitisers, masks, ration kits, oximeters, steam inhalers, and thermometers, among others, to the needy," said Ashish Thapa, a member of the Shiv Shakti Mandir board. Several spiritual organisations have also come forward to help the people in need during the pandemic. Rajeev Kumar Lamba, president of Dehradun-based Shiva Trust, a spiritual organisation, told TOI, “We have been providing food packets to people from economically weak backgrounds. Since April this year, we have distributed ration kits to approximately 300 people.” Yogoda Satsanga Sakha Ashram, a renowned spiritual centre at Dwarahat in Almora, is also donating medicines and food in the rural areas of Almora. Vrinda Desh Pandey, a full-time volunteer at the ashram, told TOI, “We have donated a fully-equipped ambulance to the CMO office at Dwarahat and conducted medical camps in villages for 15 days. Dry ration kits, oximeters, thermometers were also distributed in several villages. We have also sent out masks, sanitisers and medicines to the SDM’s office and Dwarahat MLA for distribution among people.” (By Ashita Kapoor)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/religious-spiritual-institutions-come-to-the-aid-of-covid-hit-families-in-uttarakhand/articleshow/83998776.cms||---
---||Jaipur||BJP accuses Ashok Gehlot of defaming RSS||JAIPUR: The state BJP has slammed the Gehlot government for falsely implicating RSS leader Nimbaram in a case related to bribery by misusing the ACB aiming to defame the Sangh and keep the Congress high command in Delhi happy. Deputy leader of the opposition, Rajendra Singh Rathore, who jointly addressed a press conference with former BJP state president Arun Chaturvedi on Wednesday, said the ACB had filed a case against the RSS leader under CRPC Section 41(i) without meeting the three basic components. “It appears to be a first case in which neither anyone had approached ACB with a complaint nor a tip-off had been generated. Even no one raised any suspicion on those names in the complaint. The strange thing is that no one has claimed that somebody is trying to provide any favour to anyone,” said Rathore. The ACB has named Nimbaram as the one present in the leaked video with his involvement in the alleged deal between arrested Rajaram Gurjar, husband of former JMC-Greater mayor Somya Gurjar, and BVG official Omkar. Later in the day, former CM Vasundhara Raje accused CM Ashok Gehlot of distracting people’s attention from the real issues by misusing government agencies to defame both the BJP and the RSS. Questioning the authenticity of the leaked videos and audio files, Rathore asked why the state hadn’t taken a second opinion from the FSL testing lab in Telangana. “The normal practice is that the state takes a second opinion on evidence from the central government-run labs. Sending audio files to Telangana instead of a central government’s lab was part of a conspiracy to get a report favourable to the government,” said Rathore. Both the leaders sqaid BJP would oppose the move of filing an FIR against the RSS leader. They termed the move ‘immoral’ to defame a nationalist organisation like the RSS to distract people’s attention from their failures. “If you look at history, Congress has always resorted to the tactic of implicating RSS in fake cases. They will never succeed in their plans,” said Chaturvedi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-accuses-gehlot-of-defaming-rss/articleshow/84003093.cms||---

Archbishop Thomas D Souza and Bishop Paritosh Canning held meetings on Wednesday evening as fresh guidelines till July 15 have been issued by the state. Both said nothing has been clearly mentioned about religious institutions, so they are taking cautious steps to reopen with self-imposed restrictions. Both church heads have ensured that all priests and church workers have been vaccinated. They have also requested that all those who wish to enter to pray are vaccinated. “We are reopening on Thursday but will not allow more than 20 people inside at any given time. All our 65 churches have been sanitized. Temperature checks and hand sanitization will be done at the entrance and masks must be in place. We have arranged socially distanced seating too,” said D Souza. Bishop Canning instructed the 35 churches under CNI to allow only those who can come for individual worship. Till July 15, online services will be held. It is likely that CNI churches will open up to physical services on July 18 . “We are asking all to come only after they after they are vaccinated,” Canning said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/safety-net-in-place-as-churches-open/articleshow/84000702.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Mumbai||Today, Mumbai Samachar is 200 years old||Mumbai: It has seen two World Wars, two pandemics and watched Mumbai evolve into India’s financial capital. On July 1, Fort-based Gujarati daily, Mumbai Samachar, enters its 200th year. Its director, Hormusji N Cama, credits the daily’s longevity to “content”. “Our readers are loyal to us because of the content we give. We criticize but our criticism is constructive,” said Cama whose grandfather Muncherji Cama bought the paper from the Belgaumwala family in 1933. The story of how it came into the Cama family is interesting. The Cama family supplied newsprint and ink to Mumbai Samachar. They approached court over non-payment of dues and sought the paper’s liquidation. The judge, though, asked the Camas to take over the paper as shutting it would have rendered its employees jobless. Founded on July 1, 1822, it was initially a weekly and called Moombina Samachar. It became a bi-weekly in 1832 and a daily in 1855. Editor Nilesh Dave said, “The entire year we will try to promote the Gujarati language and readers through theatre, essay competitions and by roping in writers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/today-mumbai-samachar-is-200-years-old/articleshow/84003111.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Uddhav govt decides to continue with PM Crop Insurance Scheme||Mumbai: After looking at a different crop insurance model which would set limits on the profit margin for insurers, the MVA government has finally decided to continue with the Prime Minister’s Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) or crop insurance scheme. The last date for enrolment is July 15. MVA regime had set up a cabinet sub-committee to study the issue but it finally decided in favour of PMFBY, sources said. Many states have exited PMFBY, including Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Telangana, Bihar.Sources say it would have been difficult for the state to manage the pay-out of premiums for crop insurance without the Centre bearing part of the burden. Under PMFBY, the farmer pays around 2% of the premium while the rest is split between the Centre and state.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had written to Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, pointing out that premiums paid to insurance firms in the state in the last five years outstripped claims paid to farmers. While premium since 2016 amounted to Rs 23,180 crore, claims paid amounted to Rs 15,622 crore.Thackeray suggested the state be allowed to implement a crop insurance model introduced in Beed district, where a portion of the unused premium has to be returned to the government in a good year.However, the agriculture ministry turned down the request, saying it will need time to study the proposal. For the current kharif season, it asked the state to continue with PMFBY. Under PMFBY, payouts can extend up to 350% of the premium. If claims paid are less than the premium, the insurance company can keep the amount that remains.Last year, drought-prone Beed district did not receive bids from private insurers. The state asked the public sector Agricultural Insurance Company to step in. The company’s risk extends to 110% of premium paid, with claims beyond that being borne by the state. However, if the claim amount is less than the premium, then the insurer can keep up to 20% of the premium amount remaining. The rest has to be returned to the state. This is known as a cup and cap model. Farmers activist Rajan Kshirsagar feels neither PMFBY nor the Beed model are beneficial to farmers. “In neither scheme is the farmer receiving adequate compensation. On that front, neither model does justice,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-uddhav-govt-decides-to-continue-with-pm-crop-insurance-scheme/articleshow/84003205.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||Pune||Pune: Loni Kalbhor man held for multiple card swap frauds||PUNE: The Wanowrie police have arrested a 25-year-old Loni Kalbhor resident, who is suspected to be behind a series of card swap frauds at ATM kiosks across the city. The police found Rs3.5 lakh and 17 cards from the man, Shravan Minjagi, who is originally from Solapur and has been living at Loni Kalbhor in rural Pune for quite some time. “Minjagi would loiter around ATM kiosks to keep an eye on elderly people or individuals not familiar with making ATM transactions. He would then offer help to such individuals. In the process, he would replace their cards with bogus ones and also secure the personal identification numbers (PIN). Later, he would make withdrawals using the genuine cards and PINs,” said senior inspector Deepak Lagad on Wednesday. Minjagi has duped six persons in Pune in such a manner, the police said. Four cases relating to cheating and theft under sections 420 and 379 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), respectively, were registered with the Wanowrie, Loni Kalbhor, Hadapsar and the Cantonment police stations since June 22. “Minjagi is a criminal on police record with 11 cases registered to his name with the Pune rural, Solapur, Osmanabad and also the Karnataka Police since 2016. He was earlier doing some small-time jobs and later took to duping people at ATMs for making easy money. He would use the money for merry making and living a comfortable life,” Lagad said. A police team, led by assistant inspector Jaywant Jadhav, arrested Minjagi on June 23 after his images were captured on a CCTV camera while he was diverting attention of a 61-year-old retired SRPF policeman, stealing the latter’s PIN and replacing his card with an inoperative card at an ATM at Jagtap Chowk in Wanowrie on June 7. Minjagi subsequently used the policeman’s card for withdrawing Rs80,000 from ATMs and purchasing a gold ring from a jewellery store on June 7. The incident came to light after the policeman’s wife started receiving text messages on her cellphone of the money debited from her husband’s bank account. “Minjagi used to mostly communicate in Marathi and Hind. He has duped six people to the tune of Rs1,85,500 in the city since April 16. We have summoned debit card holders for getting more details of the crime committed by him at other places in the city. We plan to register more FIRs against him,” said Lagad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/loni-kalbhor-man-held-for-multiple-card-swap-frauds/articleshow/84000715.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: BVG manager arrested but no action against company||JAIPUR: The arrest of the manager of BVG company, which is responsible for garbage collection here, has hardly made any impact in the functioning of the firm. Omkar Sapre was arrested by the ACB on Tuesday for offering bribe to the husband of the mayor to clear the company’s dues. The firm has claimed that JMC needs to pay around Rs 280 crore dues. Lawyer Vimal Chaudhary said, “After such serious claims have been raised against company officials, a fresh inquiry into the affairs of the company should be made by a retired high court judge. Every aspect of the company should be thoroughly checked and action should be taken against the firm.” According to official sources, Rs 200 crore has already been paid to the company by the corporation since March 2017. After the division of corporations, an alternative agreement was signed between the corporation and company. In an audio that went viral, the BVG manager was allegedly heard asking Rajaram Gurjar to convince his wife mayor Somya Gurjar to sign the agreement in exchange of Rs 5 crore. Despite allegations of corruption, no one has talked about blacklisting the company. A senior official of JMC-Greater said, “If we blacklist the company, there is no alternative available at present. Once we blacklist the company, sanitation condition of the entire city will come to a standstill. We need to find an alternate solution and move forward.” A JMC-Greater councillor said, “ We have already provided 50 hoopers to the BVG company for garbage collection and 100 hoopers in JMC-Heritage. When BVG called the strike recently, mayor Somya Gurjar wanted to hire 100 vehicles for garbage collection on a temporary basis. Although this wasn’t needed, there can be an alternate arrangements in the corporation if any action is taken against the BVG company.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bvg-manager-arrested-but-no-action-against-company/articleshow/84003150.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: FIR against job aspirant 4 years after SRPF’s plaint||PUNE: The Wanowrie police on Tuesday registered a case of cheating and forgery against a man from Ahmednagar and his accomplice, almost four years after the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF), Group-II, had furnished a complaint application against him for submitting a bogus medical certificate during a recruitment drive in 2017. The case was filed only after the Pune divisional commissioner’s office last year raised a query with the police if a chargesheet had been filed in the matter, in response to the man’s representation seeking a pardon for his mistake and giving him the police job. Mangesh Shinde, the commandant of SRPF Group-II, told TOI, “During the final phase of the recruitment drive in 2017, the SRPF authorities had asked the man to undergo a medical test at the state-run Sassoon General Hospital and furnish a medical report. The man did not go to the hospital and, instead, got a forged medical report done by an accomplice before submitting the same with the SRPF authorities.” Shinde said, “The forgery came to notice during the scrutiny of documents and the SRPF had then filed a complaint application with the Wanowrie police. The plea was since pending action and it was only after the divisional commissioner’s query that the police re-verified the matter and decided to register an FIR for cheating and forgery.” He said, “The police had earlier merged our complaint application with another case (related to SRPF recruitment scam) though the incident was different. We again pursued the matter with the Wanowrie police. In the second week of June this year, we again filed an application to take action against the recruitment candidate. The police then finally registered our FIR.” The police said, “The SRPF had then sent a letter to the hospital for verifying the medical certificate. The hospital replied that the certificate was not genuine. The SRPF again referred the man to the hospital and got his medical examination conducted. This time, he cleared the examination but the SRPF decided not to recruit him because he had submitted a forged certificate.” The police said, “During a preliminary inquiry conducted by the Wanowrie police in 2017, the youth had admitted that what he had done was wrong. He later made a representation to the Pune divisional commissioner and other forums that he should be recruited because he had qualified in the medical examination and his name was kept in the waiting list. The divisional commissioner’s office had raised a query if a chargesheet was filed in the case.” Senior inspector Deepak Lagad of the Wanowrie police said, “The police officer then handling the matter kept the inquiry pending for a very long time and did not register an FIR. Now, we realised that the officer had made a mistake. We took a fresh complaint application from the SRPF, conducted preliminary inquiry based on the documents given by them and registered an FIR. I have submitted a report to my superior to initiate departmental action against the officer.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fir-against-job-aspirant-4-years-after-srpfs-plaint/articleshow/84000727.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Anti-Corruption Bureau to check if BVG inflated dues||JAIPUR: The Rajasthan Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) will investigate if the outstanding dues of Rs 276 crore claimed by sanitation company BVG was inflated. DG (ACB) BL Soni said they were investigating to find out see what led to the company continue to operate despite so much of its accumulated dues not being cleared for over 20 months. “The ACB is looking into the overall payment gamut in this case, including outstanding bills,” he said. The sources in ACB said the verification of outstanding bills will begin very soon to check the veracity of the dues. Meanwhile, the ACB on Wednesday also presented suspended JMC-Greater mayor’s husband Rajaram Gurjar and the sanitation company’s employee Omkar Sapre in court. Both were arrested Tuesday. The court later sent the two accused to two days’ custody. The ACB officials said both Gurjar and Sapre will be inquired about their alleged murky dealings which were revealed in a video that emerged later showing Gurjar negotiating a commission of Rs 20 crore for releasing outstanding dues of Rs 276 crore to the company by JMC. The ACB had begun a probe soon after the video had emerged and subsequently filed a preliminary inquiry. The video and audio recordings were sent for forensic examination. The forensic report confirmed the video, following which the ACB arrested Gurjar and Sapre. The agency filed a case under the prevention of corruption act and immediately began further investigating. The ACB had also lodged a case against another employee of the BVG, Sandeep Choudhary, and one Nimbaram. The sources said they suspect Choudhary to be one of the persons who had recorded the video of the conversation from a mobile phone during which these under-the-table commission negotiations were discussed. “We will also question Choudhary about his role. It appears that both Choudhary and Sapre wanted to resort to pressure tactics to get the outstanding payment of their company,” an official claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/acb-to-check-if-bvg-inflated-dues/articleshow/84003170.cms||---
---||Delhi||Dwarka honour killing case: Woman’s cousin among 2 arrested||NEW DELHI: Police have arrested the cousin of 19-year-old Kiran Dahiya, who was shot at and injured while her husband was killed in a case of suspected ‘honour’ killing in Dwarka last Thursday. The cousin, Rohit Dahiya alias Vicky, is the son of Kiran’s maternal uncle, Mahavir Singh, who was earlier picked up by Delhi Police for questioning. Vicky’s friend Ritik, 22, who was also involved in the shooting incident, was also arrested. Police said Ritik is involved in three other criminal cases. On June 24, a group opened fire on Vinay Dahiya, 23, and his wife Kiran in Amberhai village in Dwarka, killing the former. Kiran told the police that her brother Aman and cousin Vicky were among those who had attacked them. Vinay and Kiran had eloped and got married in August 2020 against the wishes of the latter’s family, which was against the marriage because the two belonged to the same gotra. Santosh Meena, DCP (Dwarka) said on Wednesday, “Investigations revealed that at least four persons were involved in the attack. Two of the accused were identified as Aman Dahiya, brother of Kiran Dahiya, and Vicky, cousin of Kiran Dahiya. The technical investigation involved call detail records and location analysis of several suspected persons. Their social media accounts were also scanned to gather connecting leads.” Meena said local intelligence was also mounted. The accused were arrested in Haryana and brought to Delhi. During interrogation, they told the cops that Aman had hatched a conspiracy to kill both Kiran and Vinay. Apparently, Aman was able to flee from the clutches of police because he is backed by jailed gangster Tillu Tajpuriya. Aman is believed to have been involved in a murder case four years ago. DCP Meena added, “According to the arrested duo, Aman made a plan with them plus another individual. A day before the incident, Aman did a recce of his sister’s rented house in Amberhai. On the day of the incident, the four accused arranged weapons and reached the village in two cars, one being a Scorpio. They found the couple’s house bolted, but not locked. Three of them, namely Aman, Rohit and Ritik, went in and asked the fourth person to bolt the door from outside. Around 8.30pm, the couple entered their house and the accused fired at them. After the incident, all the suspects fled to Rohtak, where Aman took the weapons from Rohit and Ritik and discarded their mobile phones. They then parted ways, according to claims of the arrested men.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/honour-killing-womans-cousin-among-2-arrested/articleshow/84000743.cms||---
---||Pune||Residents of 12 villages in Khed launch dharna against Eastern Ring Road project||PUNE: Farmers from 12 villages at Khed taluka in Pune district have started an indefinite sit-in protest against the proposed Eastern Ring Road project for which their land would be acquired by the state government. The protesting farmers are from Khalumbre, Nigoje, Kuruli, Moi, Alandi, Charoli, Chimbli, Kelgaon, Markal, Dhanore, Solu and Golegaon villages. The proposed 103km road would pass through 46 villages of Maval, Khed, Haveli, Daund and Purandar tehsils for which the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) and the district administration would acquire 1,585 hectares of land, said officials. The project is at the stage of measurement of land for acquisition process and the villagers have raised concerns over the state acquiring fertile land and giving them no clear idea about the compensation package. The villagers are sitting in protest for the last three days outside the office of sub-divisional officer, Khed, to draw attention of the authorities to their grievances. Patilbua Gawari, a resident of village Moi, who is leading the protest, said, “We have held meetings with revenue officials, SDO Khed Vikrant Chavan and MSRDC officials. They said that they would not go ahead with the land measurement process until our concerns are addressed. However, the officials have begun the work of measuring land for the project without fulfilling the promise made to us. We tried to meet SDO Khed, but he avoided us.” Chavan didn’t reply to phone calls and text messages sent by TOI on Wednesday. Kiran Mungse, a farmer from Kelgaon village, said, “We have been urging the authorities to acquire the barren land owned by the district administration. How can they acquire fertile and proper irrigated land for the project? Many of the villagers are totally dependent on farming. The government will pay us compensation, but with that we will not be able to buy land of equal value in Pune district. We will have to migrate to other district.” Another protester, Sachin Yelwande from Alandi, pointed out that over 100 houses and hundreds of acres of land would be acquired for the project. “If they make some changes in the project, many of our issues / concerned will be addressed amicably. But the government is adamant on the project, which is against farmers. We are protesting peacefully, but many of us are already frustrated,” Yalwande added. Pratap Ghenand, a farmer from Markal, said he would be landless if his entire five acres of project irrigated fertile land are acquired by the government for the project. “Farming is the only source of income for us and we have been into sugarcane farming for the last two decades. If the government takes away our land, where will we get this type of land? The government should make some changes in ring road design to help us avoid such troubles,” said Ghenand. Sandeep Patil executive engineer, MSRDC, said, “We have tried to address some of the issues in the meetings held with farmers in the last few weeks. However, some of them are not satisfied with our solution. We are again going to hold meetings with them in days to come.” Regarding changes in the design of the project and acquisition of fertile land, Patil clarified that the project has been designed and approved by experts. “But we will discuss these issues with senior officials of MSRDC and district administration in meetings,” added Patil. The MSRDC has carried out measurement of land at Chimbli village in Khed. It has planned to carry out the drive in other villages in Haveli tehsil as well, said Patil.

---||Jaipur||Why ACB not arresting RSS man in bribe case, says Govind Singh Dotasra||JAIPUR: Rajasthan Congress has questioned the functioning of a police wing under its own party government for failing to arrest an RSS functionary allegedly involved in a bribe deal between the husband of a suspended Jaipur mayor and a sanitation company’s employee. Congress state president and school education minister Govind Singh Dotasra held a press conference here on Wednesday and demanded the arrest of Nimbaram, an accused in the Rs 20-cr bribe deal that led the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) to arrest suspended mayor Somya Gurjar’s husband Rajaram Gurjar and BVG company’s employee Omkar Sapre a day earlier. “Why is the ACB not arresting RSS pracharak Nimbaram even though his presence in the video exposing the bribe deal has been established by forensic reports?” Dotasra asked. He added, “I will talk to the state government to immediately arrest Nimbaram and bring to fore other people too covertly involved in the bribery.” On being asked why he was feeling compelled to hold a press conference to demand the arrest from his party government, Dotasra replied, “The way the Modi-government is goading state governments, these people can do anything. Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat recently lodged a complaint in Delhi to counter a FIR registered here (in phone tapping case). We are not raising a finger on our government but want swift action against people involved in corruption.” Dotasra said, “There is evidence of BJP-RSS being neck deep in corruption. The entire state is talking that the husband of a BJP mayor demanded 10% commission in RSS office in the presence of a key RSS functionary in lieu of releasing Rs 276-cr to BVG company, whose audio-video had gone viral on social media.” “BJP and RSS call themselves honest, nationalist and disciplined but these organisations have now been exposed. BJP and RSS people are committing corruption even in the name of religion. The Ram Mandir trust purchased a Rs 2-cr land for Rs 18.5-cr from donation money,” said Dotasra. In 2017, the then Jaipur mayor Ashok Lahoti, who is a sitting BJP MLA, started door-to-door garbage collection through BVG sanitation company. The alleged bribe deal struck recently was for releasing Rs 276-cr to the company, which courted controversies over violating the contract conditions and for failing in regular collection of garbage. Box: On nominating District Congress Committee presidents, party state president Govind Singh Dotasra said the district in-charges would recommend names that will be considered by the PCC and forwarded to the party high command for approval. Dotasra said the district presidents would be declared by July 15. On the issue of employing computer teachers, Dotasra said whenever the recruitment would take place it would be done on a permanent basis. “I have asked the officials to find an honourable solution to the issue. The Gehlot-government is sensitive to educated unemployed youths,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/why-acb-not-arresting-rss-man-in-bribe-case-dotasra/articleshow/84003211.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Avinash Bhosale to skip ED summons, cites Covid crisis||Mumbai: Pune businessman Avinash Bhosale has cited the Covid crisis to avoid appearing before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday. The ED as part of a probe into a money-laundering case had summoned Bhosale and his son, Amit, for questioning on Thursday and Friday, respectively. This is the second summons issued to Bhosale after he failed to turn up. Amit has not sought any exemption. ED officials have registered the money-laundering case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) based on a cheating case filed by Pune police against Bhosale, his son and others a few years ago along with his company Avinash Bhosale Infrastructure Pvt Ltd (ABIL). It is alleged there was a plan to construct a residential building for bureaucrats on a plot in Pune. Bhosale, though, had purchased the plot after manipulating the rules and constructed a commercial structure. Earlier, the ED had searched Bhosale’s premises in Pune and Kolhapur and collected documents for examination. It is also investigating two separate cases of Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) violations cases against the Bhosale family. Bhosale allegedly invested abroad violating foreign exchange rules. In one of the two cases, the ED recently seized Bhosale’s assets worth Rs 40 crore in India under Section 37-A of FEMA, for investing in Dubai. If a person has invested an amount abroad after violating the FEMA rules, Section 37-A authorises the government to seize his equivalent value assets in India. The attached assets include 50% equity shares of Bhosale and his son in Classic City Investments Pvt Ltd; the remaining half share is with a hotelier. Classic City Investments, which owns three luxury hotels in Pune, Nagpur and Goa, wrote to the agency that they are blocking the seized share in the name of the ED, thus blocking the Bhosales from interfering in their businesses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-avinash-bhosale-to-skip-ed-summons-cites-covid-crisis/articleshow/84003251.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Jaipur||Overcoming Stress And Fatigue, They Battle Virus||JAIPUR: In both personal and profession fronts, doctors have been battling hard for over a year. With unshaken determination, they are continuously beating mental, emotional and physical exhaustion to ensure proper treatment of Covid patients without being worried about their own lives.On the eve of Doctors’ Day, a virtual programme was organised by Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Society (PHNHS) and Mahatma Gandhi Hospital (MGH) on Wednesday. Governor Kalraj Mishra, who was the chief guest at the programme said, this day is dedicated to those who have devoted their lives for saving others.“This year’s Doctors’ Day is special and overwhelming and we are observing it with a heavy heart because we lost 79 practitioners to the virus in the past one year while performing their duties,” said Dr Vijay Kapoor, secretary PHNHS.MGH chairperson Dr ML Swarnkar said for doctors, life of every patient is precious as they put every possible effort to save it.Doctors in different hospitals are working with the same mission. At an age of 60, Dr Sudhil Kalra of CK Birla Hospital ensure that he visit his patients daily without bothering about his own life. “When I got infected with Covid and my wife and son also contracted the virus, all kind of thoughts were coming in my mind. We were in different rooms in quarantine. But, after recovery, I resumed work to serve the patients,” said Dr Kalra.Overcoming mental, physical and emotional exhaustion, doctors performed their duties. “Many a times, we were devastated after seeing lives being lost. We work relentlessly as a team and our families always support us. Mental hazard was an outcome of such responsibilities but we overcame by comprehensive approach,” said Dr RS Khedar, director, internal medicine & critical care, Eternal Hospital.Recalling the second wave, doctors said they have to fight in two different fronts — professional and personal. “There were also days when many of us did not see our families, just to keep them safe and to ensure that we do not become the carriers of the virus for them. It has been the hardest of times to show empathy to the patient’s families, while we were ourselves facing anxiety, depression and stress,” said Dr Pankaj Anand, senior consultant critical care & ICU at Fortis Escorts Hospital, Jaipur, adding that the second wave was like a nightmare for the medical fraternity.Doctors felt devastated witnessing increased number of deaths in the second wave. “The number of severely sick patients in a short span of time was very high, and we had to face high mortality this time. It was overwhelming to watch patients succumb suddenly and being a doctor, there is a feeling of loss. Nevertheless, we have to regulate our emotions and continue treating patients. There is also the added responsibility of calming the nerves of the patients and their families,” said Dr Shalini Rathore, nodal officer, Covid at Mahila Chikitsalaya.Doctors find it mentally taxing as they had to turn down Covid patients due to the lack of resources like beds, oxygen, and medicines. “During the second wave, we had to deal with an enormous number of critical patients everyday, we fell short on healthcare staff and also on providing ventilator beds and oxygen. We worked beyond our capacity to save every life,” said Dr Arun Agarwal, director, internal medicine, Fortis Escorts Hospital, Jaipur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/overcoming-stress-and-fatigue-they-battle-virus/articleshow/84003254.cms||---

The stock at the end of June this year was the highest in five years. Heavy spells of rain increased the water levels in the dams in the division. The state irrigation department’s data revealed that in 2019, the dams collectively had 7% water stock, while in 2018 and 2017 the stocks in the major dams in Pune division were around 22% and 16%, respectively. The state irrigation department’s data revealed that the five dams that supplied water to the city — Khadakwasla, Temghar, Varasgaon, Panshet and Bhama Askhed — now held over 3.5 TMC additional stock, compared to the same time last year. Officials from the state irrigation department said that according to the data of past years, the catchments of the major dams in Pune division received heavy spells in July and August. This year, good spells were also recorded in June and it had led to the increase in water stock. “The Pune division includes Satara, Kolhapur and Sangli districts. The dams located in all these districts have also recorded fairly goods spells of rain and rise in water stock. In the coming months, we are expecting similar spells, which could push the water-levels further”, an official said. Stock in most dams in Satara and Kolhapur districts were around 30% of their respective live stock capacities, including Koyna with 37% live stock at the end of June and Radhanagari at 25%. The collective stock in the four dams — Khadakwasla, Temghar, Varasgaon and Panshet — that supply water to the city was at 8.61 TMC (29.5%) on Wednesday while the storage of Bhama Askhed was 3.23 TMC (42%). VP Patil, the executive engineer of Khadakwasla irrigation circle, said that the inflow of rain water in reservoirs had reduced in the last three days because of subdued rainfall in the catchments. The existing stock in dams had been kept reserved to meet the drinking water requirements. The water-levels in the reservoirs were being checked on a daily basis, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/35-dams-in-division-hold-7-more-stock-than-last-yr/articleshow/84000793.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Delhi||RFID: Fine on defaulters on hold pending air panel nod||NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) will restrict the entry of commercial vehicles without valid Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags or sufficient recharge into Delhi from July 1 at all the toll points. However, the civic body has put on hold its decision to impose a penalty on defaulting commercial vehicles for now for want of permission from the commission for air quality management in the capital. Officials say that the RFID system has been activated at all 124 toll points but 11 of those, where farmers are sitting on strike, are non-operational. “At all toll points, the concessionaire has been directed to collect the tax online or return the vehicle. We have decided to start the videography of toll plazas soon to check the implementation of directions,” said an SDMC official. “To make people abide by the norms, we had written to the commission to give us authority for collecting double the amount of toll tax (as penalty) from defaulters entering the city without proper recharge or valid RFID, but no reply has come so far. Till now, we have managed to issue around 5.5 lakh tags but there are at least 7 lakh commercial vehicles entering the city every day. Also, many vehicles, which have tags, are not recharged properly,” said the official. TOI tried contacting MM Kutty, chairman of the air quality management commission, on this issue but there was no reply. Last month, SDMC had issued a public notice specifying that the work for installing the RFID system for collection of toll and environment compensation charge was completed at all 124 toll plazas in the capital. Considering the pollution situation and commercial vehicles being an important contributor to it, a system to issue RFID tags and collect toll tax and environment compensation charge online was earlier set up in Delhi. It was initially installed at just 13 locations. RFID tags can be obtained or recharged at 39 points of sale system set up at Delhi’s entry points, including Kapashera, Rajokri, Aya Nagar, Badarpur, Tikri, KGT, DND, Kalindi Kunj, Ghazipur Main, Ghazipur Old, Shahdara Main, Shahdara Flyover and Palam Vihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rfid-fine-on-defaulters-on-hold-pending-air-panel-nod/articleshow/84000823.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Missing salon owner traced, held on charge of wife’s murder||PUNE: The Samarth police on Tuesday arrested salon owner Salim Shaqil Shaikh (33), who was found missing along with his 15-year-old sister, after a decomposed body of his wife, Sumaiyya (35), was recovered from his Bhavani Peth flat on June 19. Police said Salim is suspected to have strangulated Sumaiyya to death over some domestic issue on the night intervening June 13 and 14 and left the place by locking the flat from outside. On Wednesday, a local court ordered his remand in police custody till July 6. Sumaiyya was Salim’s second wife and the two used to stay with his minor sister in the Bhavani Peth flat, police said. His first wife and their three children (two daughters aged 13 and 7 and a 5-year-old son) stay in a rented flat at Mundhwa, where he also has his saloon. Prima facie investigations revealed that Salim and Sumaiyya would frequently quarrel over the latter meeting and talking to some people and Sumaiyya, too, suspected him of having an extra-marital affair, police said and added that this might have led to the murder. The murder came to light on June 19 when a foul stench emanating from the flat prompted neighbours to call the police. When police broke open the flat, they found Sumaiyya dead and Salim and his sister missing. Police initially registered a case of accidental death and launched a hunt for Salim. Senior inspector Vishnu Tamhane and inspector Ulhas Kadam of the Samarth police received information that Salim had fled to his native village at Pratapgarh in Uttar Pradesh. A police team went to Pratapgarh. “Salim was not present at his native village. However, we found his minor sister there. She narrated how her elder brother killed the woman in the flat and how they reached Pratapgarh,” said Kadam. “The girl told us that the deceased woman and her brother got married about one-and-half year ago in Pune. The couple used to fight every other day. Late on the night of June 13, the couple picked up a fight and this enraged Salim, who then strangulated her to death,” he said. Kadam said, “The girl’s statement proved crucial. Based on her statement and other circumstantial evidence like the fact that Salim, Sumaiyya and his sister were the only three staying in the flat and Salim had locked the flat from outside, we converted the case into that of a murder and are investigating further.” Police said Salim had left Pratapgarh house before the police team reached there. He returned to Pune after travelling to a few places in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh and started living with his first wife when he was traced and arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/missing-salon-owner-traced-held-on-charge-of-wifes-murder/articleshow/84000756.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Special drive to bring more farmers under PM’s scheme||LUCKNOW: Initiating a major farmer outreach, the BJP government in UP is set to roll out a special drive to enroll farmers under the PM’s crop insurance scheme, provisioning financial cover to crops that sustain damage due to adverse weather. The seven-day drive, starting July 1, will focus on 75 development blocks in the state – many of them being Dalit-dominated – where enrollment of farmers under the crop insurance scheme is low. The move comes amid prolonged agitation by farmers against the new farm laws, which is attaining political overtones to threaten BJP’s electoral prospects in states, including UP, where assembly elections are due next year. The Centre has identified eight blocks in different aspirational districts – Bahraich (Rakabganj), Shravasti (Sirsiya), Balrampur (Utraula), Siddharthnagar (Lotan), Fatehpur (Hathgaon), Chitrakoot (Ramnagar), Sonbhadra (Bagni) and Chandauli (Niyamtabad) – where crop insurance enrolment is low. Besides these, the state government has identified Varanasi (Sevapuri), Gorakhpur (Campiyarganj) and Deoria (Patherdeva) where the number of farmers covered under the scheme is inadequate. Additional chief secretary (agriculture), Devesh Chaturvedi, said special vans would be sent to rural precincts to get farmers covered under the scheme at their doorsteps. Talking to TOI, the ACS (agriculture) said a number of insurance companies had come forward for the campaign. The drive, scheduled to be flagged off by UP agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi on July 1, also coincides with the government’s ‘Bharat Ka Amrut Mahotsav’ campaign which is being organised to mark the 75th Independence Day next year. The Centre has decided to dedicate January 13, 2022, to the PM’s crop insurance scheme. “The first week of July and December will be dedicated to Kharif and Rabi crops, respectively. Under the campaign, not only insurance companies but also banks and Jan Suvidha Kendra (JSK) will be engaged to ramp up the participation of farmers in crop insurance scheme,” Chaturvedi said. In a communique to all district magistrates, the ACS (agriculture) has also pitched for the use of social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, to project the benefits of the schemes. He added that the message of the scheme should also be telecast through audio-visual means and regional TV channels. The agriculture department has asked district officials to decide the route of campaign vans in such a manner that maximum blocks and nyay panchayats get covered. Officials have also been directed to camp in villages and hold meetings to assess the progress of the campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/special-drive-to-bring-more-farmers-under-pms-scheme/articleshow/84003327.cms||Pankaj Shah

The exams will be held in a proctored online format. Mock tests will be conducted on July 8, 9, and 10 for students to get used to the process. The university has uploaded the timetables of some courses in humanities, science, engineering, and commerce faculty. “About 6.5 lakh students will appear for the second-semester examinations. The courses and years exact numbers will be known later. We will conduct the examination for 4,200 subjects for a total of 284 programmes run by the university in its departments or affiliated colleges,” Mahesh Kakade, director of examination and evaluation, SPPU, said. The university will conduct the examination of all final-year students on priority so that they can get their results soon. “Since the final-year students need to apply for higher education or for jobs, their exams will start around July 12 and end by July 30. We are hoping to complete the evaluation and give the results of these students by August 15. For the rest, we expect to complete everything by August-end,” Kakade said.

---||Delhi||Delhi to test more as it aims to eradicate malaria by 2022||NEW DELHI: The capital needs to significantly ramp up the blood slide examination rates if it wants to realise the goal of eradicating malaria by 2022. The rate has been abysmally low with Delhi carrying out only 32,170 tests in 2020 with an annual blood examination rate (ABER) of just 0.16%. In a review meeting on the vector-borne disease with the Union health minister on Tuesday, the three municipal corporations were directed to significantly ramp up the examination rate. “Strengthening surveillance activities is an important component of the malaria eradication programme. The target of ABER should be 10. Tests will be ramped up,” an official said. World Health Organization recommends that at least 1% of the population should be screened. This means Delhi should test at least two lakh of its 2 crore population every year. ABER is every 100 blood slides examined for the overall population. Just like 2020, the ABER count is lower in 2021 too. As per the weekly vector-borne disease report issued on Monday, only 13,722 blood slides have been examined in comparison to 15,008 tested in the corresponding period in 2020, 32,108 in 2019 and 35,645 in 2018. Many other steps, such as notifying dengue/malaria as a dangerous disease, implementation of the district-level malaria elimination programme, strengthening case-based surveillance and close coordination with National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, have also been ordered for eradicating malaria from Delhi. Expediting the process pending since 2019, malaria is also expected to be notified as a dangerous disease to improve the disease surveillance. “Smaller clinics and hospitals are legally bound to report malaria cases to the corporations only if it is declared a ‘dangerous disease’ through an official notification. The files were sent by the municipal bodies to the health department in 2019,” an official said. Ending a malaria death-free spell that had started in 2015, the municipal corporations had reported a malaria death last September, when a 6-year-old boy from a JJ colony in Madanpur Khadar died in Holy Family Hospital due to cerebral malaria with refractory shock. After progressively decreasing from 2011 till 2016, the number of malaria cases in Delhi had started rising in 2017. The Data of the last decade shows that the number of cases was 413 in 2011, 382 in 2012, 353 in 2013, 98 cases in 2014, 54 cases in 2015, and 31 cases in 2016. But the count then rose to 577 in 2017, 473 in 2018, 713 in 2019 and 228 in 2020. In 2021, 11 cases have been registered so far. “We had earlier targeted to eliminate malaria from Delhi by 2020, but the plans got disrupted due to the pandemic. The new target is 2022,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-to-test-more-as-it-aims-to-eradicate-malaria-by-next-yr/articleshow/84000924.cms||Paras Singh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: June saw 961mm rainfall, third highest for the month in 10 years||MUMBAI: The month of June this year has recorded 961.4 mm of rainfall which is the third highest in the last decade, according to the Met department’s records. Also, the total rainfall recorded so far has been over 50% above the average June rainfall. The average June rainfall recorded is 505 mm. The total rain recorded for June has been 961.4 mm, which is around 38mm short of the 1,000mm rain mark. Previously, in the month of June, rainfall had crossed the 961 mm mark in the year 2015, when 1,106 mm of rainfall was recorded during that month. Prior to that, in the year 2013, there was 1,029 mm of rain recorded for the entire month. The onset of monsoon over Mumbai this year was declared two days earlier on June 9 while June 11 is the official onset date. Prior to it, significant pre-monsoon showers had already been recorded. The Met department data shows that most of the rainfall in June was recorded in five days — June 8-12 — while 231.3 mm was recorded only on one day — June 9-10. Weather officials pointed out that southwest monsoon has currently entered into a break phase, with little rains over the country expected till July 7 at least. KS Hosalikar, scientist, IMD, said that there are no severe weather warnings issued by IMD for the state in the coming five days. “While subdued rain in the state was seen for the last two weeks, it was supported by daily thunderstorm associated with moderate rains in the interiors of the state. The situation is likely to improve after the first week of July, as per model guidance,” said Hosalikar. Meanwhile, the total water stock in the seven lakes supplying water to the city stands at 2.57 lakh million litres or 17.81% of the total required stocks. Last year too, the total stock on the same date was much lesser at 1.21 lakh million litres. Civic officials said they are hopeful that rainfall in July will help increase the water stocks in the seven lakes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-june-saw-961mm-rainfall-third-highest-for-the-month-in-10-yrs/articleshow/84003406.cms||Richa Pinto

In its second year, there were 400 applications for the 30 seats, which the university says will be easily surpassed this year. Vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar said, “When we started the course, getting the 30 students was a bit hard. People were still accepting the idea of liberal education as most of us have been used to the conventional educational set-up. But once the students came to know about the course and the choices it offers, the interest grew. The last time, we had about 300-400 applications for just 30 seats. This year too the numbers will grow. We may make it a four- year programme with the last year dedicated to internships or a set-up where students can get hands-on training in the field of their choice.” Dishan Kamdar, vice-chancellor of FLAME University, said in recent years there has been a revival in humanities. The announcement of the National Education Policy 2020 is a big shot in the arm for liberal education, he added. Kamdar added that the pandemic has impacted the career plans of the students. “With the kind of changes happening in the economies worldwide, liberal education is being viewed as a more preferred choice by parents and students. At our university, we have seen the result of increasing interest among students through the applications. Students with top academic and entrance test scores who had applied to the world’s best institutes and Ivy League universities have shown interest in our university,” he added. Head: Students Get Future And Career Ready With more awareness about different career opportunities increasing, initial hesitation towards the UG courses in liberal arts has given way to acceptance Many students who have not decided what they want to do after Std XII or graduation are taking up a UG course in Liberal Arts They dabble with all the wide variety of subjects offered and then decided what they want to pursue as a career The NEP 2020 policy is an endorsement of the importance of how liberal education can offer students a holistic education The biggest advantage of liberal education is that it does not slot students into narrow specialization but prepares them for diverse career options The guidelines of the NEP also allow students the freedom to choose and make changes in what they wish to study||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/more-awareness-better-options-nep-draw-students-to-liberal-arts/articleshow/84000989.cms||Ardhra Nair

The initial deadline of June 30 has now been deferred to July 10. The government decision came after a series of representations by trade and industry associations citing severe shortage of Covid vaccines. Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel said, “Chaired by the CM, the core committee to control Covid spread in the state has decided to extend the time limit for compulsory vaccination of staff of commercial and trading establishments as well as other establishments from June 30 to July 10.” Following government’s diktat to close all establishments where staffers are not vaccinated, vaccination centres saw an unprecedented rush, leading to shortage of vaccines. The government is also pushing to vaccinate all staffers at MSMEs and other industrial units. While the state has extended the deadline, a 10-day window does not seem to be realistic enough to vaccinate all stakeholders, especially at a time when the shortage of vaccines is evident. “Across industries in Gujarat, 60% of the senior and executive level staffers are yet to be vaccinated whereas 80% of the labour force is also not vaccinated yet. A 10-day window is not enough to achieve this. Therefore, we will make a strong representation before the government to focus on stakeholder vaccination,” said Pathik Patwari, secretary, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vax-shortage-forces-govt-to-blink-defer-deadline-to-july-10/articleshow/84001091.cms||---

The proposal before the standing committee considers deduction of 10% for five years from the officer’s pension. In the past, the matter had led to suspension of four officers and eight others were placed under departmental inquiry. “With allegations made against Bhaskar Choudhary, deputy chief engineer, DP, during a departmental inquiry having proved to be true, the standing committee’s permission has been sought for deducting 10% from his pension for five years,” states the proposal. A 14,000-sqm plot in Jogeshwari, worth about Rs 500 crore, made news as a case was filed in 2018 over “tampering” of remarks by the then civic chief. Opposition party leader and standing committee member Ravi Raja said, “If one sees value of the plot, 10% is nothing...Most civic inquiries are superficial and manipulated with culprits allowed to get away while other made scapegoats.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/plot-scam-bmc-proposes-10-cut-in-pension/articleshow/84003450.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Getting fewer doses than needed from Centre, says deputy CM Nitin Patel||GANDHINAGAR: Six days ago the Gujarat government wielded a legal baton against the 1.5 million shops and commercial establishments across Gujarat’s four major cities to ensure that all their employees are vaccinated by June 30 or else they will be forced to shut down. But, this deadline was missed by the lawmakers themselves. On Wednesday, a serious dearth of Covid vaccines finally led the deputy CM and state health minister Nitin Patel to admit that vax supplies suffered because of the large numbers of enthusiastic citizens coming forward for vaccination, and that the on-spot registration process too had caused many who had previously registered on CoWIN to go back without being vaccinated. Patel argued, “The vaccination drive is running on in a big way. Every day, we vaccinate 3 to 4 lakh citizens.” He added, “Due to sudden rise in awareness in citizens for vaccine, the demand has increased drastically. Moreover, we had stopped advance registration midway, owing to which citizens in large numbers turned up at our centres unexpectedly, while supply to of doses to different states remains fixed.” On Wednesday 2.78 lakh citizens were vaccinated across the state. Patel reiterated, "We have increased the number of centres from around 2,500 to 5,000 to maximise vaccination efforts. We have planned to procure 5 lakh doses per day and have begun new vaccination centres. But against our demand we are still getting 3.5 lakh to 4 lakh doses from the government of India.” Patel further added, “We are concerned about senior citizens having to go back due to non-availability of doses and are working out a way. Over 2.5 crore doses have so far being administered. We are talking with supplier companies also to get more doses to meet the increased demand resolve all issues at the earliest,” he added. In a press release, Patel claimed ,“The core committee to control the Covid spread in the state had decided to extend the time limit for compulsory vaccination of all the staff of commercial and trading establishments from June 30 to July 10.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/getting-fewer-doses-than-needed-from-centre-dycm/articleshow/84001079.cms||---
---||Delhi||Another arrest in Red Fort violence case||New Delhi: Delhi Police’s Crime Branch on Wednesday arrested a man wanted in connection with the Republic Day violence this January. Buta Singh, a 26-year-old resident of Punjab’s Taran Taran, was carrying a cash reward of Rs 50,000. Police claim he was seen in a video along with others hoisting a religious flag atop Red Fort. According to police, different groups of farmers’ organisations protesting against the farm Bills had gathered at the Red Fort in large numbers without permission. “The mob climbed the rampart of the fort and unfurled the religious flag at its pole. The rioters even caused damage to the government vehicles and public properties and assaulted police personnel,” said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Monika Bhardwaj. During the investigation, the DCP said, specific information was received regarding Singh and a raid was conducted at his village, Talwandi Sobha Singh. “During the raid, Singh’s family members and neighbours tried hard to get him out of the police custody and attempted to block the roads with tractors, but the team, with the help of local police, managed to come out of the village along with Singh,” she said. According to Bhardwaj, Singh told police that he was radicalised by watching provoking social media posts of various groups. “He used to frequently visit the Singhu border in Delhi and was highly motivated by speeches there,” she said. As per the plan, Singh had entered the fort along with his five-six associates and other unknown armed miscreants, the DCP claimed. “His act of hoisting the flag had motivated already violent protesters” to indulge in all sorts of violence against police personnel deployed on Republic Day and damage the historical monument, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/another-arrest-in-red-fort-violence-case/articleshow/84001068.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Vidarbha sees one Covid death, first time after July 2020||NAGPUR: One Covid death in Chandrapur district made up for Vidarbha’s toll on Wednesday. This was first time when the day’s Covid fatality in the region was restricted to just one district and stood at one after the onset of Covid pandemic last year. Nagpur district did not report any Covid casualty for the fourth consecutive day on Wednesday and sixth time in the last 11 days. The dwindling number of Covid cases and waning fatalities have been unexpected, but quite pleasant for the people in general and medical fraternity. Some are also surprised at the sudden drop in cases which has also left many healthcare facilities with few patients. This was not seen between the two waves or even before the start of the first wave, when even suspects too would be admitted. The number of under treatment patients dropped below 2,000 as only 1,861 remained under medical care. Daily testing count also increased to 28,644. All districts in the region have increased testing after Delta Plus variant being reported from different parts of the country. While the new cases detected in the day in the region increased to 199, four districts saw below 10 new patients and rest under 40. At 39, the day’s highest cases were from Amravati, which also has second highest tally of patients under treatment at 331. Buldhana reported second highest cases in the day with 37 positive. Highest recoveries were 94 from Amravati, followed by Nagpur 91 and Buldhana 55. The recovery rate had swelled to a healthy 98% in Vidarbha. Yavatmal: Having no report of Covid death on Wednesday, the toll remained unchanged at 1,789. The administration received 768 test reports of which 9 were positive. Currently, there are 48 patients undergoing treatment. Of the 72,727 patients detected so far, 70,893 including 4 on Wednesday have recovered. The district’s test positivity rate is 10.69% and 2.46%. The daily positivity rate is 1.17%. Wardha: Nine new Covid cases were reported out of 1,194 test reports on Wednesday, while 4 patients were discharged. The caseload thus has increased to 49,216 and recoveries to 47,846, leaving 49 under treatment. New cases reported on Wednesday include Wardha 3, Hinganghat and Samudrapur 2 each, Ashti and Arvi 1 each. No death was reported and the toll remains 1,321. Chandrapur: One Covid casualty, 15 new cases and 24 recoveries were reported from the district on Wednesday, leaving 219 patients under treatment. The Covid toll has risen to 1,528, while caseload and total recoveries amount to 84,679 and 82,932, respectively. Amravati: For the third time since March 23 last, the district did not post any Covid death on Wednesday. The district reported 39 new cases, while 94 patients were discharged in the day. This took the Covid caseload to 95,984 and total recoveries to 94,100. Gadchiroli: No Covid death was reported and the toll remained at 740. The district reported 19 new cases and 13 recoveries. The district now has 158 patients under treatment. Washim: The district didn’t report any Covid casualty. The daily cases decreased to 17, while 39 patients recovered.

---||Agra||Group enters Uttar Pradesh temple, smashes water cooler foundation stone bearing Muslim name||AGRA: A group of Bajrang Dal activists barged into a temple in Aligarh and knocked down the foundation stone of a water cooler bearing the name of a local Muslim politician who had donated it. “We cannot tolerate the name of a person from another community inside the temple premises,” Karan Chaudhary, an activist of the saffron outfit who smashed the marble foundation stone with a hammer on Tuesday, said. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the temple committee filed a police complaint alleging that some “anti-social elements” entered into the temple and destroyed the stone. The committee head, Satyapal Singh, has demanded a case and probe into the matter. Samajwadi Party’s (SP) Salman Shahid had donated the water cooler to Khereshwar Mahadev temple in Aliagrh’s Lodha area two days ago. It was inaugurated in the presence of the temple’s priest, a prominent ‘mahant’ and several other seers who can be seen giving blessings to Shahid in the photographs taken on the occasion. When contacted, Shahid -- who is SP youth wing’s state treasurer -- said that he was shocked at the incident. “I had announced that I will install 100 water coolers in temples, mosques and health centres across Aligarh. But some people cannot take this positively and are bent on giving communal twists to everything,” he said, adding that instead of uniting people, such forces were busy creating divides. “Like others, we also have faith in the temples. Due to the scarcity of cold drinking water during summer, we installed the water cooler after discussing this with the temple committee and the chief priest,” Shahid said, adding that it was inaugurated by Swami Purna Nand Puri, a prominent priest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/group-enters-up-temple-smashes-water-cooler-foundation-stone-bearing-muslim-name/articleshow/83994076.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Pune||High expectations to pose challenge before PMC after merger of villages||PUNE: The residents of Wagholi, Khadakwasla, Sus, Manjri and the other areas merged in the Pune Municipal Corporation limits on Wednesday can now expect infrastructure development and provision of civic amenities, while the civic body would have the challenging task of meeting their high expectations. A senior official from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said the civic administration would certainly require more employees and better budgetary allocation to look after the merged areas. “The civic body cannot rely only on the taxes to be collected from new areas. We shall need dedicated funds to carry out developmental works in the merged villages. Also, the existing manpower is overburdened. Provision of more staffers is necessary to cater to these areas. The PMC will have to conduct surveys and studies in new areas, for which the administration will require manpower,” the official said. Mayor Muralidhar Mohol and BJP city unit chief Jagdish Mulik also demanded allocation of funds for the development of the new areas. “The merger is a welcome move, but the state government will now have to allocate at least Rs9,000 crore for the development works. Even the civic administration, in its feedback, had recommended the state government for allocation of Rs9,000 crore for the merged villages. The government will also have to sanction new posts and fill up the vacant posts in PMC,” Mohol said. The town planning experts stressed that PMC would face the challenge of holistic planning for the overall development in these areas, besides handling illegal constructions and encroachment. Otherwise, the development would take its own time, they said. Town planning expert Ramchandra Gohad said, “We have examples of the villages merged in the city in last few decades still waiting for overall development. The new areas being included should not continue to face similar challenges.” Gohad also questioned the need for merger because the government had already established the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) to handle the peripheral areas. Several residents of the merged villages hailed the move, though. Yogesh Patil from Wagholi said, “The merger with PMC is great news for all of us here. We hope that all problems related to water supply, garbage disposal, roads and drainage lines will be fixed soon. Wagholi also needs a government primary school.” Chetan Khade from Khadakwasla had a piece of suggestion for PMC. “It should now focus on developing the infrastructure, while keeping in mind the area’s ecological importance. I wish for better road connectivity to this area, while garbage disposal is also a serious issue.” Ramchandra Agarwal, a businessman having his unit in Pisoli, said, “Though the concreting of the stretch from Khadi Machine Chowk to Mantarwadi is on, the condition of the internal roads has to improve.” Prasad Patil from Bavdhan Budruk said, “We are ready to pay taxes but want better amenities and planned development. Water supply has to be improved.” The population of PMC is estimated to increase by four lakh following the merger of the 23 villages. According to the district administration’s letter submitted to the state government in January 2014, these villages had population of 1.98 lakh then. The decision to merge 34 fringe villages in civic areas was taken in 2013-14, but only 11 — nine partially and two fully — were merged in the PMC limits in 2017. This time, the “entire area of the revenue village” has been included in PMC limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/residents-expectations-to-pose-challenge-to-pmc-after-merger-of-villages/articleshow/84001100.cms||Sarang Dastane

The sub-species has been named ‘Varadia’, in the honour of herpetologist Dr Varad Giri. The genus is ‘Varadia Amboliensis’ — a tribute to the Amboli biodiversity site.Dr Amrut Bhosale, the assistant professor of zoology at the Sadguru Gadage Maharaj College in Karad, said he began researching this snail when he spotted it in the Amboli region for the first time in 2017. “This semi-slug was spotted in 2017 for the first time in the Amboli region. We spotted it again in 2019 and, thereafter, in 2020 while conducting our research. It has similarities with other species. In fact, we had earlier mistaken it for another species.

An autopsy will be carried out to determine their identities. Police said it was tough to recover human remains as the entire material inside the building were charred and got stuck to each other. A team of Forensics Science Laboratory (FSL) lifted samples on June 25 from the ground, first and second floors. The same day, the remnants of possibly a human body were also collected. On Monday, four pieces of small bones were found near the bathroom on the second floor by FSL and fire officials. “On Tuesday, three different human traces were found from the second floor and sent to the Sanjay Gandhi mortuary. Two mobile phones, one belonging to victim Shamshad and another to Vikram, were also found,” said Parvinder Singh, DCP, Outer. On Wednesday, too, human remains were found on the second floor and another mobile phone, which belonged to victim Sonu, was recovered. “The search is still continuing,” Singh said. On June 21, the call about the blaze was received around 8.22am and 30 fire tenders were sent to douse the fire. Four people were rescued by noon while two managed to escape, but a few were reported missing. The building, consisting of a basement, ground and two other floors, did not have a valid fire NOC. Meanwhile, the corporation has declared the building dangerous after its second and first floors collapsed partially.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/over-a-week-after-udyog-nagar-fire-forensics-pull-out-body-parts-of-three-different-people/articleshow/84001141.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Police arrested Sanjay alias Pratap alias Pravi Chorodia (28), a native of Mota Dadva village in Gondal taluka of Rajkot, for the murder of Shanker Vekaria, a resident of Virnagar village. Chorodia used to work as a farm labourer on Vekaria’s farm with his wife. According to police, Chorodia killed Vekaria as the latter was demanding sexual favours from his wife. At couple of occasions, Vekaria had forcefully held Chorodia’s wife. When Chorodia’s wife told him about intentions of the old man, he decided to bump him off, said police. Vekaria was found dead with his legs tied to a wooden pillar on his farm on June 25. He was also gagged with a cloth. There were no injury marks on his body. It was Chorodia who had informed police about Vekaria’s death. It was believed that Vekaria was murdered with intention of loot. During the investigation, police did not find anything worth stealing from Vekaria and suspected Chorodia’s murder for loot theory. On Wednesday, a forensic postmortem report confirmed that Vekaria died due to strangulation. Police detained Chorodia and during questioning, he confessed to murdering Vekaria, said police. Vekaria was unmarried and lived on the farm on the outskirts of Virnagar village near Jasdan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/cops-solve-farmers-murder-in-jasdan/articleshow/83997055.cms||---

At Indrapuri, against the 1,300 who turned up at the urban health centre, only 337 individuals were vaccinated. Similarly, at Ellisbridge, Shahpur and Naranpura urban health centres, citizens voiced their protests at not being informed about the unavailability of vaccines. Only 26,300 citizens were administered vaccines on Wednesday. “At the Amraiwadi municipal school, only 54 vaccine doses were administered, the lowest,” admitted a senior Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) official. On June 23, more than 42,000 doses had been administered in the city which halved to 22,000 in the following three days. “At a majority of the 115 centres on Wednesday, an average of 150 to 390 individuals were vaccinated,” said the AMC official. “Long queues were also seen at other vaccination centres in areas such as Khokhra, Amraiwari, Vastral, with people turning up since early morning to get vaccinated. Also, between June 21 and June 29, the AMC had been failing to cross the 50,000-mark consistently,” an AMC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/chaos-reigns-lack-of-vaccine-supply-makes-people-tense/articleshow/84001162.cms||---
---||Nagpur||NMC makes test mandatory for fully vaccinated too, draws flak||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s move to make Covid-19 test mandatory for all those working in banks and commercial establishments etc even after they have been fully vaccinated has drawn sharp criticism. Though aimed at detecting possible ‘superspreaders’ so as to contain spread of the virus and facilitate early treatment to those infected, the civic body’s drive is receiving poor response. On Monday, a team from NMC’s Hanuman Nagar zone visited a bank in South Nagpur and asked all employees there to give swab samples at its mobile swab collection centre. This caught the staff by surprise. A woman staff tried to reason out with the NMC team saying, “I have taken both the doses of Covaxin. The second dose was administered 20 days ago.” Yet, the NMC team insisted that testing was mandatory for all even if they have been fully vaccinated, she said. “I also showed the final vaccination certificate, but to no avail. I had no option but to give swab sample,” said the woman. An official from Hanuman Nagar zone said, “Civic chief has directed us to test ‘superspreaders’ once in a fortnight. Fully vaccinated people can also get infected, hence the order to test them too.” While allowing non-essential shops, private offices to reopen and increasing timings from June 1, the civic body had made testing mandatory once in a fortnight for all those working in private offices like banks where a large number of people visit daily, shops, vendors, hawkers, home delivery boys etc who come in contact with many people every day. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said, “The move to conduct fortnightly testing of fully inoculated people will defeat the very purpose of vaccination. Fully vaccinated person can contract the disease and may remain asymptomatic, but he or she cannot transmit the virus. There is less than 10% chance of transmission in case of severe infection. Therefore, there is no point in testing fully vaccinated people who are attending office or running commercial establishments.” Dr Shinde said, “Authorities should come up with incentives for fully vaccinated people instead of troubling them. A few malls and restaurants have displayed boards highlighting that all their staffers are fully vaccinated. Authorities should identify them and offer special recognition. Vaccination is the only solution to contain the spread and save people from this disease.” Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said, “Testing of fully vaccinated people working in banks or commercial establishments is not mandatory. But testing such people is also not wrong. They can contract the disease. Testing will help them know if they are carrying the virus and get treatment.” NMC officials told TOI, “There is poor response from commercial establishments to the fortnightly testing. We have sent letters to almost all establishments informing that NMC is ready to collect swab samples at their places. But majority of them are not ready to get the tests done. Therefore, we are compulsorily testing those from some establishments where a large number of people visit daily.” Radhakrishnan said, “Fortnightly testing of the ‘superspreaders’ will help us in identifying Covid cluster, if any, early. It will help in containing the spread as one from a shop can infect several people in a day or two. Keeping cases low is also very important for continuing the unlock. Therefore, people should cooperate in saving themselves and also the city.” The NMC has also introduced a web link where any establishment or housing scheme can apply and get testing in bulk done at the doorstep.

---||Mumbai||‘Excess deaths’ in Mumbai call for scientific survey: TISS||MUMBAI: This April, the city saw a 112% rise in deaths due to all causes compared to the average seen for the same month in the previous four years. The mortality data, which is still emerging, has raised concerns about the real toll of Covid-19 and the extent to which it was missed by the reporting systems. Data from the civic corporation obtained through an RTI application shows that there were 14,484 deaths due to all causes in April this year, an 89% jump from deaths in April 2020 (7,648). The number of deaths in April 2019 were 6,572; in April 2018 the number was 6,719, and in April 2017, it was 6,234. If a four-year average of deaths in the city in April is considered (6,838), this year has seen a 112% jump. Deaths for the months of January and February this year didn’t show any remarkable shift from the previous years. March saw a 12% rise compared to 2020. Records for May show a 48% drop in deaths from last year, but officials said the registration for May is ongoing. The significant spurt in all-cause mortality for April, which includes deaths due to both Covid and non-Covid reasons, is concerning since the city’s official Covid toll for the month was just 1,479. It means the city had almost 6,200 ‘excess deaths’ in April, if compared with the average of previous years. ‘Excess deaths’ is the gap between the number of people who die from any cause in a given period and a historical baseline from recent years. “Covid accounts for only 10% of the April deaths. Considering that railway and road traffic deaths have reduced in Mumbai due to the lockdown, it is unlikely that so many deaths would be non-Covid,” said Soumitra Ghosh of School of Health Systems Studies, TISS. He said the excess deaths warrant an urgent scientific survey of mortalities in Mumbai, including triangulation of data from sources such as crematoriums. Sharad Yadav, an RTI activist who obtained the data, accused the BMC of under-reporting Covid deaths to show “everything was good on paper”. April was the peak of the second wave for Mumbai, when it was recording an average of 9,000 cases every day for the first three weeks. This year’s highest single-day detection of Covid cases was on April 4, when 11,206 cases were found. But as per BMC figures, Covid deaths started rising only towards the end of April before peaking in mid-May. Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the Covid death audit committee, said that gauging the actual Covid toll is a challenge, although there is no denying there has been a notable rise in all-cause deaths. “In Mumbai, every death of a confirmed Covid patient is reported, but there is a possibility that victims who did not test positive for coronavirus before dying are missed,” he said. Importantly, the pandemic and lockdown had made it harder for people to commute and access health services. “That may have indirectly caused an increase in fatalities from diseases other than Covid such as heart attacks, cancer, etc,” he added. Dr Supe said that a national exercise is being planned to analyse the true extent of Covid deaths. AMC Suresh Kakani said a lot of patients from MMR have died in the city while undergoing treatment and their deaths were registered here. “That could have pushed up Mumbai’s mortality numbers. We are quite up-to-date with uploading information about deaths, but we are yet to assign causes,” he said. Denying the allegation that Mumbai was undercounting deaths, he said hospitals have a standing instruction to report them in 48 hours.  In 2020, Mumbai had nearly 21,000 excess deaths. Ghosh said it is crucial to know the death burden to plan better for the third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/excess-deaths-in-city-call-for-scientific-survey-tiss/articleshow/84001199.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The New Market police have now busted a gang of three men, who offered people fake KMC jobs after faking the signature of the present KMC commissioner. The accused — identified as Rajib Mallick (37) — from Bowbazar — and his associates Siddhartha Saha (31) and Joydeb Sarkar (38) used fake letterheads and stamps of senior KMC officers to hand over fake appointment letters to jobless youths for group C level staff positions in return for money. The New Market police, said they are not ruling out the possibility of the accused having access to lower level staff of KMC. “We lodged the case pertaining to cheating and fraud on June 26 and worked in quick time,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. The case was recorded on the basis of a complaint by Jai Kishore Dhanuk, conservancy overseer (SWM department), at KMC headquarters after a few people came with queries on when they should report for work.

---||Coimbatore||Make online classes accessible to students in hilly areas: CPM||COIMBATORE: CPM members have requested the state government to take immediate steps to make online education accessible to the students from hilly areas such as Valparai, where mobile network is not strong. They have shot off letters to chief minister M K Stalin, chief secretary V Irai Anbu and district collector G S Sameeran in this regard on Wednesday. P Paramasivam, Valparai CPM secretary, said more than 90% of families in the region were involved in tea estate works. “The school education department had suspended the schools after the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country in March 2020 and been educating the students online. Many students in Valparai region do not have a smartphone. Those who have smartphones have to go to tea estate borders in search of a mobile network. It is very risky given the movement of wild animals. Because of the poor mobile network in the region, most of the students can’t access online classes.” Pointing out that the state government had been telecasting video lessons through Kalvi channel, he said the channel was unavailable on the local cable network. “It is available only on Arasu cable network. Despite several requests in the past one year, the government had not taken any steps to bring Arasu cable network to the region. The cable network, if brought to the region, will be very helpful to the students.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/make-online-classes-accessible-to-students-in-hilly-areas-cpm/articleshow/84001181.cms||---

But the government allotted only Rs 2,500 crore, which will not be sufficient even to cover the targeted 25 lakh micro units,” Focia coordinator J James said. “The target would benefit only 4.2% of the micro units in the country. We have requested the minister to increase fund allocation for the scheme.” A statement from the federation said that the members also requested the minister to take steps to waive penalties levied on bounced EMIs in the last two months during the lockdown. “The recent statement by banks reveals that about 60% of new non-performing assets added during April and May 2021 are from MSMEs and the increase is almost twice the normal occurrence,” the statement added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/fm-told-to-allocate-more-funds-for-micro-units/articleshow/84001171.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Bombay high court asks Neeri to research side-effects of steroids||NAGPUR: With increasing reports of side effects due to use of steroids on Covid-19 and mucormycosis patients, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday directed National Environment Engineering and Research Organisation (Neeri) here to conduct a research in this regard. “There is difficulty as the total number of patients of both diseases is very less and it may not be enough to conduct research. For this purpose, we expect that all the authorities like collector, municipal commissioner, IMA president, and deans of GMCH and IGGMCH join hands,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor said. All these authorities were directed to work out modalities suggested by IMA counsel Bhanudas Kulkarni for carrying forward research in this regard. “If any blood samples of patients are available, those may be collected and submitted for research to Neeri.” Asking the masses to take precautions and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, the judges warned them that the third wave of coronavirus may hit the state in mid-July. “We don’t know whether it would really come or not, but there can be no denying the fact that all of us have to remain prepared for any kind of emergency arising due to it.” While hearing a suo motu PIL based on TOI report where Shreerang Bhandarkar was appointed amicus curiae along with Nidhi Dayani, the bench pointed out that HC had largely focussed on hospital infrastructure in cities, but hardly any information was provided on number of primary health centres (PHCs), rural and district hospitals in each of the Vidarbha districts. “We direct Nagpur and Amravati divisional commissioners, civil surgeons and health officers of all the districts to submit entire information in this regard. It included the number of doctors and nursing staff available, vacancies, and availability of all common drugs and other facilities like beds. They should also inform on the norms prescribing the number of posts of medical staff along with minimum required equipment, machines, gadgets, and concentrators for each of the PHCs and its sub-centres along with rural and district hospitals,” they said. Before adjourning the hearing by four weeks, the justices told respondents to fill up all vacancies in three months and furnish all the information by next hearing. “The situation of Covid-19 as well as mucormycosis prevalence has improved considerably. Everyday, decline in the number of patients is being witnessed which is a good sign.” The judges granted permission to the collector to spend Rs2 crore from CSR funds deposited for purchase of LMO storage tank of 125 MT capacity from VRV Asia Pacific Private Limited. They further asked the government to pay salaries of 40 doctors who had joined AIIMS about a month back. “We request government pleader Ketki Joshi to verify the position and acquaint HC. If their salaries have not been paid really, we direct the government to ensure that on the next hearing, there is no grievance heard in this regard,” they added. ‘Research on plasma therapy dropped The HC has dropped its May 12 orders to Neeri to conduct research on use of plasma therapy and its side effects, including claims of acceleration of coronavirus mutations in patients. “We must say that since plasma therapy’s use has been stopped altogether by the government, samples of such patients are no longer available. Therefore, directives given by HC have now been rendered infructuous.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-asks-neeri-to-research-side-effects-of-steroids/articleshow/83994212.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Nashik||Ahmednagar: Political foes team up to win mayoral polls||NASHIK: Shiv Sena and NCP, arch political rivals in Ahmednagar politics, joined hands to script an easy victory for the MVA candidates in the mayoral elections of the Ahmednagar Municipal Corporation on Wednesday. Sena’s Rohini Shendge and NCP’s Ganesh Bhosale are the new mayor and deputy mayor respectively. Rajendra Bhosale, the returning officer for the election and Ahmednagar district collector, announced the names of the new mayor and deputy mayor for the next two-and-a-half years. The duo won the polls uncontested as BJP did not field a candidate this time. In the last civic polls, held in December 2018, Shiv Sena emerged as the largest party winning 23 seats followed by NCP (19), BJP (14), and Congress (5). The other small parties and independents won the remaining six seats. The coming together of Sena and NCP in Ahmednagar is significant as the relationship between these two parties has been acrimonious in the past. In April 2018, Sena had accused some of the top local NCP functionaries of allegedly being involved in the murder of two of its prominent leaders in Kedgaon. Later, the police had arrested some NCP functionaries. In the previous mayoral polls, despite lacking in numbers, BJP was able to have its mayor with NCP’s backing. This time, despite reluctance of some local Sena and NCP leaders, the high commands of both these parties made it clear that MVA must face the mayoral polls together to defeat the BJP. Ahmednagar city NCP MLA, Sangram Jagtap told TOI that it was the first time that NCP and Sena joined hands in Ahmednagar. “The NCP, Sena and Congress have formed a coalition government in the state. Naturally, in Ahmednagar the local leaders of these parties made a unanimous decision to contest the polls together. There is a perfect understanding between us,” added Jagtap, who was instrumental in deciding to back BJP in the last mayoral polls. Sena insiders claimed that one faction of the local leadership thought teaming up with NCP would be politically ‘detrimental’ for the party in the district. However, the Sampark Pramukh of Sena in Ahmednagar, Balchandra, alias Bhau Korgaonkar, denied any such opposition. “All our corporators and party workers were there in the civic body when the MVA candidates won the elections unopposed. Our party chief and CM Uddhav Thackeray is leading the MVA government extremely well. I am confident that the MVA coalition in AMC too would work in a cohesive manner,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ahmednagar-political-foes-team-up-to-win-mayoral-polls/articleshow/83994235.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Nagpur||NMC receives 580 complaints against private hospitals from Covid patients||NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Tuesday said it had received 580 complaints from patients regarding excess bills charged by the private hospitals that treated them for coronavirus. The statement was made by NMC additional commissioner Ram Joshi in an affidavit submitted in the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court (HC). The suo motu PIL based on TOI reports where Shreerang Bhandarkar was appointed amicus curiae along with Nidhi Dayani would come up for hearing on Wednesday. According to Joshi, the civic body had received 425 complaints — including one filed by former mayor Sandip Joshi — against the hospitals till June 2 and in the last three weeks, 125 more were added. “Of them, 496 were finally adjudicated by NMC. However, despite passing detailed and reasoned orders, many hospitals have not yet complied. Moreover, 84 complaints were sent to the respective hospitals as per HC’s directives. They were told to submit their response within seven days. Of them, 80 have responded and NMC would adjudicate them judiciously,” Joshi said. He added that as response was awaited from four hospitals, it may lead to delay in redressing the grievances of patients and their relatives. “Additional municipal commissioner Jalaj Sharma had convened a meeting in this regard in his chamber with amicus curiae, Indian Medical Association (IMA) counsel Bhanudas Kulkarni and NMC lawyer Sushir Puranik. They were apprised of non-compliance by the hospitals and IMA was requested to convince them to cooperate with the civic body for resolving the patients’ complaints by submitting their replies. The response is, however, still awaited,” Joshi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-receives-580-complaints-against-pvt-hosps-from-covid-patients/articleshow/83994227.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Ahmedabad||Four years after GST rollout, SGST growth still slow||AHMEDABAD: Four years after goods and services tax (GST) was rolled out, overall growth in collection of the state GST (SGST), continues to remain slow. Data from the state commercial tax department shows that SGST collection stood at Rs 34,561.34 crore in Gujarat in 2020-21, down by 3.75% against 2019-20, when it was Rs 35,908.64 crore. For two consecutive years, GST collection has slowed.  J P Gupta, state commercial tax commissioner, said, “SGST collection has surely slowed but overall the state’s revenue through GST has gone up with IGST settlement and GST collection. We have clocked an average of 8% growth in revenues over the past couple of years. Gujarat being a manufacturing-heavy state was at a natural loss of revenue because GST is a consumption-driven tax.” “Moreover, compliance has continued to remain a concern as not all taxpayers are filing returns whereas some are wrongfully claiming input tax credit, which is a clear loss to the state exchequer,” Gupta added. Sources also said that economic growth has not been as robust as expected and in a slowdown-like situation, tax collection is bound to be affected. Last year it was due to the pandemic and the year before that due to several other factors. At the time of tje GST rollout, it was announced that for the first five years after the rollout, the Centre would compensate to states if the growth in the state’s revenues through GST was less than 14%. From July 2017 till February 8, 2021, according to data from the Union finance ministry, Gujarat has claimed Rs 29,243 crore worth of GST compensation, indicating a significant deficit in the state’s revenues. If the GST council does not extend the deadline for compensation, Gujarat will have a significant revenue loss.

The merged villages are likely to play a key role in deciding the final party-wise tally of corporators. The merger would also have an impact on the delimitation of wards. The population of the Pune municipal Corporation (PMC) is likely to increase by four lakh following the merger of 23 villages. Around 60,000 citizens would be represented by a corporator. Thus, the number of corporators could go up by seven after the merger of the 23 villages. PMC currently has 164 corporators. The civic body had 162 members till 2017. Two more were added after the merger of 11 villages in 2017. Both BJP, the ruling party in PMC, and NCP — the key opposition party in the civic body — are hoping to reap political benefits of the merger. The merged areas, mostly under rural parts of Pune, have been traditionally seen as the bastion of NCP. BJP made its mark in these villages during some local elections, too. It is hoping to make grounds in these areas during the municipal elections in February 2022. Even Congress, Shiv Sena and MNS are eyeing their pockets in these villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-areas-to-play-key-role-in-polls/articleshow/84001175.cms||Sarang Dastane

We will take a call then,” the minister said and hinted that it may be shifted to an elephant camp. With animal rights activists and politicians calling for the release of the elephant and the Madras high court directing the forest department not to keep it in captivity after treatment, residents of Vazhaithottam and Masinagudi in the MTR-buffer zone want the animal to be kept in captivity. Animal rights activist and BJP MP Maneka Gandhi had called for the release of Rivaldo. On Monday, BJP MLA Vanathi Srinivasan requested chief minister M K Stalin to release it. Rivaldo was guided to the kraal on May 5 by forest officials for treatment. The elephant had been wandering in Vazhaithottam and Mavanallah areas in the Masinagudi panchayat for the last six years. “We want the district administration to take the elephant to the camp in Theppakadu in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve. Though the elephant had not killed any human, it damaged compound walls in Vazhaithottam and Mavanallh areas and damaged crops,” said Abbas, representing residents of Vazhaithottam. “It would visit petty shops in the area for food and would not move from the place for hours together. People asking for release of the elephant should know the ground realities.” “We want Rivaldo to be taken to the camp so that it would get good care and food,”said Kannamma, another resident. “If the elephant is released, it would not be able to survive infighting.” A mahout and two assistants are training the animal, ATR field director K K Kaushal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/keep-rivaldo-in-captivity-vazhaithottam-residents/articleshow/84001158.cms||---

When he developed symptoms, he was admitted to a district hospital in Sikar, where he remained till May 11. He was then shifted to a private hospital in Sikar. When his condition deteriorated further, he was rushed to a private hospital in Jaipur on May 23. He died on June 9. The expenses for his treatment ran into lakhs, which was paid by doctors who raised money for the same. Doctors are considered ‘demigods’ for their selfless service and grit, but when it comes to their own health, the Covid-19 pandemic has proved that they are mortals and require equal care and treatment. Dr Saini is one of the 79 doctors who lost their lives due to Covid in the state. “For treatment of doctors, infected by Covid, we faced a lot of difficulties. In these pandemic times, seeing patients at clinics and hospitals is always full of risks. The doctors showed a lot of courage and grit and provided treatment ignoring the risks involved. Dr Saini is an example of how difficult it was to provide treatment for a doctor, who was himself treating infected patients. We collected Rs 17 lakh from our fraternity for his treatment,” said Dr Manish Dhankar, coordinator of UPCHAR Samvedna, an organisation formed by doctors to ensure treatment is any one of them get infected by Covid. Even doctors found it difficult to get beds, oxygen in hospitals, he alleged. Pradeep Karwasara, a young 32-year-old doctor from Nohar of Hanumangarh who runs his own clinic, also died of Covid. Since he had begun his career recently, he doctors' community helped him financially for treatment. But he died on May 19. He was rushed to a private hospital to Jaipur from Nohar, where he was kept on ventilator support. But he lost his battle against the virus. Another 45-year-old doctor, Rakesh Siwasia from Ajmer, who was rushed to a private hospital in Jaipur for Covid treatment died on June 8. He was a general practitioner and providing treatment to Covid patients. During the pandemic, doctors had put their own lives at risk to save patients. They continued to practice and treat patients despite the pandemic. According to the Private Hospital and Nursing Homes Society (PHNHS), 79 doctors have passed away due to Covid and post-recovery complications in the state, so far. Among those, 23 belonged to Jaipur. The deaths of doctors are a huge loss for the society. In Jaipur, the pandemic took away lives of many prominent doctors. Among them were Dr Ashok Panagariya, Dr SL Tolani and Dr Mukesh Sharma. “He was dynamic and an unparalleled neurologist who provided insight into various diseases related to nerves, neuromyotonia, channelopathies ìn the field of neurology,” said Dr RK Sureka, former additional principal, SMS Medical College, recalling Padmashree Dr Ashok Panagariya, the former principal and controller of SMS Hospital, who passed away due to Covid complications recently. Dr Sureka had workes with Dr Panagariya for 30 years at SMS Medical College. “We lost eminent doctor Mukesh Sharma due to Covid. He was the only doctor from the state who had represented Rajasthan for more than 20 years in Medical Council of India,” said Dr Virendra Singh, former superintendent of SMS Hospital. Despite the number of fatalities among their fraternity, the confidence and courage of doctors have not shaken. They are still in the forefront of the battle against the pandemic, giving hope to a society which see them as the difference between life and death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/79-raj-docs-fought-lost-to-corona-but-will-live-forever/articleshow/84003632.cms||---

The woman’s 29-year old son survived with 30% burn injuries. Police said the fire was probably caused by a leaking gas cylinder that was set aflame by a short-circuit in the electric meter. The fire department claimed receiving a call around 12.12am about an LPG cylinder blast in Bhikam Singh Colony in Farsh Bazar. “We rushed nine fire tenders to the site of the blaze,” said Atul Garg, director, Delhi Fire Service. “The fire was quickly brought under control and five people were moved out of the house and rushed to the hospital. Four of them had been rendered unconscious after inhaling smoke, while the fifth sustained 30% burn injuries.” The fire department identified the dead as Munni Devi, 45, her sons Naresh, 22, and Omprakash, 20, and daughter Sunita, 18. The eldest of the sons, Lal Chand, 29, suffered burns and is undergoing treatment at a hospital. With his father having died last year, Chand is the lone survivor in the family. He runs a food cart business near a mall in east Delhi. Chand said, “We lived on the ground floor, where the house owner ran a cooking gas refilling shop. He filled smaller cylinders with gas from bigger cylinders.” Recalling the tragic incident, the son said he was on his mobile phone around midnight when his mother asked him who he was phoning at that time. “Suddenly, I saw a ball of fire and thought the roof had collapsed. Then I realised that the gas cylinder had exploded. I ran towards the door but the wall collapsed. The fire went out quickly, but dense smoke filled the rooms. I stuck mine face, and my younger brother’s, out of the window, but it was too late for him and the others. I lost my entire family.” A police team evacuated the families living on the other floors to safety. No one else besides Munni Devi’s family was affected. A police officer said, “There were no burn injuries on the bodies of the deceased. The cause of the fire is believed to be a short circuit in the electric meter board and there is a possibility that a gas cylinder was leaking. Investigations are under progress and legal action will be initiated after recording the statement of the injured Lal Chand.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/48-yr-old-woman-3-kids-die-in-farsh-bazar-blaze/articleshow/84001222.cms||---
---||Thane||Yet another TMC gaffe: Teacher gets call he has ‘died’ of Covid||THANE: A Thane-based teacher, who recovered from Covid in August 2020, got a rude shock on Tuesday when a caller reportedly from the civic corporation’s birth and death registration department informed him about his ‘demise’ due to the SARS-2 infection in April. This is the latest in a series of Covid-related gaffes committed by the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC)—from swapping dead bodies to triple vaccinating a resident. On Wednesday, an audio clip of the phone conversation between the teacher, Chandrashekhar Desai (55), and a municipal staffer went viral. During the one-minute call, the staffer is heard asking Desai about his details only to inform him that, as per the records, he is dead. The caller immediately apologised and disconnected the call after Desai questioned the lapse. He went to the TMC headquarters and saw his name on the list of deceased patients. “I was not allowed to click a picture of the records. I was told there could be some error on part of the department,” Desai said. However, TMC officials on Wednesday told TOI that its officials were only cross-checking the data of 16 death cases sent by the State Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) cell, as per protocol. Death-related data is verified at the local level and sent back to the state before being uploaded on the national database. TMC health officer Dr Vaijayanati Deoghekar said: “The corporation is not at fault as we only verify the names of the deceased sent to us daily. This is the first incident that has been highlighted in Thane and we feel there could be some error somewhere. We have alerted the state regarding the same,” she said. IDSP chief Dr Pradeep Awate remained unavailable for comment despite repeated attempts.

However, employees were not injured in the fire, which broke out in the godown at Alathur near Avinashi. According to the employees, the fire was noticed as a small spark in the cotton stock, which soon spread all over the godown burning down several bales as well as machineries there. The workers attempted to put out the fire, but failed in the attempts as the flames spread fast. They informed fire and rescue personnel, who rushed the water tenders from Avinashi. After struggling for about two hours, the fire was finally extinguished. “However, huge mounds of cotton stock were burnt to ashes by the time,” said a fire service personnel. Neither the employees nor the fire service personnel were certain about the cause of fire, but suspect that it could be due to short circuit. Officials have asked other mills to conduct proper and periodical maintenance work to avoid short circuits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cotton-bales-gutted-in-fire-at-godown/articleshow/84001150.cms||---

The properties are situated in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. The scam worth more than Rs1,000 crore came to light in August 2017. Funds from government bank accounts were fraudulently transferred into the accounts of an NGO, Srijan Mahila Vikas Sahyog Samiti (SMVSS), in connivance with government and bank authorities in Bhagalpur and several other districts of Bihar. These funds were further laundered to the bank accounts of different firms and private persons.

Sources said the ED attached 12 flats worth Rs3.09 crore in Patna, Bhagalpur and Ghaziabad. “One flat in Patna is in the name of late Manorama Devi, who was the NGO’s secretary. Another flat is in the name of her daughter and son-in-law in Ghaziabad. One flat each is in the name of bank employee Sant Kumar Sinha and his wife in Bhagalpur and Ghaziabad respectively,” sources said. They said another flat, also in Ghaziabad, is in the name of accused Devankaar Mishra and his wife Shashilata Mishra. Sources said the accused government audit officer Satish Kumar Mishra had also purchased two flats in Ghaziabad in the name of his son and daughter. “Government employee Babita Jha also had a flat in Ghaziabad.

---||Coimbatore||Three cheers to Tamil Nadu Agricultural University||Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) was established to produce technically savvy agricultural graduates. But the byproduct appears to be a range of civil servants who have now come to occupy senior positions in administration. Days after one of TNAU’s alumnus Irai Anbu became chief secretary, it is the turn of another alumnus C Sylendra Babu to occupy the top seat in the state police department on Tuesday. On Wednesday yet another key posting – vice chancellor of Salem Periyar University – was also that of TNAU alumnus. R Jagannathan has also worked as the dean agriculture, professor and head, agricultural meteorology/agro-climatic research centre in TNAU. Every year at least five of TNAU alumni crack UPSC and go on to occupy high positions in police and other departments. “It is the academic ambience in TNAU and its affiliated colleges and the motivation we offer to the students that should be credited for such high numbers of our alumni cracking UPSC,” says Prof K Krishnamurthy, secretary of TNAU Alumni Association and former dean of Agri College and Research Institute, Madurai. Krishnamurthy himself aspired to become a civil servant but had to drop the idea due to eligibility criteria, but later had a stint as advisor for UPSC. Because of his association with UPSC, he knew the interview methods and wanted to train students. “I wanted other students to get what I could not,’’ he said. Among the first to get coached was former state health secretary V K Subburaj who eventually became the first from TNAU to crack UPSC in 1978. After Subburaj became an IAS he visited TNAU and gave speeches to the students which motivated many. “At that time, Sylendra Babu as well as ADGP M Ravi were students and got inspired to pursue civil services,” he said. Sylendra Babu has on multiple occasions credited TNAU as well as Krishnamurthi for his achievements. Soon it became a culture of sorts for students in TNAU, Coimbatore, as well as its affiliated colleges to prepare for UPSC. Some also chose BSc agriculture with the objective of later preparing for UPSC. Not just Irai Anbu, former chief secretary K Shanmugam was also an alumnus of TNAU, beside former west zone IG Periaiah, central zone IG V Balakrishnan, IAS officer Amutha and joint secretary of department of Atomic Energy, Mumbai, Mervin Alexander.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/three-cheers-to-tnau/articleshow/84001212.cms||Mayilvaganan

Going by past precedent, other brands are likely to follow the market leader shortly.

A press release issued by the company Wednesday said, “The increase of Rs 2 per litre translates into 4% increase in MRP which is much lower than average food inflation...” GCMMF cited higher input costs as the reason for the hike. “... in the last 1.5 years Amul has not made any price revision in its fresh milk category. ”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-price-of-amul-milk-increases-by-rs-2-per-litre-from-today-over-high-input-cost/articleshow/84003645.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

We will not allow this to happen. We are shutting down courts (for physical hearing). We are not functioning full strength. Political rallies are going on,” said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni while hearing a PIL on Covid-19 management. The judges mentioned the protest rally for naming of the Navi Mumbai airport and noted that there were 25,000 participants. “How will you manage Covid? Is this the time to rally? The last rally was over the naming of the airport. Can it not wait till Covid is over?” the CJ asked. The judges commented that though the airport was not ready for operation, but there was a haste to name it. “First name, then airport…And you assemble 25,000 people!” the CJ remarked. Advocate Rajesh Inamdar, for a petitioner, referred to the OBC quota rallies. The judges also hinted at the protests for Maratha reservations when a decision on the state’s review of the Supreme Court order is awaited. “When will political leaders go before the electorate and say ‘the matter is before the court, the highest court in the land. It has the final say, not the government’?” the chief justice said. The judges then asked if political leaders are not on par with those holding fake vaccination camps. “Are they any less responsible than those holding fake vaccination camps? They are trying to take mileage for political gains. Why? Let it (rallies) wait for some time,” the CJ said. Inamdar said the Delta variant figures are highest in Maharashtra with 21 cases to date. He said Japan is seeing a fifth Covid wave and the UK a fourth wave. “These countries are not able to tackle it,” he said, adding that “we are not able to recover from the second wave.” The judges said there are lessons to be learnt from the second wave in India. “We should all take lessons from the second wave. Everything was normal since November. We invited it,” the chief justice lamented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/stop-political-rallies-that-flout-covid-protocol-bombay-hc-tells-state/articleshow/84001244.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Workers have been busy restoring the iconic black weathercock — synonymous to the 205-year-old church — since the beginning of last month. The weathercock, which was black in colour and weighed over 100 kilograms is as old as the church which was built in 1815. Scaffoldings have been put up around the spire of the church and the weathercock will be back on top soon. Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage or Intach is sponsoring the entire project. A restorer from the capital has set up a workshop inside the church. “Intach is sponsoring theentire project. We have tried to restore the bird from the bits and pieces available from the neighbourhoods after the cyclone blew it away,” GM Kapur of Intach. The estimated cost could be over a million rupees. Kapur said one of the challenges was to gain access to the top of the spire. “We have managed to setup the scaffoldings and taken stock of how it is upstairs. We are now working at overcoming the challenge of taking the bird to its original place. Safety of everybody involved is our main concern,” said Kapur. “The work had to be stopped after restrictions were imposed in the middle of May due to the pandemic. Now the work has resumed and if everything goes fine, the weathercock should be back at its original position soon,” said Reverend Father Swarup Bar of St Andrew’s Church. “After the weathercock was blown away by Cyclone Amphan, we tried to retrieve bits and pieces from the neighbourhood. It has been restored putting the bits and pieces together.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/amphan-ravaged-weathercock-restored-to-be-back-atop-st-andrews-church-soon/articleshow/83999321.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Ahmedabad||Don’t be swayed by social media, Chief Justice of India N V Ramana to judges||AHMEDABAD: Chief Justice of India N V Ramana on Wednesday asked judges not to be “swayed” by the emotional pitch of public opinion on social media, but also said that they cannot also live in ivory towers and ignore what is going on at present to decide on social issues. Speaking on the subject ‘Rule of Law’ for the Justice P D Desai Memorial Lecture, the CJI said that media trials cannot be a guiding factor in deciding cases. He spoke on the independence of the judiciary and warned judges against the opinion building that is taking place on social media. He said, “The judiciary cannot be controlled, directly or indirectly, by the legislature or the executive, or else the rule of law will become illusory. At the same time, judges should not be swayed by the emotional pitch of public opinion which is getting amplified through social media.” He further said, “Judges should be mindful of the fact that the noise that is amplified is not necessarily reflective of what is right and what the majority believes in. These new media tools have enormous amplifying ability are incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong, good and bad and real and fake. Therefore, media trials cannot be a guiding factor in deciding cases. It is therefore vital to function independently and withstand all external aids and pressures. While there is a lot of discussion about the pressure from the executive, it is also imperative to start a discourse as to how social media trends can affect institutions.” However, the CJI insisted that judges and the judiciary cannot completely dissociate from what is going on, “Judges cannot stay in ivory castles and decide questions which pertain to social issues... The ultimate responsibility of a judge is, after all, to uphold the Constitution and the laws. Reason, reasonableness and protection of human dignity are the values that will serve us well.” Justice Ramana also insisted that the judiciary’s function is to apply checks on governmental power and action and to have complete freedom. The importance of the judiciary should not blind judges to the fact that the responsibility of safeguarding constitutionalism lies not just on the courts, but other organs are equally responsible. The CJI also said that the people of India have voted wisely despite illiteracy and alleged ignorance as they have changed eight ruling parties and alliances of parties in 17 general elections. Now it is the turn of those who are manning key areas to see whether they are living up to constitutional values.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dont-be-swayed-by-social-media-cji-to-judges/articleshow/84001214.cms||---

So far, these commuters had been travelling in buses operated by the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) that are in a very poor condition. The NMC on Wednesday operated nine buses on as many routes from two depots — Tapovan and Nashik Road. NMC’ executive engineer B G Mali said we conducted the trials with passengers and got a positive feedback from them. “It was also a trial for the conductors who gave tickets to the passengers even though it was a free ride. The trial run will continue on Thursday as well. The city bus service is to be launched between July 1 and 10 and the exact date is to be announced shortly,” he said. “The bus has various features like automatic doors, CCTV cameras, public address system, among others. Moreover, the bus driver can be given any message directly from the command control room in case there is heavy traffic on any route or any emergency message. Moreover, there are panic buttons that the passengers may use to stop the bus in case of emergency,” he added. Vikram Gaikwad, a commuter, said it was a good experience travelling in the city buses. “This will be helpful for the commuters who commute on a regular basis. We want the NMC to start city bus service immediately connecting all the routes in the city,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/people-get-free-rides-during-trial-of-city-buses-in-nashik/articleshow/83994282.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Jaipur||Ranthambore, Sariska to remain partially shut for three months||JAIPUR: Two tiger reserves in the state, Ranthambore National Park and Sariska Tiger Reserve, will be partially closed for tourism this monsoon from July 1 to September 30. Like previous years, safari in zone 6 to 10 of the Ranthambore will be opened for tourists. The tourism in Ranthambore instantly gained momentum after the park was opened after a hiatus of two-and-half months. Since June 25, 2,356 wildlife tourists have visited the park. However, tourists will now have to wait for another three months to go for safari in zone 1 to 5. An official said, “Following the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA)’s directions, the jungle safaris in the core area of tiger reserve is ceased during monsoon. It will allow forests to rejuvenate and tigers to breed.” In Sariska, tourists can go for safari on routes, including Tehla- Kalighati, Umri junction and buffer zones. The stakeholders at STR are elated as on the decided routes there is a possibility of better sighting of tigers for tourists. “Earlier, wildlife tourists coming to Sariska for safari during this season was feeling duped as there was zero sighting. We have requested the administration to at least open one route where there is possibility for tiger sightings.” For the past few years, reserves have been open for tourists as forest administration believes that tourism helps to monitor tigers and check illegal grazing, poaching and deforestation. Also, it’s not risky for tourists as barring few jungle tracks, most of the park terrains where tourism is allowed remains dry. A senior official at RNP said, “Every year, zones are open for tourism keeping in mind the safety of the tourists and condition of roads. Also, we open zones in parks on rotation basis for three months round the year wherein each zone would be closed for three months,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rbore-sariska-to-remain-partially-shut-for-3-months/articleshow/84003689.cms||---

Inoculation was also affected in rural areas to a great extent. There will be no vaccination on Thursday and Friday in the entire district due to lack of supply of doses from the central government. Sources from the office of deputy director of health services told TOI fresh stock of doses of Covishield is likely to come on Friday evening. “Vaccination can be resumed on Saturday if doses are received on Friday.” Thus, there will be no free-of-cost vaccination in the city for four consecutive days and in rural areas for two days. On Wednesday, Covishield vaccination continued at one centre dedicated for staff of Indian Air Force. The civic body continued Covaxin jabs for 45-plus age group at three centres and second dose for 18-44 age group. The NMC centres inoculated 559 beneficiaries. On June 23, when vaccination for 18-44 age group resumed, 23,703 had taken the jab in city. Record 30,313 beneficiaries were inoculated in the city on June 26. The Zilla Parishad (ZP) could administer vaccine at only eight of 135 centres on Wednesday where 300 got the jab. Here. inoculation had increased to 18,500 per day after resumption of vaccination of 18-44 age group. At 10 private hospitals, 2,395 took the jab on Wednesday, which is slightly more than that registered on Tuesday (2,117) and Monday (1,947). Thus, vaccination declined to 3,254 in the district on Wednesday. Vaccination had increased to 45,839 on June 26. The central government had started vaccination of 18-44 age group on May 1 but placed responsibility of procuring doses and vaccination on states. The state government started vaccination for this age group on May 1 but stopped it on May 12 citing shortage of doses. The centre announced resumption of vaccination for 18-44 age group from June 21. It restarted from June 23 in the state. Again, the district is facing similar interruptions due to lack of supply of sufficient number of doses from the centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-covishield-jab-at-govt-centres-in-entire-dist-for-next-2-days/articleshow/83994366.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore education officials, teachers enroll students at their doorsteps||COIMBATORE: Trudging an unusual path, educational officials and government schoolteachers are now visiting students at their houses to enrol them to the schools and handover books. Now that the state government has relaxed the lockdown norms, school managements in the district have started the admission process and distribution of books to the students. In most of the cases, students visit the schools with their parents, fill the admission forms and get enrolled. But there are rare instances of teachers going in search of children to their houses to get them enrolled. On Monday morning, block educational officer M Ramesh Kumar, along the headmaster and teachers of the panchayat union middle school at Lingapuram, had gone to meet the children at their houses at Gandhavayal tribal settlement, which is at least 2km away. They have enrolled 11 new students to the school for kindergarten and Class VI. Ramesh said, “Most of the children’s parents make a living by collecting honey and other edible items from forest and selling them in the market. The children are often left alone at their houses. At a time like this, it is difficult for them to visit the school to collect the books. So, we went to the settlement and distributed the books. We also enrolled new students.” Explaining that the students have to cross the bridge connecting Lingapuram and Gandhavayal to reach the school, he said the bridge would be submerged for most part of the year, forcing the students to use coracle to cross the 300 metres wide river. The official said they have postponed the visit to Uliyur settlement to the next week following the reports of tusker Bahubali roaming around the adjoining area. In another instance, R Saminathan, headmaster of the panchayat union middle school at 24 Veerapandi, visited the students at their houses at Marudhangarai melpathi, Marudhangari Keelpathi and Kalvai areas, which are more than 3.5km away from the school, on Tuesday. He said, “About 25 children from these areas are studying in our school. There were also four to five children, who are eligible to join the school. Due to lack of transportation facilities, parents have to hire auto or jeep to reach the school. In order to avoid inconvenience, I decided to travel to the areas and complete both the enrolment and book distribution process.” Saminathan said his visit has evoked good response and they would be in touch with the students and their families constantly in order to create a bond with them and make them regular at the school. The headmaster used to visit the students with snacks before the pandemic. During the lockdown, he had visited them with grocery items. The school education department had earlier arranged transportation facilities to ferry the students to and from their houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/edu-officials-teachers-enrol-students-at-their-doorsteps/articleshow/84001238.cms||Nivedha Selvam
---||Delhi||Initiative to educate professionals on transgender health||New Delhi: To promote trans-inclusive healthcare and to educate healthcare professionals on transgender health, an initiative, ‘TransCare:MedEd’, has been launched by Sangath, a public health research NGO, in association with the University of Chicago. As part of the initiative, workshops will be conducted for healthcare professionals, medical educators and other stakeholders to bring in changes in mindset towards transgenders’ healthcare. “The project is planned in collaboration with the transgender community, with Dr Aqsa Shaikh of Jamia Hamdard and is funded by the University of Chicago,” the organisation stated. According to Sangath, TransCare:MedEd aims to highlight global best practices in shared decision-making for vulnerable communities and to create a set of core competencies on trans-affirmative healthcare for India. Shaikh, associate professor of community medicine at Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, said it was a year-long project and workshops would be conducted in Delhi, Bhopal and Manipal. Dr Satendra Singh, disability leader and professor at University College of Medical Sciences, emphasised on the previous successful advocacy. “I was the Indian lead on the University of Chicago’s ‘Disability-inclusive compassionate care’ project, which resulted in disability competencies and their subsequent implementation into the new medical curriculum in India. We intend to do the same with this initiative.” Anant Bhan, leading bioethicist associated with the project, said that TransCare MedEd would focus on the need for identifying and acting on areas of reform in health professionals’ education. “This community-based approach across multiple Indian cities to develop trans health competencies is a major step towards bridging the health inequities faced by trans and gender non-binary people living in India,” said Anu Hazra, project lead and assistant professor at University of Chicago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/initiative-to-educate-professionals-on-transgender-health/articleshow/84001394.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Pune||CoWIN shows 45 lakh people in Pune given at least one dose||PUNE: As many as 45 lakh people in the district have been given at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccines so far, data on CoWIN has shown. The vaccination database showed that 36.78 lakh people have received at least the first shot of Covishield or Covaxin, while 8.93 lakh people have been given their second shot as well. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said vaccination numbers have seen a major boost in June. He added that if supplies remain steady, July too could see similar levels of coverage. June, with more than 12 lakh vaccinated, has recorded the best coverage since April, when the district had vaccinated more than 14 lakh beneficiaries. “We are also aware that many citizens are now waiting to get their second dose of Covishield. It is going to be a real challenge to vaccinate all of them,” he said. In July, nearly 10 lakh people in the district from the 45-plus group are expected to become eligible for a second dose of Covishield. These beneficiaries were given their first shots early in April and and according to guidelines, they'll need the second after 12 to 16 weeks. Deshmukh said that the strategy to reserve Covaxin stock only for second doses has been relaxed a bit to allow some beneficiaries to receive a first dose. “If some doses are left from an already opened vial, vaccinators have been allowed to give them to first-dose beneficiaries.” There was no fresh supply of vaccines on Wednesday. District officials who were expecting a batch said they are now hoping it lands on Friday. “We might receive around one lakh doses of Covishield by Friday,” Deshmukh said. In June, Pune district received nearly 6.7 lakh doses of both Covishield and Covaxin. For Thursday, July 1, the PCMC has decided to carry out vaccinations across eight sites — for first and second-dose beneficiaries. The civic body has set aside another eight centres for healthcare and frontline staff who are due for a second dose. The PMC had not announced a vaccine plan for Thursday till late on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cowin-shows-45-lakh-people-in-dist-given-at-least-one-dose/articleshow/84001258.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Agra||Age records tweaked, 20 minors trafficked from Bihar for Delhi factories rescued in Uttar Pradesh||AGRA: Twenty minor boys, most of whom are from poor Muslim families in Bihar, were rescued from trains in Aligarh and Firozabad in three raids when they were being taken to Delhi, allegedly to work in packaging factories across the city. Their traffickers, 10 of them, work in those factories, were the boys’ “neighbours” in Bihar and had made fake Aadhaar cards to show they were not underage. They have been arrested. The first tip-off came on Saturday. Eight children were being escorted by four men on the Kamakhya Anand Vihar Festival Special. It seemed suspicious. “I received information through my sources,” Surya Pratap Misra, UP state coordinator for anti-child trafficking NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA), told TOI. The youngest among them was nine. “I got in touch with the district authorities and railway officials,” Mishra said. The children were rescued from Aligarh railway station. Two days later, on Monday, Misra was tipped off again. This time, they were travelling in two batches — four children accompanied by two men, all from Araria, and eight kids with four men, all from Katihar. The first group was rescued from Firozabad and the latter from Aligarh. While they are still trying to get in touch with the children’s families, the BBA coordinator said the pandemic has made poor families like theirs soft targets. “Because of the lockdown and resulting unemployment, many families are turning easy prey for traffickers, who promise jobs in other cities,” he added. “The children told us they were being taken to Delhi to work in factories. The traffickers had made their fake Aadhaar cards. One of them said he was promised Rs 5,000 a month and an additional Rs 200 a week,” Gyanendra Misra, director of Childline in Aligarh, told TOI. “The children will be produced before the Child Welfare Committee and then handed over to their families.” The traffickers have been booked under sections 370 (importing, exporting, removing, buying, selling or disposing of any person as a slave, or accepting, receiving or detaining against his will any person as a slave) and 374 (unlawful compulsory labour) of the IPC, and Section 14(3)(d) of the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986 (penalty for failing to compy with Act, simple imprisonment up to one month or with fine up to Rs 10,000, or both), government railway police thana in charge in Aligarh AM Khan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/age-records-tweaked-20-minors-trafficked-from-bihar-for-delhi-factories-rescued-in-up/articleshow/83997225.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Civic committee directs BMC to stay fire service fees’ recovery||Mumbai: The civic standing committee meeting on Wednesday was adjourned over the BMC move to recover fire service fees and annual fees from builders and housing societies. After opposition to the move from corporators, the standing committee chairman, Shiv Sena’s Yashwant Jadhav, directed that the circular to recover the fees be stalled. Corporators called the move unfair and asked the civic administration to stay the recovery process. The adjournment motion was moved by Shiv Sena corporator Vishakha Raut. Congress corporator Ravi Raja, who is the opposition leader in the BMC, said the civic administration had failed to recover the fees since 2014 and they must not penalise residents now. “This delay was caused due to negligence of the BMC officials. When the BMC tries to recover the fire service fee, builders will pass it on to home buyers. This will add to the burden on the common man. Even the 1% annual fee will be collected along with property tax and this will mean that the property tax will be hiked. The ruling Shiv Sena is failing to control the administration,” Raja said. Corporators demanded a high level probe into the delay in levying the fees and causing a loss of revenue to the BMC.BJP corporator Vinod Mishra wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, asking him to stay the decision to recover the fees. “This is a Rs 5,000 crore scam since the BMC and the state government have lost revenue. But we will not allow the BMC to loot the common man. No charges should be levied on the residents. The municipal commissioner is not fixing responsibility on fire brigade officials. There must be a probe by the central vigilance commission (CVC) and an FIR must be filed with the economic offences wing (EOW) of the Mumbai police,” Mishra said. Joint municipal commissioner Ramesh Pawar had raised a red flag last year over non-collection of fire service fees and annual fees since 2014 and recommended an enquiry against fire brigade officials for causing a loss of “crores” in revenue to the BMC. His recommendation was ignored though. Chahal did not respond to a query from TOI on whether any enquiry was initiated. Mumbai Congress chief Bhai Jagtap on Wednesday wrote to Chahal and Thackeray asking them to scrap the circular. On June 7, the fire brigade issued the circular to recover the fees from builders and housing societies retrospectively from 2014.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-civic-committee-directs-bmc-to-stay-fire-service-fees-recovery/articleshow/84003705.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The institute signed over licenses for six technologies, including soil moisture indicator, cane jam production from sugarcane juice, technology for production of cane dietary fibre food products, liquid jaggery, sugarcane de-trashing tool and sugarcane rind removing equipment to Nashik-based Celebrating Farmers Edge International and license for the motorized double-headed sugarcane single bud cutting machine to Singanallur-based Sri Balaji Industries. SBI director Bakshmi Ram signed over the licenses to representatives of the firms. “Soil Moisture Indicator technology, which won the first prize in the National Water Awards-2021, has so far been licensed to 19 firms across the country, while liquid jaggery production technology has been licensed to seven firms in Kerala and Tamil Nadu,” said the director. “The sugarcane de-trashing tool is being licensed for the second time while the rest of the technologies are being licensed for the first time.” This gives the companies a non-exclusive license to manufacture products based on the technologies for a period of five to 10 years. This helps institute-developed technologies be mass produced and reach as many farmers as possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/city-based-institute-shares-seven-technologies/articleshow/84001255.cms||---
---||Pune||Drive targets over 300 slum pockets in Pune||PUNE: More than 4.6 lakh residents of the city's 399 slum pockets (notified/non-notified) will be vaccinated against Covid-19 in a PMC programme set to start from July 5. Officials from the civic body said they will be gathering details of all eligible slum residents (aged 18 and above) for the closer-to-home drives, which will be held at schools, community halls or PMC-run establishments that are near the slums. The idea is to ensure slum residents who are on daily wages do not miss out on pay by standing for hours in queue at PMC vaccine sites. Covid vaccination of people living in densely populated slums has been a priority for the civic authorities. Authorities said efforts are on to prepare sites and infrastructure required for the drive. “Ward offices have been asked to start identifying community halls, PMC offices/establishments and schools near slums that can host the vaccination sessions. They will have to ensure internet connectivity and other required infrastrustructure at these places before starting the vaccination,” said Vaishali Jadhav, the PMC's Covid-19 inoculation chief. The ward offices will have to provide three rooms, internet connection and adequate seating at the booths. “The PMC’s health department will provide doctors, nurses and vaccines,” Jadhav said. There are 7,40,180 people living in a total of 1,40,846 homes in the 399 slums. The PMC hopes to cover 63% of this target, which amounts to 4,66,313 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/drive-targets-over-300-slum-pockets/articleshow/84001314.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Vasant-Rajab memorial, school deteriorate in neglect||AHMEDABAD: Wednesday will mark the 75th year of the martyrdom of two friends in Ahmedabad, who bond over friendship, love and selflessness but are now fading away in our memories. On July 1 of 1946, Vasantrao Hegishte and Rajab Ali Lakhani had staved off hordes of rioters during the annual Rath Yatra from Jamalpur’s Jagannath Temple — the former protecting Muslims, the latter saving Hindus — with both losing their lives in their effort to restore communal peace and our faith in humanity. Today, the two memorials in their name are chipping away in neglect. Lakhani’s grave lies dilapidated at Chartoda Kabrastan in Gomtipur area after being renovated once in 2012. A school dedicated to their friendship in the early1960s the ‘Vasant-Rajab Madhyamik Shala’ maintained by Jamalpur-Raikhad Seva Sangh’ now lies in an audacious state, crying for repairs and seething in neglect and sealed by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) for non-payment of property taxes. “An effort is being made including that by a local MLA who has written to allocate Rs 2 lakh MLA LAD funds towards restoration of Lakhani’s grave. But now we need the school to restart if we are to keep the memory of the sacrifice alive in the community’s mind,” says city based historian Rizwan Kadri. Vasantrao was born in Ahmedabad on May 16, 1906. Under the influence of the freedom struggle he left the English school and joined the nationalist school started by Mahatma Gandhi. Gujarat Vidyapith nurtured the feeling of social service and patriotism in him. He accompanied Bapu during the Dandi march till Aslali and went to prison in 1930 during the Salt Satyagraha. Lakhani was born in 1919 in Karachi. His family hailed from the then princely state of Limbdi in Kathiawar. He passed his matriculation examination in 1936 and joined Samaldas College in Bhavnagar to pursue Bachelor of Arts. He met Vasantrao in Ahmedabad and forged a strong friendship. He called himself a ‘Hindustani’. In 2015, chief minister Anandiben Patel had inaugurated a museum dedicated to the two friends at Gaekwad Haveli and vowed that their sacrifice will not be forgotten. “The CM had then asked the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) to ensure that a project that keeps their memory alive in public memory be worked out,” said a senior AMC official in the South zone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vasant-rajab-memorial-school-deteriorate-in-neglect/articleshow/84001471.cms||---
---||Delhi||Health mgmt system to be in place by March||New Delhi: After reviewing the progress of the ambitious health information management system (HIMS), chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said that implementation of the scheme would be done by March 2022 as it had been delayed due to the pandemic. Along with HIMS, a health helpline would also be started and special surveys conducted for issuing e-health cards. The digital system aims to transform consultation and health management in government hospitals. Kejriwal directed officials to ensure implementation of the project within the new deadline. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, who is the nodal minister for Covid-19, and health minister Satyendar Jain were also present in the meeting, besides senior officials, including those from the health department. After the meeting, Kejriwal tweeted that Delhi government was creating the most modern health information system and due to Covid-19, there were some delays. He hoped the scheme would start by March next year. Under HIMS, health cards would be issued to all residents of Delhi, which would ensure extending the benefits of the government’s healthcare services to them. An official said that the government would be carrying out a special survey to ensure that citizens were brought under the umbrella of the system. After e-health cards are issued, they would be integrated with HIMS. The system seeks to target the healthcare delivery process. All patient care services, hospital administration, budgeting and planning, supply chain management, and back-end services and processes would be brought under it. As far as the deployment model was concerned, the entire system would be on the cloud and digitised. This would enable citizens to avail of information on a single platform, which would help them during emergencies. With the help of their registered card number, the hospitals would be able to access their health-related information and past registry. There would also be a 24x7 call centre to help patients with health-related information, seeking consultation and other assistance. The centralised call centre would provide two levels of help — first where an operator would receive calls and messages and provide people with requisite information, and second where doctors and experts would provide appointments based on the problem or immediately give solutions for emergency cases. The facility would do away with the need for patients to carry bunches of medical history reports when they visit doctors because the hospitals would be able to access the documents through HIMS. The project would make Delhi the only state to have a cloud-based health management system. After implementation, the system would be monitored and reviewed regularly and extended to private healthcare facilities in the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/health-mgmt-system-to-be-in-place-by-march/articleshow/84049267.cms||AlokKNMishra

After touching record numbers in June, the immunisation drive has slowed down in the state since the past two days after supplies dried up. Private centres have once again taken a lead in administering doses. Additional chief secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas said fresh stocks are expected to arrive by July 2, adding that the rate of vaccination depends on the availability of doses. The state is expecting to receive 9-10lakh doses, which may suffice for a few days. In June, the state administered over 95.23lakh doses, highest since the drive started. The peak came after a drop in May when a little over 60lakh doses were administered. In April, over 88.68lakh doses were given across the state. The state had reached a peak of 7,38,450 on June 23 while Mumbai hit 1.80lakh vaccinations on June 28. Mumbai had, in fact, vaccinated over a lakh doses for three consecutive days on June 21, 22 and 23. The state’s coverage dropped to 3.87lakh on Tuesday and 2.54lakh on Wednesday. Similarly, Mumbai’s daily vaccinations dropped to 63,579 on Wednesday. The BMC said immunisation will remain suspended at government and municipal corporation-run centres due to insufficient supply. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said they are hoping to receive some stocks on Thursday. “If they arrive, we will resume vaccination from Friday,” he said. Public health minister Rajesh Tope had urged people to come out in big numbers for vaccinations. He had said the number of people who had taken the first dose was significant but the number of fully vaccinated was far from desirable. As on Wednesday, 63,71,352 people had taken both doses of the vaccine in Maharashtra. The state has an adult population of 8.5crore.  In Mumbai, 10.72 lakh people have taken both doses and nearly 33lakh have taken the first dose. Of the 63,579 doses administered in Mumbai on Wednesday, 36,054 were in private and 27,525 were at the public centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-calls-off-vaccine-drive-on-thursday-due-to-supply-shortage/articleshow/84001352.cms||---

People who had come to get the first dose of the vaccines had to return without getting jabbed. Only the second dose of the vaccines were available at selected centres. Over 95 per cent centres in the district went without vaccination. The situation remained the same in Firozabad, Etah, Kasganj and other districts of Agra region. According to the health department officials, demand for supply of vaccine has been sent to the state government. Following the second wave of Covid-19, people started rushing to the flocking vaccination centers. The crowd further swelled after people above 18 years were allowed to take the vaccine from May 1. On Wednesday, the Covid-19 vaccine ran out of stock at over 370 designated vaccine centres out of total 387 in the district. Chief medical officer of Agra district Dr RC Pandey said, “Covid-19 vaccine is out of stock at majority of the centres. The limited stock available at selected centres is being used for people due to get their second dose. Since past one week, we have not received supply of vaccine. Higher authorities have been informed. We are expecting supply of vaccine in the next two days.” According to the health department records, till Wednesday 8,17,658 people received Covid-19 vaccine in Agra district. Out of these, 7,12,344 people received the first dose and 1,05,314 received the second dose. Total 7,45,795 people have been administered with Covishield and 71,863 with Covaxin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/covid-19-vaccine-out-of-stock-at-over-95-percent-centres-in-agra/articleshow/83997235.cms||---
---||Delhi||In Delhi, 2,000 kids lost at least one parent to Covid||NEW DELHI: In the first week of April, Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) launched an all-day helpline (9311551393) that people could use to report cases or seek information on child rights. In the three months since, the helpline has received more than 4,500 complaints, of which 2,200 were in the SOS category needing immediate attention of the authorities. The distress calls pertained to children or their families urgently needing essential supplies such as rations or medical assistance, specially Covid-testing help. There were also many reports related to abandoned children. According to DCPCR, these SOS complaints were immediately responded to by a designated team, which ensured that all these complaints were addressed within 24 hours of their being recorded. Around 85% of the SOS calls were successfully resolved within 24 hours, while the rest were resolved within 72 hours, according to commission officials. Besides receiving distress calls, DCPCR has employed the helpline to undertake various wellbeing surveys and identification surveys to find children who had lost their parents due to Covid. The data was provided by Delhi government’s health department. DCPCR has been able to trace 2,029 children till date who had either lost one or both parents to the coronavirus. Of the children traced, 67 have lost both their parents to Covid, whereas 651 children have lost just their mother and 1,311, their father. The details of these children have been shared with the department of women & child development for necessary action and to enrol them as eligible beneficiaries in the scheme notified by Delhi government for children who lose their parents due to coronavirus infection. Anurag Kundu, chairperson of DCPCR, said that overall in the last three months, the child rights helpline had enabled the commission to reach out to an increasing number of children and their families and also made the panel more accessible to and closer to the children and their families. The chairperson stressed that it was only a humble beginning and the helpline had a long way to go in firmly establishing itself as a useful and reliable medium for social welfare. Going by the current trend, DCPCR will receive nearly 20,000 complaints this year. This is nearly 1,300% of the average of the past three years and is two-and-half times the complaints the commission has received in 12 years. “This shows how DCPCR has become accessible to ordinary citizens and has earned their trust, " Kundu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2k-kids-lost-at-least-one-parent-to-covid/articleshow/84001301.cms||---

But this year, the class of 2021 has received fewer international offers: less than 200 IITians across the country have landed an overseas job. While some of the older campuses have seen a substantial reduction in international job opportunities, younger IITs have seen a marginal drop. Not only have offers reduced, even the compensation packages at India’s blue-chip institutes have shrunk. At IIT Bombay, international placements for this year’s graduating class stood at 58, down from 159 last year. Numbers at IIT Kanpur have halved. And at IIT Delhi, they are down from the maximum of 45-plus in 2019 (they have hovered around 30 on an average for the past three years), said the institute’s spokesperson. At IIT Roorkee too, offers have reduced (see table). IIT Gandhinagar has not had a direct international posting since the pandemic began in 2020 but before that offers would pour in from Japan and Germany-based organizations. IIT Madras did not share information. As for compensation packages, at IIT Roorkee it plummeted from Rs 153.97 lakh per annum to Rs 69.05 lakh a year. At IIT-B, the highest international annual compensation in 2019 and 2020 was constant at US$ 1.64 lakh. This year, it was recorded at Euro 1.57 lakh per annum. “Due to uncertainty because of pandemic and fluctuating travel restrictions, international job offers this year are less compared to the last two years,” said Bithiah Grace Jaganathan, faculty coordinator, placement, IIT Guwahati. “Placements were a challenge during the time of pandemic. Running the entire process (tests, interviews) online with students located in remote parts of the country with limited connectivity, enhanced the level of difficulty. We hope the markets revive in the near future and business returns to normalcy by the beginning of the next placement season, so that we can conduct a smooth placement process for the next batch of students,” said IITB's placement officer. A lot about the challenging placement season was summed up by IIT Roorkee which interestingly conducted an awards ceremony to celebrate students’ contribution in conducting the placement drive. “Covid blues made placements one of the most challenging tasks. Though cracking the number of placements has never been a matter of concern for IIT Roorkee, maintaining the quality, meeting students’ high expectations, and hitting the high package bar set over the years, was the most ambitious and demanding task,” said the institute’s spokesperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pandemic-blues-less-than-200-iitians-land-intl-jobs/articleshow/84003769.cms||Hemali Chhapia
---||Delhi||Women safety, street domination top new Delhi Police chief’s seven-point agenda||NEW DELHI: Balaji Srivastav, the 1988-batch IPS officer who took over as Delhi Police commissioner on Wednesday, drew a seven-point agenda for the force after the first meeting with the top brass. Street domination, women’s safety, public interface, grievance redressal, police visibility, anti-terror measures and police welfare would be the focus areas in the coming days, he said. Known as someone who goes by the book and gives a lot of importance to an organised system with proper paperwork in place, Srivastav spent a little over two hours in the first meeting with special commissioners in the evening. The new police chief also stressed upon enforcement of Covid-related guidelines appropriately. “After taking charge, the police commissioner held a meeting with senior officers at police headquarters to set the agenda. He discussed the priority areas for Delhi Police in the coming days. Domination to curb street crime, direct public interface at the district level for grievance redressal, ensuring women’s safety, welfare of personnel and taking anti-terror measures are among the priority areas,” said the spokesperson for the force. Srivastav, who will retire from service in 2024 and is expected to have a fairly long tenure as police commissioner, has his task cut out. Be it the farmers’ protest or the much talked about riots conspiracy and the main probe of 53 deaths, he needs to deliver on multiple fronts. After the drone attack in J&K, intelligence agencies foresee terror groups attempting to replicate the experiment elsewhere, so security in the capital would be a prime agenda for the new top cop. A native of Lucknow, Srivastav would be overseeing the ongoing recruitment of policemen, apart from ensuring that the drive to catch the Red Fort violence perpetrators doesn’t lose steam. Any further waves of Covid-19 would be additional challenges. While serving in Research & Analysis Wing (R&AW) for nine years, Srivastav handled sensitive assignments, including a stint in London. An economics (hons) graduate from St Stephen’s College of Delhi University, he was last posted as special commissioner, vigilance. He had earlier served as director general of police of Puducherry, Mizoram and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. In Delhi Police, he was the chief of intelligence, Economic Offences Wing and the anti-terror unit, Special Cell, at the rank of special commissioner. His resume also boasts of a masters in economics from Delhi School of Economics and LLB from Delhi University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/women-safety-street-domination-top-new-police-chiefs-seven-point-agenda/articleshow/84001412.cms||Raj Shekhar

But there will be no compromise on vaccination even if a certain section population is found to possess Covid-19 antibodies,” he said. “The government’s focus is to attain 70% vaccination at the earliest nd the state has the capacity to vaccinate 10 lakh people a day. The Centre needs to provide us with the necessary number of vaccines,” Tope said. The Mumbai civic body recently conducted a sero-survey of children aged between six and 18 years. The survey revealed that nearly 51% of children have developed antibodies against Covid-19. It found that sero-positivity was highest (53.4%) among children aged 10 to 14 years. Tope said sero-surveys would be carried out in adult population for certain clusters as per the state task force’s advisory.The Pimpri Chinchwad civic body had rolled out a sero-survey covering 21 clusters in 32 wards. State task force member Dr Shashank Joshi told TOI that aggressive sero-surveys should be carried out in different socio economic strata. In the wake of the emergence of the Delta-plus variant of Covid, he said the districts should ensure that positivity rate was below 5% for more than 2-4 weeks and conduct aggressive sero-surveys and genome sequencing of the exposed tested population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tope-pledges-need-based-sero-surveys-in-key-regions/articleshow/84001332.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The accused was involved in 14 offences, including robbery and rape. He was captured at an eatery in Amarpura village in Saraswati taluka of Patan district. The accused had a pistol with him. The video of the filmy arrest has gone viral. Kishor Luhar, the wanted man, and three others were apprehended in the operation. In the video, five to seven cops are seen trying to get some space to sit at the eatery. Then they suddenly move towards Luhar and surround him. Later, the cops are seen recovering a pistol from the accused and forcing him down to the floor. When the accused is still lying face down, the cops check the three others who were with him. The cops then kick Luhar to make him stand up. At that time, one of the cops is seen pushing a pistol into Luhar’s belly. According to the CCTV footage, the arrest was made on June 27 evening. A crime branch statement said that Luhar, 29, a resident of Deesa town in Banaskantha, was involved in seven offences in Ahmedabad city, five in Banaskantha district, and two in Sirohi and Jhalor districts of Rajasthan. Apart from the pistol, cops found one magazine and five live cartridges from Luhar who was in 2019 slapped with PASA (Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act) charges. Luhar’s aide Naresh is on the run.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/crime-branch-action-heroes-quell-villain/articleshow/84001405.cms||---

And what’s more, the collection has been rotting there for several months now, raising a stink on the authorities’ apathy towards these areas. The area is outside the Vadodara city limits and hence there is no system of garbage disposal. Till Waghodiya, several units of prominent industrial houses exist along with the Parul University and Sumandeep Vidyapith campuses. From employees and workers of the units to their top bosses, students, teachers and important visitors — all use the road. “The situation is really bad. In monsoon, this garbage bags thrown on a stretch of about 100 metres will start raising a stink. I have been raising the issue with various officials and functionaries since the last few days. There is no action yet,” said Jasmine Devalia, an employee of a prominent unit in the area. While Devalia may have taken the onus of raising the issue, he is not the only one who finds the sight an eyesore. A prominent functionary of an industrial body in the area said that he had also noticed the garbage since about a year. “There may not be any system of garbage disposal in the area,” he said, requesting anonymity. It is, however, surprising that no one has taken up the issue actively so far. Devalia said that the area on the either side of the stretch of the road where garbage was strewn fell in different village panchayats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/garbage-welcomes-visitors-to-education-industrial-hub/articleshow/83997310.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||Pune||Mathematical models cannot predict extent of Delta-plus spread: Expert||PUNE: There's still not enough data on the Delta-plus variant for mathematical models to make any prediction about its spread or its involvement in a third wave in the country, virologist Dr Shahid Jameel has said. Dr Jameel is director of the Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University and former head of the advisory group of Indian SARS-COV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG) — the group of labs tracking the coronavirus' variants in India. Many states are using mathematical models to estimate the size of the next Covid surge. But Dr Jameel said a third wave would depend on factors such as levels of Covid-appropriate behaviour in populations, vaccine coverage of susceptible groups and a more transmissible variant, if that’s confirmed. “It remains to be seen if a third wave will happen or if we’ll have separate outbreaks in different states and regions that peak at different times. This is because enough data is not available on Delta-plus for models to predict anything,” he told TOI in an email interview. As for future surges, Jameel said a critical period would be the October-November festival season “when there are big congregations”. “By that time, antibody levels would have waned a bit and the second wave would be a distant memory,” he said. States are also planning to increase genome sequencing to catch variants. But Dr Jameel said such surveillance should be deployed strategically. “It is not a diagnostic test,” he said. He, however, agreed that there should be an increase in the density of genomic sequencing to address epidemiological questions. As for vaccine efficacy against Delta-plus, Dr Jameel said, “We can’t say much about Delta-plus as there are too few cases to make any judgement. Results for the Delta variant are that the available vaccines protect well from severe disease and hospitalisation, but not as well from symptomatic infection. While two doses are better, even one dose protects reasonably well from severe disease.” While Delta-plus is currently a Variant of Concern, Dr Jameel said there is no way to predict how future variants will respond to vaccines. “Based on the experience so far, I would think that we may not need new vaccines. However, should booster shots be needed, we should be prepared to ramp up capacity at short notice,” he said. The expert said that in healthcare staff, who face high exposure, studies have shown that about 10% experience breakthrough infections, more after one dose than after two doses. He said breakthrough infections largely lead to mild to moderate disease. This means the current vaccines, mainly designed to prevent serious Covid and death, are working, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mathematical-models-cannot-predict-extent-of-delta-plus-spread-expert/articleshow/84001342.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: New fire NOC rule hits high-rise projects under NMRDA||NAGPUR: The state fire safety director will henceforth issue no objection certificates (NOCs) for high-rise buildings and special 500sqm structures under the Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority (NMRDA). In a recent order, the state government has divested the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s fire department of the power to issue provisional NOCs to projects under NMRDA. The new unified development plan control rule (UDCPR), which came into force from December 2020, bars the NMC’s fire department from issuing provisional NOC or permanent fire compliance to any high-rise project outside the city limits. “The move has delayed most projects under NMRDA’s jurisdiction,” said developers Vinod Kubde, who has submitted his objections to the state government’s decision. Rules stipulate that unless a developer gets a provisional fire NOC, one cannot submit the building plan to the NMRDA for sanction. With no fire stations under NMRDA jurisdiction, state fire director Santosh Warik has been authorized to issue provisional fire NOC and subsequent compliance certificates to all high-rise projects as per UDPCR. Developers and builders who have taken up projects claimed that since the new rule came into force, their projects have hit a roadblock. Now, they have to travel to Mumbai to seek a provisional NOC from the state fire director’s office. It is not a one-day work and many times, the top official is not available in the office, builders claimed and added that travelling during the pandemic always poses a health risk. Builders said the UDCPR was published on December 2, 2020, but the city chief fire officer continued to issue provisional fire NOC from December 2, 2020, to May 5, 2021. And now suddenly, the CFO’s office has stopped the service citing UDCPR. Chief fire officer Rajendra Uchake admitted that the NMC’s fire and emergency services department has stopped issuing such provisional NOCs. A delegation of Credai Nagpur also met NMRDA commissioner Manojkumar Suryawanshi and municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B in this regard. NMRDA chief has written to the civic chief urging him to continue with the work of issuing provisional NOCs to big projects until August 31. The civic chief, on his part, has approached the office of state fire director to resolve the issue. Warik said builders are not required to travel to Mumbai in the near future as there is plan to process the application for fire NOC online. Already, the urban development department is preparing software to grant building plan approval and provisional fire NOC simultaneously. “It will be operational within a fortnight,” Warik told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/new-fire-noc-rule-hits-high-rise-projects-under-nmrda/articleshow/83994408.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Hete said, “The story of her perseverance and struggle was brought forward by a media portal and when my associate Varsha Jahagirdar showed it to me, I wanted to do something for the child.” On receiving the money, Kumari said, “I bought a phone for Rs 14,000 and have started attending classes. I want to study hard and achieve great heights of success.” Her mother Padmini Devi said, “When she shared the idea of selling mangoes to earn and save money for a smartphone, I was not convinced and did not give her the permission but my daughter was so determined that she eventually convinced me and started selling mangoes.” Kumari’s sister Deepika said, “Even in the wildest of dreams nobody would think a desire would get fulfilled so early.” Deepika (13), who too had to quit studies, is learning to operate the phone from her younger sister. Kumari’s father Vimal Kumar said a financial crunch due to the lockdown barred him from buying his daughters what they needed. Vimal is without a job since March. Now, with Hete donating the money, he is planning to get both his daughters back to the same school. “We visited the school and met the authorities and requested for admission and they assured to admit the girls,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/after-industrialist-buys-12-mangoes-for-rs-rs-1-2l-to-help-jsr-girl-kin-trying-to-admit-her-in-school/articleshow/83999859.cms||B Sridhar
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Now, uniforms not compulsory for online classes||RANCHI: The state education department has decided to do away with the compulsory uniform rule during the online classes it conducted for government school students. The students will also be not sent back if they come to their schools without uniforms to collect dry ration or depositing fees. The move comes in the wake of problems faced by the students as garment shops were shut and their parents were facing financial problems because of the Covid-induced lockdowns. Currently, the department is carrying out online classes through various apps like YouTube. The attendance of students in these classes is, however, low. Speaking on the issue, the director of the Jharkhand Project Education Council, Shailesh Chaurasia, said, “Though we encourage school dress for students, there is no compulsion. Our basic aim is that a maximum number of students should participate in the online classes.” Online classroom coordinator Kumari Deepa of the Ranchi district school said, “The students are asked to join the classrooms with their study material, including books, copy books and pens. They are expected to appear tidy but there is no admonishment if they are not in school uniform.” She informed that due to various issues, including poor connectivity and lack of gadgets, the participation of students in online classes has been reduced to 10% or 15%. A senior official of the school said with cloth shops shut for months due to the restrictions, students would have faced problems getting new school uniforms if they were compulsory. The principal of Bariyatu Government Girls’ High School, Rita Kumari, said although the dress code is not enforced, students appear for the online classes in tidy clothes. She pointed out that it is difficult to monitor each student as most of them put their devices in mute mode. The students unmute the devices only when they have to ask questions or give answers. It may be stated here that the state government provides one set of uniforms to all students from Class I to VIII while girl students get it till Class XII. Many parents also said their children have outgrown their uniforms after more than a year of lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/now-uniforms-not-compulsory-for-online-classes/articleshow/83999834.cms||---

Minister of state for Narmada and urban housing Yogesh Patel raised the issue in the cabinet meeting. On Wednesday evening, the Covid core committee too extended the deadline for vaccination of commercial establishment owners till July 10. Patel said that he was approached by many who complained that they were unable to take a vaccine yet and will have to close their businesses. Patel said that in wake of such representations, he had discussed the issue in the cabinet. “A large number of people in the city are not vaccinated yet. It would not be justified to take the step at this stage when people are in the process of taking their vaccines,” Patel said. Patel pointed out that such steps could be taken when a majority of the population was vaccinated and only some remained. He added that he had also discussed the issue with the Vadodara police commissioner and he had assured that no action will be taken regarding this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/minister-opposes-compulsory-vaccination-for-workers/articleshow/83998812.cms||---
---||Jamshedpur||Jharkhand: Now, uniforms not compulsory for online classes||RANCHI: The state education department has decided to do away with the compulsory uniform rule during the online classes it conducted for government school students. The students will also be not sent back if they come to their schools without uniforms to collect dry ration or depositing fees. The move comes in the wake of problems faced by the students as garment shops were shut and their parents were facing financial problems because of the Covid-induced lockdowns. Currently, the department is carrying out online classes through various apps like YouTube. The attendance of students in these classes is, however, low. Speaking on the issue, the director of the Jharkhand Project Education Council, Shailesh Chaurasia, said, “Though we encourage school dress for students, there is no compulsion. Our basic aim is that a maximum number of students should participate in the online classes.” Online classroom coordinator Kumari Deepa of the Ranchi district school said, “The students are asked to join the classrooms with their study material, including books, copy books and pens. They are expected to appear tidy but there is no admonishment if they are not in school uniform.” She informed that due to various issues, including poor connectivity and lack of gadgets, the participation of students in online classes has been reduced to 10% or 15%. A senior official of the school said with cloth shops shut for months due to the restrictions, students would have faced problems getting new school uniforms if they were compulsory. The principal of Bariyatu Government Girls’ High School, Rita Kumari, said although the dress code is not enforced, students appear for the online classes in tidy clothes. She pointed out that it is difficult to monitor each student as most of them put their devices in mute mode. The students unmute the devices only when they have to ask questions or give answers. It may be stated here that the state government provides one set of uniforms to all students from Class I to VIII while girl students get it till Class XII. Many parents also said their children have outgrown their uniforms after more than a year of lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/now-uniforms-not-compulsory-for-online-classes/articleshow/84011821.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The people are expected to donate their extra gadgets to create a bank for distribution to needy students for their online studies. The bank is a brainchild of state DGP Niraj Sinha who said he decided to start it after he was moved by the suicide of a 19-year-old bright student of mathematics honours at Lady Sri Ram College, Delhi, at her home in Telangana for the want of a laptop to continue her studies during the lockdown and the selling of mangoes by a 12-year-old Jamshedpur girl on the roadside to buy a smartphone. Sinha circulated his idea within the police department and called for the creation of a gadget bank at the police station levels. Personnel of the department and common citizens are now expected to donate their extra smart gadgets. The top cop said the idea is to collect second-hand smartphones and laptops which are in running condition but often discarded by users for updated versions or a better brand. The gadgets will be distributed among deserving and needy students. Talking to TOI, Sinha said he was deeply moved by the suicide of the Telangana girl in November last year just because she was unable to attend online classes as she doesn’t have a laptop. “There is a digital divide in the country and if we are unable to bridge this gap, the frustration among those willing to study but do not have the gadget can manifest in various forms, sometimes detrimental to society,” he said. “The gap between the rich and the poor sometimes increases crimes as well,” he said. The create the bank, Sinha circulated a letter within the department, seeking the cooperation of all SPs to see if the idea of creating a gadget bank at the level of police stations is viable. “I don’t want the effort to be riddled in controversy so a definite a clear-cut mechanism must be adopted for which I have also broadly discussed the modalities,” he said. Sinha said since the reach of police is maximum, the department can take up the responsibility of collecting the gadgets but in due course, they might require the support of the school education and literacy department for identification of potential beneficiaries. Discussing the modalities, the DGP in his letter has said that he is open to suggestions from all ranks and files. “A station diary entry should be made against a laptop or a smartphone received from any individual and he or she would be issued a certificate saying that for any unauthorized use of the submitted gadget, the owner would no longer be responsible,” Sinha said in the letter, explaining that this would reduce the hesitancy and liability of ownership for those willing to donate. On the other hand, the SPs have been instructed to take an undertaking from the recipients of these gadgets that they would not use them for any anti-social activity and would be held responsible if the IEMI number of smartphones or the serial number of laptops is found in crimes. To develop the formats, arranging a station diary dedicated to the purpose and training the police personnel are likely to take around a fortnight. “Though the letter has been circulated, I expect the drive to begin by July 15 so that the police stations are ready to accept the donations with proper formalities,” Sinha added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jharkhand-police-to-set-up-smart-gadget-bank-across-stations-for-needy-school-children/articleshow/83999793.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Goa||Goa: Expert panel to have more say in Covid-19 management||PANAJI: While all major decisions during the first and second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic were taken by the government, an expert committee comprising doctors from the government and private sectors will henceforth have more say in decisions related to its management. “The expert committee will continue to function and advise state authorities from time to time about the appropriate course of action to be adopted to combat the Covid-19 pandemic effectively,” advocate general Devidas Pangam told the high court on Tuesday as the court disposed of several pandemic-related petitions. Pangam also assured the court that in most cases, recommendations by the committee are accepted by the government as these come from the expert body constituted by state government itself. Although there was an expert committee in place during the first wave of the pandemic too, its suggestions were rarely taken into consideration by the government. The state executive committee, comprising bureaucrats, mostly decided the course of action then. “One of the members of the old committee was invited to be part of the second expert committee as well, but he declined considering his previous experience. He thought it was a waste of time as the government would snub the suggestions offered,” a member of the new expert committee said on condition of anonymity. However, the government has now begun taking the panel’s suggestions seriously, the member said, specially after the pandemic wreaked havoc in the state during April and May this year. “Most of the suggestions made by the second expert committee have been accepted so far,” the member added. The state also has a task force, headed by chief minister Pramod Sawant, in place. Both the expert committee and the task force were constituted after predictions that a third Covid-19 wave was likely to hit the country. Both work in tandem too, as an expert committee generally submits its suggestions to the task force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/expert-panel-to-have-more-say-in-covid-19-management/articleshow/84001517.cms||---

Students in rural Goa are being left with a serious disadvantage that will have a long reaching impact on their development, employability and their future, convenor Rahul Mhambre said. The party blamed the state BJP government for jeopardising the education of Goan children and its failure to build up Goa’s infrastructure. “It seems like BJP wants to turn the clock back decades to the time when education was only accessible with resources and in cities,” AAP’s Goa vice president, Surel Tilve said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/provide-net-at-community-centre-aap/articleshow/84001575.cms||---
---||Goa||Till date, Goa has not detected any Delta-plus variant, says GMC dean||PANAJI: Goa Medical College (GMC) dean, Dr S M Bandekar said that the new variant of Covid-19, delta-plus, has not been detected in Goa so far even as samples are regularly sent for testing to a Pune laboratory. “As of now, nobody knows how it will behave, and though it seems to be highly infectious, its severity is not known yet,” Bandekar said. “Till such time that we get our genome sequencing machine functional, we will be sending samples for testing to Pune. A lot of factors are involved in setting up of a genome sequencing machine while the project is under process,” Bandekar said replying to a query about when genome sequencing will commence at the GMC. Most of the results received so far have shown the presence of the Delta variant in Goa while results of some reports are awaited. The delta-plus variant has been detected in Maharashtra. Currently, checking is done at Goa borders. “What more can be done? It is not possible to undertake genome sequencing of all samples drawn,” he said, when asked how Goa could be protected from the latest variant. He said that if the vaccine has proven effective for delta variants it should also be effective on the Delta-plus one. “All must take the vaccine as it has been proven during the second wave that people who took the vaccine did not suffer from the severity of the infection,” he said. People’s fear of the vaccine, he said, is not scientific, and thosewith doubts should consult a doctor. “In India itself more than six crore people have taken the vaccine.” He said that the expert committee as well as the state task force committee has already started preparation in view of the possible third wave. “Pandemic is a war-like situation. Most of the things are in place, but if new problems crop up, the solution will have to be found immediately,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/till-date-goa-has-not-detected-any-delta-plus-variant-says-gmc-dean/articleshow/84001460.cms||---
---||Goa||Obesity ups risk of hospitalisation and death in Covid patients: Doctors||PANAJI: Although diabetes and hypertension were found to be the most common comorbidities in victims of Covid-19, many of those who died were also obese. Doctors said that while obesity as a comorbidity in Covid-19 patients hasn’t got due attention, it does raise the risk of hospitalisation and death. “Obesity is linked to impaired immune function. It decreases lung capacity and can make ventilation more difficult,” said chest specialist, Dr Anil Mehndiratta. People having the condition are also likely to develop other diseases like diabetes, heart disease and kidney disease. Contracting Covid-19 further complicates the situation. “The diaphragm is the strongest muscle in the body. In obese people, its functioning is compromised. When such people are afflicted with Covid-19 pneumonia, they will require more oxygen to maintain their oxygen saturation,” said Dr Uday Kakodkar, associate professor of GMC’s department of pulmonary medicine, and administrative in-charge of the superspecialty block. He said that during the ongoing second wave of the pandemic, the number of patients with obesity was larger in the 45-60 years age group as against the 61-70 years category. Mehndiratta said obese people are also susceptible to developing sleep apnea, a condition in which oxygen saturation level drops during sleep and which may have not been detected and treated previously. “They will require more effort in breathing, and so will need extra oxygen and ventilation. Naturally, their chances of survival diminish,” he said. The study of cases, he said, suggests that risks of hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation and death are higher with increasing body mass index (BMI). “The increased risk for hospitalisation or death was particularly pronounced in those under the age of 65,” Mehndiratta said. Besides, the management of an obese patient on a ventilator support is difficult as compared to someone who does not have the condition. “For instance, moving a heavy patient is difficult for an attendant. There are always practical difficulties involved in management of obese Covid-19 patients,” Kakodkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/obesity-ups-risk-of-hospitalisation-and-death-in-covid-patients-docs/articleshow/84001718.cms||Bindiya Chari

At the monthly meeting held on Wednesday, the members unanimously passed a congratulatory motion in that regard. In view of the Covid-19 pandemic situation, all the cards issued under the scheme have been auto renewed. “It’s a welcome move by the government as people have been saved the trouble of visiting the DDSSY Kendra during the pandemic for renewal of their cards. The South Goa zilla panchayat has placed on record its appreciation for the same,” South Goa zilla panchayat president Suvarna Tendulkar told reporters after the meeting. Replying to a query, Tendulkar said that with the government now appointing a full-time chief executive officer (CEO) for the South Goa zilla panchayat, payment of dues of contractors, which were delayed, will be cleared soon. “Besides the accounts officer, most of the engineers too are holding additional charge, which leads to a delay in clearing bills raised by contractors. As we now have a full-time CEO, the bills will be cleared soon,” she said. Tendulkar further said that tenders for development works in all ZP constituencies will be issued next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/move-to-auto-renew-ddssy-welcome/articleshow/84001856.cms||---

However, this could not be confirmed. The speculation is due to the peculiar situation arising from the fact that the CM is not a member of the state assembly. He is currently a Lok Sabha MP from Pauri Garhwal, and needs to win an assembly seat by September 10 to be able to continue as chief minister. Read AlsoUttarakhand to have another CM before polls?

However, assembly elections are expected to be held early next year, and former Congress minister Nav Prabhat recently cited provisions of the Representation of People Act to say that a bypoll cannot be held if elections are scheduled within a year. Nav Prabhat claimed that this would leave BJP no choice but to change the state’s CM again before the assembly polls.Rawat was in Ramnagar till Tuesday to attend the party’s ‘Chintan Shivir’, a three-day brainstorming session for the upcoming assembly polls, and had just returned to Dehradun when he got the call. He cancelled his appointments for the day and left for the national capital. Asked about the Delhi visit, Rawat said, “Since we had a three-day brainstorming session in Ramnagar, I am going to discuss the conclusions at length with the party’s senior members.” Queried on the bypoll debate, the CM said, "The party leadership will take a call on that”.

He added, “I am waiting for the Election Commission to announce its decision on the matter.

Such visits by party leaders are frequent but some people are trying to exaggerate it unnecessarily,” he said. On the bypoll impasse, Uniyal said, “The responsibility of a government is to inform the Election Commission about any vacant constituency and thereafter the EC takes a call on the issue. We have duly informed the EC.” At present, two assembly seats – Gangotri and Haldwani — are lying vacant in the state. Gangotri seat fell vacant on April 22 after the death of BJP legislator Gopal Rawat while Congress MLA from Haldwani Indira Hridayesh passed away on June 13.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-abuzz-as-bjp-brass-summons-tirath-singh-rawat-to-delhi/articleshow/84006575.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Goa||Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry calls for supportive policies to revive pvt sector||PANAJI: The aftershocks of the Covid pandemic will be felt for a long time, new Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) president Ralph De Souza said. There is a need for supportive industrial policies and a pro-active government to help revive private sector growth and employment, he said. Souza, along with outgoing president Manoj Caculo, said that the government needs to study and implement the economic revival committee’s recommendations. The GCCI said that it would continue to provide the state government with inputs to bring the state’s economy back on track. “A conducive policy and a responsive administrative framework will have to be set-up to attract fresh investments which would help in creation of good employment opportunities and revenue generation in the state,” Souza told GCCI’s 113th AGM. In his address, Souza was candid about his conviction that hard times still lay ahead and that the effects of the pandemic would be long lasting. Caculo concurred and said that when he took over in June 2020, he had expected the pandemic to subside, but it had only worsened to become one of the worst health emergencies in the history of mankind. Caculo said that members of the state government’s economic revival committee had presented a detailed report to the government on kickstarting industry revival. “However, more than a year later, there is hardly any progress by the government on implementing the committee’s suggestions,” he said. The outgoing president spoke of the industry’s opposition, apprehension and disappointment about the amendments in the Industrial Disputes Act, Goa Factory Rules and charging of all taxes and fees in full by the municipalities and panchayats during such a major crisis. Goa’s three major industry associations have raised objections over the state’s decision to rush through an amendment to the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, saying that it will have a severe and adverse impact on Goa’s industrial sector. The GCCI had also asked the CCP and other municipalities to reduce the annual fees and taxes collected from traders and establishments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gcci-calls-for-supportive-policies-to-revive-pvt-sector/articleshow/84002010.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Goa: Hospicio’s counsellors trained to handle grief from Covid deaths||PANAJI: The pandemic has created an unseen set of victims, those who have been left mentally and emotionally traumatised following the sudden loss of a dear one. Dealing with these people requires counsellors to get special training, and Hospicio Hospital, after seeing the large number of lives claimed during the second wave, has equipped its counsellors at their crisis intervention centre — OPD 23 — to meet the challenge. The mental health workers have been taught practical skills to show understanding and to communicate while maintaining social distance and with masks on, besides the main training of handling unresolved grief due to lack of closure. “A lot of physical expression cannot be communicated to those in grief because only the counsellors’ eyes are exposed. They are being trained to express empathy with their eyes and various hand gestures — holding their own hand to signify a hug, using a thumbs up sign to express feelings of empathy,” psychotherapist and officiating principal Carmel College, Dr Aldina Braganza, said. OPD 23, initially started as a one-stop centre for victims of domestic and sexual violence. It later turned into a crisis intervention centre. And now it is supporting those who lost their loved ones to Covid. The pandemic has robbed many of the grieving rituals that are essential to acceptance of the death and eventual healing, she said. Burials and cremations have taken on a different routine, with the dead being put in bags to ensure that the infection does not spread. Besides, in many cases, family — the core support system — are many times unable to be there. “All this affects human mourning,” Braganza said. Some children who have lost a parent to Covid are turning silent, she has found. “They see their other parent crying and grieving and they have to take control of the situation. We don’t know how they will react next,” she said. They are reminded to take care of themselves and others left behind, by eating and sleeping right. People who are struggling to cope after having lost a loved one during the pandemic can walk into Hospicio Hospital’s OPD 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hospicios-counsellors-trained-to-handle-grief-from-covid-deaths/articleshow/84002141.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Sawant said there is a need to “generate news with facts and figures to convey a strong message that this government is working in the interest of the state and its people”, while addressing PROs, HODs and OSDs to cabinet ministers at a workshop organised by the department of information and publicity. The moves comes following the criticism of the government from various quarters on several fronts in recent times ahead of elections in early 2022. “This endeavour will help substantially to highlight the achievements and initiatives of the government and develop its positive image in next six months in right perspective,” Sawant said. The chief minister told the PROs to ensure prompt publication of any clarification to counter criticism against the government. “Don’t publish it after eight days,” he said. Sawant said that apart from print media, the government departments should make “maximum use” of All India Radio and Doordarshan which, he pointed out, had a good number of listenership/viewership. Press Information Bureau (PIB) deputy director (M&C) Vinod Kumar D V, who was the keynote speaker, told the PROs to keep themselves abreast of new realities of information age and to make maximum use of all modes of communication, digital and print. The CM’s additional private secretary Gaurish Kalangutkar spoke on how to use social media to project the good works done by the government with the objective of developing a positive image in the eyes of the public. Department of information and publicity (DIP), director, Dipak Bandekar said that his department has constituted a dedicated team of officers to coordinate with the PROs/HODs to obtain prompt information from them.

However, this time around, with the pandemic, the increasing number of visitors thronging the site, this despite official notification that it is closed to the public due to the pandemic, has irked the villagers of Tudal. Interestingly, police visit the site and even chase away the visitors, who return once the cops go away, a local, Joy Velip said. Gaondongrim sarpanch Suman Gaonkar told TOI that when tourists flock the site, she informs police, the forest department and other authorities concerned. She said that while officials do their duty, it is the visitors who need to feel a sense of responsibility and refrain from visiting the waterfall in the midst of a pandemic to control the spread of the virus. Further, she said that she would meet the Canacona range forest officer and explore the possibilities of restricting entry of visitors. An elderly local, Babu Velip, said that it is over the last 10 years that the waterfall has gained immense popularity. However, he laments that many of the visitors indulge in unruly behaviour at the site such as recklessly discarding their garbage and consuming alcohol and breaking bottles. Some visitors, in an inebriated state, get into fights, disturbing the peace and tranquillity of the site. He said that the panchayat, on orders from the authorities concerned, has put up boards in the vicinity of the waterfall mentioning the ban of alcohol, but the visitors often ignore this. In its edition dated June 30, TOI had reported about how in Bicholim’s Latambarcem village locals had blocked the path leading to the Kalaskond waterfall due to the nuisance being caused by visitors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/virus-fears-increase-in-tudal-as-visitors-flock-to-waterfalls/articleshow/84002459.cms||Albert Fernandes

Rainfall up to 19% below the long-period average (LPA) is considered normal. As per the IMD data, though Punjab, Haryana, HP and Chandigarh received normal rainfall in June, the progress of monsoons has been sluggish. As per the IMD data, Punjab received 49.9 mm rainfall (-1% below normal), Haryana had 49.5 mm (4% above normal), HP had 84.6 mm (-16% below normal) and Chandigarh got 119.4 mm (-8% below normal) in June. The southwest monsoon had reached HP and parts of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh on June 13. After good showers for about three-four days in the region, the advance of monsoons stalled. In its forecast issued on Wednesday evening, IMD stated prevailing meteorological conditions, large-scale atmospheric features and the forecast wind pattern by dynamical models suggest that no favourable conditions are likely to develop for further advance of southwest monsoon into remaining parts of Rajasthan, west Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Punjab during the next six-seven days. It also warned that heat wave conditions may prevail in isolated pockets over Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh on Thursday. BOX Erratic monsoons Punjab and Haryana, both key paddy-growing states of India, have faced several erratic monsoons in the past decade (2011-2020). Rainfall was deficient during monsoon (more than 20% to 59% below the normal precipitation in the June-September period) in Punjab in 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. In the same period, monsoon failed six times (2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019) in Haryana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/despite-sluggish-monsoons-rainfall-normal-during-june-in-region/articleshow/84002544.cms||---

Like Tuesday, Najafgarh was Delhi's hottest spot at 44.4°C. Track the pollution level in your cityHeatwave conditions are likely to continue in isolated parts of the city on Thursday. The lack of rainfall along with hot winds blowing from Rajasthan led to the severe weather condition, IMD's Kuldeep Srivastava said. There may be respite on Friday in the form of a duststorm or thunderstorm. Winds from Rajasthan: Air in poor zoneMet officials said winds from Rajasthan gusting at 50 km/hr have pushed Delhi’s air quality into the ‘poor’ category, with an overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of 206 on Wednesday as compared with Tuesday’s reading of 195 (moderate).

The average monthly temperature remained below the normal temperature, according to IndiaSrivastava, also the head of the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre (RWFC) in Delhi, said though heatwave conditions are expected to prevail across the region even on Thursday, the intensity will be lower. "We will not see a severe heatwave like Wednesday, but the mercury will still be above normal." Thursday’s maximum temperature may drop to around 41°C and may further fall to 39°C the next day due to a likely thunderstorm activity.

Speaking to the media after his arrival in the city on Thursday , the former chief minister said the saffron party would disclose its plans on the day Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government declares its candidate for the prestigious post. It became vacant after Sakoli MLA Nana Patole resigned to take over reins of Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president. The Southwest Nagpur MLA also denied he his being posted to Delhi to take up an important responsibility at the national-level. “Such rumours are often doing the rounds, but there’s not an iota of truth in it. In our party, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is our top leader and we all follow his guidelines. Anyone having good knowledge of BJP and Maharashtra politics must know that there’s no possibility of me moving out anywhere. Many of my well-wishers wanted that to happen, but I want to tell them that I will remain very much active in state politics,” he said. On rejection of the Central government’s review petition in the Supreme Court on continuing Maratha reservation, Fadnavis said justice Bhonsale committee had already stated that such cases had limitations and very little scope for survival. “This panel had clearly defined the terms of reference for the backward commission to remove discrepancies in the old records earlier submitted to the apex court. It was appointed by the MVA government, which is now playing delaying tactics. The panel also had members like former advocate general Darius Khambata along with a host of legal luminaries, but the government is simply sitting on its recommendations,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-to-reveal-plan-after-mva-declares-candidate-for-speakers-post-fadnavis/articleshow/84048302.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

While her 77-year-old mother Kanta Ambalal Patel passed away at 3.30 am, Dr Shilpa, an associate professor with anatomy department donned her PPE suit within six hours, staying true to her mother’s words – duty before everything else! Like her, several doctors in hospitals of Vadodara were back in the saddle trying to save other lives even as they had themselves lost their parents or near and dear ones to coronavirus. “Based on rotation, my Covid duty was supposed to begin at 9 am that day. But my mom departed before that,” recalls Dr Shilpa, adding that just a couple of hours before she passed away, her mother had insisted that she should stop worrying about her and concentrate on her duty. “My parents always taught me to work with dedication. And that motivated me to keep working even during those trying times,” said the doctor, who along with her brother had carried their mother’s body wrapped as per Covid protocol in an ambulance and cremated her before returning to the hospital to join duty. Dr Rahul Parmar, who was serving as nodal officer for Covid management and part of dead body disposal team at Central Gujarat’s biggest hospital too had rushed back to join duty after finishing cremation rituals of his 67-year-old mother Kanta Parmar. His mother had passed away in Gandhinagar due to age-related issues. Dr Parmar, who is with the preventive and social medicine department resumed duty the very next day. At Parul Sevashram Hospital, medical administrator Dr Krupa Vaghela continued serving Covid-19 patients despite her personal loss.

Wednesday saw 45,951 cases and 734 deaths as the second wave continued to go on a downward slope. There is a mixed pattern at the global level. While both India and the US continued to report a decrease in cases, there seems to be a surge in Colombia, Brazil, Russia and the UK. At present, there are six countries where the latest available data on daily cases has exceeded the 20,000 mark. This includes India, Colombia, Brazil, Indonesia, Russia and the UK. Kerala was the only state that saw over 10,000 cases on Wednesday.

---||Chandigarh||Rape, murder tarnished kisan image: Khattar||Chandigarh/Bathinda: Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said on Wednesday that a rape and murder on the farmers’ agitation site had tarnished the image of ‘kisan’, and then he hinted at a possible strong action to reclaim the national highway toll plazas from the protesters. Interacting with the media at the launch of an integrated app in Chandigarh, the CM said: "The word kisan has a sanctity and even I have respect for it. But it lost this sanctity after rape and murder. The way these farmers confront the local villagers after blocking their roads, the kind of language they use for the government, and the way they resort to the undemocratic ways of protest, I condemn it all." Khattar said all the appeals were lost on the farmers. He said: "Seven months are gone telling them the benefits of these three laws and asking them to give in writing what is wrong in those, yet they are stuck on scrapping the laws. If it could be done, it would have been done by now." Reacting to that, the Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) stated in Bathinda that the Haryana CM’s remarks—that the protest had tarnished the word kisan, that the dignity of women was being taken away, that murders were happening and roads being blocked—were "BJP’s attempt to denigrate the movement and defame the farmers". The SKM claimed to have inputs that the Centre might bring a bill in the coming parliamentary session from July 19 to convert Delhi’s air pollution ordinance into a central law, "which will have a sly provision for penalising farmers for straw burning despite assurances given in late December 2020 that there will be no fines". A joint team of the SKM and the All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee met Maharashtra chief minister to press for an assembly resolution in the state legislature session starting July 5 to repeal the three central laws and guarantee MSP by a statute. The team also met the deputy CM and a few other ministers for consultation-based amendments to the Maharashtra APMC Act. The Morcha accused the BJP of trying to provoke the Ghazipur border protesters by getting close to their stage on the pretext of welcoming party member Amit Valmik and calling them anti-national in the slogans. It claimed injuries to five farmers in the clash and said the reports of weapons being found and vehicles being damaged were "diversionary tactics".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rape-murder-tarnished-kisan-image-khattar/articleshow/84002713.cms||---

The applicants must visit the electricity department’s web portal, https://acreplacementscheme.uhbvn.org.in. There is a provision for extra subsidy to the rural consumers. The urban subsidy under the scheme is Rs 2,000, and and Rs 4,000 is the exchange rate of the old AC. The rural subsidy is Rs 4,000, while the exchange rate is Rs 8,000. The new sets will save the consumers 657 more power units a year than the old 3-star ACs. It amounts to a cost saving of Rs 5,000. The warranty is up to 10 years on the compressor and one year on the other parts. The installation will be by the authorised dealer. Additional chief secretary (power) P K Das said: “This is the country’s first AC scheme started by a power distribution corporation to reduce domestic energy consumption and maximum load. It will save the state 68 MU of energy and reduce power demand by 75.6 megawatts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/discounted-acs-for-hry-up-to-aug-24/articleshow/84002762.cms||---

According to officials, IPSCDL has decided to hand over the St Inez desiltation project to the Water Resources Department while funding will come from the Smart Cities Mission. IPSCDL also approved the construction of a pedestrian bridge linking central library to Mary Immaculate school over Mala Creek. “Most of the approved projects were beautification projects for the city,” said a source. “WRD has been asked to use amphibious de-weeding machines to clear up the creek.” The St Inez Creek, which winds its way through the capital city, has suffered due to decades of neglect, indiscriminate release of waste water and dumping of solid waste. After several attempts by other agencies to clean up the creek, the St. Inez Creek rejuvenation project was handed over to IPSCDL. The board also gave the go ahead to Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation to complete the cycling track along the Mandovi promenade from Youth Hostel to Children’s Park at Campal. The 1.5 kilometre-long cycling track and footpath was being constructed by Krishna Builders and was being executed by GSIDC but was left incomplete in 2017. At the earlier board meeting held on June 8, the smart city board had requested GSIDC to see if the project could be restarted and completed. Proposals for construction of a mini-market at Ribandar along with a football ground, rejuvenation of the existing crematorium at Ribandar are also in the pipeline, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/st-inez-creek-de-silting-project-now-with-wrd/articleshow/84002896.cms||---

According to Dhanda, an advocate and member of state bar council of Punjab and Haryana, he has a serious threat to his life from Bains. He has claimed tha Bains has been threatening him through a key aide because he had been supporting a woman who accused Bains of raping her. Justice Lisa Gill has issued the notice to Punjab government and Ludhiana police, asking authorities to respond to the issue by July 19. In his plea, Dhanda, who has also served as chairman of state bar council and is a general secretary of the SAD at present, has informed the court that a woman had filed a complaint with the commissioner of police against Bains, alleging that the MLA exploited her situation and raped her. Bains is the founder of LIP. Dhanda claimed that he had been openly supporting the rape victim in demanding justice for her and had been expressing his views in press conference as well as on social media to highlight her plight and to impress upon the administration to provide her justice. In this course, the petitioner has been meeting the commissioner of police and the deputy commissioner of police of Ludhiana, he said. Dhanda claimed that as per some reliable information, an attempt will be made to harm him physically. The court was informed that Dhanda had filed a complaint against Bains and two of his aides, after which a court in Ludhiana summoned the two aides, but dismissed his plea against Bains. He said he filed a revision petition against the order dated April 28, 2021, passed by the chief judicial magistrate of Ludhiana. Dhanda’s counsel submitted that the petitioner was getting constant threats from “gunda” (anti-social) elements belonging to LIP. He said they had been openly declaring that they will take revenge from the petitioner and will harm him physically. Dhanda informed the the court that a request was also made to Ludhiana police for security. Dhanda prayed before the high court to provide him security cover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-notice-to-punjab-after-sad-ex-mla-alleges-threat-to-life-from-aides-of-lip-mla/articleshow/84002802.cms||---
---||Amritsar||Pink bollworm infests cotton crop in Bathinda, Mansa||BATHINDA: The cotton crop in nearly 24 villages in Bathinda and Mansa districts of Punjab has been infected with a pest called pink bollworm for the second consecutive year. Bathinda and Mansa are the two biggest cotton-producing districts of Punjab. Though the attack is on a small scale and has only affected the crop in the vegetative stage, the pest infestation is being seen as a cause of concern for the agriculture department. BT cotton is resistant to American Bollworm, but it is said to be prone to pink bollworm as has been seen in Maharashtra, Gujarat and now in Punjab. The pest is learnt to have developed from ‘vareve’ (cotton seed), which is left after harvesting the crop, and ‘chattian’ (cotton sticks) in the area, where a couple of cotton ginning factories are situated. Last year too, pink bollworm had infested crop in the area of a ginning factory. Agriculture experts say as the crop is in the vegetative stage, when it is only a month old, it could be contained without much loss. However, an attack during boll formation and flowering stage could cause a big loss. At present, the economic threshold level (ETL) of pink bollworm infestation is learnt to be found within permissible limits. ETL is pest density at which control measures should be applied to prevent increasing pest population from reaching economic injury level. Permissible limit is six adults per leaf. In Bathinda district, the pest has affected the crop in Gurusar Senewala, Kotshamir and nearby villages in Sangat block, and a couple of villages each in Bathinda and Talwandi Sabo blocks. In Mansa, the affected villages include Bhamme Khurd, Burj, Jodkian, Tandia, Birewala, Bajewala, Mojia, Uddat, Jattan Kalan, Fatta Maloka, and Alike. Farmer Balwant Singh of Gurusar Senewala said the pest has attacked the crop in many fields. "We told the agriculture department about the presence of pests on the plants, but department officials arrived after two days. When we had seen the attack last year as well, the department should have been vigilant enough and should have been surveyed the fields. Even now, corrective measures need to be taken to prevent its spread to other areas," he said. Punjab agriculture department director Sukhdev Singh and Bathinda chief agriculture officer Bahadur Singh said their teams had visited affected villages, met farmers and suggested remedial measures. "Yellow traps have been put in the fields and appropriate spray has been suggested. A cleaning operation has been undertaken at the ginning factory close to fields," they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/pink-bollworm-infests-cotton-crop-in-bathinda-mansa-for-2nd-year-in-row/articleshow/84002885.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Chennai||Vaccine shortage leads to flash protests across Tamil Nadu||CHENNAI: People across the state went on flash protests and made angry calls to state helpline 104 on Wednesday morning as notice boards in many government vaccines centres across state said, “no vaccines”. By noon, officials from the state immunisation wing got the nod from the Union health ministry to pick up 2.5 lakh doses from the Centre’s warehouse -- Government Medical Store Depot in Periamet. Yet, many central, western and southern districts did not receive stock until late evening. By 8pm, the state vaccinated 83,141 people. Health minister Ma Subramanian said the fresh stocks they received will last for just another day. “We know vaccines are the only effective tool we have against the anticipated third wave. We are trying to vaccinate as many people as possible,” he said. In Madurai, from 3am several people queued up outside the Elango Corporation Boys Higher Secondary School, a vaccination centre attached to Government Rajaji Hospital. When health officials put up notices saying vaccines were not available, people raised slogans demanding vaccines. Health officials in the district closed several centres as they had just 3,320 doses. Meanwhile, the Greater Chennai Corporation announced on its webpage that the vaccination drive will be paused until further stocks arrive. By noon, health officials reached the Periamet lab to pick up stock. “We have dispatched these doses to districts but the vaccination in many districts will resume only by Thursday,” Subramanian told reporters. He also urged people to stop street protests. For June, the state was allotted 42 lakh doses, but the Centre gave an additional 5 lakh doses. The addition of 2.5 lakh doses on Wednesday took the June tally to nearly 50 lakh doses. For July, the Union health ministry has been allotted 71.5 lakh doses. Of this, 17.75 lakh doses has been set aside for private hospitals. This means the state will have just 53 lakh doses – about three lakh more than in June – and shortage is likely to continue. Later, Subramanian flagged off the “mega Covid Vaccination drive” launched by Apollo Hospitals Group in Chennai. The hospital said it will launch vaccination drives from 200 centres across India. TN will receive 36,610 doses of Covaxin by 9am on Thursday, said DPH Dr TS Selvavinayagam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/vaccine-shortage-leads-to-flash-protests-across-tamil-nadu/articleshow/84006694.cms||---

The owners said they are in a deep financial crisis and moving towards bankruptcy as they have not been getting any rental income for the last seven-eight months because all Reliance retail outlets have been forcibly closed by the agitating farmers, who have put their tents outside various stores. Reliance has around 275 stores in Punjab, all of which are shut. Officer on special duty to CM Sandeep Singh Brar, who interacted with the building owners, ensured all possible support to them and promised to take it up with the CM. “We are bearing huge losses as buildings are on loans from banks and we have to bear the burden of huge EMIs, municipal taxes, electricity and water charges etc. Moreover, the livelihood of lakhs of workers, employees and their families has also been adversely affected. Farmer leaders warn us of severe consequences if we open the stores. We have even approached district police and other local authorities but in vain. As per the agreements with the company, no rental payment can be made in case there is no billing or the store is closed due to agitation,” said Prabhnoor Singh Walia from Kapurthala. “We are all Punjabis and fully support the farmers, but such forced closure of Reliance’s stores is only harming Punjab as Reliance procures a lot of products locally, provides huge direct and indirect employment to Punjabis and pays huge taxes to the state,” said Dharampal Singh Nain from Jagraon. “We have borrowed loans and invested all our hard-earned money in the properties, but such forced closure is ruining us. Their stores are open in all other states. But in Punjab, Farmers are not allowed to open even those stores which are under essential services, so we are here to request the CM for help”, said Nirmal Singh from Jalandhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/reliance-outlet-owners-seek-cms-help-to-open-shop/articleshow/84002953.cms||---

But a unique pilot project initiated for Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS) ensured that the enrolled tribal students never fell out of the academic ecosystem. In many villages of Chandrapur district, teachers rolled into villages in a special car christened ‘School On Wheels’ and brought the classroom right at the doorstep of students. Under the aegis of state tribal development department (TDD), this pilot project was launched in Devada (Chandrapur district) during July last year. EMRS Devada principal Rupa Borekar said, “The pilot project addresses both, learning and psycho-social needs of 600+ students in extremely remote areas in radii of 50 to 300 km.” Two teams of staff including the teachers, principal, wardens and non-teaching staff were formed, who then planned visits for six days of the week to designated villages using hired vans. Borekar said, “The vans were equipped with a Covid-19 safety kit, teaching learning material, worksheets, activity sheets, stock of nutritive food items etc. Our teams visited villages in green zones and conducted various activities for about 6 hours every day.” These activities consisted of awareness sessions regarding the pandemic, curriculum aligned multi-grade teaching, and co-curricular activities with group of 10 to 15 students ensuring safety compliance. Apart from academics, EMRS teachers also taught children about personal hygiene, specifically focussed on preventing Covid-19 infections. In some villages that were nearer to urban centres, there were parents who had access to smartphones, which was a blessing for EMRS teachers. “Our teachers formed WhatsApp groups with such parents and were able to keep in touch regarding studies and future visits to the villages. This teacher-parent-student bond strengthened into a community bond, which helped us ensure that all stakeholders were involved equally in the process,” said Borekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-chanda-a-school-which-drives-right-to-tribal-homes/articleshow/84000766.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Hyderabad||Darbhanga blast: NIA arrests two LeT operatives from Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: Six days after registering a case in connection with the parcel bomb blast at Darbhanga railway station, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday arrested two Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militants from Hyderabad and carried out searches at their rented house. NIA sleuths arrested prime accused Imran Malik and his elder brother Md Nasir Malik, both hailing from Kairana town in Shamli district of Uttar Pradesh after sustained interrogation for the past few days. On Wednesday evening, the NIA team took the brothers to their rented house in Mallepally and reportedly seized incriminating material from their premises even as the local police threw a tight security ring. According to sources, Nasir Malik, who runs a garment business, has been operating from Hyderabad for over two decades now. Mohd Nasir Khan had got training in making IEDs in PakIrfan joined his brother this year. They rented a house on the first floor of a building in Mallepally area near Bharat grounds. “Preliminary investigation and examination of the accused has revealed a trans-national conspiracy hatched by top operatives of LeT to execute terror acts across India and cause largescale damage to life and property,” the NIA media communique said. Acting under the directions of Pakistan-based handlers of LeT, Md Nasir Malik and Imran Malik prepared an incendiary IED and packed it in a parcel of clothes. The parcel was dispatched in an express train from Secunderabad railway station to Darbhanga. “This was aimed at triggering an explosion and fire on a running passenger train to cause huge loss of lives and property,” a senior NIA official said. Mohd Nasir Khan had visited Pakistan in 2012 and received training from LeT in making IEDs with locally available chemicals. Nasir and Imran were in contact with Pakistan-based LeT handlers through encrypted communication platforms, the NIA official said. For the past few months, Iqbal was training Imran online to prepare explosives by using nitric acid, sulphuric acid and sugar. “The trend of preparing explosives by procuring easily available chemicals in the market is a serious concern. We are trying to cull out more information about the terror cells,” said an intelligence official. On June 15, Imran Malik prepared an IED using a 50ml medicine bottle and concealed it in a parcel of women’s ready-made garments. “The accused had set an approximate time of 16 hours to trigger the blast. Since the explosive liquid leaked from the bottle into the wrapped newspapers and clothes, the intensity of the explosion got minimized,” said a police source. The parcel was booked from Secunderabad railway station using a forged PAN card in the name of Md Sufiyaan on June 15 and the blast occurred on platform number 1 of Darbhanga railway station on June 17 when the parcel was unloaded. Luckily there were no casualties. Two other suspects Haji Saleem and Khafeel were already taken into custody by the Uttar Pradesh ATS last week and handed over to the NIA. The NIA team from Delhi will be shifting the accused to Patna and produce them before the NIA court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/darbhanga-blast-nia-arrests-two-let-operatives-from-hyderabad/articleshow/84006741.cms||---

Delta variant, the double mutant identified as B1.617.2, was first detected in January this year by Neeri-CCMB genome sequencing study in Nagpur region. This variant had been behind the acceleration of cases in the menacing second wave. The detection of Delta Plus (B1.617.2/AY.1) variant in 12 states had forced revision in movement control norms last week and also necessitated Neeri-CCMB study on these 8 samples. In a press statement, district collector Ravindra Thakare said the study has ruled out Delta Plus presence in the samples of all the eight patients from Umred. “All the eight patients are from the second wave,” the note read. It was also found that the eight family members had travel history after they tested positive, it said. Soon after testing positive, they were shifted to Umred Covid Care Centre (CCC) where two more family members were admitted on Monday as they too tested Covid positive. Genome sequencing of these two samples is yet to be done. The district authorities were yet to take a call on the discharge of the 10 patients from Umred CCC while their health parameters were said to be fine. The genome sequencing was performed on saline gargle RT-PCR samples, the results were yielded in record 8 days by Neeri-CCMB. Usually, it has taken months and in some cases a year to provide results from other labs due to slow pace. The district administration thanked National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) environment virology cell led by Dr Krishna Khairnar for the study done in record time and free of cost in public interest. The rapid spread of Delta variant among the Umred family members is concerning given that the second wave is on the decline in the district and state. While RT-PCR samples are yielding less than 50 Covid positive results in entire district for the last some days, 10 members of a family getting infected within a short span in Umred was baffling. In its advisory to local health department, the report states it is possible continuation of the second wave at unexposed pockets of the district. “The cases are sporadic re-emergence of Delta variant,” an official said. On the relevance of such spike, infectious disease specialist Dr Ashwini Tayde said the entire family testing positive has been the peculiar trait of Delta variant and this was widespread during the second wave from March to mid-May. “Those pockets which have remained sterile due to isolation or yet to develop herd immunity or having low vaccinated population may see such sporadic spike even as cases decline elsewhere in the region,” she said. Physician and critical care specialist Dr Kamal Bhutada advised citizens to avoid travel, but in case it is necessary then they need to isolate. “At least 5-day isolation is must if one has travelled in high risk zone. As we may not know the status of each area, it is best to maintain a distance from co-morbid members or elderly in the family,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/neeri-ccmb-study-finds-delta-variant-in-8-umred-samples/articleshow/84000866.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

This deprived city cops and administration of access to the footage from 3,700 cameras across the city. City police and civic administration were left puzzled after the private operator decided to disconnect the CCTV servers in the city, making it highly vulnerable from security point of view. A senior official from Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited confirmed that the firm engaged in operating the surveillance system has stopped video system of the Command and Control Centre over outstanding payments. “Just video was on, system was off. Our access to video footage was stalled but surveillance system across the city is on,” the official claimed. Cameras installed at important squares, roads, WiFi service etc were all working and even the recording was going on. The official claimed that payments to the private firm are being done from MahaIT office in Mumbai. Sources in the police department said a senior citizen was robbed by a chain snatcher in central Nagpur but cops were left clueless about the robbery. “Citizens have been left exposed to the threat of street crimes and cops have little clue to trace perpetrators,” said a cop. Even traffic cops were left in a tight spot as they could not get any backup from the command and control system. CP Amitesh Kumar said the matter is being sorted out at the government level. “We have requested the vendor not to take such a drastic decision unilaterally, which may jeopardize the city’s security,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/citys-vital-installations-exposed-to-threat-as-cctvs-stopped-functioning/articleshow/84001086.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: CBI team begins formal probe||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The team from Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probing the controversial Isro espionage case began the formal investigation into the case in the capital. On Wednesday, the team recorded the statements of former Isro scientist Nambi Narayanan. The team that visited Nambi Narayanan’s residence spent more than two hours, recording the details of his statements before the DK Jain committee, based on which the Supreme Court had asked the agency to register a case and investigate. It is learnt that the CBI team would issue notices to the accused in the FIR in the coming days. The CBI team from the special crimes unit in Delhi had reached the capital on Monday and is camping at the CBI office in Muttathara. As many as 18 former police officials, including those who served in Kerala police and intelligence bureau during the Isro espionage case, were named as accused in the FIR submitted by CBI in the chief judicial magistrate court here in connection with the case. CBI had cited offences, including conspiracy, physical torture and forging false documents to trap central government officials. The Supreme Court had on April 15 this year ordered the CBI to look into the justice D K Jain committee report on the role of some of the senior state police officers, who had framed Narayanan in the espionage case. Narayanan too had taken up the matter seeking action against erring officers at the Supreme Court by filing a civil writ petition. Former IPS officers, including Siby Mathews, Mathew John, RB Sreekumar are among those who have been named by the CBI in its FIR submitted in the court of the chief judicial magistrate here. Mathews is the fourth accused in the case as per the FIR. Mathews was the DIG (crimes) when the case occurred. Meanwhile, Mathews along with other accused PS Jayaprakash, S Vijayan and Thampi S Durgadatt have sought anticipatory bail. They have submitted in court that they are ready to cooperate with CBI’s investigation but their arrest should be stopped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-cbi-team-begins-formal-probe/articleshow/84006763.cms||---

The Hyderabad based vaccine-maker has, however, denied any wrongdoing and said it has followed a common, widely accepted and established vaccine procurement process that includes an advance payment. “Since the first meetings with the ministry of health (MOH) Brazil during November 2020 until June 29, 2021, a step-by-step approach has been followed towards contracts and regulatory approvals, during this nearly 8-month long process,” Bharat Biotech said in a statement. “During the past few weeks, there have been reports in the media at large misrepresenting the procurement process of Covaxin in Brazil and other countries,” it added.Brazil’s MOH, in its order issued on June 29, said the General Comptroller of the Union (CGU) did not find any irregularities in the preliminary analysis and the CGU minister said the suspension was a preventive measure, according to a translated version of the statement on MOH website. Slamming allegations that its partner Precisa Medicamentos asked the Brazil MOH to make an advance payment to a third party – Singapore-based Madison Biotech Pte Ltd – Bharat Biotech said the company was set up by its founder CMD Dr Krishna Ella in 2020 for “the purpose of external R&D and sales and marketing of vaccines”. “We wish to dispel any notion or implication of any wrongdoing whatsoever, as all these are affiliate companies founded or acquired and operated by Dr Krishna Ella,” Bharat Biotech said. The company also said that after receiving the emergency use authorisation (EUA) from Brazilian authorities on June 4, it has not received any advance payments nor supplied any vaccines to MOH as of June 29. Elaborating on the procurement process, the company said once it receives a letter of intent (or MOU) for procurement, it applies for EUA in that country. Post the EUA, the MOH of that country places an order by releasing a purchase order. “In order to secure a firm purchase order from the country, the company proceeds to raise a proforma invoice to the MOH, towards the supply of vaccine. Based on the invoice, the MOH pays the amount in advance. Once the payment is received, the company proceeds to supply the agreed quantities and within the agreed timelines,” it explained. “In several countries, MOHs have placed orders for procurement prior to the approval of vaccines such as USA, EU, India, etc. However, procurement happens only post EUA,” it pointed out. On the procurement price, which has been the subject of investigation in Brazil, Bharat Biotech said Covaxin pricing has been clearly established between $15-20 per dose for supplies to governments outside India. “The pricing for Brazil has also been indicated at $15 per dose. Bharat Biotech has received advance payments from several other countries at the above price points, with supplies in process, pending approvals,” it said. Covaxin has received EUA in 16 countries and EUAs are under process in 50 countries worldwide with discussions also underway with the World Health Organisation (WHO) for emergency use listing, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/row-in-brazil-over-covaxin-deal-bharat-bio-says-no-wrongdoing/articleshow/84006795.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Head of legislative public accounts committee and former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar held online meeting with collector, health officials, Chandrapur mayor, ZP president and other people’s representatives to take stock of the preparedness of the administration to deal with the third wave. During the meeting, collector Ajay Gulhane said the administration has estimated the number of Covid patients to be 20,000, of which around 9,000 are likely to be accommodated in Covid Care Centres (CCCs). The district will require 2,500 oxygen beds, 850 ICU beds and 425 ventilator beds to treat the admitted patients, he said. The collector said presently 4,000 patients can stay at the CCCs and there are 1,300 oxygen beds available in the district. There are 105 ventilator beds out of which 94 ventilators are functional. The administration has sent proposals seeking 50 ventilators from divisional commissioner and 80 from medical education department. Of these, 24 ventilators have arrived but these are yet to be activated. Mungantiwar said that dean of Chandrapur GMCH should send proposals for rest of the ventilators and follow it up. Gulhane said there is requirement of 57 metric tonne liquid oxygen, out of which 56.34 MT is available. Soon 200 beds will be available in Jumbo Care Centre, 200 in Somayya Polytechnic and 475 in rural hospitals, said the collector. Detailing mucormycosis situation in the district, Gulhane said total 107 mucor patients have been found so far. While 66 have recovered and discharged, 36 are under treatment, he said, adding five patients have succumbed to mucormycosis so far. He also informed that bed monitoring system will be used this time. District has ample stock of medicines and all necessary preparations for tackling the third wave will be completed by August 15, he added. Mungantiwar sought details of the beneficiaries of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule scheme and asked the collector to bring more hospitals under its ambit. He directed ZP president and district health officer to prepare a white paper on condition of 65 public health centres in the district. District health officer told that district doesn’t have permission to recruit medial officers on contract basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/chanda-admin-projects-20k-patients-in-3rd-wave/articleshow/84001253.cms||Mazhar Ali

Under this project, a manufacturing unit has been installed at the premises to produce biodegradable, low-cost sanitary pads. The unit will be operated by partially sighted and blind persons from Atmadeepam Society. Tiwari lauded the NLC women — Area 3 chairperson Farheen Rana, NLC chairperson Sakshi Diwanka, vice chairperson Esha Bindra and secretary Megha Agrawal — for their efforts. Underlining various schemes for disabled people introduced by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), Tiwari said, “It’s important for citizens in the sector of social work for disabled persons to know about the projects that have been undertaken by the civic body.” “A portal was launched recently for disabled persons to register and avail the benefits of various schemes designed for them,” said Tiwari. He urged people to create awareness among those in need so that they can be provided assistance. Atmadeepam Society Jidnyasa Chawaldhal emphasized on the need to solicit public funding for the project so that the sanitary pads reach underprivileged students and also for organizing menstrual hygiene awareness camps. Tiwari assured his support towards this cause. Secretary Hema Kubde said, “When girls don’t have access to sanitary napkins, they are forced to miss school for 5 days every month. It is an impediment to their right to education. Like water and nutritious food, sanitary pads should also be provided free of cost to such students through public funding. These pads are biodegradable and support the larger cause of an eco-friendly environment.” She added that Atmadeepam Society aims to empower people with visual impairment and help them lead an independent life by imparting life skills, training them in various computer courses, etc. Bharti Sable and Snehal Wankhede will be managing the sanitary napkin manufacturing unit. They will provide hands-on training to blind persons for operating the machine.  Ladies Circle International president Sweden Viveca Raim and international service project convenor Rohini Christopher among others were present at the programme virtually. NLC thanked tabler Rohit Agrawal for his support. Corporator Varsha Thakre was also present at the inauguration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/project-crimson-to-produce-low-cost-santiary-pads/articleshow/84001211.cms||---

West Bengal Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (WBTIDC) floated a tender for the same on June 11. The prerequisites include a minimum five-year experience in operating a fixed-wing, twin-engine aircraft with a minimum capacity of 8-10 passengers. The aircraft must be air-conditioned and a pressurised, super mid-size flying machine such as the Falcon-2000 with stand-up cabin space. It must also be capable of flying any distance within India. According to transport department officials, the chief minister and senior officials often travel to north Bengal or Delhi at short notice. In the long run, a leased plane is cost-effective and many states have such aircraft at their disposal. While the minimum utilisation time for the aircraft to be procured will be 75 hours a month, the main route shall be Kolkata-Bagdogra-Cooch Behar-Kolkata. However, officials said the plane would also cater to the Kolkata-Andal-Kolkata route when not in use by officials. “We will save a substantial amount of money in the long run,” a transport official said. The operator — apart from holding a proper NSOP licence in its own name — shall also ensure that the operations are conducted in a professional manner by deploying requisite staff who will undertake the process of check-in and ground handling of flights at each location. In the event of the deployed fixed-wing aircraft being grounded or not being serviceable for more than 72 hours, a replacement shall be provided by the operator at no additional cost to the government. Many states have exclusive aircraft for their CMs and senior bureaucrats. The erstwhile Akhilesh Yadav government in UP had acquired a plane and a helicopter, besides five aircraft already in its fleet at the time. Gujarat bought a new aircraft for its CM to replace an old one, a nine-seater Beechcraft Super King Air 200. Bengal’s plan drew a caustic remark from leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari. But, state transport minister Firhad Hakim reminded that Adhikari himself had forwarded the file during his tenure as transport minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-to-lease-fixed-wing-plane-for-urgent-govt-work/articleshow/84001387.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

This is game-changing technology with applications spanning various industries such as utility (electricity, water, gas), asset tracking that is location tracking for transportation of goods, digital healthcare applications and many more," said Prof Kiran Kuchi, professor in the electrical department, IIT-H who has been spearheading the national 5G research and standards development effort. NB-IoT to enable smart metersNB-IoT is set to enable smart meters, machine-to-machine connectivity, a plethora of sensor connectivity among others. “Commercialisation is being done by WiSig Networks, a 5G start-up that is incubated at IIT-H. Commercial launch of the chipset is expected within a year,” said Kuchi. The chip supports 3GPP Rel-13/14 compliant NB-IoT modem with integrated baseband and radio, an application processor and GPS functionality for location tracking. It was developed as part of the indigenous 5G testbed project funded by the department of telecommunications. Officials said that the technology being used for 5G is homegrown, both on the hardware and software. “Koala NB IoT fulfils the objective of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ and has wide-ranging 5G applications. I am also happy that Cyient has been a partner in this development,” said Prof B S Murty, director, IIT-H.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/internet-of-things-gets-5g-push-with-iit-hyderabads-cellular-chipset/articleshow/84006803.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal will need 47 lakh shots to meet July second-dose target||KOLKATA: Bengal will require 47 lakh doses of vaccine to cover just its eligible second-dose recipients — at an average of 1.5 lakh jabs each day — in July, according to the health department sources. This is seven lakh more vaccine shots that the state received in June. Most of the 47 lakh vaccine recipients took Covishield, the rest Covaxin. If the state wants to continue vaccination for those in the 45-plus age group who haven’t yet received the first dose, as well as priority groups in the 18-plus group, the minimum requirement in July will shoot up to nearly 1 crore doses. If private vaccination centres provide 14% of the jabs (like they have on average in the last few months), the state will still need at least 86 lakh doses to meet the second-dose obligation. “There is an indication that we will get around 70 lakh doses in July. While that will cover the second-dose requirement, the quantum needs to be hiked to continue the momentum of the vaccination drive,” a health department official said. The vaccine crunch was not felt till the third week of June as the second dose of Covishield was suspended in mid-May, when the gap between the two doses was increased to 12-16 weeks. But with the second-dose window opening up from June 23, the demand has shot up. On Wednesday, Bengal received a supply of 4,54,570 doses of vaccine in two consignments. Of this, 50,000 doses were of Covaxin and the rest Covishield. “Our target is to cover 7 crore people during this inoculation drive, for which we need 14 crore doses. So far, we have administered 2.2 crore doses. Currently, we are administering around 3 lakh doses a day whereas we are capable of providing up to 8 lakh doses a day, provided there is adequate supply. Hopefully, the supply will increase in July,” said a Swasthya Bhavan official. The demand-supply gap in vaccines has forced the health department to scale down supply to government vaccination centres, leading to long queues and many returning without receiving their jab. At the Beliaghata ID Hospital, the number of people who turned up for vaccines on Wednesday was twice the number of vaccines that the hospital had to offer. Those who left disappointed have been asked to return on Thursday. “We were occupying the fourth place in the drive in the country initially. And, with the kind of strong immunisation system we have, there is no reason why we cannot perform better if we get the required supply on time,” said community medicine specialist Sanjib Bandyopadhaya, vaccination supervisor at ID Hospital. Most centres attached with government hospitals are now inoculating much less than capacity. This, they said, was because supply to them from the district vaccine store had been cut by nearly half. “Currently, we are administering only 400 doses a day. We can easily scale it up to 800 if there is enough vaccine,” said Medical College Hospital deputy superintendent Amit Hazra, who is also the vaccination coordinator at the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-will-need-47l-shots-to-meet-july-2nd-dose-target/articleshow/84003916.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Contai co-op bank plaints will be probed: Didi||Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said the Bengal finance department would probe complaints of “benami accounts” and “ghost transactions” at Contai cooperative bank. Similar complaints had been received from cooperative banks in Tamluk and Midnapore, she added. Leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari helms the Contai cooperative bank since 2009; he also chairs two other cooperative banks. The CM said: “The state is well within its rights to investigate complaints of wrongdoing in these banks. There are complaints of benami accounts and ghost transactions. Pending investigations, nothing can be said. But it needs to be probed since these are public money.” She added: “Whenever there are complaints, a petition is filed in court to stay probe. Why? Parde ke piche kya hai (what is being hidden)?” Auditing these benami accounts was the state’s responsibility, she further said. “The probe will be done,” she said. According to state minister and East Midnapore’s Trinamool leader Akhil Giri, it also needed to be established how Adhikari continues as the Contai cooperative bank chairperson for over three terms whereas cooperative laws bar this. Several complaints have been made to the state cooperative department against the banks. When Suvendu defected to the BJP after he quit all state positions, he didn’t quit the bank posts, alleges Giri, and instead moved court to continue. “If he has so much to say against the government why is he holding on to these chairs,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/contai-co-op-bank-plaints-will-be-probed-didi/articleshow/84001506.cms||---

The CBI plea was made on the grounds the CM and the law minister had led a dharna at the probe agency’s office and “mobocracy” had vitiated court proceedings on May 17, the day CBI arrested four senior leaders accused in Narada case. On Wednesday, a five-judge bench of the HC allowed the applications subject to payment of Rs 5,000 by each applicant. The bench also granted 10 days to CBI to file its reply in opposition. The court will hear the case again on July 15. The applicants made the prayer on the directions of the Supreme Court, which annulled the five-judge bench order of June 9. The HC bench had refused to take on record their affidavits, saying the three wanted to file affidavits after waiting for arguments to be completed. The CM in her reply-affidavit denied the CBI allegations on the events that followed the arrest of Subrata Mukherjee, Firhad Hakim, Madan Mitra and Sovan Chatterjee on which the agency built its “mobocracy” argument.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hc-allows-cm-law-minister-pleas-to-hear-case-on-july-15/articleshow/84001587.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

A five-judge bench had directed NHRC to set up a panel and examine all complaints lying with the commission and West Bengal Legal Services Authority, and submit its report to the court. The seven-member NHRC panel submitted its brief report to the court in a sealed cover on Wednesday. NHRC counsel Subir Sanyal told the larger bench that the report filed was only a part-report and sought more time for the panel to reach out to affected places before coming up with a comprehensive report. “We have opened the report. We feel it appropriate to go through the report along with annexures before we pass any order,” acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal said.

---||Kolkata||Guv writes to Bengal Speaker against complaint of ‘interference’||Kolkata: The West Bengal governor has opened yet another front, this time with the assembly Speaker, two days ahead of his address to the House on July 2. On Wednesday, governor Jagdeep Dhankhar in a letter to Speaker Biman Banerjee refuted the latter’s complaint in a virtual meeting the Lok Sabha Speaker had held with speakers of legislative assemblies a week ago, saying that the governor was “trying to interfere in the administration of the West Bengal assembly”. Dhankhar also took exception to Banerjee venting his angst on a national forum. “Such optics damages the institution we need to nurture…” the governor said in the letter. Dhankhar also expressed shock over earlier incidents — assembly gate closed during his notified visit, Speaker being absent that day, and “blacking out live media coverage” of the governor’s address to the assembly. He also rebutted Banerjee’s claim that three pieces of legislation were lying with Raj Bhavan. “No Bill, save one, is pending consideration at my end,” the governor said. Dhankhar clarified that the President of India had withheld consent to the Dunlop India (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertaking) Bill, 2016, though it was forwarded by the former. Dhankhar stated he had sought clarifications from the department concerned after leader of opposition and Left Front legislature party pointed to “procedural lapses” in framing of the West Bengal (Prevention of Lynching) Bill, 2019. “The response was not only delayed but evasive…” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/guv-writes-to-bengal-speaker-against-complaint-of-interference/articleshow/84002206.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||BJP fanning violence news to defame Bengal: CM||Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee lambasted BJP leaders for harping on post-poll violence in Bengal and claimed it was being organized from the office of the Union home minister. She said BJP was trying to defame the state in every possible way, unable to digest the defeat in Bengal polls. Banerjee also criticized the Yogi Adityanath government as she said bodies from UP were reaching Manikchak in Malda. “The bodies were floated in the river in UP and some were voraciously eaten by crocodiles and fish. Seven bodies floated to Bengal, officially,” she said and added that nobody questioned the UP government. Fake and distorted news were an attempt to divert focus from the atrocities in UP or Bihar or Gujarat, she continued. “BJP decked up the videos and decorated things and has hatched this conspiracy. They are jealous and though defeated, they cannot accept the people’s mandate. Bengal is doing well,” Banerjee said. The CM referred to the trouble that broke out at Jadavpur, where National Minority Commission vice-chairman Atif Rasheed was reportedly assaulted on Tuesday. “What happened in Jadavpur is that the central force had beaten up some women and after that, the women got agitated,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-fanning-violence-news-to-defame-bengal-cm/articleshow/84001923.cms||---
---||Business||FCI, agri start-ups join hands for quick test grain quality at mandis||NEW DELHI: Two Indian agri start-ups have joined hands with the state-owned Food Corporation of India (FCI) to develop handy testing equipment that can be deployed at mandis for quality testing of grains. Two pilots have been carried out at four mandis in Punjab and Haryana during the current procurement, sources said. Currently, the quality of grain brought by farmers to the mandis is tested against the standards fixed by following the method prescribed by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). But except testing of moisture contents in the grain, all other parameters are tested using manual analysis. Officials said this is a time-consuming process and has certain levels of subjectivity. “Therefore attempts are being made to bring in technology-based quality assessment. This will be quick and transparent as well without any human intervention,” said an official. About the outcome of the pilot, a food ministry official said, “It is a work in progress. The start-ups are trying to get all quality refractions measured through machines instead of human analysis. The AI based software is able to identify the refractions but hasn’t reached acceptable levels of accuracy so far. Based on the experience, they are working on improvements in the equipment for further testing during the coming paddy procurement season.” Till last week, the FCI and other government agencies procured 853.9 lakh tonnes of paddy, which is equivalent to 573.6 lakh tonnes of rice, and 432.8 lakh tonnes of wheat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/fci-agri-start-ups-join-hands-for-quick-test-grain-quality-at-mandis/articleshow/84006801.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Kolkata||HC seeks report from Bengal on Suvendu security||Kolkata: Calcutta High Court has directed the state government to submit by Thursday a comprehensive report on the withdrawal of Suvendu Adhikari’s security. Hearing the petition filed by the leader of the opposition on Wednesday, Justice Shivakant Prasad asked the government to include in the report who all in the state enjoyed special security, why the state earlier granted Adhikari extra cover and on what ground was his security withdrawn. At the same time, the judge wanted to know from the petitioner’s counsel why Adhikari needed additional security when he was already enjoying Z-category cover. The BJP leader had on Monday prayed before the court for a directive to the state director of security on the matter. Justice Prasad observed: “He (Suvendu Adhikari) is a political leader. He is not a government servant. He is the leader of a strong opposition party. The state should take this into account. He has to move places to help out people. Why shouldn’t the state have any communication with him? The state has to submit (a report) by Thursday.” As a cabinet minister in the Mamata Banerjee government, Adhikari enjoyed Z+ security. After he resigned, he was given security meant for state VIPs. The Centre offered Adhikari Z-category security after he joined the BJP in January. Adhikari’s lawyer submitted in court that even though the leader enjoyed Z-category cover, he would still require the state government’s support in three areas — pilot car, route lining and monitoring of places where public meetings might be held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hc-seeks-report-from-bengal-on-suvendu-security/articleshow/84001806.cms||---
---||Business||Govt proposes norms to protect direct sellers & make direct selling entities accountable||NEW DELHI: Direct selling companies such as Amway, Oriflame, Tupperware and all other such entities in the domestic market would be barred from charging any entry or registration fee or the cost of equipment and materials for sales demonstration from their agents. The draft rules for direct selling notified by the consumer affairs ministry has described such agents as “direct sellers”. Earlier in 2016, the ministry had come out with a set of guidelines for the sector, which were advisory in nature. But now the proposed rules under the Consumer Protection Act will have legal backing and violation will attract penalties. As per the draft rules, every direct selling entity carrying out business in India will have to be registered with the industries department (DPIIT) and must have at least one office in India. The registration number has to be displayed prominently on its website and all invoices. They will be required to have dedicated executives to address grievances and to comply with the government directives. Such entities will also need to have a 24X7 customer care number to resolve their issues. The proposed rules specify that no direct selling entity will be allowed to promote “Pyramid Scheme” and participate in “Money Circulation Scheme” in the garb of direct selling business. Pyramid scheme is a business model that recruits members via a promise of payments or services for enrolling others into the scheme, instead of sale of products or services. The direct selling industry has been urging authorities not to treat them as "pyramid" schemes. It claims while direct selling businesses are registered with local regulatory bodies under existing laws, "pyramid schemes" are unregistered. The draft rules say that all firms operating across the country will have to comply with the norms within 90 days. According to the proposed rules, any direct selling entity can’t refuse to take back spurious goods or deficient services and will have to refund the consideration paid for goods and services provided. It also proposes that the agent or seller will have a “cooling off period” during which he/ she can change mind about an agreement made. This won’t result in a breach of contract and or levy of penalty. The draft rules also have a provision for a buy-back or repurchase policy for “currently marketable” goods which are not unpacked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-proposes-norms-to-protect-direct-sellers-make-direct-selling-entities-accountable/articleshow/84006821.cms||Dipak K Dash

His meeting with the Gandhis assumes significance as the party high command is working on a plan to resolve a crisis in its Punjab unit. The meetings are believed to have a bearing on Sidhu’s fate in the party. Though Sidhu had left for Delhi from Patiala on Tuesday, Rahul had told media persons that there was no meeting scheduled with the Amritsar East MLA that day. On Wednesday, Sidhu first met Priyanka in the morning and tweeted a picture with the caption: “Had a long meeting with @Priyanka-Gandhi ji.” The meeting reportedly went on for three hours. Later, he went to meet Rahul in the evening and the interaction lasted over an hour. Had a long meeting with @priyankagandhi Ji 🙏🏼 https://t.co/Wd4FYXFrhr— Navjot Singh Sidhu (@sherryontopp) 1625031507000Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh is likely to be called to meet the top leadership before a new role for Sidhu is announced soon, said party sources. So far, Amarinder has not met Rahul during the ongoing internal turmoil in the Punjab unit of party. Sources added if Sidhu was not keen on taking up the post of deputy chief minister, he could be made the Punjab Congress president. But for this, the party high command will have to convince chief minister Amarinder Singh, who publicly opposed the idea. An announcement regarding Sidhu is likely to be made in a day or two, said party sources. Earlier, party incharge for Punjab affairs Harish Rawat said Congress chief Sonia Gandhi will decide on a roadmap for Punjab Congress, including changes in the cabinet and organisational structure, by the first week of July. “Since he had such long meetings with the two leaders, he would have also shared his feedback on the ground realities in the state and how to brace for the next assembly elections,” said a party leader. Meanwhile, Sidhu was trending on Twitter – first as #Sidhu in the news category and later #NavjotSinghSidhu in the evening. Earlier, the three-member Kharge panel appointed by the party had recommended that Sidhu should be “suitably accommodated” ahead of the next assembly elections in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-amid-congress-crisis-navjot-singh-sidhu-meets-congress-leaders-priyanka-gandhi-rahul-gandhi/articleshow/84006830.cms||---
