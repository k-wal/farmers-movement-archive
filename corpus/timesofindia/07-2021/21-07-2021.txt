No injuries were reported on either side during the skirmish, since the projectiles largely fell in open areas. One rocket from Lebanon was intercepted by an Israeli missile defense system, known as Iron Dome, while a second fell without causing damage. The Lebanese army later said it had foiled an attempt by militants to fire a third rocket. No faction in Lebanon claimed responsibility for the rockets, but an Israeli military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said officials believed the rockets had been fired by Palestinian militants based in Lebanon. The incident underscored the fragility of the situation on the Israeli-Lebanese border, where there are regular tensions between the Israeli military and Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Shia militia that holds sway across much of southern Lebanon and does not recognize Israeli sovereignty. There are also occasional attacks by Lebanon-based Palestinian militants. Lebanon’s economic crash, and the social instability it has unleashed, has led some to fear that the security situation on its southern border may become even more unpredictable. In a speech Tuesday morning, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett of Israel said that Lebanon was “on the verge of collapse,” adding, “We will not accept a leakage of the situation in Lebanon into Israel.” Benny Gantz, Israel’s defense minister, had written earlier on Twitter that Israel “will not allow the social, political and economic crisis in Lebanon to turn into a security threat to Israel.” He called on the international community to take action to restore stability in Lebanon. The exchange was the first such skirmish since mid-May, when Palestinian militants in Lebanon fired several rockets into Israel in solidarity with militants in Gaza led by the Islamist group Hamas who were then in the middle of an 11-day air war with Israel. Hamas has not fired rockets or incendiary balloons into Israel from Gaza for several weeks, but the dynamic between Hamas and Israel remains volatile.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/israel-briefly-shells-southern-lebanon-after-militant-rocket-fire/articleshow/84595894.cms||---
---||World||UN experts alarmed by migrants' hunger strike in Brussels||BRUSSELS: Two United Nations representatives urged Belgian authorities Monday to offer temporary residence permits to several hundred migrants who are on a hunger strike in Brussels, some of whom with failing health. The migrants desperate to obtain legal residency papers began their hunger strike on May 23 at two universities and a church in the Belgian capital. Some said they have been living and working in the European nation of 11.5 million for a decade. In recent days, some of the migrants have also started refusing water. UN Special Rapporteurs Olivier De Schutter and Felipe Gonzalez wrote an open letter to Belgian Secretary of State for Asylum and Migration Sammy Mahdi asking for urgent measures. "The information we have received is alarming, and several of the hunger strikers are between life and death," said De Schutter, the UN's special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights. Gonzalez, the UN's special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, said the Belgian government should clearly rule out the possibility of deporting the migrants, given the state of their health. The government also "should consider issuing temporary residence permits allowing any person who introduces a request for stay regularization the right to exercise an economic activity," Gonzalez said. In his response to the letter, Mahdi said a collective solution should not be proposed and said he had suggested to the hunger strikers that they file individual residency requests. According to the rapporteurs, some 150,000 migrants live in Belgium without authorization. They said that people wanting to have their status legalized are deterred from doing so because they fear they will be deported if they apply. The hunger strike has ignited tensions in the coalition government led by Prime Minister Alexander De Croo. Last week, the Socialists and Greens called on the liberal De Croo to intervene in a bid to avoid "an imminent drama." According to Belgian media, Minister of Economy and Labour Pierre-Yves Dermagne went a step further on Monday, threatening that all socialist members of the government will resign if one of the migrants taking part in the strike dies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/un-experts-alarmed-by-migrants-hunger-strike-in-brussels/articleshow/84596256.cms||---
---||World||After horrific fair ride accident, Ohio beefs up inspections||Four years after a carnival ride's corroded steel arm snapped and flung a high school student to his death at the Ohio State Fair, the state is tightening its oversight of amusement rides.  Inspectors are conducting more mandatory checks for rust and metal fatigue and increasingly flagging rides for repairs during the first year of enforcement under the new regulations.  Some carnival operators say inspectors are overreaching and shutting rides over issues that aren't immediate safety concerns. A few have pulled out of Ohio's festival circuit or are considering it because of what they say is uncertainty over how the rules are being enforced.  The 2017 accident at Ohio's showcase fair that killed Tyler Jarrell, an 18-year-old Marine enlistee, and left four others with life-changing injuries sent shudders through the amusement industry.  The maker of the spinning, swinging Fire Ball ride said years of undetected excessive internal corrosion caused a carriage holding four riders to break apart just hours after a final inspection.  Attorneys for the victims believe the state's inspectors missed obvious warning signs and also blamed the ride's operator and maker, though no one was charged.  Ohio, like many other states, gives its ride inspectors immunity from negligence lawsuits. But settlements were reached with the ride's owner and two private inspection companies while another lawsuit against the manufacturer is still in court.  While the state has long had one of the nation's more robust ride inspection programs - nine states don't require any government scrutiny - Ohio lawmakers spent more than a year crafting a plan to increase oversight. Called "Tyler's Law," it requires more mandatory inspections for big attractions and makes owners maintain repair and travel records.  "We will have a history that comes with each ride, whether it be a kiddie ride or a roller coaster," said Dorothy Pelanda, director of Ohio's Agriculture Department, which oversees ride inspections.  The head of the state's amusement ride safety office, David Miran, said the law emphasizes checking a ride's structural components and that inspectors are told to err on the side of caution.  Carnival owners also must work with ride manufacturers or a certified engineer when repairs are needed and have them sign off on the work - a process that is more expensive and keeps rides out of commission longer, resulting in lost revenue, their operators say.  "It's out of the ride owners hands in that scenario, and it's up to the manufacturer who has the deep knowledge of what that ride is and what the ride needs," said Miran. "Having that other set of eyeballs is huge."  Because ride owners now are required to make visual inspections before going out on the road, many are making needed modifications before inspectors arrive, Miran said.  Ride owners say they're all for safety and don't mind added scrutiny, but some rides have been shut down for things they think don't compromise safety such as surface rust on handrails and on transport trailers.  Frank Welsh, a member of the Ohio Advisory Council on Amusement Ride Safety, a volunteer board, said some inspectors are probably being a little too picky to protect themselves from being fired or disciplined.  "Take an an older car - you get a little rust on the bumper and it doesn't mean the car's unsafe," he said. "It doesn't mean you need to have an engineer look at it."  Eric Bates, who has been in the portable ride business for five decades, said the new law doesn't address what caused the Fire Ball accident - internal corrosion that can only be spotted by ultrasonic testing that measures the steel's thickness.  "By the time we see external rust, it's too late," said the owner of Bates Brothers Amusement Co.  This year, five of his 18 carnival rides weren't allowed to start at the beginning of the season. A kiddie coaster had to be disassembled and repaired even though it had issues that he didn't think needed immediate attention.  Amusement operators say they especially can't afford to have their rides grounded for repairs that they don't believe are warranted coming after a year when they were shut down because of the pandemic.  "I can't gamble like that," said Val Gorham, who runs Cromer United Amusements from its base in Eaton, Ohio.  Instead of taking his rides to 26 fairs and festivals around Ohio this summer, he's canceled all of those and filled his calendar with events in neighboring states.  "When I go 15 miles to Indiana or to West Virginia, Georgia, Florida or Kentucky, my equipment's fine," he said.  His decision left organizers of the Tusky Days festival in Tuscarawas scrambling to find another ride company. All they could come up with were a few inflatable bounce houses and one kiddie ride.  "We were doing damage control all weekend," said festival chairman Matt Ritenour. "Having a festival without rides is like having a beer garden without beer. You just can't have it."  In neighboring Denison, only six of 11 rides were approved to operate during its four-day festival in June because inspectors had "zero tolerance for rust," said Greg DiDonato, the town's mayor.  "I get that there was a tragedy. I get it, we want safety, but this is a huge overreach," said DiDonato, a former state lawmaker. "I'm for ride safety, everybody is. But this will kill the small ride operators."  Small town carnivals and church festivals are most likely to lose out because some out-of-state operators won't go through getting licensed in Ohio and those that remain will seek out more profitable, bigger events, said Mike Spriggs, president of the Ohio Fairs and Festivals Association.  "If there aren't changes made to be a little more friendly, I think we'll continue to see them go by the wayside," he said about the ride companies. "They're not going to go through that trouble to get licensed in Ohio."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/after-horrific-fair-ride-accident-ohio-beefs-up-inspections/articleshow/84596719.cms||---

The DFCCIL, the SPV executing the two dedicated freight corridors (DFCs), said on Tuesday that a meeting was held with the stakeholders on Tuesday for developing this 262 km stretch on the PPP mode. It said there were about 100 participants from 42 entities. They included World Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company, SBI Capital, HDFC Bank, India Exim Bank and KPMG. Companies such as L&T, GMR, GR Infraprojects, Tata Projects, IRCON, Adani Group, Siemens, Sojitz, RZD International LLC are also interested in the project. The section is expected to serve major power houses, industrial corridors and multi-modal logistics parks in Haryana, Punjab, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. Increasing trends in finished steel consumption and production would drive growth of steel traffic on the route, the DFCCIL said. It is also planning to develop multi-modal logistics parks, sidings and feeder routes for last mile connectivity along the section alignment to attract more traffic and achieve targeted rail share of freight. As a part of EDFC, the Sonnagar-Dankuni section of 536 km has been approved by the railway ministry for development through PPP. The ministry has directed the DFCCIL to take up this project in two phases – Sonnagar to Gomoh (262 km) Gomoh to Dankuni (274 km).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/world-bank-jica-sbi-capital-hdfc-bank-show-interest-in-dedicated-freight-corridor-project-on-ppp/articleshow/84597030.cms||Dipak K Dash

He also sniffed Amnesty International's role to defame India in the process and demanded the Centre to ban its activities in the country, besides blaming the Congress for creating a ruckus on the issue in Parliament. "In the last two months, India has activated its vaccination programme. We have reached almost 40 crore of people. Now every month India is vaccinating around 15 crore people and has effectively controlled the second wave of Covid," he said at a news conference, accusing the Congress of shifting from ‘oxygen conspiracy’ to ‘phone-tapping’ controversy. Sarma said though people involved in the ‘Pegasus controversy’ claimed to have discovered a database, they could not confirm there was phone-tapping. "They only said there is a possibility of some people’s phones being tapped. But the handsets with phone numbers have not been sent for forensic investigations," he said. He dared Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to lodge an FIR. "Rahul Gandhi could have filed an FIR with his device. But nothing of that kind happened," Sarma said. What should have been discussed in Parliament was the road ahead to revive the economy and the preparation for a possible third wave. “But what happened on the eve of Parliament session was furore over phone-tapping. Whenever the country tries to achieve a milestone, a conspiracy from within and outside breaks out,” said Sarma. He hailed Modi's leadership saying that India is one of the 12 countries which developed its own indigenous vaccination programme. "India is actually demonstrating a huge potential of becoming a world power. We are securing our borders, we are not compromising with anything when it comes to the unity and integrity of India," Sarma said. "We all know that the story was broken by certain international media and also a news portal from India. They have said that Amnesty International is a partner in the project. We all know the role of Amnesty. They are encouraging left wing terrorism in India. They are working overnight to defame India and we know the credibility of Amnesty," he said. Though there is a system of telephone surveillance under the authority of law, Sarma said the government has clarified time and again that they are not intruding into the privacy of the people. "Mainly the Congress is creating the ruckus in Parliament. But in 2013, in a reply to an RTI, the then UPA government had admitted they are doing surveillance of over 5,000 phones and 500 email accounts," he said. "The Congress in Rajasthan has been criticized by the court for infringing on people's privacy and freedom. Their integrity and respect for privacy have always been questioned," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/spyware-attempt-to-defame-india-globally-says-himanta/articleshow/84597155.cms||Kangkan Kalita

While his right leg is paralysed, Ashraf says that is no deterrent and he is determined to complete his journey. Ashraf hit the road on July 15 from his hometown Thrissur in Kerala, and reached Bengaluru on Monday evening. Ashraf said he worked as a computer engineer in Dubai years ago before losing his job. “In 2017, I met with a bike accident. It took nine surgeries and years in hospital to recover.” Ashraf took to cycling in April last year to beat depression. He soon fell in love with it and the mountains even though he could pedal only with his left leg and a few fingers of his right hand had sensation. His aim is to reach Khardung La, one of the highest motorable passes in the world at an altitude of 17,582 feet. Ashraf said after his accident, he realised he could either spend his life in bed or fight it out. “It is all in the mind and I decided to spread the word, ‘Nothing is impossible’.” Target: 100-150km a dayCrossing 10 states, Ashraf plans to cycle 100-150km a day. “I have a foldable tent and a sleeping bag for night stay at petrol pumps. The only difficulty might be in finding restrooms with western commodes as I can’t squat in Indian toilets,” he said. Asked why he doesn’t opt for a prosthetic leg, the avid cyclist said, “I have exhausted family savings in my three years of hospitalisation and once I’m back after this expedition, I will raise money for my surgeries and prosthetic leg.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cyclist-35-beats-disability-aims-to-reach-khardung-la/articleshow/84597240.cms||Kiran Parashar

Just 5.5% of new cases within the period were detected among people who had been fully vaccinated, Darias said, adding 11.4% were partially vaccinated and 83.1% were unvaccinated. "We must keep up the rhythm of vaccination we have reached," the minister told a news conference. "This will give us an important level of protection to allow us to enjoy the summer." The number of new Covid-19 cases per day in Spain has been steadily rising since late June, with the 14-day incidence rate per 100,000 inhabitants rising to 622.4 on Tuesday. The country of 46.9 million people has so far reported a total of just under 4.2 million cases and 81,148 deaths. Spain is the third fastest country at vaccinating its population, according to database Our World In Data, lagging behind only Canada and the UK with 51.3% of Spaniards fully vaccinated and 62.1% at least partially vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/80-percent-of-new-covid-19-cases-in-spain-among-non-vaccinated-people-health-minister/articleshow/84597130.cms||---

Just to the north, the famed Shaolin Temple known for its Buddhist monks' mastery of martial arts was badly hit. There was no immediate word on possible deaths or injuries Tuesday, but videos posted online showed entire neighborhoods covered in water at least a meter (yard) deep and vehicles floating in the muddy mire. More than 10,000 residents of Henan province were moved to shelters, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. The province, home to the Shaolin Temple and many other cultural sites, is one of China's most populous and a major base for both industry and agriculture. Some people were spending the night in their workplaces or checked into hotels. Wang Guirong, a 56-year-old restaurant manager, said she planned to sleep on the couch in her restaurant after being told there was no power in her neighborhood. ``I have lived in Zhengzhou all my life and have never seen such a heavy rainstorm as today,'' Wang said. The State Grid Zhengzhou Power Supply Co. said a downtown substation was forced to shut down because of the rain. China experiences regular flooding during the summer months, but the growth of cities and conversion of farmland into subdivisions has raised the costs of such events.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/heavy-flooding-hits-central-china-subways-inundated/articleshow/84596999.cms||---
---||World||Syria shot 7 of 8 Israeli missiles, Russian military says||MOSCOW: Syria's air defense forces shot down seven out of eight missiles launched by Israeli warplanes during a raid that targeted the Syrian province of Aleppo, the Russian military said Tuesday.  Rear Adm. Vadim Kulit, the head of the Russian military's Reconciliation Center in Syria, said that four Israeli F-16 fighter jets targeted facilities southeast of Aleppo in Monday's strike.  Kulit said seven of eight missiles launched by the Israeli fighter jets were downed by Syrian air defense units that used Russia-supplied air defense systems Pantsyr-S and Buk-M2. One missile damaged the building of a scientific research center in Safira, he said.  A Syrian military official previously said in remarks carried by the state news agency SANA that Israel carried out an aerial attack in the Aleppo province late Monday. He said that Syrian air defenses shot down most of the missiles in the attack that occurred just before midnight.  The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor that has activists on the ground in Syria, said the Israeli strikes targeted weapons depots that belong to Iranian-backed militia operating in Aleppo's Safira region. The group said the strikes were followed by loud explosions. The weapons depots were located inside Syrian military posts, the group said.  Israel has launched hundreds of strikes against Iran-linked military targets in Syria over the years but rarely acknowledges or discusses such operations. Israel fears Iranian entrenchment on its northern frontier, and it has repeatedly struck Iran-linked facilities and weapons convoys destined for Hezbollah.  Russia has waged a military campaign in Syria since 2015, helping President Bashar Assad's government reclaim control over most of the country after a devastating civil war. Moscow also has helped modernize Syria's military arsenals and train its personnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/syria-shot-7-of-8-israeli-missiles-russian-military-says/articleshow/84597368.cms||---
---||Business||‘IOC will use green energy to power all new capacity’||NEW DELHI: IOC chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidya shared with TOI his vision for transforming India’s largest state-run oil refiner and fuel retailer into a new age energy major. Excerpts: Q: Net zero is the buzzword. What are your plans?A: We have to be in sync with the government saying that by 2050 we all should be net-zero. But we should also clearly understand the realities of this part of the world versus the developed world. Emerging economies are totally different in the way they consume energy. So considering the availability, accessibility and energy security, which is the primary concern for me, I firmly believe that all forms of fuel have a place to stay. Now net zero can be divided into categories: One, what energy we use. Suppose we become net zero in that. The second is grid power. If that is green, then stage two is also cleared. Third is what we produce and is being used, such as petrol and diesel, which becomes net zero. That is a tall order. So one way is to reduce the energy we use, bring more energy efficiency. That itself will reduce emissions in a big way. Secondly, whatever electricity we get from the grid we will ensure it is green. We are investing in solar and wind energy in a big way. We have a 75 MW operational wind energy project in Rajasthan. We are bidding for 250 MW solar capacity. We can use the grid to transmit that power to our plants. We have several expansion projects down the line. The intention is to run all expanded capacity on green power. They will not have captive power plants. Q: What about new-age mobility solutions?A: Fossil fuels will be there but gas will play a big role because the government has rightly chosen it as the transition fuel. We are committed to CNG and CBG (compressed biogas) under the government’s SATAT (Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation) scheme. We have issued 2,000-plus LoIs for CBG plants. That will be a game-changer for us. The best part of CBG is that it primes up the total economy. Today, 50% of employment and nearly a third of GDP comes from the agricultural sector. CBG under SATAT scheme creates rural employment and takes care of agricultural and urban waste. Our R&D is working on generating hydrogen through different pathways. We are introducing 15 hydrogen buses in the NCR region. We are also investing in producing hydrogen with 99.999 purity at Gujarat refinery for hydrogen fuel cell buses. We intend to operate these on the iconic Baroda-Sabarmati and Baroda-Statue of Unity (Kevadia) routes in Gujarat soon. We intend to utilise wind power from our Rajasthan project to produce green hydrogen through electrolysis at Mathura refinery as is in the Taj Trapezium Zone. All these will contribute towards net zero. Q: How does hydrogen compare with diesel in terms of cost?A: We are too far away from comparing the cost of hydrogen with diesel. Right now we are only comparing green and grey or blue (method of producing) hydrogen for that matter. Hydrogen from fossil fuel, or grey hydrogen, should not be more than $2/kg but if you go for green hydrogen (produced by electrolysing water using green energy) then it becomes four times costlier. So far it is not a cost-effective option otherwise, we would have made headways in that direction. But we have to set the ball rolling, either the hydrogen becomes available then the buses and everything else starts coming. That is why we intend to supply hydrogen from Gujarat at a subsidised rate so we are able to sustain the ecosystem (for the buses). Q: When do you expect fuel demand to reach pre-Covid levels?A: Petrol is already there. Diesel I expect in a quarter max; by Diwali. ATF (jet fuel) will take time, may be six months or next year. Q: How will competition after BPCL privatisation and energy transition impact your retail character?A: Today we have about 32,000 retail outlets. All of them are automated. We know the units of fuel dispensed in each delivery or which outlet is closed. Automation ensures quality and quantity to our customers. We are at par with anyone who comes in the market, be it private or public. The second part is alternate fuels. We are adding charging points for electric mobility, CNG and CBG at our outlets, wherever possible. CBG will be one big fuel for the future. We are the only oil company to offer CBG from 23 outlets. Hydrogen is still far and it will be few locations where we dispense it. We have set the ball rolling. Eventually, we will make sure it also scales up. LNG is also coming. We have been tasked with setting up 20 of the 50 outlets being planned along the Golden Quadrilateral. Q: How many outlets will offer multiple fuel options?A: About 10,000 of our 32,000 outlets are Kisan Seva Kendras. For argument’s sake, let’s take them out. Then at least a third of the remaining 22,000 outlets will have multiple fuel options, to begin with. Q: How has Covid-19 impacted your retail expansion?A: See, 50 years down the line Covid-19 will be just a blip in human history. So we did not allow our business to suffer. Last year we commissioned 3,000 retail outlets, the highest-ever by IndianOil. This year we intend to do much more. Q: Does such expansion make sense in view of the thrust on gas, ethanol and electric mobility?A: What you are saying is okay if the fuel demand becomes stagnant then the number of outlets will cut into each other’s business. But the whole pie is increasing. We have one-third of the global average in terms of per capita energy consumption. We are the only growing economy, apart from China, where energy consumption is growing in leaps and bounds. Please understand that 250 million tonnes (refining) capacity is likely to rise to 400 so that additional fuel is there. Demand is picking up, we are not stagnant. Ethanol is not going to displace the petrol, it will add on to the MS (motor spirit or petrol) pool. Suppose today I am making 100 kl (kilolitre), it will become 120 kl. It will reduce my import dependence since ethanol will be something I am generating within the country as well as I will be emitting less as it will be green fuel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ioc-will-use-green-energy-to-power-all-new-capacity/articleshow/84597342.cms||Sanjay Dutta

John T. Earnest avoided the death penalty with his plea in San Diego Superior Court. The San Diego County district attorney's office said he agreed to serve the rest of his life in prison without the possibility of parole in state prison. Sentencing is scheduled Sept. 30.  Earnest opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle during the last day of Passover services in April 2019 at Chabad of Poway. The attack killed 60-year-old Lori Gilbert-Kaye and wounded three others, including an 8-year-old girl and the rabbi, who lost a finger.  Earnest then called 911 to say he had shot up a synagogue because Jews were trying to "destroy all white people," authorities said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/california-synagogue-shooting-suspect-pleads-guilty/articleshow/84597662.cms||---

The drama, according to the police, was staged to get their security cover upgraded and attract more attention from the party leadership. Those arrested were identified as Ishfaq Ahmad Mir, son of BJP’s Kupwara district president Mohammad Shafi, and party spokesperson in Kupwara Basharat Ahmed. “Ishfaq had sustained injury in his hand in a firing incident that took place last week. The conspiracy was hatched along with Kupwara BJP spokesperson Basharat Ahmed,” said police. Shafi has been placed under suspension by the BJP UT unit. The case came to light after police launched an investigation into the firing incident. Police said Ishfaq had initially described the incident as a terrorist attack. He later said and accidental bullet fired from a security guard's gun led to the injury. The PSO’s weapon went off accidentally in the car which hit the arm of BJP worker Ishfaq Mir. The other PSO fired in fear. Ishfaq got a minor arm injury,” Kupwara SSP GV Sundeep tweeted. “Two police personnel deployed with Ishfaq Mir are also being questioned,” police added. Meanwhile, BJP said in a statement: “… some reports received from various sources made us think about the credibility of our workers. As such, the party has taken the decision that GM Mir, state spokesperson of the party, will examine the whole facts of the incident and report to the party by July 25. Till then, both BJP leaders are suspended from the party.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/two-bjp-leaders-held-for-faking-terror-attack-in-jk/articleshow/84597724.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Police on July 11 had recovered weapons from a Kashmir-bound truck and had arrested its driver, identified as Muntazir Manzoor of Prischoo Pulwama. According to a source, “The accused was taken to the location from where he had collected the weapons for its further delivery in Kashmir. The accused was taken to Nonath Ashram Gahgwal and adjoining areas.” “The driver during questioning has divulged that the consignment was dropped by a drone from across the border and his handlers had tasked him to carry it into Kashmir,” the source said. One pistol and two hand grenades were recovered from his vehicle during checking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/terror-suspect-brought-to-identify-weapon-dropping-spot/articleshow/84597837.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

More than 80 large wildfires in 13 western states charred nearly 1.3 million acres (526,090 hectares), an area larger than the state of Delaware, by Tuesday, according to the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) in Boise, Idaho. But due to the jet stream and other cross-continental air currents, the regional disasters were being felt nationally. Wildfire smoke prompted an advisory from New York health and environmental authorities on Tuesday for fine particulate matter as the region's Air Quality Index hit 118, which is unhealthy for sensitive groups such as people with breathing problems. AQI readings well above 100 were also recorded in other Northeast cities, including Boston, Hartford and Philadelphia. In Cleveland and Detroit, AQI topped 125, which NIFC meteorologist Nick Nauslar said was likely caused by smoke from Canadian wildfires in southeast Manitoba and southwest Ontario. "Sunsets look prettier, redder, more colorful.” said National Weather Service meteorologist Bob Orevec of the Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. While some smoke diffuses into the upper atmosphere after traveling thousands of miles, it still can lower air quality, Nauslar said. Unhealthy AQI readings were recorded on Monday in parts of Idaho and Montana, which, along with Washington state, are in the wind-driven path of smoke from southern Oregon's Bootleg fire, according to air resource adviser Margaret Key. "Wildfire smoke exposure also increases susceptibility to respiratory infections including COVID, increases severity of such infections, and makes recovery more difficult," Key said by email. The Bootleg fire, already the country's largest wildfire, grew by 24,200 acres overnight to nearly 388,600 acres (157,260 hectares), about half the size of Rhode Island. Some 2,200 personnel managed to contain 30% of it, officials said. As of Tuesday, the fire had destroyed 67 homes and was threatening 3,400 more. An estimated 2,100 people were under evacuation orders or on standby alert to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Rising smoke from the fire raging in and around the Fremont-Winema National Forest about 250 miles (400 km) south of Portland has already produced at least two pyrocumulonimbus clouds, an unusual phenomenon often called fire clouds, the NIFC's Nauslar said. "It can start to produce its own lightning, and essentially become a fire generated thunderstorm,” he said by phone. This can cause rapid and erratic fire spread.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/smoke-from-us-west-wildfires-leaves-easterners-gasping/articleshow/84597756.cms||---

"This is part of a series of attempts to defame and destabilise Pakistan," he said at a presser in Rawalpindi, building on National security adviser Dr Moeed Yusuf's allegation that the country was currently the target of "hybrid warfare". Selsela Alikhel, the Afghan envoy’s 27-year-old daughter, was allegedly kidnapped and subsequently released on Friday at Blue Area, Islamabad’s commercial hub. According to her statement, she was returning home in the afternoon by a taxi when the driver midway picked up another man, who then abused and assaulted her. She was later dumped unconscious by the roadside. Her medical report states she was assaulted. Interior minister Ahmed said the police investigation didn't throw up any evidence to corroborate Selsela's version. "No man sat in any taxi. All four taxi drivers have no criminal record. The Islamabad police reviewed over 700 hours of footage from 300 cameras installed along the route taken by the Afghan ambassador’s daughter, besides interviewing over 200 citizens." The footage has been sent to the foreign office, which will inform the Afghan diplomatic mission about the findings, the minister said. "India is trying to reshape the narrative and trying to create misunderstanding between China and Pakistan. World powers do not want Pakistan and China’s relations to be strong. The unannounced hybrid war against Pakistan has been intensified," Ahmed said. Referring to the timing of two terror incidents in Pakistan, the minister said, "Look at their timing. The Johar Town blast (explosion outside Hafiz Saeed’s Lahore residence) was perpetrated just a day before the FATF (Financial Action Task Force) meeting. The Dasu incident (blast on a bus that killed nine Chinese engineers) took place right before the JCC (Joint Coordination Committee) meeting of the CPEC (China Pakistan Economic Corridor) and the incident involving Afghan envoy’s daughter took place just days before the Afghan peace conference." Ahmed alleged that "efforts are being made to give a false impression to the rest of the world that the security situation in Pakistan is not good".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pak-blames-india-afghanistan-for-distortion-of-facts-on-envoy-daughters-abduction/articleshow/84597911.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

---||World||Mexican president says vigilante groups unacceptable||MEXICO CITY: Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday that his government will not accept armed self-defense groups that say they have formed to protect themselves against criminals.  His comments came after members of a new vigilante movement named "El Machete" (The Machete) showed off weapons including automatic rifles at a parade at the weekend in southern Mexico.  "In no case will the formation of so-called self-defense groups be accepted," Lopez Obrador told reporters.  "It's our responsibility to guarantee peace and calm and we are doing it."  Although such groups say they are taking up arms because of insecurity in parts of the country, the real reason may be political and criminal power struggles, he said.  It is necessary to establish where these organizations get their weapons, Lopez Obrador added.  Self-defense movements have proliferated since the 1990s in Mexico, mainly in the southern state of Guerrero and, more recently, in neighboring Michoacan.  It is estimated that there are around 50 of them operating in the country.  On Sunday members of El Machete, including members of the Tzotziles and Tzeltzales communities, gathered at a football stadium in the southern state of Chiapas brandishing their weapons.  A spokesman for the group said that they armed themselves "to defend their lives against the drug cartels' assassins," accusing the local authorities of colluding with criminals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/mexican-president-says-vigilante-groups-unacceptable/articleshow/84598008.cms||---

Thomas Joseph Barrack, 74, of Santa Monica, California, was among three men charged in New York federal court with trying to influence foreign policy while Trump was running in 2016 and later while he was president.  Matthew Herrington, an attorney for Barrack, did not immediately return an email seeking comment. Barrack was due to appear at an initial appearance in federal court in Southern California.  Barrack was charged with conspiracy, obstruction of justice and making multiple false statements during a June 20, 2019 interview with federal law enforcement agents. The charges were brought in Brooklyn.  "The defendants repeatedly capitalized on Barrack's friendships and access to a candidate who was eventually elected President, high-ranking campaign and government officials, and the American media to advance the policy goals of a foreign government without disclosing their true allegiances," Acting Assistant Attorney General Mark Lesko said in a release.  Lesko characterized the alleged conduct as "nothing short of a betrayal of those officials in the United States, including the former President."  "Through this indictment, we are putting everyone - regardless of their wealth or perceived political power - on notice that the Department of Justice will enforce the prohibition of this sort of undisclosed foreign influence," the statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/trump-inaugural-committee-head-thomas-barrack-accused-of-being-uae-agent/articleshow/84598098.cms||---

The district needs to administer around 9,000 doses on Thursday to complete 28.07 lakh doses. Officials feel that it will be an easy target as they are aiming to administer over 24,000 doses. The district officials have identified 28.07 lakh people aged above 18 for inoculation in the mass drive in population of 40 lakh. District immunisation in-charge Dr Tarun Gupta said, “Coordination, support from all stakeholders including district administration, IMC, other departments, public representatives, NGOs, social group, everybody played their part in the mass drive.” “People came forward to get the jab because of awareness. Our ground workers, ANMs and ASHA workers worked very hard during pandemic right from outbreak to vaccination,” said Dr Gupta. The state government has maintained the supply in accordance with demand, said Dr Gupta. In case of Madhya Pradesh, the target was to administer around 10.98 crore doses of vaccines to 5.49 crore population aged above 18. The health bulletin record suggested that so far MP has administered 2.56 crore doses, which was 23.31% of target to complete two doses vaccination. The drive started on January 16 in phase-wise manner but later expanded to cover most of the part of district as over 1000 sites were operated during mega drive held between June 21 and 30, said Dr Gupta. Indore administered 27.98 lakh doses with 5.29 lakh as second doses which is 18.84% complete vaccination with second dose and around 81% got first dose. No vaccination today District health authorities decided to postpone the scheduled vaccination to July 22 because of gazetted holiday on Wednesday. The authorities also decided to carry out inoculation in urban parts of district through pre-online booking mode only and in rural parts through on-spot vaccination as earlier.  On Thursday, the district health authorities will administer 75,000 doses with first and second dose of Covishield and second dose of Covaxin. The drive will be held after a gap of two days. On Tuesday, two areas reported new Covid-19 cases. Dr Amit Malakar, district nodal officer Covid-19 said, “The cases are at the lowest level of the 16 months of pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/indore-all-set-to-be-1st-district-to-administer-50-of-targetted-doses/articleshow/84598130.cms||Antriksh Singh

Citizens say given the way cables and wires hang precariously or lie on pavements, it is not clear which of them is in contact with live electric cables or poles. Many fear that even accidentally tripping on them or touching them could prove costly. Several roads in Seshadripuram, Malleswaram, Sanjaynagar and Ulsoor have cables dangerously hanging from tree branches as well as lying coiled up on pavements. On Seshadripuram 1A Main Road, walkers had to do a delicate balancing act to avoid tripping on cables or getting their feet entangled in them. Footpaths on Mathikere Main Road too seemed to be no-go zones, given the tangled cables strewn all over. Dikshith S, a resident of Yeshwantpur, said, “Some of the cross roads in our area have cables lying around for years now. We really don’t know who to raise this issue with. For that matter, several streets in the city have this problem. While cables on the main thoroughfare are removed during BBMP drives, those on side roads tend to remain there for years.” Suchithra Deep, a resident of Malleswaram, said a private OFC company carrying out some work in the area left behind cables everywhere, not even bothering to restore the roads after digging them up. “What excuse does a private company have for not being able to clear the debris as soon as work is over? We have spoken to the Malleswaram assistant executive engineer about this,” she said. Sushila G, who has been selling flowers on Sahakarnagar Main Road for nearly 10 years said, “After some work on the road, heaps of cables have been lying on the pavement. I wear a sari and carry a basket on my head. I can’t keep looking down to ensure I don’t trip on cables and spill all the flowers,” she said. Sushila and other street vendors bundled up the cables and put them in a corner. After a few days, BBMP cleared the pileup. “We did it because we needed a place to sit and carry out our business,” she said. “We are aware there are a lot of unused cables lying on pavements. We have received orders from the high court to conduct a drive to have them removed. Zonal chief engineers have been put in charge of this,” BBMP officials said. They, however, said it’s risky to remove cables without checking since some may be functional internet ones. In that case, internet connectivity will be disrupted and affect those working from home and doing online classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/residents-fume-as-dangling-cables-wires-on-pavements-pose-danger/articleshow/84598269.cms||---

While most CNG-filling stations are currently located on the outskirts, things are likely to change in the next few months. This year, GAIL Gas is planning to set up filling stations in BBMP limits and other areas, including KH Road, Lalbagh, Koramangala, Banashankari, Vijayanagar, Ramamurthy Nagar, Kengeri, Rajrajeswari Nagar, JP Nagar, Nagarbhavi, Mahadevapura, Yelahanka, Kanakapura Road, Mysuru Road, Singasandra and Whitefield. “GAIL Gas has planned 49 CNG stations in Bengaluru, of which 31 are operational and the remaining are expected to be ready by September 2021,” said a company spokesperson. “We are planning to set up an additional 100 CNG stations in the next two-three years in Bengaluru Urban and Rural districts. The plan is to set up more than 300 stations by 2027,” she added. Around 9,200 CNG vehicles ply in Karnataka, including 5,000 in Bengaluru. They include autorickshaws, cars, buses, trucks and light commercial vehicles (LCVs). The city also has six CNG kit-installation (retrofitment) centres. CNG price in Bengaluru is Rs 55 per kg. Compared to petrol and diesel, its savings are between 42%-63%. “After petrol and diesel prices spiralled, CNG sales in Bengaluru increased from 12,000 kg per day to 15,000 kg ” she added. GAIL Gas is also planning to facilitate mobile CNG-filling services in the city. This will help motorists avoid queues at filling stations and provide CNG in areas with fewer stations. Each mobile-refuelling unit carries 1,500kg of CNG and can refuel 100-150 vehicles on an average of 10kg each.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/city-core-to-get-more-cng-stations-soon/articleshow/84598338.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

The trio left the city at 8.30pm and reached Nice Road near Yellamma temple. Sahana requested Hemanth to stop the vehicle as she needed to attend to nature’s call. When Hemath stopped the car, Sahana got down and went to the roadside. The woman, meanwhile, was sitting in the back seat of the car. Hemanth asked her to come to the front but when she refused, he touched her inappropriately. She objected but he flashed at her and tried to hug and kiss her, police said.

Central Crime Branch officials arrested Naseeb, Mohammed Azam and Mahir Khan, all residents of Fraser Town, and recovered 19 cars, including a Toyota Fortuner, worth over Rs 3 crore. Pavan Kumar BA, 31, of Banashankari filed a complaint against Naseeb and gang with Jnanabharati police on July 5. Kumar said when his IT company incurred loss, he decided to sell his Toyota Fortuner and approached Naseeb. Naseeb met Kumar in December 2020 and suggested that he shouldn’t sell the vehicle as there was no demand then. Instead, Naseeb offered Rs 13 lakh as loan and demanded that Kumar pledge the car with him in return. But he and his aides transferred only Rs 4.6 lakh to Kumar’s bank account and took away his car, Kumar told police. “The gangs said they were close aides of Zameer Ahmed Khan and threatened me if I alerted police,” Kumar alleged. CCB officials found the gang members moved around in cars that carried stickers with Zameer’s photo and his designation. The gang used to approach car owners or agents, who were about to sell their vehicles, claiming to be prospective buyers, and pledge or sell the cars later. CCB officials said the gang sold one car to a local JD(S) functionary in Davanagere, another to an advocate in Vemagal, Kolar, and also to an aspiring corporator in Bengaluru. They pledged or sold cars in Chitradurga, Davanagere, Bhatkal, Mysuru and neighbouring areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/vehicle-lifters-use-mlas-name-to-dupe-owners/articleshow/84598549.cms||---

"An ultrasound a few hours ago confirmed the presence of a panda embryo," a spokesman told AFP, adding that birth could occur late this month or in early August.  Panda reproduction, in captivity or in the wild, is notoriously difficult because the female panda is in heat only once a year for about 48 hours.  Huan Huan and her partner Yuan Zi, the star attractions at Beauval, thrilled zoo officials in March when they managed to make "contact", as they put it, eight times in a weekend.  Veterinarians also carried out artificial insemination, just to be sure.  That technique was used on Huan Huan for the birth of her first cub, Yuan Meng, in 2017, the first panda ever born in France.  Now grown to around his mother's size, he is to be sent this year to China, where around 2,000 pandas live in the wild and a further 500 are in captivity.  The number of pandas worldwide has rebounded since the black-and-white bear was declared an endangered animal in the 1980s, thanks to efforts to protect it and its habitat.  The gestation period varies from three to five months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/panda-loaned-to-france-by-china-is-pregnant-again-zoo/articleshow/84598618.cms||---

While the high sero-positivity gives rise to hope that a majority of people have developed antibodies, the officials cautioned that the findings should not be extrapolated to draw conclusions at district and state levels as many areas in the country still have a high positivity rate. Moreoever, the distribution of persons with antibodies is not likely to be even. “The findings clearly show that there is a ray of hope but there is no room for complacency. We have to maintain Covid-appropriate behavior and community engagement,” Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) director general Balram Bhargava said on Tuesday. Read AlsoNo deaths due to lack of oxygen reported by states: CentreThe government on Tuesday told Parliament that there were no deaths due to lack of oxygen specifically reported by states and UTs during the second wave of Covid-19. Health minister Mansukh Mandaviya tweeted that the data was based on reports from the states and UTs. He also said, during aInterestingly, the highest sero positivity of 77.6% was found in the 45-60 age group and not the younger 18-44 profile that is seen to be more mobile. Children showed the lowest exposure to Covid as compared to other age groups. However, more than half the children in the 6-17 bracket had antibodies. The sero-positivity was 57.2% in the 6-9 years age group, whereas 61.6% in the 10-17 years age groups showed presence of antibodies. Of the individuals surveyed, 62.2% had no vaccination, 24.8% had taken one dose and 13% were fully vaccinated; 10.5% of surveyed healthcare workers were unvaccinated. Underlining that one in three Indians is still susceptible to Covid-19, Bhargava strictly advised against any “societal, public, religious and political congregation” as well as “non-essential travel”. “State heterogeneity indicates possibility of future waves of infection,” he said asking governments to conduct district-level sero survey to assess the granular data of infections. Read AlsoKerala easing Covid curbs for Eid a sorry state of affairs: SCThe Supreme Court on Tuesday passed a stricture against the Pinarayi Vijayan administration in Kerala for succumbing to traders’ pressure to relax Covid lockdown norms for Eid shopping even when the ‘God’s own country’ had a high Covid positivity rate with more than 1.2 lakh active cases.The latest national survey was conducted during the last 10 days of June to first week of July and included children from six years of age as well as vaccinated people. The sero-prevalence among healthcare workers stood at 85.2%. The survey was carried out among 28,975 people that include 7,252 healthcare workers across 70 districts and 21 states of the country. These are the same districts where the first three rounds of the sero survey were conducted. Sero positivity was 81% among people who had taken one vaccine dose and 89.8% among those who received both doses. The prevalence of SARS-CoV2 antibodies was slightly higher among females at 69.2%, as against men with 65.8% sero-positivity. Covid exposure among those surveyed was slightly higher in urban areas at 69.6%, whereas 66.7% in rural areas showed prevalence of antibodies. “The data shows that a third of the population did not have antibodies, which means 40 crore Indians are still vulnerable. However, national serosurvey is no substitute for local (state/district) variations. State-led sentinel sero-surveillance will inform further state-level action,” Bhargava said. The last sero survey was conducted during December-January when the total sero positivity stood at 24.1%. Highlighting that the rise in seroprevalence is due to two factors - the second wave and also the vaccinations which has given some seroprotection to people, officials said it is preferred that immunity grows through vaccination and therefore, Covid-appropriate behaviour must be followed till large-scale vaccination is achieved. “It is preferable to get immunity by vaccination, not by infection. That is why we need to continue with our strategy of test, track, treat and vaccinate, and also strict containment measures,” NITI Aayog member-health Dr V K Paul said.

---||India||No deaths due to lack of oxygen reported by states: Centre||NEW DELHI: The government on Tuesday told Parliament that there were no deaths due to lack of oxygen specifically reported by states and UTs during the second wave of Covid-19. The response drew strong reactions, particularly on social media, given the crisis of medical oxygen during the second wave. But health minister Mansukh Mandaviya tweeted that the data was based on reports from the states and UTs. He also said, during a discussion on the pandemic in the Rajya Sabha, that the states had been urged to report all cases and deaths. The demand for oxygen peaked at nearly 9,000 MT compared to 3,095 MT in the first wave following which the Centre had to step in to facilitate equitable distribution among the states, it said. Times ViewTransparency and owning up facts is fundamental to a healthy democracy. This seems to be a plain case of hiding facts behind a technicality. It is sad that even extensively reported facts, which thousands of eye witnesses can vouch for, are being brazenly brushed under the carpet."Detailed guidelines for reporting of deaths have been issued by the Union health ministry to all states/UTs. Accordingly, all states/UTs report cases and deaths to the Union health ministry on a regular basis. However, no deaths due to lack of oxygen have been specifically reported by states/UTs," Bharti Pravin Paawar, junior minister for health told the Rajya Sabha. The minister was responding to a question on whether a large number of Covid-19 patients died on roads and hospitals due to acute shortage of oxygen in the second wave. The Centre has supported the states and it undertook a series of actions, including provisioning medical oxygen and other consumables, to ensure clinical care of patients in view of the steep rise of Covid-19 trajectory in the country during April-May, she said. On the total demand of oxygen by the states and the total supply, the ministry said the supply of medical oxygen to hospitals is determined by contractual arrangements between the hospital and the medical oxygen supplier concerned. "However, due to an unprecedented surge in demand for medical oxygen during the second wave — the demand in the country peaked to nearly 9,000 MT as compared to 3,095 MT during the first wave — the central government had to step in to facilitate equitable distribution to the states," she said. The active caseload of the state and UT was the primary determinant of oxygen allocation. Other factors such as case doubling rate, available medical infrastructure, etc were also given due consideration.

The strong reaction reflected concerns in Israel that the ice cream maker's decision could lead other companies to follow suit. It also appeared to set the stage for a protracted public relations and legal battle. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's office said he spoke with Alan Jope, chief executive of Ben & Jerry's parent company Unilever, and raised concern about what he called a "clearly anti-Israel step.'' He said the move would have "serious consequences, legal and otherwise," and Israel "will act aggressively against all boycott actions directed against its citizens.'' In Washington, State Department spokesman Ned Price declined to comment directly on the company's decision. But he said the US rejects the boycott movement against Israel, saying it "unfairly singles out'' the country. In Monday's announcement, Ben & Jerry's said it would stop selling ice cream in the occupied West Bank and contested east Jerusalem. The company, known for its social activism, said such sales were "inconsistent with our values.'' The statement was one of the strongest rebukes by a high-profile company of Israel's settlement policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, which it has controlled for more than a half-century after capturing them in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians, with broad international support, claim both areas as parts of a future independent state. Israeli settlements, now home to some 700,000 Israelis, are widely seen as illegal and obstacles to peace. Israel annexed east Jerusalem after the 1967 war and considers the entire city its undivided capital, though the annexation is not internationally recognized. It says the West Bank is disputed territory and says its final status should be resolved in negotiations. The international community, however, widely considers both areas to be occupied territory. In its statement, Ben & Jerry's said it had informed its longtime Israeli partner that it will not renew its license agreement when it expires at the end of 2022. While noting it would not serve Israeli-occupied areas, it said it would continue to provide ice cream in Israel "through a different arrangement.'' A number of companies, most notably beverage company SodaStream, have closed factories in the occupied West Bank but few have targeted Israeli consumers living there. It remains unclear how Ben & Jerry's plans to do that. Israeli supermarket chains, a primary distribution channel for the cleverly named flavors of ice cream, operate in the settlements, and under Israeli law, people or companies that boycott the settlements can be sued. On the global stage, Israel does not differentiate between settlements and the rest of the country. When home-rental company Airbnb announced in 2018 that it would no longer list properties in West Bank settlements, Israel harshly condemned the move as part of a broader Palestinian-led boycott movement against Israel. Israel's strategic affairs minister at the time, Gilad Erdan, encouraged Israelis harmed by the decision to sue Airbnb. Several months later, after continued Israeli criticism and a US federal lawsuit filed by Israeli Americans, the company reversed course. Erdan, now Israel's ambassador to the US, said on Tuesday that he had sent a letter to the governors of 35 states that have passed laws against anti-Israel boycott activity. "Rapid and determined action must be taken to counter such discriminatory and antisemitic actions,'' he wrote. "We must stand united and send an unequivocal message that this will not be tolerated.'' But even some of Israel's supporters said the company was on solid ground. Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of the liberal pro-Israel group J-Street, said it was not antisemitism to differentiate between Israel and settlements built on occupied territory. "Instead of demonizing and attacking companies and individuals for making principled decisions,'' he said, "these leaders would make a greater contribution to the fight against antisemitism by helping to bring the unjust and harmful occupation to a peaceful end.'' The dispute has turned the Israeli ice cream market into the latest front in Israel's long-running battle against the BDS movement, a Palestinian-led grassroots campaign that promotes boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israeli businesses, cultural institutions and universities. BDS organizers say they are protesting what they call Israeli oppression of Palestinians in a campaign modeled on the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. Its nonviolent message has resonated with audiences around the world, including on many US college campuses. But Israel says the movement has a deeper agenda aimed at delegitimizing and destroying the country. Omar Barghouti, a BDS co-founder, said the movement had been urging Ben & Jerry's to pull out of Israel for years. He called its decision "quite significant.'' "It shows you cannot have business with an apartheid state without being complicit,'' he said. "We expect more socially responsible companies to follow suit, perhaps less publicly. Unilever, which acquired Ben & Jerry's in 2000, appeared Tuesday to distance itself from the ice cream maker. In a statement, Unilever noted that under the purchase agreement, it recognized Ben & Jerry's independence and right "to take decisions about its social mission.'' "We remain fully committed to our presence in Israel, where we have invested in our people, brands and business for several decades,'' it said. Eugene Kontorovich, a professor at George Mason University's Scalia Law School, said that despite such assurances, the global company could be vulnerable to US state laws banning anti-Israel boycott activity. Kontorovich, who consulted with lawmakers in some states that adopted the laws, said they treat anti-Israel boycotts as a form of discrimination. Violating these laws, he said, could make both Ben & Jerry's and Unilever ineligible for state contracts or prompt states to drop Unilever shares from large pension funds. "They may see that mixing ice cream and anti-Israel politics may not be the best idea,'' he said. The battle comes against the backdrop of shifting US attitudes toward Israel. Where Israel once enjoyed solid bipartisan support in the US, the country has turned into a divisive issue in recent years, with Republicans strongly supporting it and Democrats, especially young liberal voters, increasingly supporting the Palestinians. Several factors have fueled this trend, including former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's close alliance with former US President Donald Trump. Michael Oren, who served as Netanyahu's ambassador to the US, said the trends were worrisome for Israel. While he said the Ben & Jerry's decision posed no immediate threat to Israel's robust economy, he said the boycott movement could contribute to a "steady erosion of Israel's legitimacy.'' "Our enemies know they cannot destroy us with all those missiles,'' he told reporters. "They can destroy us economically through sanctions and boycotts. And that's where BDS poses a long-term threat.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/israel-vows-to-act-aggressively-against-ben-jerrys/articleshow/84599371.cms||---

The island had seen far fewer infections than most other Latin American nations over the first year or so of the disease, imposing strict quarantines, isolating the infected, and shutting down its tourism industry despite devastating economic consequences.  But new cases have been soaring in recent weeks, with an average of about 6,000 a day being reported in the country of 11 million people. The first three weeks of July have accounted for about 100,000 of the nearly 300,000 infections recorded all together in Cuba since the first case arrived some 16 months ago.  Cuba's national director of epidemiology, Francisco Duran, said Tuesday that 717 people have died so far this month in Cuba, a heavy share of the 2,019 who have died in all.  Anxiety over that spread was one of the factors that fed into the wave of street protests that broke out across the country on July 11.  Duran said transmission is "very elevated" now, especially in the central provinces of Matanzas, Cienfuegos, and Ciego de Avila, as well as in Guantanamo, to the east. There's also been a rise in Havana, the capital.  "Of course we are worried because we see there is a high incidence in the population, above all in young children," said Yurizam Martinez, a 53-year-old nurse in Havana. "I feel affected psychologically because we have been working for more than a year and we still don't see the result we had hoped for. ... But we have to keep on."  Cuba has been trying to rapidly roll out the two vaccines that it has approved for massive use, Abdala and Soberana, both of which require three jabs. The government reported that both, particularly Abdala, have proven highly effective.  Duran said 18.8% of the population is already fully vaccinated and 30.1% has gotten at least one dose. Officials say they hope to have 80% vaccinated by the end of August, and children by September.  The surge, Cuba's first real wave of the virus, appeared to start slowly after some restrictions were relaxed around the start of the year and new variants began to spread around the world.  Authorities blamed the delta variant for at least part of the problem in Matanzas, where hospitals were flooded with patients and authorities mobilized brigades of physicians to treat the ill.  Pianist Regla de la Caridad Mesa, 60, said she trusted that the island's vaccine campaign will begin to lead to reduced deaths and critical cases.  "We Cubans are a beautiful people, a people who like parties, we like groups. ... We have come through worse things."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/virus-slams-cuba-as-it-races-to-roll-out-its-new-vaccines/articleshow/84599904.cms||---
---||World||Researchers: Virus surge a 'raging forest fire' in Arkansas||LITTLE ROCK: Public health researchers on Tuesday called the rapid rise in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in Arkansas a "raging forest fire," and the state's top health official warned that he expects significant outbreaks in schools. The model by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences' Fay W Boozman College of Public Health projected a daily average of 1,039 new cases over the next week. The model also predicted an average increase of 169 new cases per day in children under the age of 17. Arkansas leads the country in new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. The state also has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with only 35% of the population fully vaccinated. "Covid is no longer smoldering. It has broken out into a raging forest fire that will grow in size and strength," according to the UAMS forecast. "We cannot stand still. We must act to reduce the consequences of this new surge to the extent possible." Dr Jose Romero, the state's health secretary, said he was concerned about the possibility of a "surge on top of this surge" when school begins this fall. Laws enacted this year prevent schools from mandating face masks or from requiring students and teachers to be vaccinated. "I expect to see this year significant outbreaks within the school system," Romero said during a virtual discussion on vaccine hesitancy held by US News & World Report. "What's already telling me that's going to happen are the number of day care closures that have occurred because of outbreaks occurring, and camp exposures and closures occurring." Romero said the key to combatting those outbreaks will be parents stressing the importance of wearing masks. The White House's vaccine coordinator was in Arkansas to meet with Romero, hospital leaders and other health officials about the outbreak in the state. Governor Asa Hutchinson earlier this month began holding town halls around the state aimed at addressing people who have so far resisted getting vaccinated, and he planned more of the forums next week. The state's virus hospitalizations on Tuesday increased by 28 to 815, with 313 in intensive care and 131 on ventilators. UAMS Chancellor Dr Cam Patterson said the increases are straining hospital resources. "Our staffing is really stretched thin at this point," Patterson said. "It's not a matter of finding beds, it's a matter of finding people to take care of patients, whether they're Covid-19 positive or not."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/researchers-virus-surge-a-raging-forest-fire-in-arkansas/articleshow/84600584.cms||---

Barrack entered his plea to seven criminal counts before US Magistrate Judge Sanket Bulsara in Brooklyn. The charges against Barrack, 74, included secretly lobbying the Trump administration for the UAE between 2016 and 2018, and lying to investigators about dealings with the Middle Eastern country. Barrack chaired Trump's 2017 inaugural fund and was a frequent guest at the White House. In an indictment unsealed last week, federal prosecutors accused three people - Barrack, his former employee Matthew Grimes, and an Emirati businessman - of failing to register as lobbyists, and of using their influence to advance the UAE's foreign policy in the United States. Grimes pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and illegal lobbying charges on Monday. The third defendant is at large. Barrack founded the digital infrastructure-focused private equity firm DigitalBridge Group Inc, known as Colony Capital Inc before a rebranding was announced in June. His blank-check acquisition firm Falcon Peak Acquisition Corp withdrew an initial public offering registration on Friday after the charges were unsealed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/trump-ally-barrack-arrested-on-foreign-lobbying-charges-us-justice-department/articleshow/84600959.cms||---

---||India||Kerala easing Covid curbs for Eid a sorry state of affairs: SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday passed a stricture against the Pinarayi Vijayan administration in Kerala for succumbing to traders’ pressure to relax Covid lockdown norms for Eid shopping even when the ‘God’s own country’ had a high Covid positivity rate with more than 1.2 lakh active cases. A bench of Justices R F Nariman and B R Gavai used terms like “alarming state of affairs” and “sorry state of affairs” to describe the CPM-led coalition's decision to relax lockdown norms even in areas with 15% positivity rate and castigated the state for “laying bare the right of life of citizens to Covid”. However, it did not strike down the Kerala government notification allowing three-day relaxations in Covid lockdown norms for Eid shopping, restricting itself to issuing a warning that if Covid cases register a spike later due to opening of shops for Eid, the authorities concerned would be taken to task. This was in contrast to its strident stand against permitting Kanwar yatra, which was scheduled to commence from July 25 in Uttar Pradesh. The same bench had left the Yogi Adityanath government with no choice on the Kanwar Yatra — either the state stops it or the SC would direct it. This ultimatum forced UP to convince Kanwar organisations to voluntarily postpone the Yatras. At the time of hearing, UP was reporting less than 100 cases daily and had a total caseload of 1,100. Kerala has a daily caseload of around 12,000. Justifying the relaxation notification at a time when the state is reporting a high number of Covid cases, the Kerala government said, “Bakri-Eid, the holy festival of Muslims is being celebrated on July 21. The traders were expecting that Bakri-Eid sales would alleviate their misery to a certain extent. They have stocked up the goods for this purpose much earlier. The organisation of traders started to agitate against the stringent curbs... declared that they will open shops all over the state flouting the regulations. The opposition political parties also raised the traders’ issue in the public domain and demanded more relaxations in the curbs to give some respite to the traders and to allow some economic activities in the state.” The bench agreed with petitioner P K D Nambiar’s counsel Vikas Singh, who described the notification as shocking. Singh said religious festivities cannot be a ground for relaxation in a state which is the major contributor of Covid cases to the country's daily tally. “If one does it for Bakri-Eid, the others will do it for Holi and Diwali,” he said. The bench said, “...the affidavit read with this notification discloses that the state government has given in to associations of traders who represented before the government that they have stocked up goods for the purpose of Bakri-Eid very early. The state also blithely records that the opening of shops will strictly follow Covid protocols and they are ready to follow additional regulations ordered by the State, if any.” “What is extremely alarming is the fact that in Category D, where infections are the highest i.e. 15%, a full day of relaxation has been granted, which was yesterday (July19). It is then stated that, as far as possible, the persons visiting shops and other establishments may belong to those with at least one dose of vaccine/Covid recovered category and follow strict Covid protocols,... along with the CM’s appeal," the bench said. "The aforesaid facts disclose an alarming state of affairs. To give in to pressure groups so that the citizenry of India is laid bare to a nationwide pandemic discloses a sorry state of affairs. Even otherwise, homilies such as ‘as far as possibl’ and assurances from traders without anything more, do not inspire any confidence in the people of India or this court," it said. Justices Nariman and Gavai said, “We may only indicate that this affidavit discloses a sorry state of affairs as has been stated herein above, and does not in any real manner safeguard the Right to Life and Health guaranteed to all the citizens of India under Article 21 of the Constitution. It may also be pointed out that the relaxation for one day to a Category D area (with over 15% positivity rate) was wholly uncalled for. In these circumstances, we direct Kerala to give heed to Article 21 read with Article 144 of the Constitution, and follow the law laid down in our orders in the Uttar Pradesh case (Kanwar Yatra).” Having decried the Eid-related relaxation by the Kerala government, the bench made a general remark that no government should buckle under pressure from any group, religious or otherwise. “Also, pressure groups of all kinds, religious or otherwise, cannot in any manner, interfere with this most precious fundamental right of all the citizens of India. We may also indicate that if as a result of the July 17 notification, any untoward spread in the Covid-19 disease takes place, any member of the public may bring this to the notice of this court, after which this court will take necessary action against those who are responsible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kerala-easing-covid-curbs-for-eid-a-sorry-state-of-affairs-sc/articleshow/84601612.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The two senior members have been at loggerheads on many issues, including who will be the party’s face for the 2023 assembly elections. The Congress high command had summoned them to iron out their differences. Rahul reportedly instructed Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah to fight the assembly polls under collective leadership, warning them against projecting themselves as the chief ministerial candidate. “Rahul Gandhi gave us some advice, which we will follow sincerely. Certainly, there are minor differences of opinion. Congress has a strong internal democracy. Having a difference of opinion is part of a democratic set-up, but we will remain united,” Siddaramaiah said at a press conference. Shivakumar said that Congress would go to the next polls under united leadership. “Congress is a national party with a well-defined ideology. It’s collective leadership and there’s no scope for individual leadership. We have a dozen leaders, and the party will go to the elections under them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/work-together-rahul-tells-dks-siddaramaiah/articleshow/84601789.cms||---
---||World||France and Britain beef up patrols, crack down on illegal migration||PARIS: France and the United Kingdom have agreed to deploy more police and invest in detection technology on the French coast to try to stop boats carrying illegal migrants from reaching British shores, they said in a joint statement on Tuesday. France will double police numbers on its northern coast, between the cities of Boulogne and Dunkirk and around the port of Dieppe, as well as reinforce air patrols, in a bid to target small boats attempting the dangerous Channel crossing. Britain will help fund the measures, which also include financing more migrant shelters in France, and invest 62.7 million euros between 2021 and 2022, the countries said following a meeting between French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin and his British counterpart Priti Patel. Most of the steps involve measures on the French side to prevent boats from leaving and France said it had intercepted dinghies carrying a total of more than 7,500 people since last year. On Monday, at least 430 migrants crossed the Channel to the United Kingdom, including women and young children, a record for a single day, the Home Office said. At least 8,452 people have now crossed the English Channel in small boats this year, surpassing the total for all of 2020, according to data compiled by the PA news agency as of late Tuesday. Britain was working on making the country less attractive for asylum seekers and would enforce measures such as sanctions on illegal migration and those who enabled it, the statement said. France said it was also deploying more police to patrol its borders with Spain and Italy.

---||World||US, Germany near deal on Russia pipeline, upsetting Ukraine||WASHINGTON: The Biden administration has reached a preliminary agreement with Germany over a controversial Russia-to-Europe gas pipeline that is vehemently opposed by Ukraine and Poland as well as both Republicans and Democrats in Congress.  Congressional aides briefed on the outlines of the deal said it would allow the completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline without either Germany or Russia facing new US sanctions. In return, the US and Germany will make certain concessions to Ukraine and Poland, although it was not immediately clear if those would be welcomed.  Administration officials declined to comment on specifics of the matter pending an announcement that could come as early as Wednesday. The State Department said Monday that a senior diplomat would be visiting both Poland and Ukraine this week in part to discuss Nord Stream 2 in what are expected to be contentious talks.  The Nord Stream 2 project has posed a major foreign policy dilemma for the Biden administration. US officials from both parties have long feared that it would give Russia too much power over European gas supplies, potentially shutting off gas to Russian adversaries Ukraine and Poland. But the pipeline is almost completed and the US has been determined to rebuild ties with Germany that were damaged during the Trump administration.  President Joe Biden's approach to Ukraine is also a sensitive political subject. Former President Donald Trump's attempt to pressure Ukraine's president to dig up dirt on Biden and his son led to Trump's first impeachment. He was later acquitted by the Senate.  State Department spokesman Ned Price would not confirm on Tuesday that a deal had been done, but said "the Germans have put forward useful proposals and we have been able to make progress on steps to achieve that shared goal, again that shared goal being to ensure that Russia cannot weaponize energy flows."  Word of the impending agreement comes as Ukraine is eager to have the White House make good on an invitation to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to visit Washington. The invitation was extended in principle for "later this summer" before Biden met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva last month.  Although Zelenskyy said at the time he expected to meet Biden in July, no date has been announced as the month draws to a close and Ukraine's public reaction to the Nord Stream agreement may be muted as a result.  Nord Stream 2 has been a topic of intense debate between US and German officials for some time and it was a major agenda item during Biden's meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel last week. Merkel supports the pipeline and Biden has suggested that punishing Germany for that support would be counterproductive to broader US interests.  But like the Trump administration before it, the Biden administration regards the Nord Stream 2 project as a threat to European energy security and has imposed sanctions on some of those involved in building it.  "We continue to oppose the Nord Stream 2 pipeline," Price said. "We view it as a Kremlin geopolitical project that is intended to expand Russia's influence over Europe's energy resources and to circumvent Ukraine. We have made no bones about the fact that it is a bad deal for Germany, it is a bad deal for Ukraine and for Europe more broadly."  Still, Biden earlier this year waived sanctions against the German company constructing the pipeline and its top executives, drawing angry responses from members of Congress and disappointment from Ukraine and Poland. State Department counsellor Derek Chollet is visiting Kyiv and Warsaw on Tuesday and Wednesday to brief officials there on developments.  Administration officials have defended the waivers, saying they can be rescinded at any time and that that threat actually gives the US more leverage. That argument has been scoffed at by pipeline opponents, although Price said imposing the sanction would have been counter-productive.  "It did not make sense to sanction our allies over a project that was more than 90% complete on day one of this administration," he said. "We did not believe that sanctions could stop the completion of the pipeline. And so we made the determination that it made more sense to address Russia's use of energy potentially as a weapon and other malign activity."  Poland, Ukraine and other eastern and central European countries bypassed by the pipeline are concerned that Russia will use gas supplies as a political weapon. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle in Congress and some members of the administration are sympathetic to that position  Under the terms of the expected US-Germany agreement, Ukraine would get $50 million in green energy technology credits, a guarantee of repayment for gas transit fees it will lose by being bypassed by the pipeline through 2024, and a pledge from both Germany and the US that sanctions will be revisited should Russia use the gas as a political weapon, according to the congressional aides.  In a nod to Poland, Germany will also agree to sign onto the so-called "Three Seas Initiative," an EU and US-promoted scheme that aims to boost investment, infrastructure development and energy security among the countries bordering the Baltic, Black, and Adriatic seas, according to the aides.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-germany-near-deal-on-russia-pipeline-upsetting-ukraine/articleshow/84602003.cms||---

It also reported that telephone numbers of an anti-caste leader and several prominent activists also figured in the list of numbers which had been allegedly targeted with Israel-based NSO Group’s spyware, said a report on web portal ‘The Wire’. The report said activists whose phone numbers figure in the leaked records include Ashok Bharti, former JNU students Umar Khalid, Anirban Bhattacharya and Banjyotsna Lahiri, academic and chronicler of life in Naxal-dominated regions Bela Bhatia, railway union leader Shiv Gopal Mishra, Delhi-based labour rights activist Anjani Kumar, anti-coal mining activist Alok Shukla, Delhi University professor Saroj Giri, Bastar-based activist Shubhranshu Choudhary and Bihar-based activist Ipsa Shatakshi. NSO has questioned the authenticity of the claims on 50,000 phones being targeted and has said that the numbers are not from the cyber security firm’s systems and it has no such master list. “The records indicate that phone numbers of some of the key political players in Karnataka appear to have been selected around the time when an intense power struggle was taking place between BJP and the JD(S)-Congress-led state government in 2019, after 17 ruling alliance’s legislators ...resigned to force a trust vote in the assembly,” the Wire report claimed.

---||World||Russian hacker Levashov sentenced to time already served in US||CONNECTICUT: A Russian hacker known internationally as the "bot master" was sentenced to the 33 months he has already served in custody on federal charges that he operated a network of devices used to steal computer credentials, distribute spam and install malicious software. Peter Levashov, 40, pleaded guilty in 2018 to causing intentional damage to a protected computer, conspiracy, wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft. Prosecutors said he operated several networks of hijacked computers, known as botnets, that were capable of pumping out billions of spam emails. US District Judge Robert Chatigny said on Tuesday that he believes the financial harm caused by what began as a spamming scheme was overstated in a pre-sentencing report that recommended a sentence of at least 12 years. But the judge acknowledged that the crimes evolved into something serious and sophisticated. "It goes without saying that somebody that builds and operates botnets, as you did, and profits from making them available for use by cybercriminals, should expect to be prosecuted and punished," he said. "Because indeed this is significant criminal conduct that is harmful to the public." Prosecutors had asked for a sentence that was called for in the pre-sentencing report of between 12 and 14 1/2 years in prison. The judge also ordered Levashov to serve three years of supervised release, during which his computer activity will be monitored. He deferred imposing a fine or restitution for 90 days until he could receive more information about Levashov's financial situation. In their written pre-sentencing arguments, prosecutors said Levashov spent more than a decade controlling the botnets — including one that may have infected 2,00,000 computers, to harvest email addresses, logins, and passwords from infected computers and also distributed malware and other malicious software. "Levashov used those botnets to send billions of spam messages, messages which ranged in destructive potential from relatively harmless advertisements to email messages used to conduct 'pump and dump' schemes, to email messages containing malicious links that spread malware such as viruses or ransomware," Assistant US Attorney Edward Chang wrote in his sentencing memorandum. Chang said Levashov, also known as "Peter Severa", operated three of the most notorious botnets known to authorities — Storm Worm, Waledac, and Kelihos. At its peak, Storm Worm reportedly sent 57 million email messages in a single day, prosecutors said. Waledac could send 1.5 billion spam messages per day and Kelihos was reportedly capable of sending 4 billion spam messages per day, he said. Prosecutors said Levashov had also moderated online forums used to sell and trade stolen identities and credit card numbers. Levashov was arrested in April 2017 while vacationing in Spain. His arrest was one of a series that targeted Russian cybercriminals outside their homeland, which has no extradition agreement with the United States. Russian authorities fought his extradition, but Levashov was eventually transferred to the US. He was prosecuted in Connecticut because the FBI's New Haven office investigated the case through its Connecticut Cyber Task Force and some of the hijacked computers were located in this state, authorities said. Levashov has been out of prison on electronic monitoring since January 2020. Chatigny said his isolation away from his wife and young child during the pandemic was also a factor in the sentencing. Levashov's lawyer, Vadim Glozman, in arguing for the sentence of time served, said his client's hacking was not complex enough to warrant a harsher sentence. He also referenced Levashov's harsh life in Russia, which involved standing in bread lines, which he said led to a desire to take care of his family. He is humbled, apologetic, and has suffered enormously already from his crimes in the years since his arrest, Glozman argued. "Aside from the general weight of being under federal indictment, they have been spent locked up in two foreign countries, away from his family, where he does not know anyone, and spent in the midst of an unprecedented worldwide pandemic," defense attorney Vadim Glozman wrote. "Put simply, these four-and-a-half years have felt like an eternity." Levashov, in a brief statement to the court, thanked his wife and his attorney, who he said nearly brought him to tears with the story of his life. "I apologise if my activities hurt someone," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/russian-hacker-levashov-sentenced-to-time-already-served-in-us/articleshow/84601480.cms||---
---||World||At six months, Biden convenes Cabinet but roadblocks loom||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden marked six months in office on Tuesday with a crowded Cabinet meeting, a gathering meant to symbolize both a return to normalcy due to vaccines and a display of the federal government doing the people's business. But the moment was shadowed by the uncertain fate of a key Biden legislative priority, the bipartisan infrastructure plan, and a virus that has begun to surge anew. Biden crammed 25 Cabinet-level officials, as well as another 18 senior staffers, into the ornate West Wing space to hear the president extol his administration's actions after taking office during a once-in-a-century pandemic. ``The bottom line is we're delivering on our promises,'' Biden said. ``We have to deliver on all the promises we made, because I think we're in a situation where the vast majority of the public agrees with the essence of what we're trying to do.'' The Cabinet members were packed tightly around a table for their first full meeting in the Cabinet room, with a group of journalists squeezed in shoulder-to-shoulder at the outset to chronicle the event. The White House held a rehearsal for the meeting several weeks ago to ensure that all the Cabinet-ranked officials could fit around the table and be seen in photos. ``Time flies when we're having fun,'' White House press secretary Jen Psaki quipped at her briefing, previewing the six-month-mark meeting. Biden was flanked by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. Vice President Kamala Harris sat across the table while some of the president's most influential aides, including national security adviser Jake Sullivan and domestic policy adviser Susan Rice, lined the walls. The scene looked far different from Biden's first Cabinet meeting, held in March, which took place in the more spacious East Room to allow for social distancing. All attendees that day, including the president, wore masks. There were none in sight on Tuesday. The meeting lacked the over-the-top praise of the chief executive that defined former President Donald Trump's Cabinet meetings. But Biden took the opportunity to push for his two-track legislative plan, believing that it was key to jump starting ``an economic boom for some time to come.'' ``The American people are overwhelmingly supportive of our plan,'' the president said. ``That's the part that a lot of our friends on the other team kind of miss.'' Though Biden enjoys largely positive public polling, there are clouds on the horizon. As he convened his Cabinet, the three top aides who have negotiated the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure deal were not there, having rushed to the Capitol to try to save a deal that appeared on the verge of falling apart. Biden's March meeting came just days after he signed into law a $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill and he has poured his legislative energy since then into the infrastructure package despite calls from some in his own party to focus on issues like voting rights and immigration. And while the pandemic had receded since March, the nation's vaccination effort has stalled and a new more contagious strain of COVID-19, the delta variant, had sent infections rising across the country. It largely impacts the unvaccinated _ though the White House announced Tuesday that some vaccinated staffers had tested positive _ and its spread has prompted several major cities to reinstitute mask mandates. The White House, so far, has not followed suit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/at-six-months-biden-convenes-cabinet-but-roadblocks-loom/articleshow/84602056.cms||---

The government found a way to end the stalemate at a meeting of leaders presided over by Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu, when all parties agreed to hold a short discussion on Covid. Some members from opposition parties had submitted notices for discussion on the issue. Leader of the House Piyush Goyal had an informal discussion with opposition leaders and sought their cooperation to resume normalcy. Subsequently, he met Naidu along with the opposition leaders soon after the first adjournment of the House. However, the day had begun with leaders of TMC, AAP, SP, RJD, DMK and YSRCP meeting informally and deciding they would not allow the House to function if any other issue but the Pegasus software issue were to be taken up. In Lok Sabha, the opposition had its way and the Lower House could hardly transact any business for a second day of the monsoon session. On Monday, the opposition had disrupted the proceedings over a variety of issues, including price rise and three farm laws as well as the snooping issue. Earlier in the day, the House was adjourned twice after the opposition created a ruckus over snooping and other issues. Opposition members, including from Congress and TMC, started raising slogans and showing placards to attack the government on the snooping issue as soon as the House met for the day at 11 am. TMC members alleged that party MP and chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee’s phone number were among the numbers snooped on. YSRCP members also flagged the issue of special status for Andhra Pradesh. Speaker Om Birla tried to calm the House saying it was not right to disrupt the House and the government is ready to answer any question. “Please go back to your seats. I will facilitate a debate on every issue. (But) sloganeering is not right. The government is ready to debate on whatever issues you want to debate on,” he said. But the repeated appeals did not help restore normalcy in the House.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pegasus-fracas-stalls-ls-but-impasse-ends-in-rs-with-discussion-on-covid/articleshow/84602079.cms||Mohua Chatterjee

Opposition unity virtually unravelled when the government agreed to hold a discussion on Covid in Rajya Sabha even as Congress declared that it will still boycott the Covid briefing which was earlier to be held by Prime Minister Narendra Modi but was later changed to a presentation by the health secretary. Sources said at a joint meeting of the opposition parties, when Congress announced that it will boycott the briefing, there were murmurs from other parties who argued that the government had agreed to their demand for a discussion in the House. TMC, NCP, Shiv Sena, DMK, SP leaders said it will be an unacceptable stance and said they will attend the session. There was no hint of a discussion on Covid in Lok Sabha as happened in the Upper House. Also, there appeared some confusion within the Congress ranks as a senior LS leader initially told TOI that the party will attend the evening Covid meeting under protest. However, a senior Congress manager said that Trinamool used the change of briefing to health secretary as a “face saver”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-isolated-as-it-skips-govt-briefing/articleshow/84602109.cms||---

The party demanded a judicial probe claiming that then CJI Gogoi’s judgment facilitated defections from Congress and JD(S) to BJP, while the government snooped on family members of the woman. Congress claimed Gogoi was rewarded with a nomination to Rajya Sabha immediately after retirement and this proved a quid pro quo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cong-drags-ex-cji-gogoi-into-row/articleshow/84602122.cms||---
---||India||Highlight welfare schemes, fight Cong ‘lies’: PM Modi to party||NEW DELHI: While exhorting BJP MPs to highlight schemes like free ration to BPL families to counter opposition parties’ allegations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday asserted that providing relief to the people is the government’s responsibility and not a favour. “The pandemic is a humanitarian crisis… the government has ensured that no one dies of hunger during the crisis period. However, let’s be clear that providing relief to the people is government’s responsibility and not a favour,” Modi said in the BJP parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday and asked the MPs to launch an extensive campaign against the opposition, especially Congress “lies” about the Covid management in the country. While senior leaders, including home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, party president J P Nadda were also present, Modi hit out at Congress saying a party which has been reduced to barely two to three states is not doing its job as an opposition party. Modi said Congress leaders, after being in power for decades, have developed a sense of entitlement due to which they are not ready to accept their defeat . “Congress party is in a state of coma but unable to accept the fact BJP is in power and its popularity has been surging,” the PM said. He referred to the PMGKAY scheme saying that feeding over 80 crore people from all castes and communities during the pandemic isn’t an easy exercise. Modi maintained that Covid was not a political but a humanitarian issue but the opposition has been behaving irresponsibly. He reiterated that the government was willing to hold discussions in both Houses of Parliament, but the opposition was not cooperating. He also asked the MPs to ensure that Covid vaccination drive is carried out smoothly in the constituencies. Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi shared details of the meeting and said that the PM expressed concern about the attitude of the opposition, especially the Congress which still believes that only it has the right to be in power. “Such a pandemic has not been witnessed by the world for almost 100 years. Last time, in such a situation, people faced a severe food shortage, but this time the government ensured that no one slept hungry, Joshi said quoting the PM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/highlight-welfare-schemes-fight-cong-lies-pm-to-party/articleshow/84602145.cms||---
---||India||PM at all-party meet: Draw up district-level vaccine strategy||NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi, while interacting with the floor leaders on Tuesday about Covid management, urged the states to devise district-level vaccination strategies even as he expressed concern that a significant number of healthcare and front-line workers are yet to be vaccinated. “We need to properly plan the vaccination drives at the district level,” the PM said. The discussion, where leaders were given a presentation by health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, saw Modi making a detailed intervention. Interestingly enough, the meeting was organised as opposition leaders objected to a proposal for the PM to brief MPs at the Parliament Annexe. The PM said, “It is a matter of concern that around a significant number of healthcare workers and front-line workers are yet to get the vaccine even after 6 months since the drive commenced. States need to be more proactive towards this.” Although some political parties including Congress, Samajwadi Party, AAP, Akali Dal, RJD and Left, skipped the meet, others like DMK, Shiv Sena and TMC attended. He also spoke about the efforts being made to ensure one oxygen plant in every district across the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-at-all-party-meet-draw-up-district-level-vaccine-strategy/articleshow/84602222.cms||---

This will increase the confidence of the people in the police. Gehlot was doing a review of the law and order situation in the state through video conference on Tuesday evening. The chief minister directed to formulate a new policy to make the process of issuing arms licences more rational and transparent in the state. He directed to organize district collector-district superintendent of police conference soon for administrative and law and order monitoring. The chief minister directed to take strict action against the misguided elements by spreading misinformation on various social media platforms. He said that the monitoring cell of social media should be further strengthened at the police headquarters and district police level. Also, the response time of the police should be improved in case of incident. Gehlot said that police officers should adopt sensitive attitude in cases of harassment of women. In such cases, strict action should be taken against the culprits by registering the cases immediately. Also, provide security and legal aid to the victim women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hold-effective-drive-to-nab-goons-cm/articleshow/84600517.cms||---

Despite negative impact of the Covid-19 induced pandemic and its adverse effect on the dairy commodity markets, the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (Amul Federation) has registered turnover of Rs 39,248 crore in financial year 2020-21. Results of the apex body of the dairy cooperatives of Gujarat were declared on Tuesday during the 47th annual general meeting of GCMMF. The federation had posted a turnover of Rs 38,542 crore in the previous financial year. Country’s largest cooperative is now aiming to double its group turnover to Rs 1 lakh crore by the year 2025. It has already climbed the global ranking by emerging as world’s eighth largest milk processor in 2020 from 18th position that it had bagged in 2012 on International Farm Comparison Network (IFCN), a global dairy research network. Milk procurement of all member unions of GCMMF have registered 14% growth in 2021 over the previous year. The co-operative handled 40 lakh litres of milk per day extra during the pandemic. While consumer pack business grew by 8.1%, bulk dairy commodities as well as sales from restaurants and hotels suffered a decline in 2020-21 due to Covid-19. “Since out-of-home consumption in hotels, restaurants, cafes and catering segments was significantly impacted during the pandemic, we focused our attention on enhancing in-home consumption of our products. Impressive growth in sales of our consumers products in household segment, helped us overcome the impact on demand from institutional segment,” said GCMMF’s managing director, R S Sodhi. “Despite restrictions on movement and challenges imposed by the pandemic, our consumers had access to their favourite products,” said federation’s chairman, Shamal Patel. “Our objective is to become world’s largest dairy organization. This would be our fitting tribute to the legacy of legendary Dr Verghese Kurien, whose birth centenary coincides with 75th anniversary of Amul cooperative movement,” said vice-chairman Valamji Humbal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/75-year-old-amul-groups-turnover-crosses-rs-53k-crore/articleshow/84594910.cms||---

HAM(S) is an ally of the NDA in the state. “It’s high time for Centre to pay attention to soaring prices of essential commodities and petroleum products,” Manjhi tweeted. The former CM said the rise in prices of petroleum products has adversely affected all segments. At the same time, Manjhi heaped praises on CM Nitish Kumar for the latter’s assurance that he would look into options to control the prices of petroleum products. “I will look for options to reduce taxes to control fuel prices in Bihar,” the CM had told media persons on the sidelines of his ‘janata darbar’ programme on Monday. The CM’s statement, however, didn’t go down well with the opposition parties. Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said, “It is quite surprising that the CM is not aware that prices of petrol have crossed Rs 100 per litre in the state. This shows his callousness towards problems faced by the people,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/manjhi-to-centre-check-fuel-prices/articleshow/84595491.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||Bagmati in spate at many places||PATNA: Moderate to heavy rainfall will continue to lash the basins of the rivers flowing through south Bihar and in bordering areas of Jharkhand till Friday, according to the flood bulletin of the water resources department (WRD). Accordingly, the basins of the rivers like North Koel, Punpun, Falgu and Sakri-Panchane are likely to receive moderate to heavy rainfall over the next three days. The north Bihar plains also received light to moderate rainfall on Tuesday, as a result of which the water discharge through Kosi on the east and Gandak in the west kept on increasing all through the day, worsening the flood scenario in their basin areas. The water discharge through the Birpur barrage across Kosi in Supaul district increased dramatically from 1.69 lakh cusecs in the morning to 1.95 lakh cusecs in the afternoon and is expected to increase further over the coming days. As a result of it, people living along the lower reaches of the river may be affected by flood. On the other hand, the water discharge through Valmiki Nagar barrage across Gandak remained steady at around 1.50 lakh cusecs in the morning, but increased to 1.58 lakh cusecs by the afternoon. Among other rivers, the water level in the Bagmati was rising. The river was flowing above the danger level at many places, posing fresh flood threat. Similarly, Kamla was flowing 1.10 metres above the danger level at Jaynagar and 1.19 metres at Jhanjharpur. The water level in the Ganga has begun to rise in Buxar on the west and Kahalgaon in the east, while Mahananda was flowing below the danger mark. Meanwhile, the swollen Masan river has been eroding its left bank fast at Dih tola of Raibari-Mahuyawa panchayat under Bagaha-1 block in the Bagaha subdivision of West Champaran district for the last one week. There is threat of soil erosion to over 100 acres of arable land with sugarcane crops. Dwelling houses of Prabhu Yadav, Manoj Yadav, Eslam Khan, Kunkun Yadav, Lalbachan Yadav, Ghur Yadav, Lalbabu Prasad and others have already been eroded. The rescued families have taken shelter at different places with their children and domestic animals. The mukhiya of the panchayat, Shamsad Ali, said sub-divisional magistrate of Bagaha, Shekhar Anand, along with subordinate officials inspected the erosion site. The villagers demanded anti-erosion work. Meanwhile, the protection bund made for the left bank of the Gandak in Bagaha was being threatened by the river in Miraza tola and Parasnagar localities.

---||Visakhapatnam||Weekly positivity rate falls below 5% across districts in Andhra Pradesh||Visakhapatnam: The Covid-19 weekly case positivity rate has finally dropped to below 5% in all districts of the state for the first time in months during the ongoing second wave. Even last week, when Andhra Pradesh’s average weekly positivity rate stood at 3.2%, East Godavari and West Godavari had crossed the 5% positivity rate threshold. As per the latest weekly case positivity rate statistics between July 12 and 18, Kurnool has the lowest case positivity rate among all districts at 0.74%. In all, Anantapur, Kurnool, Srikakulam and Vizianagaram have a less than 2% weekly case positivity rate. While the weekly positivity rate ranges between 3% and 5% in five districts, eight districts have a positivity rate less than 3%. The case positivity rate is a key indicator to gauge the spread of the disease in the community at a certain point in time. The World Health Organisation (WHO), in an advisory released in May last year, stated that less than 5% samples testing positive for Covid-19, at least for two weeks, is an indicator that the disease is under control. The daily positivity rate had peaked to 25.6% on May 16 before it started to witness some improvement. It has remained under 5% for at least the last one month. But some districts, such as East Godavari, West Godavari, and Chittoor remained a challenge even after considerable improvement in other districts. Particularly, the twin Godavari districts posed a big challenge to officials. Corresponding with the lowering case positivity rate, the daily new infection numbers have now dropped to about the 2,000 to 3,000 range from the peak of 24,171 cases on May 16. But districts such as East Godavari, West Godavari, Visakhapatnam and Chittoor still continue to contribute a major chunk of the daily infection numbers. This can be gauged from the fact that while the state’s cumulative case positivity rate stood at 8.22% as of July 18, it is as much as 12.43% in East Godavari, 9.88% in Chittoor and 8.59% in West Godavari. Despite the fall in case positivity rate, the state health department is augmenting infrastructure at all hospitals in its preparation for the anticipated third wave. A special focus has been laid on improving infrastructure to treat paediatric Covid-19 cases based on the assumptions of several experts and reports that the third wave may hit children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/weekly-positivity-rate-falls-below-5-across-districts/articleshow/84594455.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Patna||35 bogus firms unearthed, Rs 540 crore fraudulent transactions detected||PATNA: The investigation teams of the commercial taxes department have unearthed 35 firms which made fraudulent transactions worth Rs540 crore and also did tax theft worth Rs48.45 crore. As many as 26 of them were bogus firms with non-existent address and existed only on paper. The biggest surprise was that as many as 25 firms traded in supari (areca nut). Further, they were part of the interstate syndicate of the traders and transporters. They were trading in the name of firms which did not exist at their declared address. The states with which the syndicate did the trading are Bihar, Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Mizorum, Assam and Manipur. They made purchases and sales of supari worth Rs405 crore, besides making tax theft of Rs20.45 crore. They traded illegally in supari and also indulged in fraud by e-way billing. The other commodities in which the 35 firms did the trading are iron and steel, coal, cooking oil, etc. As many as 35 investigation teams of the department fanned out in different towns to do the inspection work. They had made detailed analysis of the firms before embarking on the physical verification and inspection of their trading practices done with eye on the theft of taxes. They included seven firms of Patna, six of the Magadh region, three of Bhagalpur, one of Begusarai, seven of Saran, two of Purnia and 10 of the Tirhut region. Commercial taxes department secretary-cum-commissioner Dr Pratima Kumari said strong action will be taken against the firms indulging in fraudulent trading practices. The department will take all necessary steps to prevent theft of taxes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/35-bogus-firms-unearthed-rs-540-crore-fraudulent-transactions-detected/articleshow/84595298.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||Covid-19: Vax drive at a snail’s pace in rural Patna||PATNA: The urban areas of Patna are far ahead of rural belt as far as Covid vaccination is concerned. Of the eligible people who have received their first dose of vaccines in the district, only 38.8% are from rural areas and the rest 61% from urban areas. This despite the fat that rural people account for 66.9% of the total population in the district. As per the data available on Centre’s CoWIN dashboard, 17,97,586 beneficiaries have received their first dose of the vaccines and 5.4 lakh second jab so far in the district. The total eligible population in Patna is around 43,49,131 as per the census projection of current population. Of them, 14.3 lakh live in urban and 29.12 lakh in rural areas. According to district authorities, around 76% people have received their first dose of vaccine in urban areas and only 24% in rural areas. The district administration has set the target of administering first dose of vaccine to 100% population in urban belt of the district by the end of this month. In Bihar, around 65% vaccines were administered in rural areas and 34% in urban areas in the last one week. However, in Patna, it was only 27% in rural belt. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh said the effect of Covid-19 during the second wave was more in urban pockets of the district. “The average positivity and mortality rates in the second wave were higher in urban areas when compared to rural Patna because of population density, mobility and interaction of people in urban pockets,” he said. The DM added 76% people have achieved herd immunity in urban areas of the district. “We have set the target to inoculate 100% population in urban areas by July-end. The focus will then shift to the rural areas. The other reason for the vaccination gap between rural and urban areas is the limited number of vaccines that we are getting,” Singh said. As per the data available on CoWIN dashboard, around 13 lakh men, 10.2 lakh women and 484 others have received their vaccine shots in Patna. Among them, 12.1 lakh people have received Covishield, 11.5 lakh Covaxin and 1,445 Sputnik V vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vax-drive-at-a-snails-pace-in-rural-patna/articleshow/84596100.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Lalu Prasad Yadav better, ‘no change in RJD leadership for now’||PATNA: RJD state president Jagadanand Singh on Tuesday ruled out any immediate change in the organizational structure to make any new political arrangements in view of party’s national president Lalu Prasad’s poor health. He said Lalu will soon return to Patna. Singh was alluding to the likely elevation of Lalu’s younger son and the leader of opposition in the state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav to the post of the party’s acting president. “It is all speculation,” Singh said. “There is no plan for any political change in the immediate future,” Singh also said, adding that “no political” meaning should be read in his own meeting with Lalu on Sunday and Monday, and even in the sudden rush of Tejashwi to Delhi on Monday. Singh had a meeting with Lalu at the latter’s daughter Misa Bharti’s residence where the RJD chief has been recuperating since his discharge from the AIIMS where he had been admitted after getting bail in a fodder scam case. “It is quite strange. They have heaped cases on Tejashwi. When he goes to Delhi in connection with the same and to consult lawyers, they ask why he is in Delhi!” Singh said, adding: “Tejashwi has to also see his ailing father. There is nothing other than that.” Singh said before Lalu was granted bail, his condition was bad since “he was seriously ill in the jail. But his condition has improved and today he is better than what he was, but he has to abide by the advice of the doctors”. He also said suitable constructions and arrangements were being made at his Patna residence, so that Lalu could live there adhering to the advice and guidelines from the doctors attending on him. “Doctors have advised him not to climb up or down the steps. Once, suitable arrangements are made, he will come to Patna and also travel between Patna and Delhi for medical treatment,” Singh said. During his July 5 virtual address from Delhi at the RJD’s foundation day function held in Patna, Lalu had said would return to Patna and visit every district. However, the state BJP has been refusing to accept that the elevation of Tejashwi to the post of the RJD’s acting president is not in the pipeline. “Like Congress, the RJD is also a party of a family. The leadership of the party will be passed on to someone in the family. It could be Tejashwi, and there is also Rajya Sabha member Misa Bharti,” state BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said, adding that former minister Tej Pratap Yadav has been sidelined, even though he is older than Tejashwi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-immediate-change-in-rjd-leadership-jagadanand/articleshow/84595456.cms||Abhay Singh

He is the second JD(U) leader after the party's parliamentary board chairman Upendra Kushwaha to launch a yatra to get feedback from people about different development schemes of the state government. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Umesh said he would leave Patna for Purnia on July 24 and hold a ‘Jan Samvad’ with people to know their problems. He will also meet party workers separately. On July 26, he will reach Katihar from where he will move on to Kishanganj the next day. On July 27, he will visit Araria district. “The main objective behind the yatra is to gauge the people’s mood and strength of the party,” Umesh said, adding that he would ensure that people’s problems were addressed. The JD(U) state chief said he would also interact with the members of the district executive committees during his yatra. They would be asked to form separate teams to make the people aware of the development works undertaken by the state government. Earlier, Upendra Kushwaha visited West Champaran, East Champaran, Sitamarhi and Madhubani districts as part of his yatra. On his return from the first leg of the yatra, he said people still have faith in the leadership of Nitish Kumar. He, however, admitted that some people complained about the style of functioning of the local government officials. Later, he told media that he would give feedback to the CM on his yatra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-bihar-chief-to-visit-four-districts/articleshow/84595624.cms||Ramashankar
---||Business||Increased trust@work is pandemic’s silver lining||By Tarun Rai“How do you mark attendance when everyone is working from home?” This question on one of my ex-company’s WhatsApp groups got me thinking about how, without realising it, organisations may have changed the way they relate to their employees during the long months of the lockdown. Trust is such an important aspect in any organisation, of any team. However, maybe inadvertently, organisations and team leaders do not focus on this aspect enough. In fact, a lot of systems, processes and behaviour in organisations feel contrary to an ethos of trust. At the start of my career I was very lucky to experience trust in action. And I am sure that it laid the foundation of my own leadership style — a style based on an implicit trust of my team and all the people I work with. Here are just two examples from my initial years of work life… Learning to swim, the Asian Paints way There are two ways to learn swimming: a) Start at the shallow end and learn to float. Learn the strokes and practise with the confidence of knowing your feet can touch the floor. Then gradually develop the courage to get to the deep end. b) Someone throws you into the deep end and you thrash about, swallow some water but then manage to ‘swim’ your way to safety. The Asian Paints style of teaching fresh graduates and preparing them for a career in the company was the latter. I, along with a bunch of management graduates, had two weeks of ‘orientation’ and then a few months of ‘training’ in a city office (branch, as they were called). And in exactly six months we were at our first postings as assistant branch managers — basically the deputy head of the branch. With a total of six months of work experience! That was my first experience of trust in an organisation. Everyone at the branch knew more than me. And I learnt from all of them. I made mistakes along the way (thrashed around at the deep end of the pool), but I learnt fast and the learnings of my three years in Asian Paints stayed with me all through my career. More than us, the rookies, it was Asian Paints that had the courage to trust fresh graduates with important roles. ‘I don’t want to talk to your boss’ Fast-forward three years to my next job at HTA (renamed JWT, and now, Wunderman Thompson), and my first client, Hero Cycles. By now I had strong sales & marketing experience, but advertising was new to me. It was, therefore, a bit daunting as the client we were dealing with was not a brand manager (in those days, Hero didn’t even have a marketing department) but the chairman himself who was involved with all advertising decisions. Appropriately, our meetings with him, in their head office in Ludhiana, were always with our own seniors with heavy-weight designations. My contribution at these meetings was, therefore, limited. After coming back to Delhi from one such meeting in Ludhiana, the phone rang at my desk. It was his EA on the line who said that the chairman wanted to talk to me. I was sure it was a mistake and I was about to shout out to my boss when the chairman came on the line. “I don’t want to talk to your boss,” he said. He wanted something done urgently, so decided to cut the layers of hierarchy and wanted to speak to the person who actually does the work. Like most self-made entrepreneurs, he was intuitive and figured, from his brief interactions with me, that I would be able to deliver. From that point onwards, I handled the account pretty independently. It was the beginning of a long innings for me with Hero. Our business with them grew, as they grew. And three decades later, they are still one of our biggest and one of our most important clients. My client reposed a lot of trust in me. And so did HTA. Reporting or mentoring? However, I have seen that many organisations do not operate on the presumption of trust of their people. The very rigid, hierarchical structure itself that almost all organisations have smacks of a ‘supervisory’ and a ‘command-and-control’ ethos. In fact, I used to wonder why we refer to a junior-senior relationship as a ‘reporting’ relationship rather than a ‘mentoring’ one. I used to laugh and tell people that we are not in the army where there is a need of hard ‘reporting’ lines, where there may be no time to question your immediate senior’s decisions or authority on the battlefront. I got to know recently that the modern office organisation structure is, indeed, based on the military and has its roots in the post-World War II period (Joanne Lipman, Time magazine – issue dated June 14, 2021).The key role of the senior should really be that of a mentor — to ensure the growth and development of the people in their teams. To share knowledge, to equip them to take on more responsibility by giving them more opportunities. And supporting them when they falter. To trust them to deliver. ‘Who do you work for?’ At one of our offsites, when I was heading Worldwide Media (or WWM — a TOI–BBC joint venture), I popped this question on a slide while making a presentation to a large audience of our mid to senior staff. The people in the room were from different functions — editorial, sales, marketing, distribution. I got various answers — ‘for the company’, ‘for my boss’, ‘for my client’, ‘for my reader’… The answer I was looking for was — ‘I work for me’. And when I mentioned this, it resonated immediately with everyone and they agreed that our primary motivation is to excel for ourselves. To take pride in our work. To impress ourselves before anyone else. If organisations and team leaders accept this to be their staff’s primary motivation, they can ‘assume excellence’ from their people. And reduce the need of constant ‘supervision’. ‘Presenteeism’ While our organisation structures may be based on the military, our preoccupation with ‘office attendance’ might be from the start of the industrial revolution itself. The shop-floor workers had to punch in their cards on time and take their places on the production belt. Many decades later, almost all companies, irrespective of the nature of their business, have an office attendance muster, where people have to ‘swipe’ the time they enter office. Being in office, and on time, staying on late to show that they are working hard has become the culture in most organisations. This creates the problem of ‘presenteeism’ — people are present in office but not necessarily productive. They are there to be ‘seen’ by their bosses. It is borne out of insecurity, of a lack of trust. A culture of trust This brings me to the question that was posed at the beginning of the article: ‘How do you mark attendance when everyone is working from home?’ You can’t. You just assume that everyone is at work on time, every day, unless an employee requests for official leave. You trust them. While this particular question relates to attendance, it throws up issues of trust beyond being present. How does a boss ‘supervise’ someone’s work when there’s no shoulder to peer over? How does anyone determine how many ‘hours’ people are putting in when they can’t be ‘seen’ at work? There’s no option but to learn to trust. In our organisation, I found that productivity and the quality of our output was maintained despite the hurdles put up by the long months of the lockdown. Our people were more innovative, more resourceful and collaborated extremely well. They found the time even for pro-bono campaigns — whether it was encouraging people to wear masks, or raising awareness about domestic violence during the pandemic. We got public recognition for our pro-bono work and our client ratings in a survey done in April this year, after so many months of working from home, were the highest ever. WFH over the last year would have, certainly, made organisations and leaders give more freedom and independence to their employees. Allowing people to manage their time and responsibilities themselves. It has put the focus on building a culture of trust in organisations. That, to me, is one silver lining of the pandemic.

The bench of Justice Chakradhari Sharan Singh observed that its high time the state considered framing statutory rules in view of laws laid down by the Supreme court on the serious and grave consequences of blacklisting a firm. The court made the above observations in its 57-page judgement delivered while quashing the BUIDCo order of blacklisting M/s EMS Infracon Private Limited on March 4, 2021 for one year as per the provisions of Bihar Contractor Registration Rules, 2007 for mentioning false facts in its tender documents. The order was uploaded to the high court website on Monday night. The rules were actually formed by the state road construction department with it’s commissioner-cum-secretary as an appellate authority. The court observed that blacklisting a contractor can have more serious consequences than dismissal of an employee for reason that his status may be restored with other consequential benefits if found illegal. Loss incurred by a firm because of the ineligibility after being blacklisted cannot be compensated. The court observed that it was the BUIDCo’s obligation to have recorded the points unacceptable in the petitioner’s reply to the show-cause notice dated October 31, 2020. It observed that the order to blacklist the firm appears to be based on a presumption. The firm was one of the four bidders for construction of a sewage treatment plant (STP) with 167.3-km-long sewerage network in Munger worth around Rs300 crore under the Centre’s Namani Gange project. Firms were considered eligible only for technical bidding. The project has 70% finance from the World Bank through the Centre. The court raised significant question, as can BUIDCo as an executing body completely ignore arrangements with the World Bank, which is funding the project and the state funding only 30% of it. The private firm, in joint venture with M/s Technocraft Construction Private Limited, had taken part in the bidding process as per the World Bank’s guidelines. The bench ordered the technical tender committee to revisit TBER considering NMCG communications on the issue. It also ordered for fresh evaluation of technical bid, making state development commissioner as chairman of the technical committee in the interest of justice. It gave the commissioner liberty to reconstitute the committee with NMCG technical executive director as one of the members. The court also ordered that the committee meeting be held by July 22 and the commissioner should consider if BUIDCo chief engineer be allowed to participate in it or not. The engineer’s two blacklisting orders have already been quashed by the high court. The firm, represented by senior counsel SD Sanjay, had submitted that BUIDCo didn’t have jurisdiction to decide on incorrect facts in tender documents as it was purely in the World Bank’s domain. The firm had also challenged the legality of four technical bid evaluation reports (TBER) of BUIDCo where the petitioner was not recommended and declared non-responsive. It had sought relief as per World Bank observation in letters to the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG). Advocate general Lalit Kishore appeared for the state and BUIDCo while PK Shahi represented Toshiba Water Solutions Private Limited. The court observed that BUIDCo acted irresponsibly, casually and in a cavalier manner in blacklisting the firm, adversely affecting the project’s progress along with serious adverse consequences on petitioner’s eligibility to participate in other government bids. The court observed that the BUIDCo chief engineer didn’t consider the firm’s explanation to the show-cause notice, referred to new facts which were absent in the notice and most importantly not recorded anything on applicability of executive instructions of the contractor rules for taking action in a bid based on model tender document set by NMCG having the World Bank funding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-hc-indicts-buidco-for-blacklisting-firm-casually/articleshow/84595797.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The hillocks are believed to be living places of rishis of the Ramayana era as well as the birthplace of Luv and Kush when Lord Ram’s wife Sita was in exile. The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar was hearing a PIL filed by one Vinoy Kumar Singh of Rajauli in Nawada to protect environment and ecosystem surrounding both the hillocks having religious, cultural and historical importance with temples, caves and stairs existing for thousands of years. The ecosystem includes a water fountain badly damaged due to quarrying. The bench asked the state government to reply within four weeks’ time. The petitioner has urged the high court to order the authorities to permanently stop mining activities in the area and declare both hillocks as heritage and protected sites while including them in the Ramayana circuit. The PIL mentions that even the Britishers in 1906 gazette had highlighted the religious and historic importance of the hills. The court has also been urged that environment and forest department be directed to withdraw its clearance for quarrying in the area. The court was apprised that rock particles from blasting were causing injury to the nearby villagers and affecting wildlife. Counsel Brishketu Sharan Pandey appeared for the petitioner while assistant solicitor general Tuhin Shankar appeared for the Centre and government advocate Raghawanand for the state government. HC orders inspection of Patliputra Jn: The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar has ordered the principal secretaries of road construction department and urban development and housing department to carry out inspection of Patliputra Junction with railway authorities to get rid of the problem of poor connectivity and infrastructure for passengers even a long time after it became operational. The court has allowed a week’s time to carry out the inspection and submit report on it for hearing the matter again. The court was hearing a PIL filed by one Bharat Prasad Singh. ‘Why construction of vending zone stopped’: The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar, while hearing a PIL filed by Dr Ashish Kumar Singh, directed the Patna Municipal Corporation to reply why the construction of a vending zone for vendors of Kadamkuan vegetable market has been stopped. The bench directed the municipal body to reply within a week. The court orally observed that why people should suffer for incompetence of the government authorities. Petitioner’s counsel Mayuri submitted that due to lack of coordination between the civic body and the UDHD, only 30% work could be done while yje vending zone was to be completed by 2019. The vendors are forced to sell their items on road resulting in encroachments and traffic jam, he argued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-hc-stays-quarrying-on-nawada-hillocks-seeks-bihar-govts-reply/articleshow/84595838.cms||---

The deceased were identified as Paparao and his one-and-a-half-year old grandson Chaitanya. According to Vissannapeta police, they received a complaint from Paparao’s daughter Vasanta Lakshmi that he may have killed her son before ending his life. Explaining the father-daughter relationship, cops said Paparao was against his daughter’s love marriage with Peddiboyina Venkateswara Rao that took place two-and-a-half years ago. Cops said that the incident happened when Paparao’s wife Venkateswaramma, his daughter Lakshmi and son-in-law Venkateswara Rao went out to work, leaving Chaitanya under his care. When they returned home in the evening, they were shocking to find both dead by consuming pesticide. However, the family members did not lodge a complaint with the police and it only came to light after villagers expressed their concern that it could be a case of revenge killing and suicide. Based on a complaint by the local revenue officials, cops registered two cases. Cops said Venkateswaramma’s statement claims her husband was not mentally stable and might have consumed the poison on his own.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/man-1-yr-old-grandson-found-dead-revenge-killing-suspected/articleshow/84594681.cms||---
---||Business||HDFC average loan size swells by Rs 2.5L to Rs 29.5L||Mumbai: HDFC has seen its average loan size jump from Rs 27 lakh to Rs 29.5 lakh during the Covid pandemic as borrowers sought larger homes with many companies shifting to work-from-home mode. Addressing shareholders at the company’s annual general meeting on Tuesday, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh said that the pandemic has reaffirmed that there can be no greater security in life than a home and the inherent demand for home loans continues to be strong. He said that there was a shift in preference to more spacious and larger homes during the pandemic. HDFC’s average loan size had been around Rs 27 lakh for several years as demand shifted to smaller towns and affordable housing. The Rs 2.5-lakh increase shows a major shift during the pandemic. Even as the average property value purchased by borrowers during the pandemic rose, the affordability of loans for borrowers improved to a 25-year high. The affordability is measured as the number of years of income required to buy a home. In the case of HDFC, the affordability improved to 3.2 years of income as against 3.3 years in FY20 and 2.5 years in FY19. This was largely because the annual income of borrowers rose from Rs 15 lakh to Rs 16 lakh even as property values remained at FY18 levels. The average age of the borrower also dipped from 39 years to 38 years. Parekh said that despite the pandemic, companies have not given up their office premises. “With the e-commerce boom, demand for real estate is coming from warehousing and fulfilment centres. Similarly, with the build-up of digital infrastructure, demand for data centres has increased. These are segments of the real estate sector that have potential to grow immensely,” he said. In his address, Parekh said that India’s macro-economic fundamentals were strong and that a recovery was under way despite the uncertainty caused by the virus. Pointing out that forex reserves and foreign direct investment were at a record high, and that capital markets were buoyant, recovery would be bolstered by strong foodgrain products and an accommodative monetary policy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-average-loan-size-swells-by-rs-2-5l-to-rs-29-5l/articleshow/84599717.cms||---

The experience was harrowing for residents of these societies as many households simply could not prepare breakfast or lunch. “The supply was affected around 8am as there was a leak in the main pipeline, according to the message we received from Adani. By the time gas supply was restored, it was around 3.30pm and we had no choice but to order for food,” said Manisha Sharma (name changed), a resident of Shela. Sources confirmed that a leak occurred at around 7.35am near Shela, due to some road-digging activity being undertaken by UGVCL. Supply was restored at around 11am. However, around noon, another leakage was reported in the main gas pipeline of Adani Gas near Club O7, where a private developer had undertaken digging for construction. Supply was restored by 2.50pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/leaks-affect-adani-gas-supply-in-shela-south-bopal/articleshow/84598590.cms||---

The company said that the board of directors in their meeting also approved the appointment of Pramit Jhaveri, who headed Citibank India for nearly a decade, as an independent director on its board. While the company’s assets under management (AUM) increased by 15% to Rs 1.6 lakh crore as of June 30, bad loans or gross non-performing assets (NPAs) rose faster to 2.96% of gross advances, from 1.4% a year ago. Shares of the company closed 1.2% lower at Rs 5,937. “Since Q1 has been a large miss on expectations and provisioning buffer has declined, incremental bounce, collections and roll-back trends would be key monitorables. The management’s credit cost and growth guidance for the rest of the year is primarily anchored on these metrics staying healthy,” said Rajiv Mehta, analyst at Yes Securities. “The deterioration in asset quality is not surprising given it was a Covid quarter without any regulatory moratorium and that the management had alluded to higher forward flows across overdue buckets due to collection constraints,” said Mehta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bajaj-finance-net-rises-4-bad-loans-jump/articleshow/84600099.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

VIP chief and minister of animal husbandry and fish resources department Mukesh Sahani said preparations were underway to observe the death anniversary of former MP, who championed the cause of the fishermen community. Altogether 18 statues of the departed leader were given final touches at the Strand Road residence of the minister here. These statues will be installed at all the 18 divisional headquarters of Uttar Pradesh, where assembly polls will be held in 2022. Sahani will attend the installation ceremony to be held at Sujabad Parao in Varanasi district. The statues will be installed at other locations too, including Lucknow, Prayagraj, Sultanpur, Mirzapur, Meerut, Balia, Bandra, Jaunpur, Gorakhpur and Ayodhya. Sahani said the statues of Phoolan Devi would remind people how a rural woman, who was subjected to physical torture, fought against the perpetrators of crime, scaled the height in public life and reached the Parliament. He said the provisions of reservation for Nishad and its sub-castes in the Constitution have not been implemented in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. “The matter is pending with the central government. As a result, people from these states are deprived of the facilities,” he added. Sahni had earlier announced that his party will contest the assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh on 150 seats and set up offices in important towns. Nishad and its sub-castes constitute nearly 14% of the total population in Uttar Pradesh. They have their presence in at least 70 assembly constituencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vip-to-install-18-statues-of-phoolan-devi-in-up-towns/articleshow/84595563.cms||Ramashankar

While Jaynagar is in Madhubani district, Kurtha falls in Dhansua district of Nepal. ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar said the railways intends to start rail services on the route at the earliest. “Commissioner of railway safety (CRS), eastern circle, is likely to inspect the track condition and its fitness. Once he gives his green signal, the long-cherished dream of the people of the two countries for a rail service will be fulfilled,” the CPRO added. “Work on first phase of the project from Jayanagar to Kurtha has been completed. The second phase will connect Kurtha with Bijilpura (17km) and the third phase Bijilpura with Bardibas (17km). The Nepal government has started the process of acquiring land for the third phase of the project,” said an official of Ircon International Limited, an undertaking of the ministry of railways. He added the entire stretch from Jaynagar to Bardibas is dotted with eight stations and six halts. The ministry of external affairs has provided Rs 787 crore for implementation of the project after mutual agreement between the governments of the two countries in August 2018. A new rake of passenger train is ready to run from Jaynagar to Kurtha, the sources said. Jaynagar-Kurtha rail line was built during the British Raj with the sole purpose of transporting wooden logs from Nepal forests. Later, this rail line was washed away in the devastating floods during pre-Independence period. Since then, direct rail communication between India and Nepal was completely snapped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/trains-between-jaynagar-and-kurtha-soon-rlys/articleshow/84592793.cms||---

Makeshift stalls that displayed earrings, bangles, artificial jewellery, embroidered clothes, footwear, home decor items, utensils, and dry fruits for sale were also put up in perennially crowded localities like Sabzibagh, Alamganj, Shahganj and Phulwarisharif. The festival will be celebrated on Wednesday. Mohd Arman, the owner of a bakery in Sabzibagh, told this newspaper that Eid and Bakrid were the only festivals when he and other shopkeepers raked in the moolah. “I have made over 10,000 ‘rotis’ which I am sure will fly off the shelves by evening,” he said, adding that ‘naans’ and ‘bakarkhanis’ were available in the range of Rs 40 to Rs 350. Many girls and women also queued up outside local boutiques for getting henna applied on their hands. Sajida Khatoon, a resident of Azimabad Colony, said, “I am looking forward to celebrating Bakrid and having a gala time with my family.” Another shopper, Ayesha Siddiqui, pointed out that the festival was incomplete without new clothes and delicious food. Meanwhile, some shopkeepers were disappointed as they witnessed poor footfalls on the eve of Bakrid. Gopal Singh, the manager of a readymade garment store in Patna Market, rued, “Many people have switched to online shopping because it does not require them to step out of their houses amid the Covid-19 pandemic.” Another shopkeeper, Sumit Kumar, echoed similar views and said the pandemic had hit his business. Cattle traders in Raja Bazar also seemed disappointed because of low footfall of buyers. Ranbir Singh, a seller from Uttar Pradesh, claimed, “I have not witnessed such a poor response in the last 40 years. Of the 45 goats I brought here, only 22 have been sold.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/last-minute-bakrid-shoppers-flock-to-markets/articleshow/84595949.cms||Faryal Rumi

As many as 20 ward councillors met mayor Sita Sahu on Monday and said Meera was incapable to hold the deputy mayor’s post. Empowered standing committee member Indradeep Chandravanshi claimed that around 50 out of the 75 councillors would vote in favour of the motion. “We will move a no-confidence motion against deputy mayor. She is incapable to hold her post and always oppose the decisions of the civic body. She had even tried to create ruckus during the meetings held to pass the PMC’s proposals,” he told this newspaper on Tuesday. “During the floor test for Patna mayor, Meera had deliberately misused her power to throw Sahu out in an undemocratic manner. It is due to this domineering behaviour that we want her to be removed from the deputy mayor’s post,” Indradeep said. As per the Bihar Municipal Act, the first no-confidence motion can be brought within two years of taking charge. Meera completed her two years as a deputy mayor on Tuesday. Sahu said several councillors are not satisfied with Meera and even those who helped her attain power have now decided to bring motion against her. Meera told this newspaper that if the majority of the ward councillors wanted her to leave the post, she was ready to face the floor test. “As a deputy mayor, I have very minimal power. All the power is vested in the mayor. Since the day I have joined, I only work for the people and raised objection when I thought it was required. I don’t know why she (mayor) has a grudge against me. She has not done anything for the city, but shamelessly put up the banner in Patna about her fake achievements.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Covid cases are down but rise in viral fevers, says doctors||MUMBAI: Although Covid-19 cases are down in the city, doctors say there is a rise in other viral fevers, especially those causing respiratory problems. Most patients, both adults and pediatric, undergo an RT-PCR test to rule out Covid-19 before being treated for symptoms such as fever, cough and cold. Due to the Covid-induced lockdown last year, there was a lull in non-Covid ailments. But with the decline of the second wave, doctors have noticed a trend of rising fever cases. Dr Lancelot Pinto, pulmonologist with Hinduja Hospital, Mahim, said such fever cases have increased with the monsoon. “These are not Covid-19 cases, but the usual respiratory viruses that affects people during the monsoon and cause high fever, cold and cough,’’ he said. Pediatrician Dr Indu Khosla, who is attached to Lilavati Hospital in Bandra and SRCC Children’s Hospital near Chowpatty, said she has noticed a sharp rise in children with non-Covid respiratory ailments in the last fortnight. “When we first got such cases, we repeated Covid-19 tests that came negative,” she said. As the fever in two children admitted under her care did not resolve for days, she conducted detailed viral tests for them. “These tests are costly and not done usually, but the tests revealed that the children had RSV,’’ she said. RSV or respiratory syncytial virus is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. Most people recover in a week or two, but RSV can be serious for infants and senior citizens. Dr Vijay Yewale, attached to Apollo Hospital in Nerul and a member of the state Covid-19 task force on pediatrics, said he noticed the trend since Covid cases dropped drastically three weeks back. “Seasonal viruses missing in 2020 due to lockdown, which prevented children from playing with each other, seem to be back in circulation this year,’’ he said. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said fever cases are normal during rains. “Viruses circulate in humid conditions. Temperature fluctuations are higher this season,’’ she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-covid-cases-are-down-but-rise-in-viral-fevers-says-docs/articleshow/84598596.cms||---
---||Business||Demand dips for loans guaranteed by govt||Mumbai: The emergency credit line guarantee scheme (ECLGS), which was a major driver of loan demand in the first phase of the pandemic, is seeing a tapering off in utilisation. As of July 2, an amount of Rs 2.7 lakh crore has been sanctioned under the scheme. Of this, Rs 2.1 lakh crore has been disbursed. The ECLGS aimed to provide collateral-free and government-guaranteed loans to mitigate the economic distress faced by micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and other entities due to the Covid-induced lockdowns. The government has extended the scope of the ECLGS from time to time through the introduction of ECLGS 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0, and it is valid till September 30, 2021. In the latest iteration of the scheme ECLGS 4.0, the overall government guarantee was increased from loans totalling Rs 3 lakh crore earlier to Rs 4.5 lakh crore. In a reply to a Parliament query on Tuesday, the government said that, as of July 2, guarantees have been issued for loans granted to around 1.1 crore MSMEs. According to bankers, borrowers eligible and in need of additional funds have already availed of the loans in the first two rounds. Borrowers do not want to be under a watchlist for stressed loans. “We have seen the number of applicants dropping with every new version of the scheme,” said a banker. With only two months more for the scheme, banks do not expect a big jump in demand for government-guaranteed loans. Some feel that there could be fresh borrowing if there is a spike in demand before the festival season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/demand-dips-for-loans-guaranteed-by-govt/articleshow/84599674.cms||---

---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Hamlets test chilli smoke method to keep tuskers away in Vizianagaram||VISAKHAPATNAM: With the rise in human-elephant conflict across Vizianagaram district, the forest department with the support of elephant expert Dr Rudraditya has started awareness programmes among villagers. The programme focuses on the use of chilli smoke to keep the jumbos away from human habitations bordering forest areas. With the support of the forest department, Dr Rudraditya, a veterinarian doctor from Himachal Pradesh, has visited over 20 villages between the Nagavalli River and Thotapalli Reservoir Project and demonstrated the cost-effective method in hamlets where elephant herds have destroyed the standing crop and killed residents in the past few years. The chilli smoke technique propagated by Dr Rudraditya involves burning dry red chilli with used engine oil in a gunny sack. The sack is tied to a stick and placed on the boundary of the farm. Rudraditya said the chilli fumes deter tuskers from entering the spot and they do not return to the same place for a period of time. The wild animals have a strong sense of smell and the chilli smoke can travel upto 500 to 1,000 meters. Most importantly, the method is low cost and can be used by the locals. Several farmers, who have borne the brunt of the the jumbo menace in the district, have said they will use the technique, he added. “We have visited Dhuggi, Gunaanapuram, Bitharapadu, Ankulavalasa, Panthulavalasa, Pelliguddi, Konavalasa and Dangabhadra villages in Komarada mandal. With the support of Dr Rudraditya, we have demonstrated the chilli smoke technique. It is one of the old methods to keep away jumbos from human habitation,” said M Murali Krishna, forest range officer. “We are hoping farmers will adopt the technique to solve the menace,” he added. Meanwhile, a herd of four elephants has been moving in Srikakulam district and a herd of six in Vizianagaram district. Among the ten, two are male, one is around 13 years another is 5-years-old. The elephants came to the Andhra Pradesh forest area from forests in neighbouring Odisha. Altogether, seven people have been killed in human-elephant conflict in Vizianagaram district in the past few years. Expressing displeasure over the loss of crops and lives due to the jumbo menace, activist K Samba Murthy said due to the scare of elephants, farmers have lost their crops in the farm fields. The district administration and ministers from Vizianagaram have failed to save lives and crops, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/hamlets-test-chilli-smoke-method-to-keep-tuskers-away/articleshow/84594562.cms||Nalla.Babu

The accused was identified as Yallanraju Venkata Ramanaiah, a native of Kundakuru village of Gudur mandal. According to deputy superintendent of police Rajagopal Reddy, Ramanaiah got married to Yallanraju Padma back in 2018 but their marriage took a quick turn towards domestic violence over dowry. Cops explained that Ramanaiah was demanding additional dowry from Padma’s parents and had tortured her not being able to have children. On March 30 this year, Ramanaiah, his father Venkata Subbaiah and brother-in-law Subramaniam strangulated Padma to death while she was sleeping. Padma was rushed to a hospital where the doctors pronounced her as brought dead. Later, the woman’s parents noticed injuries on her body and lodged a complaint with the Gudur police. Cops said that all three accused who were absconding were arrested at Kundakuru Cross Road on Monday. The rope used for the murder and the cellphone of the accused have been seized. All the three accused have been booked under sections 498a (dowry harassment) and 302 (murder) of IPC at Gudur police station.

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu eases income norm for OBC certificates||CHENNAI: Candidates applying for Other Backward Classes certificates in TN need not worry about creamy layer criteria as the state government has directed revenue officials and collectors to issue the certificate without insisting on income details. OBC certificates are required for candidates from backward communities to apply for admissions to central educational institutions and jobs. The July 5 order states that salary and agriculture income need not be taken into account while calculating annual income ceiling of Rs 8 lakh for parents of non-creamy layer category. The order, however, does not cover six categories, including people occupying constitutional posts and service and professional categories identified by the Centre in 1993. The move comes amid complaints about some officials raising objections while issuing OBC certificates citing income criteria. The communique was issued by A Karthik, BC, MBC & Minorities Welfare Department secretary. For instance, an applicant, whose parent earns an annual income of Rs 10 lakh that includes Rs 7 lakh through salary and agriculture income will still be eligible for OBC certificate as the Rs 3 lakh income through other sources alone will be calculated as the annual income. Even if an applicant’s income is Rs 25 lakh, so long as the income through sources other than salary and agriculture is under the Rs 8-lakh ceiling, they will still be eligible for OBC certificate. The secretary further said in the letter to district collectors and revenue administration department that it had been brought to the government’s notice that there were issues in giving OBC certificates, hampering benefits offered by the Union government under 27% reservation for OBCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-eases-income-norm-for-obc-certs/articleshow/84593947.cms||---

Speaker MB Rajesh said that the session will be convened for 20 days, in which four days will be set aside for private members’ business that includes private member bills and resolutions. One day each has been set apart for discussions on supplementary demands for grants for 2021-22 and finance appropriation bill. The speaker said that time will have to be earmarked for legislation, if there is any, and the business advisory committee will meet and make appropriate decisions. The session will conclude on August 18. With regard to the privileges of members (in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision on the assembly ruckus case being awaited), the speaker said privileges are given to members to discharge their duties and responsibilities without fear. He also cited how the then Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee refused to accept a notice from the Supreme Court when the matter regarding ouster of 11 MPs from the house was considered by the court, to point out that it is the discretion of the speaker to take a call on whatever has happened inside the house. The speaker also said that a proper inquiry is warranted with regard to the Pegasus snoop-gate scandal. “The Supreme Court had ruled earlier that phone tapping is the violation of the rights ensured to the citizens by the Constitution. The court had ruled that as per the Article 21, which includes the right to live, tapping the phone is a violation of rights. It is also a violation of Article 19 (1) (a) as well. Under these circumstances, tapping phones is unthinkable in a democracy. An inquiry should be conducted into these, and truth should come out,” Rajesh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/state-assembly-session-set-to-begin-tomorrow/articleshow/84598641.cms||---

He emerged as the first researcher to get a doctorate in astrophysics from the University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC) in the USA. But as they say ‘success doesn’t come overnight’, Bhardwaj’s application for research admission in astrophysics was turned down by many institutions due to his academic background in engineering, but not physics. Even at the UMKC, he was first offered a PhD seat in computer sciences. He was ambitious enough to convince the university authorities to bag a seat in his favourite astrophysics in 2014. Bhardwaj completed his schooling in Vijayawada and did his engineering from the Koneru Lakshmaiah Deemed to be University. Speaking to TOI, Mantha Kameswara Sarma, father of Bhardwaj who is working as an assistant executive engineer in APGenco, Sileru, said that Bhardwaj has now got a post-doctoral fellowship in the University of Minnesota. “As part of his work at UMKC, Bharadwaj conducted research on identifying colliding galaxies and measuring the rate which the galaxies collide. He developed new techniques to identify galaxy collision related signatures using the Hubble space telescope. He has shed light on some of the pressing questions on cosmic evolution. He is also trying to implement novel machine learning based algorithms in astronomy. He has bagged the astronomical achievement award from the American Astronomical Society in 2018, apart from several other awards. He has published several research articles in various international scientific journals,” said Sarma. Kameswari, mother of Bhardwaj who is currently working as an LIC employee in Vijayawada, said that Bhardwaj has been doing research on various aspects related to the growth and evolution of galaxies since 2014. “After engineering, he decided to become an astrophysicist. But he was rejected by many institutions as he does not possess a degree in physics. He self-taught undergraduate physics by watching online lectures. He also did an honor code certification from Cornell University in Relativity & Astrophysics in 2014,” said Kameswari. Sarma said that Bharadwaj wants to ignite interest among the Indian students about astrophysics after his return from the USA after completing his post-doctoral work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-student-gets-1st-doctorate-in-astrophysics-from-umkc/articleshow/84594738.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The devotees will have to offer prayers at home and only priests will be allowed to perform rituals in temples. Bihar State Religious Trust Board chairman Akhilesh Kumar Jain on Tuesday said following a direction issued by the state government, religious congregations like the devotees’ long walk to temples, traditionally known as ‘kanwar yatra’, will not be allowed this time. Earlier, devotees used to walk to temples to offer special prayers to Lord Shiva and participate in Shrawani Mela. Jain said the devotees would also not be allowed to fetch holy water from Ganga at Bhagalpur and Sultanpur. Important temples which used to attract large number of devotees with ‘kanwar’ in the state during the month of Shrawan were Garibnath Dham (Muzaffarpur), Kusheswar Sthan (Darbhanga), Harihar Nath Temple (Sonepur) and Bihta temple. According to Hindu traditions, Shrawan is the dearest month of Lord Shiva and that is why devotees hold special prayers in different temples. Since speculations of the third wave of Covid pandemic are gaining ground and the state government is taking all measures to strengthen health facilities from rural to urban areas, unregulated gatherings like ‘kanwar yatra’ and Shrawani Mela could increase the risk of spread of the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-kanwar-yatra-fairs-in-bihar-this-year/articleshow/84596019.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Business||Business leaders, HR executives differ on CXO quality||MUMBAI: A dichotomy has emerged between how leaders rate the quality of leadership within the organisation, and what HR professionals think of the same. This, even as current challenges place more demands on leaders. In its latest forecast study by global leadership firm DDI (along with The Josh Bersin Academy), 37% of HR professionals in India rate their leaders as ‘high quality’. The number has dropped consistently from 41% in 2014 to 38% in 2017-18. Ten years ago, this number was at the same level as in the current study, that is, 37%. On the other hand, 69% of leaders rate the quality of leadership at their organisation as high. This has grown from 54% in 2017-18. The study, which has been shared exclusively with TOI, states only 20% of HR professionals believe they have a strong bench strength to fill leadership roles. These statistics appear bleak because, since the pandemic, the pressures on leaders have only increased with more demands on them to be resilient, agile, and adaptable in a rapidly transforming workplace. And, in what could be a double-whammy, the study points out that 57% of leaders are looking at changing companies to advance in their career. DDI India’s MD Amogh Deshmukh told TOI the study clearly indicates a leadership crisis that is setting in owing to a growing disparity in what leaders want and what they are actually provided with. “Leaders have shown self-confidence that they are good at the ability of building a pipeline of leaders from within. What then explains the large number of lateral hiring that is taking place at CEO as well as CEO-minus-one levels? While leaders usually make bullish statements, HR is more realistic,” said Deshmukh. RPG Group president (HR) S Venkatesh said, “We (RPG) are one company with certainly a very high confidence in its existing leadership bench strength. It is also important to define what you mean by ‘bench’. I would include those who are at the cusp of leadership levels, but demonstrate great promise and potential. Companies should be willing to punt on these people. Otherwise you will always be staring at a numerically small pool.” Given the challenges posed by a protracted pandemic, what should organisations do to have a good leadership pipeline? “Pandemic or not, companies need to have a laser like focus on developing their leadership pipeline,” said Venkatesh. He highlighted some of the key ingredients for success as: (a) A strongly defined set of leadership capabilities that aligns with company’s vision, values, DNA and future plans; and (b) A belief in betting early on high potentials and top talent, that is, a calculated risk approach to promoting younger talent into leadership roles. Venkatesh said if a company believes in internal talent development and provides opportunities for its existing top talent as a priority, then strengthening the bench strength and leadership development are now more important than ever before. “This is RPG’s preferred approach also. Otherwise talent is available in the market and there is going to be greater fluidity in the coming days,” he said. Deutsche Bank India, MD, head - HR, Madhavi Lall, said, “We have a healthy pipeline of talent that we continuously develop, mentor and coach to be future leaders. Most of our leadership roles are filled internally and there is a rigorous succession, development and selection plan in place to enable this. The average tenure of our senior leaders is 15 years.” Although companies say the focus is on in-house leaders, Deshmukh pointed out that talent acquisition at leadership levels have picked up pace in the last three months. On assessment of talent across organisations, DDI found fewer leadership-ready talent. “It usually takes two-three years to develop talent for leadership roles. Not many organisations are investing in such development,” said Deshmukh. Investment in leadership talent may have got impacted during the pandemic. “Although people got promoted to leadership levels, not many of them got support in terms of training during the challenging period. Prior to the pandemic, there were several leadership development programmes, that may have now suffered a setback. While the pandemic would have had some influence on these numbers, the study reveals a consistent trend of a decline in quality of leaders within organisations,” said Deshmukh. Lack of leadership quality also remains an issue because of reduced average tenures since the last decade. “With a short-term vision, a new leader is busy launching new initiatives rather than strengthening the succession pipeline and building new leaders.

The Andhra Pradesh State Veterinary Students and Graduates Association (APSVSGA) has requested chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy to issue a notification for filling around 1,200 vacant veterinary assistant surgeon posts at rural livestock units (RLUs) across the state. Veterinary graduates on Tuesday submitted a memorandum to the director of the animal husbandry department and requested him to recruit qualified doctors at proposed disease diagnostic laboratories. “We have staged 45-day-long protests opposing appointment of unskilled technicians at RLUs. The then opposition leader and present CM Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy visited our camp at Dr NTR College of Veterinary Sciences, Gannavaram and assured that he will fill all vacant posts after he forms the government. We are eagerly waiting for that announcement,” said Dr BVS Sai Kiran, president of APSVSGA. In recent meetings, the chief minister has directed officials to rationalise the veterinary department, similar to the health department. He has also proposed animal ambulances and clinical labs. “We welcome this move. But we request the government to appoint qualified UG and PG doctors in these newly-created posts and existing vacancies,” Sai Kiran demanded. “Prompt disease diagnosis is an essential part of appropriate and treatment of animal diseases. Accurate diagnosis helps in management and prevention of diseases and curb unnecessary utilisation of resources that can go to waste due to poor or underdiagnosis of diseases. We heard authorities are trying to fill posts with existing unskilled staff. So we requested them to consider our request,” said Dr P Ramesh, general secretary of the association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vet-doctors-demand-filling-up-vacant-posts/articleshow/84594638.cms||Venu Lanka

The study found that sanitation rates were being levied without any scientific support and on the basis of area and not based on the quantum of waste generated. GCCI found that a car showroom pays higher sanitation fees as compared to a vehicle service centre, which generates more waste. GCCI submitted the study findings to CCP along with a draft proposal to revise the sanitation fees. “The draft proposal was presented to the CCP team followed by interactive sessions with CCP to ensure that it is a win–win proposition,” said GCCI president Ralph de Souza. Former GCCI president Manoj Caculo had initiated the process with CCP mayor Rohit Monserrate, municipal commissioner Agnelo Fernandes and the councillors. “CCP requested for a detailed, well-researched proposal for amendments as the mayor and his team were equally concerned about the problems and wanted to bring relief and revive the trade and business community, but preferred a professional approach,” Souza said. GCCI studied the sanitation fees being charged right from March 2016 till August 2020 along with 40 different types of commercial establishments. GCCI’s draft proposal along with the proposed revisions have been uploaded by CCP on its website for feedback till August 3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/study-on-sanitation-fees-waste-quantum-reveals-mismatch/articleshow/84598632.cms||---

The Pune city police conduct surveillance on different roads and junctions with the help of 1,340 CCTV cameras installed by the state home department. The cables of the CCTV cameras are underground and are connected to the control room at the Pune police commissionerate. Police said these cameras were used to keep an eye on the roads and to detect crimes occuring on the roads. These cameras were also used by the Pune city police’s traffic branch to catch the road traffic rule violators.The traffic police issue online challans to the traffic rules violators with the CCTV grabs. “The disconnection also causes a problem in taking action against traffic rule violators,” Shisve said. VG Kulkarni, head of the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) road department, said, “The PMC takes permissions from the police before carrying out any digging work. But, if any specific case of damage is reported to us, we can inform the contractor for urgent repairs.” The local police directly contact the work contractor, who is digging the road or footpath, and then the connection of the CCTV cameras are restored, a police officer said. “If the police are intimated about the exact location in advance, such disruptions can be averted,” a senior police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/around-30-cctv-cameras-become-non-functional-daily/articleshow/84598637.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Online posts fuel nightlong arson, rioting in Rajasthan district||KOTA: Tension gripped Gangdhaar town of Jhalawar district on Monday night following a minor spat between youths of two communities. The spat turned violent resulting into arson, loot and stone-pelting in the night following a provocative misleading message that went viral on social media. In view of the situation, the internet services were suspended in Gangdhaar, Pedawa and Bhawani Mandi areas of the district for next 24 hours from 12am on July 20 to 12am on July 21. The police have registered separate cases of provoking group sentiments, arson, loot, damaging government property against 150-200 persons, including 25-30 identified and detained 35 persons of a group, while arresting three others of one of the groups. A scuffle between the two groups had occurred at a wooden stock (Aari, Taal) Monday noon, however the two groups resolved the matter through mutual agreement immediately but provocative messages stating that people from one of the communities were being attacked and thrashed in Gangdhar calling upon them to assemble at the spot went viral on WhatsApp groups in the evening on Monday, Jhalawar S P Kiran Kang Siddhu said. Acting on the social message, the police immediately arrested three youths from one of the groups, who invited scuffle, she said adding at the same time, Laxman Singh of the other group leading mob of 100-150 people reached Gandhar police station demanding to arrest the accused. The mob was not satisfied with the arrest of the three accused and they violently moved to light fire at the wooden stock (Aari, Lakdi ki Taal), the place where the scuffle had occurred in the town, she added. When the police tried to stop the mob, they went violent and stone-pelting started from both the sides, she said adding Laxman Singh himself and two cops sustained injuries in the stone-pelting. The mob burnt the wooden stock (Aari), 2-3 cabins on the roadside and also set a few vehicles on fire while damaging government property, she added. The situation further worsened later when someone spread the rumour that Laxman Singh, who was sent to hospital following injuries, had sustained bullet injuries in the firing and the mob went uncontrolled for a while, however, the situation was immediately controlled in the night, SP Kiran Kang Siddhu, camping in the town since Monday night, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tension-grips-jhalawar-town-after-spat-between-2-groups/articleshow/84600526.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||'Preserve the old to make hi-tech Hyd most livable city’||Fix city’s weak pockets To begin with, Hyderabad needs to start scientifically enumerating its weak zones that fall behind in education, community health services, drinking water, waste-water management, and sanitation services. These pockets then need to be improved. Also, garbage collection and waste disposal must be streamlined, and community healthcare workers recruited en masse. A screening of every government school, to make affordable education available to all ensure a healthy pupil-teacher ratio, is the need of the hour. Digital literacy, digital governance with online grievance redressal management over a SMS call needs implementation. Streetlights with LED must be a part of every lane. Every household needs to have a metered water supply connection with payment options available at the click of a button on consumers’ mobile phones. The government must offer single window clearance to green buildings and plan flyovers and multi-rails to tackle traffic congestion in IT bound pockets of the city. Such measures can make Hyderabad the most livable in India. -- Shashi Prakash Singh Clear roads, overhead wires Removing encroachments from footpaths/roads, to smoothen vehicular movement and arrest pollution, should be our priority. Going forward, GHMC must give building permission only to projects leaving proportionate space for green cover. For already built houses, horizontal and vertical gardening must be made compulsory, and penalties imposed on defaulters. All diesel cargo autos and all other vehicles that are more than 20-years-old must be banned along with the practice of haphazardly putting up banners/boards/flexis. All overhead wires dangling along Hyderabad’s roads – and at times even posing a threat to the safety of people – must be removed soon. And so do debris that have been lying on the roads unattended. Finally, all commercial establishments/educational institutions being run in residential areas should be removed. -- Kanchiraju Kasinath Improve traffic system To enhance the already pleasant living conditions of Hyderabad would mean focusing on logistics – like development of roads and better traffic sense. At present, it is quite chaotic on both fronts, as far as Hyderabad is concerned. Road maintenance should be a priority with discipline and not procrastination. Traffic sense like adhering to the signals, pillion riding, avoiding unnecessary honking etc adds not only value but quality to a city. True, we are pedestrians when on the road but should not be one in our thoughts, for better living. Allow the landmarks like Golconda, Charminar, Hussainsagar Lake, et al to be the city’s centres of attraction for years to come. -- Anand Menon Restore old Hyderabad Hyderabad, as I see it, is already one of the best cities to live in given its low crime rate, low pollution levels etc. But we all know that somewhere, something is always missing in a city, and something can always be improved. I believe, to give Hyderabad an extra edge over the other cities, we need to make the older region of Hyderabad better – for instance, renovate the Charminar and properly organize the shops surrounding it. I also think that the metro should be spread to the entire city so that people living in the outskirts can also access it. We should promote our assets, which attract not just locals but people from across India, so as to give an impetus to our tourism sector and improve our earnings from that industry. These are a few of my suggestions which might give Hyderabad an edge over others. -- Ayana Gopal Segregate, reuse waste Our traffic signal management needs to be revamped as does our garbage segregation system. Right now, both are falling short of our expectations. While the first can help with addressing congestion and saving fuel, the second --- if we diligently keep wet and dry waste separate -- can help in converting waste into biogas or compost that can be sold to people at a minimum price. Further, authorities must strictly impose the mandatory rainwater harvesting pit rule and ensure every house has one. If not, the government must deny permission for water supply to that complex. Our electricity board must be made more hi-tech so that unscheduled power cuts can be weeded out and our government schools and hospitals given a makeover to ensure they function properly, and these basic amenities (of good quality) are available to every common citizen. -- K AjayMake bachelors feel welcome Although Hyderabad is a nice city to live in, it has its own share of problems. On rainy days, the city becomes a pool, and it becomes extremely difficult to travel. At times, the poor transportation system gets on your nerves. The traffic is a common sight in busy areas such as Panjagutta. Worse, bachelors face enormous difficulty in finding a place here to stay and they have to often resort to hostels. If these minor problems are fixed, Hyderabad will one of the best cities in India. -- Nishtha Raghuwanshi Get more professional While Hyderabad is a great city to live in, what it needs to get better is a shift in attitude – be more professional to begin with. While we are traditionally known for our tehzeeb, both residents and officials must now work on delivering on their commitments. If that happens, the living standards of Hyderabad will improve by leap and bounds. A shift in attitude is also necessary in the education sector. While there is no dearth of good schools and colleges there are many institutions that are exploiting gullible parents and attracting exorbitantly high fees for their services. This must not be the case as education is a basic right of every individual. If these can be fixed, there can be no stopping Hyderabad from becoming the number one city. -- B Kumar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/preserve-the-old-to-make-hi-tech-hyd-most-livable-city/articleshow/84602047.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Recovering after two waves, is this the lull before another storm?||By: Dr Hemant Thacker We are midway 2021 but Covid-19 continues to haunt us. An RNA virus, sprung out of who knows where, astutely mutating has continued to baffle, fool and repeatedly re-engage with science, doctors and of course the targets. The world has already seen two very horrible waves and India in specific was crippled, criminalised and then barricaded by the second deadly wave. The US, where last month, I, first hand happened to see the new freedom, post-successful sizeable vaccination, has again started reporting a tad but definitive rise in numbers. Britain, which is on the verge of reopening with the unmasked Wimbledon, has recently reported more than 50,000 cases. Japan and the Olympic Village are also under the throes of another wave. Which brings me home to our difficult but seemingly tangible situation. After the anguished April and mauled May, the strict lockdown coupled with enforced measures and probable increase in the number of vaccinations, we saw June changing the tune. Our numbers, especially in the threatened metros of Mumbai, Delhi and the South, except Kerala, have dwindled to manageable levels. The number of jumbo centres, Covid wards and ICU beds have all been downgraded and are relatively empty. The smile has returned on the medical and paramedical staff and one can sense the relief that has returned in the demeanour of the frontline workers. There are instances of fully vaccinated individuals testing positive with mild symptoms, but none of them have had serious issues. The unpredictable behaviour of the Delta variant has still not allowed the equation to change. Is this the taming of the shrew? Or is it the lull before the storm? Swing the camera to the other fact of reality. Hill stations are overflowing, flights are packed to full capacity, social functions and markets are going about their work as if Covid is history. Congregations of people, whether for political, religious or even demonstration reasons, are often flouting laws with gay abandon. Covid-appropriate behaviour, namely masking and distancing, seems to have taken a backseat. In the next three months we can wrest the wheel of fortune in our favour. The WHO has predicted it, the paediatric population has been outlined as the next target, and everyone is anticipating the next wave. From the clinician’s perspective, vaccination is still the most important feature followed by appropriate masking (not chinning or only dangling) and definitely social distancing. The virus needs new targets to multiply and if it does not find one, it automatically dies. So, the jump of the virus from person to person can be interrupted by distancing, filtered by masking and tamed by vaccination. Administratively, one has to invoke a criminal law to discourage Covid-inappropriate behaviour which is continuously increasing. The Indian Academy of Paediatricians and others have predicted that more and more children could get infected mainly asymptomatically or mildly with less chances of serious disease. Having said this, the theme of every community should be to dwindle the ‘pandemic’ to ‘epidemic’ proportions and finally allow it to become ‘endemic’, whereby we learn to live with the virus and adapt to its behaviour. Like man has adapted to the influenza virus, we will have to endeavour to develop herd immunity. In the interim if we let our guard down, then the third wave is a surety. Remember a caged and then mutated virus, strikes with double vengeance. If we are to finally win we have to wield the willow correctly otherwise there is no “Nyay” against Covid.

According to the local residents, the issue of drainage overflow was persisting for several days before the officials took stock of the matter recently. “The sewage overflowing right in front of some of the houses in the colony was causing severe inconvenience to commuters. The situation gets worse during rains because the entire street gets flooded, and people riding two-wheelers skid and suffer injuries. Thanks to the civic authorities for promptly addressing the leakage in a timely manner after it was brought to their notice just a few days ago,” said Syed Shamshuddin, the citizen reporter who highlighted the issue. Residents said that the mosquito menace in the area has reduced significantly after the sewage problem was fixed by the concerned departments. “Earlier, there was a bad smell and increase in mosquito breeding in the area. We were not even able to keep a single window of the house open the entire day because there was always a risk of getting infected by seasonal disease. We are thankful that the problem has been resolved now,” said P Karthikeyan, a resident of Asif Nagar. Meanwhile, the GHMC mayor Gadwal Vijayalakshmi who has been inspecting the sanitation works across the city directed the GHMC officials to resolve the issue of garbage dumping and open drains. On the other hand, the HMWSSB officials have also taken up a series of safety measures amid the monsoon. In a meeting held recently, the water board officials were instructed by HMWSSB managing director Dana Kishore that issues pertaining to sewage overflow and contaminated draining water should be fixed on war footing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/asif-nagar-residents-get-a-breather-from-sewage-woes/articleshow/84602050.cms||---
---||Goa||My injury was nothing, people have seen worse: Jhingan||Panaji: The thought of surgery, months without football and an uncertain future can be scary for most footballers in the prime of their careers. Not Sandesh Jhingan; he’s certainly cut from a different cloth. The ATK Mohun Bagan defender picked up an ACL injury during a national team friendly in Guwahati and spent more than a year on the sidelines. When he returned to competitive football – after 13 months – he was better than anyone else. If proof was ever needed, it was provided by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) who adjudged Jhingan as the Footballer of the Year. “Whenever obstacles come, there are two options,” Jhingan said on Wednesday. “You either throw in the towel or keep going and come back stronger.” Jhingan is strongest at the moment. He is India’s best footballer, among the three national captains – Sunil Chhetri and Gurpreet Singh Sandhu being the others – and Igor Stimac’s most trusted man in defence. In October 2019 when he was injured, it wasn’t like this. “At the hospital in Guwahati when the doctor came in, he asked when is the season starting. I said ‘in a week’. He told me to give it up. Your ACL is gone, he said. I was shocked,” recalled Jhingan. Jhingan could no longer play for either his club, Kerala Blasters, or country for the rest of the season. He would have to undergo surgery and rehab. Yet that shock lasted, in his own words, “for two seconds.” “My injury was nothing. There are people who don’t know how they will get their next meal. In India, we see kids sleeping on the roads. There are kids who one year ago were playing football and now they are half paralysed. There are people with family members in hospital, fighting for their life,” said Jhingan. One particular kid left a lasting impression on the India defender. It happened in Kerala when he was undergoing rehab, with physiotherapist Gigi George by his side. A man, probably in his late forties, walked up to Jhingan and said someone wanted to see him. He was in the next room. “When I went, there was a boy who was paralysed. He couldn’t move on his own. One or two years ago, he was a healthy kid, playing football,” said Jhingan. Jhingan continued his rehab and was back to his best fitness in March 2020. He was set to make his return with the national team, but the Covid-19 pandemic brought sporting activities across the world to a halt. The wait got a lot longer. “I remember on my last birthday, I woke up as usual at 3.45am and started my first session at four (in the morning). I was so hungry to get back. But those days, everything had come to a stop. I couldn’t stop. I kept believing in the dream that I have,” he said. Jhingan’s dream as a 12-year-old was to become India’s best. On Tuesday, his 28th birthday, he woke up to news that he was India’s Footballer of the Year. “Sapna jaisa lagta hai (feels like a dream),” said Jhingan. “I’m just a kid from Chandigarh who dreamt of something like this when I was 12, 13, 14. You want to be the best in the country. When you finally achieve it, you are just happy and proud.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/my-injury-was-nothing-people-have-seen-worse-jhingan/articleshow/84622840.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||India||India may be first to get DNA vax for Covid: Mansukh Mandaviya||NEW DELHI: After a politically charged discussion on the Covid-19 situation in the Rajya Sabha, new health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said that vaccine supplies were improving and goals will be met even as he reiterated that the government is very clear that there should be no politics in the ongoing crisis. Assuaging fears over inadequate vaccine supplies to meet demand, Mandaviya said companies manufacturing the vaccines indigenously are increasing their production and the country may become the first in the world to develop a DNA-based vaccine. He said a third wave can be averted through “bhagidari” between the Centre and the states. He said technology transfer to several companies has started and they will begin production in coming days to reduce vaccine shortfalls in the country. He shared that Serum Institute of India is in a position to provide 11 to 12 crore doses of Covishield a month and Bharat Biotech will be providing 2.5 crore doses in July and 3.5 crore in August. He also said Zydus Cadila has completed the third phase trial and has applied for emergency use authorisation to the Drugs Controller General of India. If production starts, it may become the first DNA vaccine developed by Indian scientists. The minister said it is not appropriate to say the third wave will hit children more citing experience based on data from the first and second waves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-may-be-first-to-get-dna-vax-for-covid-mandaviya/articleshow/84602347.cms||---

While his right leg is paralysed, Ashraf says that is no deterrent and he is determined to complete his journey. Ashraf hit the road on July 15 from his hometown Thrissur in Kerala, and reached Bengaluru on Monday evening. Ashraf said he worked as a computer engineer in Dubai years ago before losing his job. “In 2017, I met with a bike accident. It took nine surgeries and years in hospital to recover.” Ashraf took to cycling in April last year to beat depression. He soon fell in love with it and the mountains even though he could pedal only with his left leg and a few fingers of his right hand had sensation. His aim is to reach Khardung La, one of the highest motorable passes in the world at an altitude of 17,582 feet. Ashraf said after his accident, he realised he could either spend his life in bed or fight it out. “It is all in the mind and I decided to spread the word, ‘Nothing is impossible’.” Crossing 10 states, Ashraf plans to cycle 100-150km a day. “I have a foldable tent and a sleeping bag for night stay at petrol pumps. The only difficulty might be in finding restrooms with western commodes as I can’t squat in Indian toilets,” he said. Asked why he doesn’t opt for a prosthetic leg, the avid cyclist said, “I have exhausted family savings in my three years of hospitalisation and once I’m back after this expedition, I will raise money for my surgeries and prosthetic leg.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cyclist-beats-disability-aims-for-khardung-la/articleshow/84598701.cms||Kiran Parashar
---||Salem||Tamil Nadu’s model town scheme to take land pooling route||CHENNAI: With the DMK government looking at future satellite towns as integrated growth centres, the state is likely to explore land pooling scheme, which involves property owners as stakeholders instead of outright acquisition. The move will facilitate returning a portion of the developed properties in new satellite towns to the stakeholders. Model towns have been planned on 800 acres of Agaramthen village near Tambaram in Chennai’s southern suburbs. The government plans to establish model satellite towns at Coimbatore, Trichy and Tirunelveli as well. While Agaramthen could become the first project to be taken up under the land pooling scheme, the draft rules for the land pooling policy have not yet been notified though they were released last year. Official sources say landowners who offer their land for the project will be made part of the project and they would get back a portion of their land as developed properties within the township. “It could be in a ratio of at least 50% of the land given by the landlords,” a housing and urban development department official said. Also, outright acquisition of lands is no more a viable option as it entails payment of 2.5 times the market value of the land as compensation. Moreover, several land parcels acquired for satellite town and housing plot projects in the past, including the one at Thirumazhisai, are mired in litigation though they were acquired decades ago. Real estate sector experts say the land pooling scheme operates on the concept of joint venture for housing projects. Builders Association of India state secretary S Ramaprabhu said, “When a satellite town is developed by the government agencies, it will have a rippling effect in the neighbourhood, boosting the prospects of urban development.” The draft rules must be notified at the earliest, he added. In 2018, the Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act, 1971, was amended to launch the land pooling scheme to acquire land for housing and other infrastructure projects. It was followed by draft rules for the scheme that aims at enhancing public participation was released in February 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/tns-model-town-scheme-to-take-land-pooling-route/articleshow/84604835.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss

The squad will also catch eve-teasers and detain them on the spot. Additional commissioner, law and order, Rahul Prakash said that the Jaipur police has begun ‘operation safer wheels,” for women commuters who rely on public transportation to travel within the city and out of Jaipur. “The members of Nirbhaya squad in civil dress would travel in buses and metros to get a first-hand experience of how comfortable women passengers feel while traveling. Two other cops equipped with wireless sets and posing as passengers would also be present. If they find that someone is troubling women, they will detain him and alert the control room,” Prakash said. Similarly, other members of the squad will travel with body-worn cameras to instil a sense of security amongst women commuters. “We will also identify specific routes, bus, etc where women passengers feel a sense discomfort. This will help us to devise a special strategy for specific hot spots,” Rahul Prakash said. The decoy operations will be held across multiple places inside city buses, inter-district buses, metros, etc. “The Nirbhaya squad is present across the city to safeguard women and girls who go to college and work. We thought it was equally important to assess the situation of public transports because a lot of women travel every day within Jaipur and outside the city,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nirbhaya-squad-to-catch-eve-teasers-in-city-buses/articleshow/84600583.cms||---

The move will facilitate returning a portion of the developed properties in new satellite towns to the stakeholders. Model towns have been planned on 800 acres of Agaramthen village near Tambaram in Chennai’s southern suburbs. The government plans to establish model satellite towns at Coimbatore, Trichy and Tirunelveli as well. While Agaramthen could become the first project to be taken up under the land pooling scheme, the draft rules for the land pooling policy have not yet been notified though they were released last year. Official sources say landowners who offer their land for the project will be made part of the project and they would get back a portion of their land as developed properties within the township. “It could be in a ratio of at least 50% of the land given by the landlords,” a housing and urban development department official said. Also, outright acquisition of lands is no more a viable option as it entails payment of 2.5 times the market value of the land as compensation. Moreover, several land parcels acquired for satellite town and housing plot projects in the past, including the one at Thirumazhisai, are mired in litigation though they were acquired decades ago.

---||Jodhpur||Rajasthan: Cracks appear in BJP during national general secretary’s visit||JODHPUR: BJP continues to remain divided around former chief minister Vasundhara Raje and state BJP president Satish Poonia. This division was affirmed in Jodhpur also during two-day visit of national general secretary C T Ravi. This all started unfolding with the installation of posters to welcome Ravi in Jodhpur, where the first series of posters had picture of Raje with complete omission of Poonia. When these posters started creating furore in the party, these posters were first changed to have a picture of Poonia in inset with other leaders including Raje and finally in the last change, he was given a prominent place in the posters with national president J P Nadda. City party president Devendra Joshi, however, rubbished this goof up as purely unintentional and attributed it to a printing mistake. While the party unit of city had just heaved a sigh of relief after tiding over this crisis, city saw fresh series of posters on Monday bearing the picture of Raje only in prominence with a picture of Ravi on the other side. Installed on the entire route from the airport to the circuit house, these posters also had also pictures of prime minister Narendra Modi, president JP Nadda and Rajasthan incharge Arun Singh on top but in small sizes. But the source of these posters and credit therein were absolutely missing making it a suspicious case that who installed these posters. Joshi also claimed that these posters were not installed by the city unit or party organization and had no idea about the source of these posters. The first set of posters, however, had been installed by the city unit of party organization but they also began with neglecting of Poonia and intended to affirm the importance of Raje over him. Division Media Incharge of BJP Jagdihs Dhanadia, however, asserted that Raje was given place as National vice president and Poonia’s picture was omitted by mistake. “Later we kept Raje as it is and gave befitting space to Pooniaji beside National President Naddaji”, said Dhanadia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/cracks-appear-in-bjp-during-gen-secys-visit/articleshow/84600598.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Mission Brahmin: BSP chief Mayawati for legal war to free widow of don aide||AYODHYA: Mayawati’s ‘Mission Brahmin’ in the run-up to assembly elections will roll out with the party taking up the legal battle to secure bail for the 17-year-old widow of slain Brahmin gangster Vikas Dubey’s nephew, Amar, who too was shot in an encounter after the Bikru massacre. BSP’s Brahmin face and senior lawyer, Satish Mishra, will seek the release of Amar’s wife, Khushi Dubey, a minor, currently lodged at a juvenile centre in Barabanki for a year, former BSP minister, Nakul Dubey, told TOI. He’s playing an active role in the July 23 Brahmin conclave in Ayodhya. For decades, slain don Vikas Dubey held sway over vast swathes of Brahmin-dominated villages straddling Unnao to Kanpur Dehat. After Khushi was booked under stringent IPC sections, including murder and criminal conspiracy, her family had claimed in an affidavit before a special court in Kanpur Dehat that she should be treated as a juvenile. Her lawyer too had pleaded that since she was married to Amar, just three days before the Bikru bloodbath, she had no role in the conspiracy, but Khushi has so far been denied bail. She has been in prison since July 8, when her husband, Amar, a sharpshooter of gangster Vikas Dubey, was shot by UP STF in an encounter in Hamirpur. Talking to TOI, her counsel, Shivakant Dixit, said, “Despite the Juvenile Justice Board’s confirmation that she’s a minor, she has not got bail. I welcome the move by BSP leadership to fight her case.” Addressing the BSP cadre, Nakul Dubey, who was in Ayodhya to finalize the contours of the Brahmin sammelan on July 23, said, senior lawyer and BSP general secretary Satish Mishra would fight her case and seek her release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mission-brahmin-bsp-for-legal-war-to-free-widow-of-don-aide/articleshow/84600613.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

This is enough to meet the city’s needs for a month. The collective storage in the four dams in Khadakwasla circle reached 11 TMC on Tuesday morning, with stock in Panshet and Khadakwasla increasing to 45%. Temghar received over 140mm of rainfall, while Panshet and Varasgaon recorded 120mm each in the 48 hours that ended on Tuesday morning. The stock in Bhama Askhed increased to 45%, while the live storage of Pavana dam, which supplies water to Pimpri Chinchwad, is at 40%. On Sunday, the collective stock in the four dams in Khadakwasla irrigation circle had stood at 9.7 TMC. It increased to 10.1 TMC on Monday and to 11 TMC on Tuesday morning — an increase of nearly one TMC in 24 hours. State irrigation department officials said most dams in the Bhima basin have recorded good spells of rain in the past two days, which has led to an increase in water stock. “Seven dams recorded more than 50mm of rainfall each in the 24 hours ending on Tuesday morning. Vadivale dam received over 91mm of rainfall, which was the highest among the 25 major dams in Bhima basin. Pavana recorded 60mm, while Mulshi received 81mm,” an official said. The collective stock of 11 TMC in the four dams in the Khadakwasla circle was almost 1.5 TMC higher than the total stock on this day last year. The irrigation department official said the collective live water storage of the four dams was at 29.15 TMC. If the catchments continue to receive good spells of rain, the dams are likely to be filled to capacity by the middle of August. “We have told the officials at the dams to keep a close watch on the water levels,” the official added. Meanwhile, cloudy conditions prevailed over the city on Tuesday. The India Meteorological Department has forecast heavy rainfall at isolated spots in the ghat areas in the next two days. Rainfall is expected at most places in central Maharashtra and Marathwada.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/heavy-rain-ensures-dams-get-a-months-quota-in-just-two-days/articleshow/84598730.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: DEO orders closure of Delhi Public School East||AHMEDABAD: The district education officer (DEO) on Tuesday ordered the closure of Delhi Public School (DPS) East, Hirapur, after receiving complaints that the school was illegally admitting students for the academic year 2021-22. A team of officials visited the school on Tuesday to investigate the matter and ordered its immediate shutdown as the school did not have the no-objection certificate (NOC) from the state education department. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to which it was seeking affiliation had set March 31 deadline to produce the Gujarat government’s NoC.  Last month, the school authorities had approached the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) for the nod for admitting students of secondary and higher secondary classes from June 21. But their application for affiliation and recognition to start a non-grant-in-aid school was rejected. The operations of DPS East were taken over by the state government in December 2019. The takeover happened because the school had landed in a controversy in connection with an ashram run by the self-styled godman Nithyananda, located on the school premises. The directorate of primary education (DPE), Gujarat government, had in October last year slapped a fine of Rs 50 lakh on DPS East and ordered the school to shut down after the end of the academic year 2020-21. The school was functioning without a proper no-objection certificate from the state government between 2008 and 2011, according to the DPE. The school authorities had allegedly forged NoC documents of the state government to get affiliation from the CBSE. The CBSE had in 2019 decided to cancel the affiliation. However, the government intervened and decided to take over the operations of the school till March 31 so that students did not suffer in the middle of their academic year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/deo-orders-closure-of-dps-east/articleshow/84598710.cms||---

Justice PB Suresh Kumar raised the criticism while considering a petition filed by doctor Wills Janardhanan, who had sought permission from the government to collect discarded blood samples of fever patients for developing the diagnostic kit to distinguish tiger moth disease from infectious viral fevers. The petitioner is a scientist who is working as project coordinator of SIDBI innovation and incubation centre at Indian Institute of Technology at Kanpur. Responding to government’s plea for time to respond to the petition, the court said if someone is doing innovative research, it should not be opposed and innovative research should be allowed. The court asked the government to take a decision soon and inform it on Monday. It was alleged by the petitioner that he approached the high court after his repeated attempts to obtain permission from the government failed to yield results. High incidence of fever epidemics in the state is linked to massive outbreaks of tiger moth adult population during monsoon, the petition had stated while mentioning a study conducted between 2009 and 2012. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-slams-govts-opposition-to-novel-research/articleshow/84598761.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Miscreants shoot at head constable, rob inspector’s car in Sikar district||JAIPUR: Unidentified criminals fired at a head constable of Jaipur police’s special team before robbing an inspector’s car at a highway dhaba (eatery) in Ranoli area of Sikar district Tuesday early hours. Head constable Manendra Singh is undergoing treatment at the SMS Hospital in Jaipur. He sustained firearms injuries on his abdomen. According to the deputy commissioner of police, (West), Pradeep Mohan Sharma, Singh’s condition is stable but a bullet was still lodged in his body. Singh is posted at the district special team (DST) of Jaipur police, he was accompanying his senior and DST in-charge, Narendra Khichar, in a Verna car. According to Sharma, Khichar and Singh had gone to Sikar in search of a fugitive as part of an ongoing Rajasthan police’s statewide hunt to catch old outlaws. They had stopped at a Dhaba for a quick supper when one of the accused asked Singh to hand over the car keys, “Singh refused to give keys and tried to stop them from entering the car, one of the accused fired at him (Singh),” Sharma said. Inspector Khichar rushed to help Singh who was bleeding profusely, the accused had already fled in Khichar’s Verna car. Superintendent of police, Sikar, Kunwar Rashtradeepm said that prima facie it appears that the two accused did not know that Singh was a cop because both Singh and Khichar were in plain clothes. According to Sikar police, the incident took place shortly after 1.45 am on Tuesday when after eating at the Dhaba, Khichar had gone to the washroom while Singh was stepping out of the place and heading to the car when two accused confronted Singh. The accused tried to forcefully snatch keys from Singh, but he confronted them and rushed to the driving seat to stop the accused from opening the car’s gate. One of the accused fired at Singh from behind, hearing gunshots, Khichar rushed to the spot but the two accused had already fled in the car. “Singh was injured and ferried to a nearby local hospital. He was later transferred to Jaipur for specialized treatment. He is responding well to the treatment,” Sharma said. Sources in the city police told TOI that Khichar’s car was last spotted at a toll booth near Churu district. The officials claimed that DST did not seek the local police’s support as it risked the information being leaked. “The DSP team usually does not call for local support. Especially, when they are searching for a fugitive who has been evading warrants for a long time,” an official said. The sources added that DST teams usually get police vehicles for operations within the district, but for traveling to a different city, they usually prefer to take other vehicles, sometimes their own, because authorization takes time and also involves the risk of confidential information leaking out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/miscreants-shoot-at-head-constable-rob-inspectors-car-in-sikar-district/articleshow/84600614.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Raj Kundra sold porn app to mislead investigators, says cops||MUMBAI: To mislead investigating agencies, businessman Ripu Sudan Balkrishna Kundra alias Raj Kundra (45), arrested late Monday evening for production of pornographic films, sold his app ‘Hotshots’ to UK-based company Kenrin Pvt Ltd owned by his brother-in-law Pradeep Bakshi but controlled activities from Mumbai, police said on Tuesday. Raj Kundra, husband of actor Shilpa Shetty, and his IT head Ryan Thorpe, arrested by the crime branch, were produced before the 37th metropolitan magistrate on Tuesday and remanded in custody till July 23. Police had already arrested nine people earlier in the case. Kundra was involved in the streaming of pornographic videos through the ‘Hotshots’ app, police said. ‘Hotshots’ has now been removed from mobile platforms, and both Apple and Google have removed it due to its pornographic content. Kundra supplied the content and controlled the UK company from his Viaan Industries office. Kundra’s IT head Ryan Thorpe used to look after the app’s functioning, including financial transactions, police said. Kundra said that in 2019, he sold ‘Hotshots’ for 25,000 US dollars and formed another company, Arms Prime Media. Police said they found proof, including clips from Kundra’s office. His lawyers Abad Ponda and Subhash Jadhav alleged the arrests were illegal as police did not follow procedures under the Criminal Procedure Code. Police claimed they arrested Kundra after they gathered sufficient digital and material evidence to show his and his company Viaan Industries’ role in streaming of pornographic clips on various apps. Police, who carried out a search of Kundra’s JLM Stream office at Veera Desai Road, Andheri, claimed to have found documents indicating his role. “In the ongoing investigations, after taking the court’s permission, our teams carried out searches of his office and residence. We found agreements, emails, WhatsApp chats and pornographic material,” said Milind Bharambe, joint commissioner of police (crime). “Kundra had formed WhatsApp groups under the name ‘HS TAKE DOWN,’ ‘HS ACCOUNT’ and ‘HS OPERATION’ and he himself was the admin, where they discussed revenue generated on porn content. There are lots of transactions in various accounts in the name of Viaan Industries. We suspect Kundra’s company has received huge finances from foreign shores, which are proceeds of crime. Till now we have frozen several bank accounts of the accused in which we have found Rs 7.5 crore,” an officer said. But Kamat told police Kenrin belongs to Pradeep Bakshi, Kundra’s brother-in-law. Police said though Bakshi’s company Kenrin owned the ‘Hotshots’ app, Kundra controlled it from his Viaan Industries office. Investigating officer Kiran Biduo told court that Kundra’s involvement came to light after the arrest of Gahna Vashist, who named the businessman’s former personal assistant Umesh Kamat. Kamat revealed Kundra's involvement and said Kundra had appointed him as coordinator and used to look after the ‘Hotshots’ app. In February, the property cell of the crime branch raided a bungalow in Madh Island and busted a porn film racket and rescued a woman. Police arrested five persons, namely Yasmin Rowa Khan, Pratibha Nalawade, Monu Gopaldas Joshi, Bhanusuryam Thakur and Mohammed Asif alias Saify under IPC sections of cheating, outraging modesty and indulging in obscene act in public places and under the IT Act for publicly exhibiting or circulating obscene books or literature. The gang’s modus operandi was to lure models promising them a break in web series and short films. They forced them to do “bold scenes” despite their objections, police said. Kundra’s name had also surfaced in investigations by state cyber police. In November last year, police had registered an FIR against 14 OTT platforms for showing pornographic content.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-raj-kundra-sold-porn-app-to-mislead-investigators-says-cops/articleshow/84598756.cms||Ahmed Ali

The two-time MLA, who enjoyed ministerial rank in the Akhilesh Yadav-led SP government, not only donated money, but also mobilised funds for rebuilding the temple. He also restored the idols in the sanctum sanctorum. Samajwadi Party’s Muslim face in the Awadh region, Rushdi Miyan, participated in the temple’s foundation-laying ceremony, which was in accordance with Vedic rituals amidst chanting of hymns by Brahmin priests. While winning praise for his effort to establish Hindu-Muslim unity, he told TOI that Hindu community of Muzaffara village had for long desired the reconstruction of the dilapidated Kali temple. “Due to lack of funds the project never took off. When I came to know about the decaying shrine, I decided to rebuild the structure and restore the idols. Villagers welcomed my move and personally asked me to lay the foundation,” said Rushdi Miyan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/muslim-ex-mla-mobilises-funds-to-rebuild-kali-temple/articleshow/84600648.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

At present, although taking licence from municipal corporation is necessary, but no dog breed has been banned or any rules have been formed to prevent owners from keeping them as pets.Pitbull, Rottweilers, Doberman are considered to be dangerous breeds who can even attack the owners. In a few states, there has been a ban imposed on the keeping such dogs as pet but not in Jaipur. With such cases increasing, there is now a demand for making a law regarding it. Sheel Dhabai, mayor of JMC-Greater said that she has been proactive in spreading awareness regarding the registration of dogs. “Since, I have become mayor my agenda was to increase the number of dog registrations. We have ordered all the commissioners and officials to keep a tab on such breeds. We are considering about changing the laws especially, for keeping such dangerous breeds in the city.”Similar views were put by JMC-Heritage mayor Munesh Gurjar, who said that already orders have been issued to all DC for checking if there are any such breeds kept in houses and take action if owners haven’t registered them. She said that they are considering making laws regarding such breeds.JMC, board can bring changes in the act to prevent people from keeping such pets especially living in flats. Moreover, there are many dog fights being organized in Haryana and Punjab including Ganganagar and Hanumangarh districts of Rajasthan. These dog-fights are illegal for which ferocious dogs are trained.Virendra Bahrdhwaj, secretary of Kennel Club of Rajasthan said, “In small flats people prefer toy breeds like beagle, pugs but some first-time pet owners do purchase such dangerous breeds for show-off. Many people train them for dog-fights in Ganganagar and Hanumangarh as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/officials-told-to-keep-tabs-on-dangerous-dog-breeds-dhabai/articleshow/84600643.cms||---

Rather, it should be utilised for public.The banner of the samiti read ‘Mai Central Park, Mujhe Central Park he rahene do’. People from all walks of life including regular morning walkers, environmentalists, and residents who are not favouring the government’s move have signed during the campaign.The members put forward the demand in-front of the state government to roll back its decision and do not construct any museum inside the Central Park. Samiti presiden, Yogesh Yadav said, “The successive government are providing benefit to influential after acquiring land in the name of public utility. At present, nearly 256 bigha of public land has been utilised by the club authority. The entire government land is 322 bigha, out of which Central Park has been developed on 66 bigha. Most land is under the club’s possession with no government control. More establishments such as museum will tamper the sanity of the city’s biggest park.”As thousands of morning walkers and joggers come to Central Park daily and number is increasing steadily, the protesters claims, that land should be reserved for expansion or existing building should be dedicated to public.Marudhar Singh, opposing the move said, “Museum in the park makes no sense. If government want to benefit public, it should develop the existing building into fitness centre. Taxpayers money should be utilised thinking twice, and not wasted. Moreover, Central Park length or breadth should be increased as number of walkers have increased with times.”The JDA, however, has cleared it stand that building will not be demolished without inviting objection and suggestion. A senior official of the JDA said, “Not an inch park land is used for construction. The land use of the hotel land is commercial/recreational and move will save the land forever.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/signature-campaign-begins-against-jda-move-to-raze-laxmi-vilas-hotel/articleshow/84600665.cms||---

The delay in arresting Kundra and his IT head Ryan Thorpe has raised questions about whether there was any interference or pressure to go slow. However, crime branch officials said the delay was due to the arrest of then investigating officer, assistant police inspector Sachin Waze. He was arrested for allegedly planting explosives near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house and the subsequent murder of Scorpio owner Mansukh Hiran. As part of the clean-up operation, 68 police officers from various units of the crime branch were transferred.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-arrest-got-delayed-as-probe-officer-waze-was-arrested/articleshow/84598799.cms||Ahmed Ali

The passenger traffic has gone down by around 25% for the last three days and less people are coming to Pune from Mumbai. The number of buses plying between the two cities has also been reduced by 20%,” a senior official of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) in Pune said. The state transport body gave a list of dos and don’ts to the drivers in view of the heavy rains. Drivers were told to strictly abide by the speed limit. Before starting a journey, all drivers had to consult the depot managers and mechanics to make sure the vehicles were technically sound. “If water is overflowing over a culvert the drivers shouldn’t cross it. We have recently introduced a vehicle tracking system (VTS) in many buses. It is helping keep track and inform passengers about the scheduled arrival and departure of the buses,” the official said. On July 17, the MSRTC provided 18 buses to the Pune rail division for Mumbai-bound passengers as the trains were short-terminated because of heavy rains, the official said. A senior police officer told TOI that two speed gun-mounted vehicles were deployed near the Sinhagad College in Lonavla and near the Amrutanjan bridge area to curb speeding. Sanjay Jadhav, the superintendent of police of the Highway Safety Patrol, said they were on high alert about vehicular movement on the Pune-Mumbai expressway along with their counterparts in other agencies. “The two vehicles are constantly checking vehicles for speeding. There is heavy police presence at the Talegaon toll plaza. Vehicles not following the rules are stopped and fined or cautioned against speeding,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/drop-in-msrtc-passenger-traffic-between-pune-and-mumbai-due-to-heavy-rain/articleshow/84598839.cms||Joy Sengupta

Let us wait for better times. Otherwise the civic administration will not be in a position to control (Covid-19 spread), ” said a bench led by Chief Justice Dipankar Datta. It heard two PILs to direct BMC to allow sacrifice by issuing guidelines like last year. Senior advocate Anil Sakhare, for BMC, submitted a July 19 circular that permits 300 water buffaloes for slaughter between 6am and 6pm. He said after July 22 no import licences will be issued to bring more big animals into the city as already there are 900 inside the abattoir. Advocate A Siddiquie, for a petitioner Al-Quraish Human Welfare Association, said cattle inside the abattoir belonged to retailers and urged for the sake of small traders to increase it to 700. Sakhare said the decision was taken in keeping with the Covid protocols and to avoid overcrowding. “Last year we allowed 150. This year 300,” he added.  tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cant-increase-animals-for-bakri-eid-sacrifice/articleshow/84598851.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Welcome record: Private hospitals have 0 Covid patients in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: On the mornings of July 18 and 19, the city had just one Covid-19 positive patient with oxygen dependency. With the discharge of the patient on Monday, the morning report of 3,473 Covid beds available in 70+ private hospitals in Ahmedabad reported zero inpatients! To put the figure in perspective, from mid-March to mid-May, the Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association recorded over 80% occupancy of 5,602 beds available then – occupancy of ICU and ventilator beds often going above 95%. The number of Covid cases started falling after mid-May and the daily new cases have not gone beyond 200 in the past 30 days. Thus, the occupancy numbers also recorded a fall. AHNA president Dr Bharat Gadhvi said that in April 2020, two city-based private hospitals were allowed to admit Covid patients. “Ever since, the number never touched zero earlier. Thus, it’s truly a zero day for the fraternity,” he said. Technically this may be right, but the number of ‘Covid patients’ has not become nil, clarified experts. “In principle, the person remains positive after infection for about two weeks. Afterwards, the viral load decreases and the RT-PCR test is negative. But the patient, due to impact of Covid, might report other health complications and need further care. The number of such patients might be in hundreds,” said director of a city-based hospital. Civil Hospital, the state’s biggest tertiary care hospital with the largest Covid care facility, on Tuesday had only 16 patients remaining. “For us, the zero day was on July 16 when for the first time during the pandemic, there was not a single case in Covid OPD or triage area,” said Dr JP Modi, medical superintendent of Civil Hospital. “On Monday however we admitted three new patients. The number is still very encouraging and reminds us not to lower our guards.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/welcome-record-pvt-hospitals-have-0-covid-patients/articleshow/84598904.cms||Parth Shastri

Arrested by the Nahargarh police on Monday, Vikas Jangir duped nearly anyone who befriended and confided in him. Secrets of his past life were revealed when the police began looking into Vikas’ antecedents. The police arrested Vikas after his landlord filed an FIR last month alleging that the accused bilked Rs 10 lakh from his bank account when the latter was undergoing treatment at a hospital after a cardiac arrest. Vikas had presented a caring face to his elderly landlord and even took him to the hospital for treatment. “He had earlier duped a woman in Gurgaon after befriending her on a matrimonial website, he cheated her of money too,” said, SHO, Nahargarh police station, Mukesh Khardiya. Khardiya said that the accused is a trained IT expert with a specialization in data management, having worked with leading companies in Gurgaon and Mumbai before moving to Jaipur. “He is a very skilled IT expert, he knew he could be traced so he stopped using mobile phones for the past several months. He spoke to people using only online apps,” he said. The police found that Vikas is married, but his wife also filed a case against him at Mahlia (women police station). “He was in a live-in relationship with a woman in Rajsamand. He duped her too,” he said. The police said that there have been multiple cases against the accused. Besides two women and the landlord he duped, the police said they are examining to check if there were other complaints against the accused. “We had a very difficult time tracking him because he knew he could be traced down with the mobile phone. So we resorted to old methods of mukhbari (intelligence), several of our cops received leads about him due to which we were able to arrest him,” Khardiya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/it-expert-turned-cyber-cheat-duped-nearly-everyone-he-met/articleshow/84600712.cms||---

This year, paddy is being cultivated only on 10,992 hectares as against 20,000 hectares last year. Paddy is mainly grown in Bhor, Velhe, Mulshi, Maval, Khed, Ambegaon and Junnar tehsils. Dnyaneshwar Bote, district agriculture officer, said, “The paddy cultivation couldn't take place due to paucity of rainfall in the last few weeks in the district. It has disturbed overall planning of the cultivators. It has slowly taken place in the last four-five days in some areas of these tehsils.” Digambar Bhalchim, a paddy farmer from Ambegaon tehsil, said that less cultivation will hamper overall equation of the harvest. “We will be getting harvest late. It will certainly have an adverse impact on the prices in the market. Moreover, we won't be able to get good harvest due to change in weather condition in the coming months,” he added. Vijay Shende, another farmer from Vlehe tehsil, said that the paddy is the main crop of the year. “If we don't get good harvest, it will be a tough situation for us in summer. We don’t get other crops due to lack of irrigation facility,” he said. Barring soybean, sowing of no other crop has been completed so far, said the report prepared by the district agriculture office. “The area under soybean increased tremendously due to good price in the market last year. The prices have touched as high as Rs7,000 per quintal. As a result, many farmers switched to soybean this year. Thus, area under it increased by average area,” Bote added. Sandesh Shinde, a farmer from Khed who has sown soybean for the first time, said, “The growth of the crop is decent so far. We didn't require more spraying of pesticides as well. We hope to get good harvest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/50-less-paddy-cultivation-than-last-year-in-july-in-pune-report/articleshow/84598894.cms||---

---||Delhi||One Nation One Ration Card scheme in Delhi: Info, weather hurdles on day 1||NEW DELHI: A day after the Delhi cabinet gave its nod to implement the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) scheme, the distribution of free rations at around 2,000 fair price shops started on Tuesday. The move will give much-needed relief to migrant workers, who are otherwise deprived of free or subsidised food items as they hold ration cards of their native states. However, the response to the scheme on the first day was extremely poor. Only a handful of beneficiaries possessing ration cards of other states turned up at the fair price shops. Lack of awareness and bad weather were considered to be the main reasons for the low turnout. A source in the food department said only two transactions related to ONORC were reported till the evening.  However, the response from people holding ration cards of Delhi was strong despite the inclement weather. In all, 14,658 transactions of Delhi’s ration card holders took place. Rations were distributed among beneficiaries using electronic point-of-sale (e-PoS) machines. The usage of e-PoS machines was on hold since April 2018 after irregularities were detected in distribution of rations. With the implementation of ONORC, e-PoS machines, which are connected to the central server, are back because beneficiaries belonging to other states cannot be verified without them. Saurabh Gupta, who represents one of the unions of fair price shop owners, said people from other states were not aware about implementation of the scheme in Delhi. “They also may not have any idea about ONORC. It will take time to make them aware,” he added. Not all migrant workers who have valid ration cards issued by their respective native states carry them when they move to Delhi or other cities in search of work. This can also prevent them from availing free rations under ONORC. Responding to the poor turnout of beneficiaries, Delhi government said, “By not crowding fair price shops, people have reposed faith in the food and civil supplies department. It is the reflection of the maturity of the beneficiaries, including migrant workers. It was a rainy day, so everyone was cautious of stepping out as foodgrains could get damaged. The public is aware that the stock will not get exhausted in one day. The government will ensure no one is deprived of their rights.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/one-card-for-ration-info-weather-hurdles-on-day-1/articleshow/84598911.cms||AlokKNMishra

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC to parents: Start paying fees then file e-class access plea||MUMBAI: The parents of 150 students from two Dadar schools who have been barred from online classes must first pay the pending fees, the Bombay high court said on Tuesday. “Start paying something, otherwise it won’t be possible (to allow them online classes),” said a bench of Justices Ramesh Dhanuka and Riyaz Chagla that heard a petition by 28 parents of students, from kindergarten to class IX, of Indian Education Society’s IES Ash Lane Primary School and IES English School. The petitioners have urged to immediately allow online classes, set aside fees fixed for 2020-21 and 2021-22 and also to reduce it by 50%. Their advocate, Arvind Tiwari, argued for concessions and instalment of tuition fees as some parents suffered casualties of a family member owing to the pandemic. The schools’ advocate, Arvind Kothari, said the parents haven’t paid for the entire last academic year and even this year. He said time was given till September to pay, but they “have not responded”. “According to you [parents], is nothing payable?” Justice Dhanuka asked, to which Tiwari replied: “There is a need for compassion, we need some time to pay.” He said parents were ready to pay the tuition fee, but not the term fee. Kothari pointed out that a few parents employed at high posts have also not paid. When he said the schools are incurring additional expenses for online classes and sanitation, Tiwari countered that parents too were facing expenses. “The schools are not entitled to a term fee,” he insisted. Justice Chagla then said: “The matter is between you [parents] and the schools to sort out.” Kothari said if the parents indicate what payment they would make, he could revert on it. The judges directed that if the payment proposal is made within two days, the schools will convey their counter-proposal. Tiwari urged that in the meantime students be allowed to attend online classes. The judges then said parents must first start paying pending fees and then move the HC for online access.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-to-parents-start-paying-fees-then-file-e-class-access-plea/articleshow/84598913.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Jaipur||Campaign against child begging begins in Jaipur||JAIPUR: The child commission began awareness campaign against child begging in Jaipur from Tuesday during which teams of nodal officers of various departments in collaboration with various NGOs went to different areas and exhorted parents who forced their children to beg on the streets. Sangeeta Beniwal, chairperson, Rajasthan state commission for protection of child rights (RSCPCR) elaborating on the campaign said, “Our main aim is not to separate the children from the parents but to make the latter understand that their kids should not be made to beg as it is stealing their childhood. Apart from this we will also talk to owners of eateries who employ children in order to ensure that child labour is also eradicated in all forms.” “After a week of intensive awareness campaign, we will review the reasons that the parents made their children beg along with the issues that our teams faced while trying to convince them against this practice. After this, we will rescue the children if need be as well as rehabilitate them if we are unable to convince the parents. This campaign will start from Jaipur and will be gradually replicated to other districts as well,” further added Beniwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/campaign-against-child-begging-begins-in-jaipur/articleshow/84600780.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: RTPCR report or vaccination proof must for visitors from high positivity states||LUCKNOW: From July 24, passengers coming to Uttar Pradesh from states where Covid-19 positivity rate is 3% or more will have to produce either an RTPCR negative report or a certificate of complete vaccination. The state government will update the list of states from where such certificates are required, twice each month and it will be made available on the website of the Directorate of Medical and Health Services, UP. To start with, passengers coming to UP either by air, rail or bus, from Manipur, Mizoram, Kerala, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Maharashtra, Goa, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh will be required to produce these certificates. This list will be valid for entry into UP from July 24 to July 31. 2nd list applicable for those entering UP from Aug 1 to 15The advisory says that the RTPCR test must be carried out not earlier than three days before travel and therefore, for someone arriving in UP on July 24, the sample should be collected between July 20 and 23. Based on the weekly positivity rate of states from July 16 to 22, the government will publish a second list on July 24. This list will be applicable for those entering UP from August 1 to 15. A negative RTPCR report with samples collected between July 28 and July 31 will be applicable for this period, or a certificate of complete vaccination. A notice issued by additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi to district magistrates, divisional commissioners and senior police officials of all districts, has said that several experts and ICMR have expressed the fear of the of the third wave starting from the last week of August and therefore, it is necessary to take steps to control the spread of fresh transmission. He said that twice a month, a list of states where positivity rate is higher than 3% will be put up on the health department website and persons coming from these states will be required to produce either a complete certificate of vaccination or an RTPCR negative report which is not older than three days. The note states that while the positivity rate in UP is 0.04%, it is several times higher in some other states. Awasthi has said that antigen testing should be carried out at all railway stations, airports and interstate bus stations, and for passengers coming from states with a high case load, so that symptomatic patients can be referred to hospitals immediately. Covid helpdesks must also be set up at such places where testing facilities, along with thermometers and pulse oximeters are available. He has asked each district to identify entry points where these facilities will be made available and provide this list to the government by July 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rtpcr-report-or-vax-proof-must-for-visitors-from-high-vity-states/articleshow/84600747.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Surat||Higher secondary in civic schools: Surat creates record||Surat: Diamond City added another feather in its cap by introducing creating higher secondary classes in its municipal schools. It has created a record in the country with this novel step by formally launching the higher classes on Tuesday through online. Schools, however, are yet to reopen for offline teaching. Total 24 divisions of class XI were started, in which, 1,562 students have been given admission. Eleven divisions are in Gujarati medium, 10 in Marathi and three in Hindi medium schools. Municipal schools will offer Arts, Commerce and Science streams in its HS division. The project was launched with funding by a local industry with plans for 14 divisions earlier. However, heavy rush for admission pushed up the number of division to 24. “It is a historic moment for the city since we have become the first municipal corporation in the country that offers education in higher secondary as well. We are already imparting education in seven different languages,” said Banchhanidh Pani, city municipal commissioner. At present municipal schools under Nagar Prathmik Shikshan Samiti offer education in Gujarati, Hindi, English, Marathi, Urdu, Odia and Telugu language. “Along with regular studies a group of 78 Chartered Accountants (CA) will teach accountancy to students of municipal schools. They will encourage students to pursue CA studies,” said Paresh Patel, chairman, standing committee. Inaugurating the initiative at Surat Municipal Corporation headquarter, mayor Hemali Boghawala said, “I completed my primary education in a municipal school and I know how important a municipal school’s role is in education of students from needy families. Education is free for girls in these newly started divisions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/higher-secondary-in-civic-schools-surat-creates-record/articleshow/84594212.cms||---

The TERN team is now working on a minimum viable prototype (MVP) of smart camera trap, which will reduce burden on the forest staff and play an important role in securing data captured from the forest. The TERN team has five members — Srushti Mehatkar, Rohit Hazare, Omkar Kekre, Madhulika Dolke and Abhinav Chikhalkar. While Chikhalkar is from IIT Bombay, other members are alumni of Ramdeobaba College of Engineering & Management. TERN works primarily on technological solutions for forests. “The startup team stood in the top 100 from among 8,000 participants from across the country registered for the competition. We are working on a smart camera trap that will be able to send data without mobile network or Wi-Fi connection,” said Mehatkar. Of the 100 semifinalists, 25 will be shortlisted in the upcoming rounds followed by 10 and then top 3. Though all will get funding to prepare prototypes, the top three will get government funds to start production on commercial scale. “If approved, our innovation can be a major boon to forest departments, both in terms of technology and wildlife and environmental conservation. The Swadeshi Microprocessor Challenge organizer has provided all semifinalists Rs1 lakh for the execution of the MVP,” she said. Under Atmanirbhar Bharat project, there is growing need for Swadeshi computer hardware that shall be part of every smart device deployed in different domains. Under the Microprocessor Development Programme spearheaded by MeitY at Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), IIT Madras and IIT Bombay, not only the family of industry-grade microprocessors has been designed from the scratch but also computer ecosystem around them has been evolved as a step towards meeting India’s future requirements. Hazare said to provide further impetus to a strong ecosystem of startups, innovators, and researchers in the country, MeitY had announced Swadeshi Microprocessor Challenge in September last. “We will be using Shakti microprocessors made available by IIT Madras to develop the camera trap prototype,” he said. MVP smart camera trap will enhance the capabilities of the existing ones being used by the forest departments. The MVP is designed to reduce problems like manual retrieval of data. The manual method delays acquiring the data with an added risk to the life of forest guards. Since camera traps are not frequently monitored, chances of the data being stolen are high. “The MVP camera trap is designed to create a self-formed network that can work irrespective of availability of the cellular network. One camera trap at the headquarters will get the data through this network. Some other features will include detection of theft or failure, quick SOS alerts to headquarters in case forest guards face any emergencies,” says Nihal Reddy, a member of TERN who played crucial role in the initial ideation. “The idea behind the competition is to promote culture of innovation and entrepreneurship by taking up complex designs in the country and innovate frugal solutions around home-grown processor ecosystem, catering to both global and domestic requirements,” says Kekre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-startup-to-make-smart-camera-traps-for-forest-depts/articleshow/84598864.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Lucknow||After RSS draws poll template, UP BJP brass meets Shah, Nadda||Lucknow: Two days after the RSS brass hammered out the political template for BJP in the run-up to assembly elections, top UP BJP leaders on Tuesday turned to the party’s national leadership to further firm up the poll roadmap. Highly placed party sources said, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal airdashed to Delhi to meet senior BJP leaders, including party president JP Nadda and home minister Amit Shah, relaying signals about the party’s propensity to expeditiously move into the electoral groove and take on a belligerent Opposition. While there was no official confirmation on what transpired in the meeting, sources indicated that Singh and Bansal discussed the outcome of the two-day coordination meeting between RSS, BJP and the UP government in Lucknow and party’s future programmes and campaigns. This comes amid plans by the BJP national leadership to regularly visit UP to ratchet up the political temperature, while keeping the party’s organisational machinery rolling. The development also stoked speculations about the ruling BJP’s plans to effect a reshuffle in the Yogi Adityanath cabinet to accommodate fresh faces, taking caste and regional representation into consideration. A senior official in the chief minister’s office said, the cabinet reshuffle was surely on the cards to “adjust” a few party MLAs, but there was no confirmation on the timing. “The call will be taken by chief minister Yogi Adityanath soon,” the official said. Unconfirmed reports said, the issue of accommodating party leaders in the state cabinet was also part of discussions during the meeting of state BJP leaders and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath with Sangh brass, including sahkaryawah Dattatreya Hosable and sah-sarkaryawah (joint general secretary) Krishna Gopal. RSS sources, however, squarely denied it saying Sangh does not interfere in the functioning of the state government and its role was restricted to ensuring BJP’s ideological commitment. Sangh, as a matter of fact, decided to take a feedback from the BJP brass immediately after its state executive meet, which saw the party releasing a host of political resolutions that included taking the Centre and state government policies to the grassroots and expediting construction of Ram temple . Political experts were quick to join the dots indicating how the recent reshuffle in Narendra Modi cabinet which saw UP getting a lion’s share was immediately followed by the RSS meeting in Chitrakoot in which UP assembly polls and Ram temple construction figured .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/after-rss-draws-poll-template-up-bjp-brass-meets-shah-nadda/articleshow/84600788.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Chennai||MLA: Why not redraw corpn zones to match constituency limits?||Chennai: At present, a resident of Mandaveli may cast their vote in Mylapore constituency, but their house may fall under Adyar zone (13) of Greater Chennai Corporation and the ration shop may be in Mylapore. This is a problem for residents across the city and leaves them confused particularly when trying to figure out which government office to approach to resolve an issue. To make things easier for citizens, Dr N Ezhilan, the newly elected MLA from central Chennai’s Thousand lights constituency, submitted a proposal suggesting redrawing the boundaries of the civic body’s zones so they match with that of each assembly constituency.  The MLA also proposed that the assembly constituency be the limit for the revenue division and under the control of same assistant commissioner of civil supplies. The confusion arises as limits of the assembly constituency and corporation zones, civil supplies limits and revenue divisions are not coterminus. This also causes delay and inconsistency in implementation of projects since more than one office of the same department has to intervene, Ezhilan said. The revenue department acknowledged Ezhilan’s proposal and initiated discussions. If implemented, the corporation would consist of 22 zones, each co-terminus with one assembly constituency. When TOI contacted senior bureaucrats for their views on the proposal, opinion was divided. One official said the proposal could be a worthwhile study with a potential to curb corruption by at least 50%-60% percent due to the reduced confusion. “But the limits of police station should also be redrawn along with corporation and revenue. Scientific positioning systems could be used. It is doable but requires an exhaustive administrative overhaul,” the official said. Another bureaucrat said the move was totally unnecessary and that this seemed to address the MLA’s inconvenience.  “Instead, a mobile app can be created to inform every resident about their nearest government office. We are in the information age,” the official said. Jayaram Venkatesan of anti-corruption NGO Arappor Iyakkam said the proposal was good but only if the assembly constituency’s limits aren’t redrawn after any process of delimitation.  “It will be very useful for the public,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/mla-why-not-redraw-corpn-zones-to-match-constituency-limits/articleshow/84596644.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar

The video prompted the district collector to direct medical college management to probe into the matter and to submit factual report soon. In compliance, KMC principal, ordered the anti-ragging committee of the college to visit the spot and begin probe. However, the committee is likely to submit its report on Wednesday. In the video clip, around 30-35 students are seen standing with their heads bowed down and holding hands at the back, while around 8-10 others, who are believed to be senior students, command them to follow various instructions. The video suggested the alleged ragging was underway in backyard of college campus. The youth, who shot the video, claimed the seniors also slapped the juniors and forced them to stand in the ‘murga’ posture, while a few of them were allegedly forced to take off their pants. However these claims were not visible in the video. After the video surfaced on Monday evening, they instantly sent two additional principals and one academic in-charge to the spot where the ragging was supposed to have taken place and the officials reached the spot within minutes to take stock of situation but there was no sign of such activity and the presence of the students, said principal of the KMC, Dr Vijay Sardana.

During the maiden visit of the state home minister Dilip Walse Patil earlier this year, he had suggested city police to undertake a study to ascertain the reasons behind high incidence of violent crimes in Nagpur. The study would aim at devising an effective methodology for crime prevention and sprucing up coordination between police, prosecution and prisons, said commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar. “The crime statistics of the last two decades shall be referred to and in-depth studies of the FIRs from 2016 onwards would be done. Our aim is to find out psychological, social, socio-economical and legal factors behind such crimes,” he said. “The aim is to find out crime-prone and less vulnerable places in the city by applying cartographic school of criminology (geographical mapping of the crime),” he said. Kumar said various measures have been undertaken over a period of time in the city to pull back the crime rate. “We would be studying the crime prevention methodologies and ascertain their effectiveness,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-police-law-univ-sign-mou-to-study-crime/articleshow/84596620.cms||---

The Border Roads Organization (BRO) reconstructed the bridge at Kulagad to relink 50 villages of Dharma, Chaudas and Byas valleys to the district headquarters. The bridge, 10 km from Dharchula town, was washed away on July 8. Thereafter, the BRO had set up wooden logs for local residents to cross the Kulagad stream which were also swept away on July 11. The logs were again set up and the SDRF and local NGO Climb Beyond The Submit (CBTS) helped people cross the stream which had swelled up in monsoon. “The BRO was instructed to construct the bridge at the earliest to minimise the problems the village residents were facing. The bridge is 150m long,” Dharchula SDM AK Shukla said. According to the disaster management office, heavy rain lashed the district on Tuesday.

When the woman’s condition worsened, she was brought to Delhi for treatment on July 18. The survivor’s brother called DCW’s 181 helpline and the commission got her admitted to a city hospital. The woman's food pipe, stomach and intestines have been burnt, and she can neither drink nor eat but vomits blood frequently, hospital officials said. DCW also got her statement registered before a sub-divisional magistrate. In the statement, the woman claimed her husband was having an affair with a woman and when she confronted him about it, he beat her and then made her drink acid the next morning. Maliwal and DCW member Promila Gupta met the survivor on Tuesday. Maliwal has written to Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan seeking strong action in the matter. The DCW chief said, “It is absolutely frightening and shameful how a young woman was made to consume acid by her own husband. The woman was brought to Delhi for treatment and we were terrified of seeing her condition. The doctors aren't very hopeful of her recovery because she is doing very poorly. It is a matter of shame that Madhya Pradesh police dealt with such a serious case with so much insensitivity. I've written a letter to the Madhya Pradesh CM, asking him to get the culprits arrested and to ensure action is taken against the police officers who tried to weaken the acid attack case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mp-woman-forced-to-drink-acid-by-husband-fights-for-life-in-city-hosp/articleshow/84598962.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

---||Chennai||Chennai: Take a selfie with underwater friends at park off Marina||CHENNAI: A mighty shark greets visitors at the park along Kamarajar Salai off Marina beach. But fear not, the shark is made of automobile scrap. The city corporation is setting up such ‘junk art’ along important stretches in the city. Aside from the asethetic appeal, the move is aimed at creating awareness on waste recycling. As part of its ongoing campaign, the civic body conducted an exhibition with scrap metal art at a corporation school in Thiruvanmiyur earlier this year. On Tuesday morning, workers were busy installing these sea creatures at Kamarajar Salai. “These will be placed near Marina beach permanently. We chose sculptures of sea animals as a symbol. For now, we have installed three such sculptures,” said an engineer with Zone 9 (Teynampet) of the city corporation. The civic body procured the art from Andhra Pradesh-based sculptor P Srinivasa Rao, 49. Rao’s art is on display across several municipalities in the southern states. The Vijayawada native, a sculptor for more than two decades, and his team began making sculptures using automobile scrap about seven years ago. “This is also one method of waste management. We procure automobile scrap from local mechanics to industrial waste at a cheap price and then convert them into art. My idea is that art should reach to the common man. Also, there is no need for galleries and these can be exhibited in a public place and require less maintenance,” Rao told TOI. Civic body officials too expressed optimism that these structures will add to the aesthetic appeal. Less than a year ago, corporation installed a typographic sculpture, ‘Namma Chennai’, near Marina beach which has now become an important landmark and a popular selfie point.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/take-a-selfie-with-underwater-friends-at-park-off-marina/articleshow/84596685.cms||B A Raju
---||Hyderabad||Stamp duty hike: Even those who’ve already paid not spared||HYDERABAD: Not just new home buyers, the latest revision is also set to hit many customers who’ve already paid their stamp duty. Reason: The order is binding on even those who have cleared their registration charges but haven't got a slot to complete the process. Now, they have to shell out an additional 1.5% before moving ahead. “This might lead to heartburn among several customers. We wish the government would at least allow registrations at old rate for those who have already paid the challan (as the government has already received the money from them),” said R Suresh Kumar, senior vice-president (business operations) of Prestige Group (Hyderabad). He added that the entire burden of the revision will fall on the end-user, not the developer. For instance, if someone buying a home at Rs 1 crore worth had to pay stamp duty of Rs 6 lakh (6% of total property value) until now, he/she will now have to pay Rs 7.5 lakh (or 7.5%). But P Ramakrishna Rao, president of Credai-Hyderabad argues that builders too will feel the pinch. And that's because of an upward revision in construction value — from Rs 760 per sft to Rs 1,000 per sft — implemented by the government. “As a result, developers will have to pay 25% more while registering development agreements. Further, this rise in construction value will also increase the labour cess -- 1% of the total cost of construction,” he said. Though the land rates, even post revision, might not impact home buyers drastically — most land transactions in Hyderabad happen at a much higher price than what's set by the government — it will increase the "nala tax commensurately”, the Credai official added. “On the face of it, the revision, especially in stamp duty, does seem very steep. But we must understand that it is being implemented after a long gap. So, at one level, it is also reasonable,” said Ashwin Rao of Manbhum Constructions. The order is binding on even those who have cleared their registration charges but haven't got a slot to complete the process.

---||Pune||Maharashtra: Man held for abducting Wadachiwadi resident||PUNE: The Kondhwa police on Monday arrested a man and booked his two accomplices, including a woman, on the charges of abducting a 23-year-old private firm employee in a car from Wadachiwadi and attacking and robbing him of two cellphones and Rs2,000 in Vishrantwadi on July 17. The Pune cantonment court on Tuesday sent the man, Riyan Khurana, in police remand till July 22. Khurana is a resident of Mangaldas Road. “The Wadachiwadi resident was a friend with the woman for three years. They had, however, stopped talking to each other for over seven months after their relations turned sour,” said senior inspector Sardar Patil from the Kondhwa police on Tuesday. “Around 2pm on July 17, the Wadachiwadi resident had walked out of a housing society to visit a bank. One of the suspects, later identified as Khurana, accosted the youth and identified himself as the woman’s brother. Khurana told the man to accompany him and a dispute broke out. A security guard advised them not to fight on the society premises and told them to settle the dispute outside,” he said. “Khurana then forced the man to step into a car parked outside the society. The woman and another suspect were in the car. The trio beat him up and one of them drove the vehicle to Vishrantwadi. After halting at a place, the three persons again beat up the man and hit him with a glass bottle. They then robbed him of his two cellphones and Rs2,000 in cash and freed him,” Patil said. The man registered an FIR against the trio relating to kidnapping and armed robbery, among other charges, of the Indian Penal Code on July 18. “We have arrested Khurana. A team of our officers is searching for the two other suspects,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-held-on-charge-of-abducting-robbing-wadachiwadi-resident/articleshow/84598945.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Nishad quota would be dream come true for Phoolan: Mother||Lucknow: “Humein yaad aa gao, Phoolan ki maang hati ki Nisaadon kau aarakchhan mile ke chaahi (I could recollect, Phoolan had demanded reservation for Nishads),” said Moola Devi, late Phoolan Devi’s mother, to volunteers of the Sarvadaliya Nishad-Kashyap union, an amalgamation of Nishad-centric social and political outfits, when they met her at her village Shekhpur Gudha ka Purwa under Kalpi thana in Jalaun recently. The union since July 11 has launched a ‘yatra’ in Nishad-dominated districts of UP, most of which are in Bundelkhand and Purvanchal regions, to mobilise the community’s support for reservation. When the volunteers reached Phoolan’s village in Jalaun, her mother made them stay with her at her home. The nonagenarian said, “The community should get a reservation. It would be a dream come true for Phoolan.” She said, “Samajwaalon soch leo, sab jan isko sahara deo (think wise and support the move). It is for your and your children’s good.” It was in 1994 that the Mulayam Singh government withdrew all cases against Phoolan Devi. In 1996, she became an MP from Mirzapur on Samajwadi Party ticket. “While being an MP, she demanded reservation for Nishads,” said convener of the ‘yatra’ Kunwar Singh Nishad. Phoolan Devi’s life in entirety makes her an unparalleled Nishad leader, at least, in the recent history. And, it’s the time for the Nishad-centric parties to harp on her legacy, ahead of each other. It was in the same direction that the union’s visit to Phoolan Devi’s village was pre-planned and so was the bid to invoke her legacy. The Sarvadaliya Nishad-Kashyap union is backed by political parties that thrive on Nishad-centric issues. Apart from the lesser known ones, including Rashtriya Mahaan Gadtantra Party, Phoolan Sena, Navlok Party and Nishad Army, the bigger parties centred around fishermen community, like Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) is also supporting the union. Though the convener of the union said it is a social outfit, the timing of the union’s coming into existence and the issue that it has raked up makes it a little less of a social group. The party will make July 25, Phoolan Devi’s Shahadat Diwas, a big occasion in UP. The party has already put a prefix to her name, that of a ‘Veerangana’ (brave woman) and taken a line, “Phoolan abhi zinda hai, hamare aur aapke vichaaron mein, mata bahno ke sangharshon mein.” VIP president and cabinet minister in Bihar Mukesh Sahni said, “We will mark July 25 as Shahadat Diwas of Phoolan Devi in UP and Bihar in a big way.” The party will install her 18-foot tall statues in 18 divisional headquarters of UP the same day. While Sahni himself might be present at an event in Varanasi party workers will ensure programmes are held from panchayat level till the district level. The party, next year, will install Phoolan’s statues in the remaining districts of UP. In a pamphlet that the party has printed on Shahadat Diwas, there is a brief history about Phoolan Devi. Born in August, 1963 in a Mallah family in Shekhpur Gudha ka Purwa village in Jalaun, she was put to non-stop harassment by a ‘specific community’ in the village, but she “did not bow down” and eventually made her way to the parliament. She exhorted Nishads all over north India, read the pamphlet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nishad-quota-would-be-dream-come-true-for-phoolan-mother/articleshow/84600825.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Major oxygen plants to be ready by August-end||AHMEDABAD: Gearing up for the possible third Covid wave, the AMC will set up a 2,000 litres per minute (LPA), a 1,500 LPA, and a 1,000 LPA medical oxygen plants or Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plants at various city hospitals. On Monday, the AMC had discussed the progress of the Rs 13 crore civil works which have been undertaken to set up these PSA plants. Interestingly, the civic body has sought private operators to run these plants for a period of five years. “The process of installation of these plants will begin from the second week of August as pre-bid meetings and technical evaluations are to be conducted,” said a senior AMC official. Recently, the AMC had installed a PSA plant at Behrampura, which has been made operational. Officials also revealed that talks are on to import a high-capacity medical oxygen plant from Germany. “We will announce that shortly. There are some modalities that need clarifications,” added the senior AMC official. Earlier this month, the state government had revealed that more than 175 oxygen plants have been installed in the state against the target of 300 with an aim to produce 1,800 metric tonnes of oxygen in the state. During the second Covid wave, the per day medical oxygen requirement had been above 280 tonnes a day for Ahmedabad. During normal days, the demand for medical oxygen remains around 100 metric tonnes for the state. But during the peak of the second wave of corona, the demand for medical oxygen rose to 1,200 metric tonnes. The state government maintained that the supply of medical oxygen in the hospitals was accomplished through systematic planning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/major-o2-plants-to-be-ready-by-august-end/articleshow/84598987.cms||---

Soon after the swearing in, the second Pinarayi Vijayan government had announced its decision to retain economist V K Ramachandran as the vice-chairman of the planning board. However, the selection of the board members has been dragging on at a time when the relevance of the planning board assumes greater significance. CPM and CPI had finalized their nominees to the crucial board almost a month ago and the delay was largely on the part of Kerala Congress (M) in deciding its nominee to the planning board. It is learnt that CPM is considering a health expert and wife of a former state minister as one of the key members on the board. Another member would be an agriculture expert who is also a Left union leader. The third nominee of CPM, said sources, is an assistant professor teaching women’s studies at Calicut University. CPI is likely to retain economist K Ravi Raman as its nominee to the state planning board. KC(M) is learnt to have finalized its candidate last week and the government announcement on the induction of new members to the important state planning body is expected this week. Planning board which carried out a study on the impact of the first wave of Covid-19 has not been able to carry out any follow-up studies on the impact of the second wave of the pandemic on various sectors in the state. “The planning board would soon come up with study reports on the impact of the second wave of Covid on Kerala economy,” said Ramachandran. He expressed hope that the reconstitution of the board would happen soon. Independent economists like B A Prakash are of the view that the state government has not been doing any quick or comprehensive studies imperative to ascertain the magnitude of the devastating impact of Covid on the state economy and lives of people, and the delay in the reconstitution of the planning board was an example for the lack of critical vision. “The government should have given top priority to the reconstitution of the planning board, which is supposed to take a lead role in the planning programme. Unless serious efforts are put in to study the impact of the pandemic and take immediate policy formulations and re-prioritizations, the days ahead will prove extremely unpleasant for the planners and government,” he warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/reconstitution-of-planning-board-likely-this-week/articleshow/84599010.cms||B S Anilkumar

Among them, Reena Gupta from Silicon Valley and Tariq Khan from New York came forward to mentor and give grants to the startup for building scale,” said Mahavir Sharma, former president of TiE Global.The recognition has come as a shot in the arm for the startup. Yuvraj Beheti, another member of the startup said, “Now we are looking to increase the student and company base. After that we will charge a small fees for the services,” said Beheti.When asked about their studies clashing with the demands of the venture, Beheti said that when they were in Class XI last year, they could build the platform without disturbing their exams. “We don’t see any hurdles for continuing the studies while working for the startup,” added Beheti.Elated with the success, Sheenu Jhawar, chair of Mentoring Program at TiE Rajasthan said that this win comes as a testimony of our structured programmatic interventions aimed at nurturing the fresh and commercial ideas.“All our focused classroom and personal mentoring programs are led by seasoned entrepreneurs. The team has been mentored by Chirag Patel, Manuj Goyal and Ashim Bhasin, all successful business owners willing to give back to the community,” said Jhawar.TiE-Jaipur has been working with school and university students to sow the seeds of entrepreneurship early on.

A medical education department committee in cooperation with private diagnostic laboratories calculated that after including all expenses such as manpower, electricity bill, waste management machine maintenance and building maintenance, the cost of RT-PCR for diagnosis was Rs 208 per sample, while the diagnostic labs can charge up to Rs 350, with a profit of Rs 142. Health department officials said that on April 17, due to falling prices of RT-PCR testing kit regimen, viral transport media kit and other consumables and their easy availability, the medical education department consulted experts in the SMS medical college and after consulting them, they had come to a conclusion that the rates of RT-PCR test can be brought down and taking action on their recommendation, the state government had put a capping of Rs350 per RT-PCR test at National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL). However, a private lab had challenged at High Court. The High Court had issued interim order directing the education department to constitute a committee to address the complaints of the private diagnostic labs.

The people moved around freely in the markets to buy livestock that arrived from different states. The hectic activity, eve of Eid-ul-Adha, is popularly known as the festival of sacrifice, which falls on the 10 days of the Islamic month of Zil-Hajjah. Markets teemed with activity as more and more people thronged to buy livestock and groceries at several places in the Old City. Traffic was seen slowing down at many points due to the animal sacrifice points set up along the roadside. Many people made a beeline to the livestock sale points at Chanchalguda, City College, Khilwat, Falaknuma, Darulshifa, Hussaini Alam, Jiyaguda, Jhirrah, Ring Road, Bahadurpura, Mehdipatnam, Nanal Nagar and Towli Chowki. Shepherds from Karnataka and Maharashtra were reportedly unhappy with sales at Khilwat ground. “The shepherds from Karnataka and Maharashtra are upset with sale and prices.

---||Nagpur||NU 1st in state to reduce fees for students due to Covid-19 pandemic||Nagpur: The Nagpur University has become the first in Maharashtra to formally reduce fees in the backdrop of Covid-19 pandemic, giving much needed respite to over 3.5 lakh students. It formally issued a notification on Tuesday after its Management Council approved the decision at its Friday meeting. The waiver would be applicable from the new academic year, 2021-22, which commenced from this month. It however excluded any cuts in tuition and term fees charged by colleges. TOI has been tracking the issue by consistently highlighting demands made by various students’ organisations and parents due to pandemic induced lockdowns, which adversely affected earnings of a majority of citizens and drained their savings. As per the notification, the university has reduced fees from 50% to 100% under various heads, while taking care that private colleges do not suffer. “It’s indeed a historic decision for lakhs of students and we’re the first in Maharashtra to do so. Even higher education minister Uday Samant appreciated NU’s efforts in this direction. Though we decided to grant 100% waiver in examination fees, we’ve agreed to limit it to 75%, with the view that its sanctity should be maintained. A majority of NU students avail scholarships, but those who aren’t eligible for it would be immensely benefited,” NU Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable told TOI. Management Council member Vishnu Changde, who was fighting with NU administration for providing 100% fee waiver since long, and even submitted many representations in this regard, said all colleges had to compulsorily provide benefits announced by NU, else strong action could be initiated against them. “Though the Management Council members were in favour of complete waiver, the NU administration was reluctant, as it would have suffered a big loss of around Rs75 crore. We then calculated all expenses and deliberated on it over multiple meetings on the issue. Still, NU is suffering losses to the tune of Rs30-40 crore.” Lauding NU administration for the historic move, Changde, who was part of the NU panel constituted for the purpose, said the university had waived off about Rs390 charged per student under various heads from private colleges. “There will be 50% concession in laboratory, library, and NU development charges, while no waiver would be provided for entry fee, students’ identity card, insurance and enrolment,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nu-1st-in-state-to-reduce-fees-for-students-due-to-covid-19-pandemic/articleshow/84599081.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

At the busy Nesbit junction, a right turn to go towards Mazgaon has been closed from 3pm to 9pm daily. Motorists wanting to go towards Mazgaon can now go less than 500 metres ahead and take a U-turn. “North-bound motorists have long been complaining on social media and offline about being held up at the Nesbit junction and getting delayed in reaching their destination. Our officers conducted an observational survey and found that while the signal remains red, at least two lanes of JJ Road were blocked only by motorists wanting to take a right turn to Mazgaon. This had a cascading effect, causing a massive backlog,” said a senior traffic police officer. To clear the stretch faster, traffic police used ropes and barricades to shut off the right turn in the evening for few days. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-decide-to-block-right-turn-at-nesbit-jn-in-sobo/articleshow/84599031.cms||---

The 34-year-old woman, a resident of Limbayat, was in a hurry to end it all, but fate had oher plans. While she failed to check for water under the bridge before she jumped in, she neatly landed in muck and had to be hauled to safety by people living in the slums under the bridge. Meanwhile, a commotion also ensued on the bridge as commuters who witnessed the woman jumping off, gathered there. One of the passers-by informed the fire department and the police control room about the incident. Fire officials said that a team from Muglisara fire station was sent to bring the woman out. But by the time they reached the spot, the woman had been brought out by the locals, who also helped her clean the muck. Later, cops from Rander police station took the woman to the police station for counselling. “The woman has not revealed the reason for attempting to end her life, but we have called her family members and counselled them as well,” said a police official. Cops said that the woman did not receive any injury. Much of the Tapi river’s banks are covered with muck as it has been dammed by the causeway. It is only when the water is released from Ukai dam and the causeway too overflows that the river flows in full spate in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/womans-suicide-bid-in-tapi-river-ends-in-muck/articleshow/84594431.cms||---

The SC rejected the government plea as it was filed after 650 days when it was required to be filed within 30 days. On the same ground, the court did not consider the petitions of a mining company as it was filed after two years. Mining in Goa came to a halt in March 2018 following the apex court’s decision to quash the second renewal of 88 mining leases. The apex court noted that four review petitions preferred by the state had a delay of 650 to 651 days and four pleas are filed by Vedanta Limited (formerly known as Sesa Sterlite Limited) had a delay of 907 day. The top court also observed that “ an application for review of a judgement has to be filed within thirty days of the date of the judgement or order that is sought to be reviewed”. A division bench comprising justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah observed, “No cogent grounds have been furnished for the delay between 20 and 26 months by the two parties in filing their applications for review. The judges comprising the two-judge bench in Goa Foundation II, justices M B Lokur and Deepak Gupta, retired from this Court on December 30, 2018 and May 6, 2020, respectively”. The SC observed that the state of Goa filed its review petitions in November 2019, after Lokur’s retirement, and Vedanta filed its petitions in August 2020, after Gupta’s retirement. “Such practice must be firmly disapproved (of) to preserve the institutional sanctity of the decision-making of this court. The review petitioners were aware of the decision of this court,” the bench held. “Keeping in mind the above, we are inclined to dismiss these review petitions on the ground of limitation alone. However, in any event, we also find that no legitimate grounds for review of the judgment in Goa Foundation II have been made out, and dismiss these review petitions on merits as well,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sc-dismisses-review-pleas-on-mining-slams-govt-vedanta/articleshow/84599065.cms||Murari Shetye

The government had last revised the basic land values in August 2013. It has not revised the rates since then though there is a provision in the Registration Act. Thanks to the economic slowdown, the pandemic, lockdowns and elections, the government did not revise the values. Once the cabinet sub-committee on resource mobilisation gave the green signal, it went ahead with the revision of rates. “After formation of Telangana state, there has been a substantial appreciation of land values owing to significant growth in IT, pharma, tourism sectors and infrastructure projects and formation of new districts. Thanks to new irrigation projects, vast swathes of ayacut have been developed leading to a considerable increase in the land values,” a senior registration department official said. Registration deputy inspector general P Subba Rao said despite the rates had been enhanced, they are nominal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/land-values-last-revised-in-aug-2013/articleshow/84600931.cms||---

Interestingly, data provided by the state government in the recent budget session of the assembly said that cancer cases have been on the decline over the past three years, ending 2019. “The number of cancer patients in Gujarat have been increasing. Especially in Saurashtra, there is a lot of prevalence of oral cancer among men because of chewing of tobacco. There are also a lot of instances of breast cancer among women,” Rupani said on Tuesday, while inaugurating a government cancer hospital at Bhavnagar. He added, “Treatment of cancer is very expensive in private hospitals. The instruments used in treatment of cancer are also extremely expensive, each costing around Rs 25 crore. The government has set up cancer hospitals in Rajkot, Jamnagar and Bhavnagar to provide free cancer treatment for people.” In reply to a question by Dasada MLA Naushad Solanki in the recently held budget session of the assembly, the state government provided figures on cancer cases over the past five years. According to government figures, the number of cancer cases registered in 2016 stood at 16,224, which have been reducing steadily and 14,179 cases were registered in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/chewing-tobacco-fuelling-oral-cancer-cm/articleshow/84599137.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur University first in state to reduce fees for students due to Covid-19 pandemic||NAGPUR: The Nagpur University has become the first in Maharashtra to formally reduce fees in the backdrop of Covid-19 pandemic, giving much needed respite to over 3.5 lakh students. It formally issued a notification on Tuesday after its Management Council approved the decision at its Friday meeting. The waiver would be applicable from the new academic year, 2021-22, which commenced from this month. It however excluded any cuts in tuition and term fees charged by colleges. TOI has been tracking the issue by consistently highlighting demands made by various students’ organisations and parents due to pandemic induced lockdowns, which adversely affected earnings of a majority of citizens and drained their savings. As per the notification, the university has reduced fees from 50% to 100% under various heads, while taking care that private colleges do not suffer. “It’s indeed a historic decision for lakhs of students and we’re the first in Maharashtra to do so. Even higher education minister Uday Samant appreciated NU’s efforts in this direction. Though we decided to grant 100% waiver in examination fees, we’ve agreed to limit it to 75%, with the view that its sanctity should be maintained. A majority of NU students avail scholarships, but those who aren’t eligible for it would be immensely benefited,” NU Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable said. Management Council member Vishnu Changde, who was fighting with NU administration for providing 100% fee waiver since long, and even submitted many representations in this regard, said all colleges had to compulsorily provide benefits announced by NU, else strong action could be initiated against them. “Though the Management Council members were in favour of complete waiver, the NU administration was reluctant, as it would have suffered a big loss of around Rs 75 crore. We then calculated all expenses and deliberated on it over multiple meetings on the issue. Still, NU is suffering losses to the tune of Rs 30-40 crore.” Lauding NU administration for the historic move, Changde, who was part of the NU panel constituted for the purpose, said the university had waived off about Rs 390 charged per student under various heads from private colleges. “There will be 50% concession in laboratory, library, and NU development charges, while no waiver would be provided for entry fee, students’ identity card, insurance and enrolment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nu-1st-in-state-to-reduce-fees-for-students-due-to-covid-19-pandemic/articleshow/84599083.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

A few more heavy spells in the coming days will help achieve the season’s average rainfall of 2,205 mm. Till Tuesday the city had recorded 87.6% of the season’s average rains. Meanwhile, in July alone, India Meteorological Department (IMD)’s Santacruz observatory recorded 971 mm of rains, which has exceeded the July average of 827 mm. In the nine hours that ended at 5.30pm on Tuesday, the IMD Colaba observatory recorded moderate rains of 35.4mm and IMD Santacruz observatory recorded 38.4mm rains. According to IMD officials, heavy rains are likely to continue in Mumbai and adjoining areas in the coming days. The weather alert for Tuesday was downgraded from an orange alert to a yellow alert. However, an orange alert is in place for Mumbai from Wednesday to Friday (July 21-July 23) indicating heavy to very heavy rainfall. A yellow alert has been issued for Saturday, indicating a decrease in rain activity. The IMD has issued a red alert for Raigad for July 21-22, indicating extremely heavy rains. Stocks in the seven lakes supplying water to Mumbai rose to 4.8 lakh million litres or 33.2% as on 6 am Tuesday from 4.2 lakh million litres or 28.7% on Monday. So far, only the two smaller lakes —Tulsi and Vihar —have overflowed. “Monsoon remained active to vigorous over most parts of Maharashtra. Most parts of Konkan—Goa and the ghat areas of Madhya Maharashtra—received widespread rainfall with heavy to very rainfall at a few places and isolated extremely heavy rainfall. Fairly widespread light to moderate rainfall occurred over Marathwada too. Owing to the existing weather condition, southwesterly monsoon flow is expected to strengthen, and the rainfall distribution and activity is expected to increase over the region,” said IMD. The weather systems currently prevailing include an off-shore trough at mean sea level, which runs from Maharashtra coast to the coast of Karnataka. It is likely to persist for the next three to four days. The meteorological department said that there was a cyclonic circulation over south Gujarat region and its vicinity at 3.6 km above mean sea level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-incessant-downpour-brings-city-close-to-2000mm-rainfall-mark/articleshow/84599152.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Revenue under secretary nudged out of secretariat||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Indicating that it will not budge to the pressure from a section of the secretariat employees, the government has transferred the revenue department official who parted with the information regarding the illegal tree felling, under the RTI Act, to a post outside the secretariat. The government transferred Salini O G, who was serving as under secretary in the revenue department, as the assistant director in higher secondary section in the directorate of general education. The move from the government comes at a time when the secretariat action council has launched a protest against the government seeking reinstatement of the cancelled “good service entry” for the official and the removal of principal secretary (revenue) A Jayathilak from the post. With her transfer, the government has transferred all the officials who had strongly opposed the revenue department’s earlier decisions that had led to issuing the controversial order on October 24, last year, that was used by the law breakers to mow down large numbers of trees illegally. Earlier, Jayathilak had issued an order on Thursday, cancelling the good service entry of Salini, citing that the integrity of the officer is doubtful. Interestingly, it was on April 1 this year, that another order was issued giving her a good service entry, citing that she “was an inspiration, the right guide and good superior officer for the assistants as a section officer.” After the revenue department’s files came out in the public under the RTI Act, she was also forced to avail leave for two months, reportedly after being admonished by the higher ups. Earlier, the government had transferred additional secretaries Girija Kumari G and Bency J, from the revenue department. While Girija Kumari had written a strong note against issuing the order dated October 24, last year, Bency is the president of pro-UDF Kerala Secretariat Association (KSA) and also the convener of the secretariat action council which is protesting against Jayathilak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/revenue-under-secy-nudged-out-of-secretariat/articleshow/84599173.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Ensuring gender justice in Covid vaccination||Since the onset of the pandemic, evidences have poured in from across countries that Covid-19 has amplified existing inequalities. There have been concerted efforts to utilize the pandemic as an opportunity to ‘build back better’ and transform structural gender inequalities. Uttar Pradesh is preparing for a vaccination drive of an unprecedented scale: near-universal coverage among adult population by the end of the year. It is imperative at this juncture to look at the fault lines of gender inequality that can impact Covid vaccination negatively and take precautionary steps to ensure gender justice in the spirit of building back better. Understanding gender disparity The available evidences on vaccination reveal that more men have been vaccinated than women. Analysis of state-wise data finds that more women have been vaccinated proportionally only in Kerala, Chhattisgarh and Himachal Pradesh. Data is available for 729 districts and more men have been vaccinated in 620 or 85% of the districts. In 16 states and Union territories, there is not a single district where women have outnumbered men. The most populous states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and even Delhi, belong to this category. This would mean that the demographic advantages of women in Uttar Pradesh, as stated earlier, have not given them any proportional lead in vaccination. In Uttar Pradesh, there are 1,58,000 ASHA workers, 38,277 ANM, 1,63,731 Anganwadi workers and 1,49,641 Anganwadi Sahayikas: a total of 5,09,649 women workers. As per CoWin portal data, the estimated healthcare workers (HCW) in the state are 10,09,876. Of this, 96% have received the first dose and 74% have completed both doses as of June 27. The total estimated population of 18-plus age group is 13.6 crore. Of them, 19% have received first dose and 3% have completed both doses. Against this, let us understand gender disparity. Since majority of health workers and frontline workers are women, we expected more women in the first phase of vaccination which included healthcare workers. In the second phase too, going by the demographic characteristics, more women could have been vaccinated as we have more women in the age group of 60-plus than men. In the working age group of 18-plus too, UP will have more women due to largescale outmigration of men (even after accounting for skewed sex ratio). In terms of absolute numbers, Uttar Pradesh has administered an impressive 4 crore doses. Nonetheless, the huge denominator (13.6 crore) and the proportionality to be maintained vis-a-vis gender and equity pose significant challenges. Without harping on the gender disaggregated coverage data in UP, what is discrete at this juncture would be to take cognizance of the bottlenecks and strategize accordingly. Acknowledging and overcoming gender barriers A deeper understanding of how gender roles, norms and relations and gender inequality influence access to, and demand for, vaccines in different contexts is critical for expanding the reach In UP, gender dynamics vary across regions. Poverty may not be a decisive factor in western UP but restrictions on mobility can nullify the relative wealth status. In Terai, Bundhelkhand and Purvanchal, a combination of caste, poverty, illiteracy, gender-based restrictions and lack of transport facility make quite a challenging situation for women. Poor and the socially marginalized communities are located away from the main part of the village and approach roads are not often well-maintained. Most of the frontline women workers do not have own vehicles and this leads to many under-served hamlets in gram panchayats. Caste and religion-based prejudices of frontline workers further complicate the situation. Hamlets of Mushahaar and other communities are examples of such under-served areas within a gram panchayat. Women of these communities face multiple levels of discrimination. Finding solutions Covid vaccination is a public health prerequisite. The department of health leads it but needs support from all departments, especially those into provisioning of public services to rural and urban poor. Quest for a fairer world is not new and the pandemic has only reiterated that fairness and inclusion are non-negotiable principles to survive. Gender justice in vaccination can be a significant step in this direction. • Adjust the vaccination outreach timing with the convenience of women to participate and for men to bring them. For example, bazaar day evenings make it convenient for both rural women and men. This can cause administrative challenges as outreach activities also tend to be organized around working hours. • Plan for vaccine education and focused coverage of women through existing structures and schemes such as SHGs, MNREGA and women business correspondents. According to NRLM website, UP has mobilized 50.3 lakh rural women into SHGs, numbering 4.7 lakh. Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Day organized by the frontline health workers every week needs to have special sessions on vaccine education. • The social welfare department reaches out to 51 lakh people through old age and widow pension. Since these numbers at village level are quite manageable, panchayats can ensure 100% coverage of 60-plus, widowed and disabled women. Panchayats can be motivated to achieve 100% vaccine coverage. • Engaging with men’s groups is also an effective strategy to promote vaccine among women family members. There are umpteen numbers of cooperatives and farmers’ groups, farmer’s producer groups, which are dominated by male members. • Make communication campaigns that connect with the rural women. Though social media and celebrities have been identified and used as potential platforms to reach out to middle-class young adult age group, reach to rural youth needs amplification. Informal youth clubs needs to be mapped out at block and district level to cover more peri-urban and rural young adults.

The government said the allegations levelled at this point on confining the competition and less realisation of bid amount or favouring certain firms were imaginary, unfounded and not based on facts. “They are aimed at maligning the extremely transparent process and reputation of state and government of India’s agencies,” it said and added that it would not hesitate to file defamation suit against those making unfounded allegations. The HMDA said the online bid process was conducted by MSTC, a GoI agency, specialised in conducting e-auctions. It said the entire process of auction was done in a transparent manner without giving any scope to any possible complaint. The prospective buyers were given login and passwords and it was not possible for anyone, including the auctioning agency such as HMDA or TSIIC, to know the details of bidders at any point during the bid process. It was only at the conclusion of bid that MSTC had formally declared the firm who won the bid, the HMDA explained. It also said auctioning of government lands for various purposes — residential layouts or commercial or institutional — was nothing new and had happened regularly in unified AP and elsewhere in the country. Authorities such as Delhi Development Authority in Delhi and similar state bodies in Maharashtra, Karnataka and UP, among others, have been conducting such auctions regularly, it pointed out.

Fifty per cent of the staff in my firm was sacked, I was among them. Even a year later, I have not got the job back,” says Pathan. Covid-19 hit the entire economy hard – especially during the second wave. The market, which was just recovering from the effects of the first Covid year, plunged back into despair and apprehension. Many business establishments shut shops, whereas those that kept afloat cut the personnel drastically to reduce budget. Those at the bottom of the pyramid were hit the hardest. Sejal Parmar, a 27-year-old from Rajpur in Gomtipur said, “We borrow money from others every month. My landlord has tried to evict me. My friends and I have had to sell off our jewellery just to ensure a roof over our heads”. She used to pack handkerchiefs for a garment company and earned Rs 4,000 every month. Due to drop in sales, the entire clothing industry took a hit. She and countless others like her were left jobless after the first lockdown. Dinesh Parmar, 42, a resident of Dariapur who works with a travel firm, said “I used to earn Rs 45,000 before the pandemic. Now, I only earn Rs 10,000. All 20 drivers were released from their jobs and are now called as and when required.” He added, “I have two daughters studying in science stream. I am not able pay their tuition fees of Rs 70,000.” Jyotsna Parmar, 54, a resident of Saraspur, was working at a nearby mill. “Due to my age, nobody is going to hire me.

---||Chandigarh||In Mohali, government buildings owe civic body Rs 12 crore tax||MOHALI: With government buildings in Mohali owing around Rs 12 crore as property tax to the municipal corporation, they have emerged as major property tax defaulters. The civic body has finally issued a demi official (DO) letter to police headquarters, deputy commissioner’s office and Greater Mohali Area Developmental Authority (Gmada) for default in property tax submission. Gmada, under its various properties like sports complexes, showrooms, booths, community centres, possessed plots and various grounds let out to real estate companies owes Rs 6 crore, said an official. “The Gmada owned sports complex owes Rs 50 lakh property tax to the MC. Three sports complexes in Mohali are under Gmada and many commercial properties, like the Gmada showroom owe property tax worth crores. The Gmada building in Mohali also owes property tax whereas PUDA Bhawan building is paying tax regularly,” said a senior MC officer. According to MC records, apart from Gmada, police headquarters is the biggest defaulter of property tax. It owes Rs 1.5 crore, which includes the police headquarter building and various police stations. This is followed by the DC Office, which owes Rs 15 lakh to the MC. The police department, along with Gmada owned sports complexes, tops the MC’s list of property tax defaulters in Mohali, followed by the old administrative complex building, Gmada head office building, civil surgeon’s office, Forest Complex, agriculture office and BSNL building. The civic body's official list of nonpayers shows the police department topping the chart with dues worth Rs 1.5 crore, of which Phase 11 police station owes Rs 8 lakh, phase 8 owes Rs 38 lakh, Sector 65 police station owes Rs 8.5 lakh, Sector 66 owes Rs 7.7 lakh, phase 1 police station owes Rs 5.5 lakh and Sohana police station owes Rs 4.5 lakh. The excise department building in Sector 69 owes Rs 7.8 lakh, Forest Complex in Sector 68 owes Rs 15 lakh, civil surgeon’s office, including PHS building, owes Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh to the MC. Civic body records show that Mohali has 52,678 properties. Of these, 41,082 are residential, 4,929 commercial, 1,683 are industrial and 4,984 are vacant plots. Of these, 24,406 are taxable and 7,826 are defaulters. MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said, “Property tax is the major revenue source and the MC is fund starved. There are over 50-odd building owners who have not paid dues. The police department owes us money, so do government-owned Gmada and the civil surgeon’s office. We have issued DO letters to them.” The police department, he said, was refusing to pay the dues claiming that the owner of the old police complex was responsible for clearing them. All the defaulters have been issued notices under Section 138(c) of the Punjab Municipal Corporation Act 1976, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohalis-govt-buildings-are-major-property-tax-defaulters/articleshow/84594499.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

But about 10 days since a tigress and her cub tore apart two men and ate one of them — as a friend of theirs, who survived by climbing a tree, had to watch — there has been no sign of either big cat at the spot in Pilibhit Tiger Reserve’s Deoria range. And that has kept locals and forest officials on their toes. “Despite monitoring for over a week, not a single image of the tigers has come up in the camera traps,” deputy director of the reserve, Naveen Khandelwal said. “They may have migrated to another forest beat … They appear to have crossed the Khannaut river (which runs through the range and is just half a kilometre from the spot). The forest on the other side has a dense herbivore population.” A member of WWF, which is helping the forest department in its search operation along with the Wildlife Trust of India, said “disturbances” in the area — lights, vehicles, humans — since the attack may have driven the tigress and her cub off. Tigers do not usually attack humans. They may do so only under some circumstances — if a human comes too close accidentally, if a tiger mistakes a human for an animal (when someone crouches, for instance), or when a tigress is with her cub. When the body of Kandhai Lal, 35, half of it eaten away, was found by villagers in the area, there was considerable alarm. His nephew Sonu Kumar, 22, had also been killed. The only survivor, Vikas, 23, would later tell TOI that it was his helmet that saved him that day. “I could hear his screams for a few seconds and then it stopped. Sonu was killed in front of me,” he had said. Atop a tree beneath which the cub roamed all night, Vikas saw Kandhai dragged away by the tigress. Since that day, the forest department has placed 26 motion sensor cameras in the area to keep an eye out for the tigress and her cub. “We may change the location of the camera based on information about the movement of tigers,” Khandelwal said. But locals are apprehensive. “We are still scared and are moving in groups. Our lives have been affected. No compensation has been given to the families of the deceased. They were attacked on the road, not in the forest,” said Rajendra Prasad, who lives in a village near the range. “The forest department is doing nothing to capture the tigers.” It is this simmering potential conflict that is worrying forest officials, who don’t want to allow another attack from either side. Khandelwal said, “Our officials are alerting those in villages nearby to report any movement of adult or sub-adult tigers they may see."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/tigress-cub-that-killed-2-men-in-up-may-have-moved-officials-on-lookout-to-prevent-rerun/articleshow/84594518.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Last year, he had cleaned the choked gutter in his locality. Ashok Talajiya, a mobile repairer, told TOI water has been entering his flat in Ashwin Nagar complex since the heavy downpour in 2017. He says since then, 30 minutes of heavy rain is enough to turn his home into a pool. After the heavy downpour in the wee hours of Sunday, rain water entered his flat once again. On Monday, Talajiya, who has not taken his Covid-19 vaccine yet, protested in the murky waters from 2.30 pm to 4 pm . He said the gutter flowing near his complex has not been cleaned by the Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation (VVMC) for five years. He says in 2017, he suffered losses worth Rs1.5 lakh. To safeguard against future damage, he purchased paver blocks and placed his bed, refrigerator, washing machine and other household items on them. “On Sunday, when the water began touching the paver blocks, I got worried. I cannot afford any more losses,” said Talajiya, who stays with his wife, daughter and son. Talajiya says he visited the VMMC with his complaints on March 30 and April 28. He said other ground floor flats in ‘D’ wing also get flooded, but his home is the worst hit as it is a corner flat. The complex comprises 15 residential buildings. A video of the protest went viral, but municipal commissioner D Gangatharan said they could not locate him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-with-water-inside-home-vasai-sr-citizen-protests-on-flooded-street/articleshow/84599183.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Three floodgates of Himayatsagar reservoir opened by HMWSSB||HYDERABAD: With heavy inflows reaching beyond full tank level (FTL) of the Himayatsagar reservoir (1763.5 feet), officials of Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) opened three floodgates at around 4.30pm on Tuesday. The water level at Himayatsagar touched 1763 feet against the FTL of 1763.5 feet at around 2pm on Tuesday. An emergency meeting was convened then at HMWS&SB main office, Khairatabad, with senior water board officials and it was decided to open the floodgates. Water board officials had originally planned to open four floodgates, but keeping in view the inflows into the water body, officials revised their plan and decided to open three floodgates only. “Three out of 17 floodgates were opened to a height of one feet each for releasing excess flood water into Musi river,” said managing director, HMWS&SB, M Dana Kishore in an official release. “People should not move along Musi as a heavy volume of water is flowing,” Kishore warned. Officials are assessing the arrival of the inflows at the reservoir in the next few hours, and will decide whether to open a few more floodgates, a senior HMWSSB official told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/3-floodgates-of-himayatsagar-reservoir-opened-by-hmwssb/articleshow/84601010.cms||Sunil Mungara

Greater Chennai Corporation is working to set up upgraded toilet complexes, replete with food courts that have vending machines and electric vehicle charging stations, on small plots across the city. Zonal authorities have begun scouting for locations along East Coast Road (ECR), Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR) and some areas in central Chennai where the project can be carried out on a pilot basis, a senior official said. If successful, the civic body could scale up the project to install at least 1,000-1,500 such complexes. People can use the toilets for free and maintenance cost would come from the revenue collected via the food courts and other amenities, an official said. Contractor Sign Tec Urbaninfra Furnitures (STAF) is executing this project. Aside from colour-coded toilets for men and women, the complex will also have provisions for those with physical disabilities. All locations will have ramps. Toilets for women will come with sanitary napkin vending and disposal machines. Mother care centres are also planned at some complexes. A high pressure pump would ensure that water supply to the toilets is replenished within six seconds, said STAF CEO R Sridar. The toilets would be equipped with UV lighting to kill germs and a shower-type cleaning system with all operations completely handled by IOT. It will also have special alarms which will go off in case of vandalism. “The cleaning process can be programmed in different modes,” Sridar said. The UV technology has been sourced from the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). The toilets are likely to be called ‘Unga toilet’ or ‘GCC smart toilets’. The toilet itself will be a concrete-cast. It can be installed at the location over one or two nights causing minimum disruption to traffic, Sridar said. “In a city like Chennai even places away from the sea face corrosion. Concrete toilets will have a lifespan of 50 years, higher than the metal toilets,” he added. In case of vandalism, the system will send an alert to the local corporation area engineer prompting a quick visit to the spot, if necessary. The safety cameras installed on site can be linked to the civic body’s command and control centre, Sridar said. A similar model had been commissioned for the Trichy corporation under the smart city project just before the first wave of Covid-19. Multiple models have been presented by the contractor. For instance, some locations will have EV charging stations for four-wheelers, while some others will have ‘battery swap’ technology for autos.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/loo-and-behold-food-courts-charging-stns-on-the-go/articleshow/84596953.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar

The party held press conferences at 18 state capitals as CMs of the BJP ruled states alleged that Congress has become a party to an “international conspiracy” to defame the country and PM Modi.  Questioning the timing of the expose which came a day before the start of the Parliament session, in which it has been reported that phones of around 40 journalists, political leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, doctors etc were being tapped, Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath said this would definitely hurt the country’s image abroad. He alleged that such a sensational charge was made a day before the Parliament session commenced in order to vitiate the environment and reflected on the falling standards of politics. “Due to negativity by the opposition during Covid, India’s has already been hurt extensively but now the opposition is making baseless allegations in trying to malign the country’s leadership. It seems to have become its agenda to spoil India’s image,” he said. Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said the use of Israeli technology to spy on people by tapping their phones came just when the government had managed to control the second wave of Covid. Shivraj Singh Chouhan (MP), Vijay Rupani (Gujarat) and all other CMs, leaders of opposition in states where the party is not in power held the press meet, which were organised at different time intervals. “Congress has become politically insignificant… what would one get by spying on their leaders. Congress did not even allow the PM to introduce his ministers in Parliament, which reflects their mindset,” Chouhan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-fields-cms-to-blunt-congress-attack/articleshow/84602488.cms||---

Irinjalakuda police was investigating the case so far, but since the amount involved in the fraud was over Rs 100 crore as per preliminary estimates, district rural police chief G Poonguzhali decided to hand over the case to the district rural crime branch wing headed by DSP Shaj Jose. As per the police department circular, probes into fraud above Rs 5 crore have to be handed over to the crime branch, she said. Meanwhile, joint registrar of the state cooperative department Mohan Mon has submitted a report to the registrar of cooperative societies P B Nooh as per the directive of the latter. “I have received the report and will respond after studying it. I will be visiting the bank this week itself. The department will be taking strong actions against those who have erred. There will also be steps to recoup the money that has been lost to the bank,” Nooh said. CPM district secretary M M Varghese denied the allegations of the BJP and Congress that the fraud had taken place with the connivance of the CPM leaders. “They can say whatever they want. The probe is on and some actions have already been initiated. Strong actions will be taken if any of the party activists were found to be involved in the fraud. It is true that undesirable developments had taken place there (at the bank). The CPM will not protect any corrupt persons,” Varghese said. More details are emerging about the dimensions of the fraud that took place at the bank. As per the audit report of the joint registrar, the bank has allocated loans to several individuals above the permitted levels. Multiple loans have been sanctioned on the same property surrendered as surety, the report said. According to the audit report, some loans have been allocated without retaining any documents as collateral, while some other loans have been sanctioned based on the title deeds of the properties which have already been sold off. BJP is protesting demanding arrest of the CPM leader involved in the fraud.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cb-to-investigate-co-op-bank-fraud/articleshow/84599229.cms||T Ramavarman

Police arrested Kanti Manat, a farm labourer in his 30s, from Ganthiol village about 12 km from Idar town. The accused was hiding there after committing the crime, said police. Manat was charged for abduction and rape under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and under various sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. According to police, the incident came to light on Monday when somebody informed the police about the 11-year-old girl who had gone missing. “When we reached the village we found the girl crying outside her house. Upon inquiring, the girl revealed that her next-door neighbour Manat had lured her with chocolate and mobile phone,” said police. Manat first took the girl under a small bridge and raped her. Despite the girl being in pain, the accused took her to an adjoining farm and raped her again, added police. Police inspector J A Rathwa said when her mother inquired with Manat’s wife, she told her that the girl had gone to the market with her husband. Based on the girl’s statement, police traced Manat and arrested him on Monday night. Rathwa said that the girl was admitted to hospital for treatment and would undergo medical tests there.

---||Bareilly||Moradabad: Liquor smuggler who won polls takes oath even as cops ‘look’ for him||MORADABAD: Ever since he won the panchayat election, Sanjay Singh had been on the run. In February, he had been arrested with 30,000 litre of spurious alcohol worth Rs 50 lakh. By May, he was out on bail and had become the pradhan of Niwaad Khas village in Moradabad. He took oath while police were still looking for him. He was eventually arrested but the investigation into how he pulled this off appears to point to police complicity — four cops were on Tuesday attached to police lines for alleged foul play. “Moradabad Police had conducted an investigation but senior officials were not convinced. They suspected Bhagatpur Police (under whose jurisdiction the village lies). A fresh probe was then ordered by Moradabad range DIG Shalabh Mathur, which was conducted by Bijnor Police,” Moradabad SSP Pawan Kumar said. “The investigation found that there had been foul play. Four cops — SHO Dharmendra Singh, sub inspector Mahesh Chandra Sharma, constables Mohit Nautiyal and Saroj — have been attached to police lines.” He did not go into the details of what “foul play” they are believed to have engaged in. Singh, in his early 40s, was an old hand in the liquor smuggling business. In fact, it was an old associate who gave him away. Bunty Saini, a gangster, had been working with Singh to manufacture spurious liquor and package them in branded bottles before selling them off. He, too, would be in and out of jail. When Saini was arrested on May 25, right after the rural polls, he spilled the beans on Singh. Police had been frantically looking for Singh at the time, having invoked the Gangster Act against him three days after the panchayat poll results were announced. A Special Task Force was formed and a Rs 20,000-reward announced for information that would lead to his arrest. While police scoured village after village, Singh appeared in Niwaad Khas quietly and took oath as pradhan. Saini told the cops. Eventually, Singh was arrested from an auto stand in Moradabad in May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/liquor-smuggling-leader-takes-oath-as-police-look-for-him-4-cops-face-inquiry-for-foul-play/articleshow/84594551.cms||Maria Khan

The revenue authorities are vigilant to tackle the flood situation. As three floodgates are being opened by the HMWS&SB, there could be major impact on areas that are inundated with flood water, Hyderabad sub-divisional revenue officer, Venkateswarlu told TOI. This is the second consecutive year in which the floodgates of this reservoir were opened. In October 2020, 13 out of 17 floodgates were opened after 25,000 cusecs of excess flood water had touched the reservoir’s FTL. Prior to opening the floodgates, the water board staff activated the siren, which covers a radius of around 25 kilometres of the reservoir, as an alert. In fact, keeping in view the inflows and anticipating reaching the FTL mark, the water board alerted the Hyderabad district administration. Soon after the alert of floodgates opening was received from the HMWS&SB officials, our revenue staff vacated nearly 100 families who were temporarily put up in shelters along the shore areas of Musi river, added Venkateswarlu. Apart from this, dhobhis who used to wash clothes at Bapu Ghat, Chaderghat and other parts where Musi water flows, were restricted from the washing, said a revenue official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-authorities-on-alert-as-gates-opened/articleshow/84601043.cms||---

Popularly known for his plays, especially his work in revival and popularity of ‘Nagri Nautanki’ across the country, breathed his last at his Lucknow home after suffering from intestinal malignancy and cancer. Tributes poured in from his students, close friends, theatre artists and others, who were closely associated with him, on social media shortly after they received the news of his passing away. A native of Dehradun, Thapliyal’s connections with Lucknow began when he shifted to the city in 1965 after getting a job in All India Radio (AIR) as a newsreader. Shortly after moving to the city, he completed his PhD in dialectal theatre from Lucknow University. An actor since the age of 9 when he began taking part in Ram Leela in his native city of Garhwal and played the role of ‘Sita’, his interest in the popular art form of ‘nautanki’ after shifting to Lucknow came natural to him. After learning the nuances of it, Thapliyal, while working for AIR, introduced ‘Nagri Nautanki’ (nautanki mixed with urban touch) to the audience during a few minutes left blank after news was aired on the radio. “His primary intention was to revive the art form and bring it to the urban audience, coupled with his creativeness. His famous work ‘Harish Chander ki Ladai’ (1984) was acclaimed so much that it ran in a number of cities and is still staged. Apart from working towards artists understanding the importance of nautanki, he also contributed towards modern theatre,” said theatre director Surya Mohan Kulshreshtha. Remembering the time when Thapliyal was called for a theatre workshop at Bhartendu Natya Akademi when Mohan was the director, he said, “I was always in awe of his unbridled creativity. But the fact that he was so warm with new and upcoming artists too, teaching them and making them perform in a disciplined way, made me respect him more.” Thapliyal went on to become one of the founding members of noted theatre group ‘Darpan’ in Lucknow in 1974. From then on, the theatre director went on to write over a hundred of dramas including ‘Yahudi ki Beti’, ‘Suraj Kahan Se Ugta Hai’, among others. The latest one being ‘Hey Brecht’, which was staged in 2020, before the pandemic. “There was no Hindi newspaper publication or magazine which didn’t publish Thapliyal ji’s writing. He was a multi-dimensional personality. He swooned the audience with his works which will be remembered for a long time,” said Rakesh Veda, chairman of IPTA Lucknow. Prof Roop Rekha Verma remembered the noted director when she invited him to judge a few theatre competitions in Lucknow University. “He was a product of the University and inviting him to judge theatre-based competitions was an honour for me. Students who participated learnt a lot since he gave suggestions to them and how they can improve their skills. Lucknow lost another gem, after Yogesh Praveen ji,” she added. Thapliyal is survived by his wife, a son, and a daughter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/theatre-doyen-urmil-thapliyal-passes-away-at-80/articleshow/84601071.cms||Aditi Singh

After the II PU exams were cancelled because of the pandemic, a 12-member technical committee was formed to fix a formula to award marks for students. “Unlike SSLC which has six subjects, II PU has 38. Therefore, we were not able to conduct exams. Students unhappy with the marks can write the exams from August 19 to September 3 without paying fees. Those opting for this exam cannot switch back to the marks announced now,” said S Suresh Kumar, minister for primary and secondary education. A total of 6,66,497 students were declared pass.

---||Vadodara||For Rs 10, consumer rights activist loses face in court||Surat: A consumer rights activist’s desperation to take a legal approach against a prominent mall in Vadodara instead of amicably settling the issue has ended in an embarrassment for him. The activist Mukesh Shah had dragged Inorbit Mall in Vadodara to court claiming that he did not get back his parking charges of Rs 10 because of the mall’s mishandling of his vehicle. According to the mall’s parking policy, people can get the parking charges back if they exit the mall within an hour. Shah said he visited the mall on December 23 in 2019 and paid Rs 10 for parking his two-wheeler. He claimed that he spent only 30 minutes inside the mall, but as the parking lot was full, it took him 15 minutes to park his vehicle. When he went back to the parking lot to leave, he noticed that the two-wheeler was moved to some other corner. He complained that as his vehicle was shifted, it took him 45 minutes to find it and take it out due to which he could not take advantage of the one-hour free parking policy. Approaching the consumer court in Vadodara, Shah requested the mall to deposit Rs 4.9 lakh in consumer welfare fund. During the hearing, the mall presented copies of footage of CCTV cameras which showed that Shah had entered the mall at 6.35pm and exited at 7.26 pm. It also argued that Shah was eligible for the refund, but he did not ask for it. The consumer forum upheld the argument and further noted that during festive seasons, malls’ parking areas become full due to which vehicles are moved. “But in this case, the complainant’s vehicle was neither lost nor damaged and he did not collect the parking charges back, so there is no justification for the complaint,” the court stated while turning down the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/for-rs-10-consumer-rights-activist-loses-face-in-court/articleshow/84594663.cms||---

It cautioned the public against striking purchase agreements with real estate projects that have not been registered with Rera. K-Rera chairman P H Kurian, in a statement on Tuesday, said the public should be vigilant against real estate promoters who try to sell off unregistered villas, flats, plots and commercial places. According to Kurian, the authority has taken note of the advertisements of unregistered projects and notices have been issued to the promoters. “Before inking agreements with the real estate promoters, the public should visit the rera.kerala.gov.in web portal to ensure that the project in question and its details are registered with Rera,” he said. Rules insist that Rera registration numbers should be displayed in the real estate project advertisements and brochures. “Agents and brokers don’t have the right to sell the properties before obtaining the clearance of Rera. Those who publish advertisements or strike agreements in violation of the mandatory rules would be inviting a fine of Rs 10,000 per day. The penalty can go up to 5% of the total project cost,” the statement said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/k-rera-warns-against-violations/articleshow/84599297.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: S Ward report had warned of inaction against dangerous structures on hills||MUMBAI: An internal civic report drafted prior to the monsoons this year by the city’s S Ward—where 10 people living on a hilltop died in a landslide two days ago—warned that an unwritten policy to tolerate dangerous structures was demoralising its staff and called for penal action against owners and tenants of such structures. The report said due to high rents and increase in migration, many in the ward were compelled to stay in unauthorized, unsafe locations. It pegged the population of squatters living in dangerous conditions, such as on hillsides, at 4-5 lakh. The district disaster management plan says S ward comprising Bhandup, Vikhroli, Kanjurmarg and parts of Powai has 152 disaster-prone spots listed, the maximum in the city. Underlining the precarious situation in the ward, a civic official said when disaster strikes in landslide-prone areas, even bringing in rescue and civic machinery proves difficult, as seen in Sunday’s operation. “It was very difficult to conduct search operations and remove debris, which still remains to a large extent as there is no access road,” said officials. With diggers working manually, the last dead body in the Vikhroli tragedy could be extricated only around 12 hours after the incident. A similar incident had taken place in the same location at Surya Nagar in August 2017 when three were killed in a landslide. The S Ward report said the unwritten policy to tolerate illegal structures or provide them protection was sending a wrong message down the line to enforcement staff and putting greater burden on authorities. To change the situation, penal action is needed against owners and tenants of such structures, it said while calling for a dedicated force to speed up demolitions along with outsourcing of labour, machinery for effective control over operations. The report said urgent attention is needed on slums with a height of more than 14 feet, which must be evacuated “with the help of police.” Refuting allegations that illegal structures in the area enjoyed political protection, BJP MP Manoj Kotak said, “A survey identifying landslide prone areas was already done. In July 2020, in a letter sent the district planning officer at the suburban collector office, I had cautioned about such a disaster along the hilly areas and said there’s a need for a retaining wall to be constructed. But no funds were sanctioned… every authority kept passing the buck… while the number of such structures kept growing under the nose of civic officials,” said Kotak. Activists say the larger problem of a housing shortage needs to be addressed by authorities while taking action. Roshni Nuggehalli, executive director, NGO Youth for Unity and Voluntary Action (YUVA), said, “People are forced to live in such areas, without the most basic services like water and toilets only because that’s what they can afford…in this case, permanent rehabilitation for people affected must be provided.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-s-ward-report-had-warned-of-inaction-against-dangerous-structures-on-hills/articleshow/84599291.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Pune||Metro extensions can cover new length, breadth of Pune||PUNE: Shivani Sanap travels daily on her two-wheeler from her home in Khadakwasla to Swargate to reach office. She spends at least one and half hours daily commuting which is getting tougher by the day with increasing traffic on the roads. Like Shivani, thousands of residents from the recently merged 23 villages travel daily to core areas for work. With the inclusion in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), residents from these areas are now expecting an extension of metro services up to their localities to get rid of commuting hassles. The work on two metro lines has been underway, but both lines will primary cater to the citizens within the central areas. Suhas Gedam, who stays on Kharadi-Mundhwa Road, said that extending the metro services to the outskirts is vital after the merger of the 23 villages with the Pune Municipal Corporation limits. Of the 23 villages, six along Khadakwasla Road have been added to the city limits, four from Solapur Road area while another four are from Katraj and adjacent area. Three villages are included from the other side of Katraj-Dehu Road bypass. Wagholi is located beyond Vadgaonsheri on Ahmednagar Road. Hadapsar MLA Chetan Tupe said a series of meetings have been held to improve the public transport services and extend the metro project in the recently merged villages. “We have already demanded a detailed study to extend the metro up to Hadapsar-Loni Kalbhor and Saswad Road. The metro will begin to run in the next few years if the authorities begin with basic planning,” Tupe said. R Shekhar, who works for a private company at Ranjangaon, said, “Ahmednagar Road requires strong public transport utility like the metro. Thousands of vehicles travel every day on the road which is now proving insufficient. This is causing hardships to local residents. The authorities need to act fast.” A senior PMC official said the existing metro plan was drafted more than a decade ago. “The metro ends at Ramwadi and Vanaz which are no more the outskirts as the city’s boundaries have expanded beyond these areas. Swargate is the central part of the city. The metro should get natural extensions up to Wagholi, Kondhwe-Khadakwasla, Chandni Chowk and Katraj,” the official added. The extensions are proposed for around 70km stretches in several directions of the city. The PMC’s standing committee has approved the proposal for extensions over the last few years which include those towards Khadakwasla, Wagholi, Katraj, Warje, Hadapsar and Loni Kalbhor. The MahaMetro which is executing two metro lines Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC)-Swargate and Vanaz-Ramwadi, has said it can prepare a detailed project report (DPR) for the extensions. It has already submitted the DPR of Katraj extension to PMC. A proposal to conduct a similar study up to Chandni Chowk is in the pipeline. An extension from Pimpri to Nigdi has been almost approved. The Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) is implementing Hinjewadi-Shivajinagar metro which will cover part of Mhalunge and will travel from areas nearer Sus and Bavdhan which are among 23 villages merged with the PMC. A study to extend the line from Shivajinagar to Hadapsar and further to Loni Kalbhor and Saswad Road is in the final stages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/metro-extensions-near-best-option-to-cover-new-length-and-breadth-of-pune/articleshow/84597043.cms||Sarang Dastane

---||Pune||Anarock deploys AI-powered platform for digital marketing||Pune: Property consultancy firm Anarock is launching ASTRA, an AI and machine learning-powered platform, to help in digital marketing for mid- and large-size property developers, with a rollout planned for September.Anarock will initially use the platform for its clients marketing needs, with a subscription-based model for its “pro” customers with additional benefits. The platform was developed over two years with its analytics partners. Anarock has started onboarding its clients ahead of the September rollout. A spokesperson for Anarock explained that developers can feed their own data about their projects into ASTRA, which will be matched with the most “likely” leads generated online for housing units from buyers. The leads will be based on data collected through various means, and observation of buyers’ needs and behaviour, such as spending patterns and power, size and location of the apartment needed, etc. The data, according to the spokesperson, will help sell units across all segments, but on the supply side, it will be of most help to larger developers, especially those with unsold inventory of Rs 100 crore and above, for adequate ROI.“Developers retain complete control of their data. The system does not require customer contact details to analyse leads. Rather, it crunches data of micro-market catchment dynamics, local price sensitivity, historic sales trends, and the impact of upcoming infrastructure and local policies,” said Gurpreet Singh, director of G-Square, Anarock’s data analytics partner.The developers of ASTRA said that the platform can help realtors increase their sales by up to 15%. “We began developing the ASTRA Artificial Intelligence models in 2019, configuring multiple models across different types of real estate projects across India. Now in its final development stage, ASTRA will give developers a 20-fold return on their investment in this AI-driven platform,” said Anuj Puri, the chairman of Anarock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/anarock-deploys-ai-powered-platform-for-digital-marketing/articleshow/84597068.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

Saurabh Garg, co-founder and chief business officer of NoBroker, said the decline in the rental market was largely due to reverse migration by bachelors, most of whom were employed in the IT and ITeS sector. “The rental market varied from city to city. Pune’s population is much younger than some other cities. The rental market declined slightly for Pune, by 20-30%, largely due to migration by bachelors back to their hometowns. There was a good revival around January and February this year, and the family market was largely unaffected,” Garg told TOI during an interaction. Garg said his firm was also trying to rake in income from value-added services generated in the process of a sale or rental, such as packers and movers, executing rent and sale agreements, housekeeping services, as well as advancing loans. It recently closed a series of funding from various VCs and has expanded its services to Hyderabad and Delhi-NCR. He said along with the rest of the city’s housing market, his company also saw an “explosive” growth in the number of enquiries and listings of people looking to buy and sell properties, as the stamp duty cuts by the state government on-boarded more people in the housing market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/punes-rental-market-down-30-nobroker/articleshow/84597081.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

---||Surat||Two Surat students drown in Tapi River||Surat: Two teenage boys drowned in Tapi river at Vaghecha on Monday evening. The bodies were fished out on Tuesday morning. Pravin Jain (17) and Piyush Gehlot (17), residents of Puna area in the city, died while swimming in the river water. “Fresh water has arrived in the river and it is shallow at most locations. However, the river is dangerously deep at a few spots resulting in drowning cases. While locals never swim in the river, people from Surat city often die here,” said a police officer. Both school students were part of a group of six friends and relatives that had gone to the spot. They reached the Mahadev Temple in the afternoon and after spending time on the bank of the river, the two went for a swim. The teens knew swimming while the others who did not know how to swim, avoided going into the water, police said. The other were eating food when the duo went for a swim and disappeared at around 7 pm. However, their relatives did not realise immediately that the two were missing. After half an hour, when they did not hear any voice they went to check but Jain and Gehlot were not found. Duo got swept away in the river water which was full owing to arrival of fresh water from the heavy rains in Surat district. In the past multiple incidents of drowning have taken place at Vaghecha. Due to its picturesque view and accessibility of the river Vaghecha is a popular picnic spot for Surtis. A large number of city residents throng Vaghecha and Galteshwar on weekends. Due to rampant accidents, the riverbank has been closed at Galteshwar Mahadev Temple. At Vaghecha, warning notice boards have been put up to prevent people from entering the river but every year many people drown at the spot. Majority of the drowning accidents take place at the start of monsoon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/two-surat-students-drown-in-tapi-river/articleshow/84594729.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||‘Science City has biggest carbon footprint’||AHMEDABAD: An opportunity to walk to a neighbourhood provision store, cycle to aschool, parking one’s car at a multilevel parking or opting for public transport to one’s workplace may irk many who depend on personal vehicles, especially in the western hemisphere of the city. No wonder then western neighbourhoods have the highest transport carbon footprints. A research recently published in the Urban Science and Engineering called ‘Transport Carbon Footprints — Examining the Neighborhoods through Residents’ Travel Behavior’ — claims that each car-owning Science City resident has a burden of emitting 463kg of Co2 per annum for every km travelled, followed by those in Bopal area where the burden is 295.2kg. The next being Prahladnagar with a burden of 239.9kg. The research also focuses on the average trip length travelled by individuals in these areas. Interestingly, those living in Ambawadi travel 6.8km, mainly towards offices and business establishments on the western outskirts of the city. The least being for two-wheeler owners living in Science City with an average trip length of 2.5km. This area also has the highest trip length for car owners which was calculated as 18km. “Our BRTS surveys have clearly showed that car-owning residents of Science City, Sola and Thaltej travel larger distances mainly to factories or to their establishments on the east or outskirts, while two-wheeler users for short distance travel to shopping areas on SG highway, Gurukul or Drive-in road,” says a senior AMC official. The research study by Aashlesha Gupte and Rahul Shukla states that every neighbourhood type will have a definite density, built urban components, land use zoning, road network patterns and public transport system, which supports the design of a transit-oriented neghbourhood. “The urban form, the way neighborhoods are planned, influences the travel modes,” claims the research. This is seen in Paldi and Ambawadi areas of the city where the transport carbon footprint is 59.3kg of Co2 per annum for every km travelled and 34.6kg respectively, which is seven times less than those living in Science City.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/science-city-has-biggest-carbon-footprint/articleshow/84597101.cms||Paul John

Arav Tomar, the boy, had already lost his left eye due to retinoblastoma — an eye cancer that starts in the retina. Colonel S K Mishra, head of the ophthalmology division at the hospital said his right eye was also affected. “The boy had received multiple courses of chemotherapy and cryotherapy — use of extreme cold to freeze and remove the cancerous tissue — but the disease continued to spread. Plaque brachytherapy was the last resort to save the remaining eye and we succeeded in it,” Dr Mishra added. Very few public hospitals in India have this facility. Tomar was operated on July 9. Dr Mishra said the procedure involved placing a plaque — a small, round piece of metal that holds the radioactive seeds — on the wall of the eye covering the base of the cancerous tumour. “It took us around two hours to place the plaque under general anaesthesia. Thereafter, it was kept inside for some time to administer radiation locally. Another surgery was done to remove the plaque. Overall, the operation took around eight hours,” the head of the department said. The operation was carried out by a team of doctors, including ocular oncologist Sonali Vinay Kumar and radiotherapist Dr Ashok Kumar. Doctors said Tomar was stable post surgery and discharged from the hospital. Periodic review has been advised, said one of the doctors. Plaque brachytherapy, the doctors added, is effective for children who do not respond to chemotherapy and laser therapy. “This therapy can save vision in cases of recurrent retinoblastoma in patients who have already lost vision in one eye. It provides focused treatment of eye cancer without damaging the surrounding normal structure. The plaque gives off radiation constantly while in place on the wall of the eyeball and once the plaque is removed, no radioactivity is left inside the body,” Dr Mishra said. He added that the Army hospital gets 30- 40 cases of eye cancer every year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/army-docs-use-plaque-therapy-to-salvage-eye-of-four-year-old-boy/articleshow/84597224.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

The state home department has denied the information by claiming that the issue falls within the purview of its special branches, which have been exempted from the provisions of the RTI laws. After the state government came up with the amendment in the anti-conversion law, Mujahid Nafees of the Minority Coordination Committee sought information from the state home department on April 7 asking it to furnish details of the procedure adopted to come to a decision to bring the changes in the Freedom of Religion Act, 2003. He had asked for details on the discussions and meetings held with various stake holders and the efforts made to invite objection and suggestions from the people before bringing in the Bill to make the changes in law. Nafees’s application was rejected on May 26 citing provisions of section 24(4) of the RTI Act and it was conveyed that the special branches, which were involved in the process, have been exempted from the obligation of parting with any information. On June 11, Nafees filed an appeal with the argument that the process of enactment of any legislation that is concerned with people cannot be kept a secret. He also cited rules to claim that common people should have the knowledge about the social, economic and environmental impact that a proposed legislation is likely to cause. Moreover, the information sought for is not likely to cause any breach of security or secrecy or to pose any danger to State’s security. Even the Government of India supplies information about the process of enactment of any law to its citizens. The appellate authority in the home department heard Nafees on his appeal and rejected it on July 8 saying that the rejection order passed by the public information officer on May 26 was correct.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/love-jihad-govt-says-no-to-info-on-enactment-process/articleshow/84597149.cms||---

The AP government had raised Rs 50,896 crore from the market, while its Telangana counterpart Rs 43,784 crore during the financial year 2020-21. Union minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary, in a reply to BJP MP CVL Narasimha Rao in Rajya Sabha, said: “For the current financial year, based on the methodology prescribed by the 15th Finance Commission, the normal net borrowing ceiling (NBC) of the states has been fixed at 4% of gross state domestic product (GSDP). Thus, NBC for Andhra Pradesh and Telangana is Rs 42,472 crore and Rs 43,138 crore respectively.” Of the normal NBC of 4% of GSDP allowed to the states for the current financial year, 0.5% of GSDP has been earmarked for the incremental capital expenditure to be incurred by states during 2021-22. In addition, the states were also allowed to avail additional borrowing of up to 0.5% of GSDP based on certain performance criteria in power sector. As a part of Aatmanirbhar Bharat package, states were allowed additional borrowing ceiling of 2% of their GSDP in the 2020-21 fiscal. “No restriction was imposed on the states for utilisation of the proceeds of the additional borrowing. Andhra Pradesh had completed the stipulated reforms in three areas namely, one nation one ration card, ease of doing business and urban local bodies reforms. Andhra Pradesh had also partly completed stipulated reforms in power sector. On meeting the reform criteria, the state was eligible for additional borrowing of 0.90% of GSDP. Thus, additional borrowing permission of 1.90% of GSDP, amounting to Rs 19,192 crore was given Andhra Pradesh in 2020-21,” the MoS said. Telangana had completed the stipulated reforms in three areas: one nation one ration card, ease of doing business, and urban local bodies reforms. On meeting the reform criteria, Telangana was eligible for additional borrowing of 0.75% of GSDP. “Additional borrowing permission of 1.75% of GSDP, amounting to Rs 17,558 crore was issued to Telangana during 2020-21,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-ap-borrowed-rs-94000cr-from-market-last-fiscal-centre/articleshow/84599373.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The contract for the 25km stretch between Anand and Vadodara is pending. On Tuesday, the NHSRCL awarded the contract for building five bridges between Ahmedabad and Vadodara. MG Contractors emerged as the lowest bidder. With this, contracts for 11 bridges on the stretch have been awarded. An NHSRCL spokesperson said that the five special bridges are one pre-stressed concrete box girder bridge and four steel truss bridges between Vadodara and Ahmedabad for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad high-speed rail corridor. The spokesperson said the bids of three parties were considered. Earlier, on Monday, MG Contractors had emerged as the lowest bidder for the construction of 11 other rail bridges. These are four pre-stressed concrete box girder bridges and seven steel truss bridges. These bridges will come up between Maharashtra and Gujarat and in the Union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli. The NHSRCL has awarded contracts for the construction of railway tracks, railway bridges, tunnels, railway stations, and depots for the project. Officials said that two contracts are for the construction of an elevated corridor between Ahmedabad and Vapi. The officials said that the work has been put on the fast track in Gujarat as the land acquisition has been almost completed. Achal Khare, the then managing director of the NHSRCL, had in March said that the possibility of running the bullet train between Ahmedabad and Vapi cannot be ruled out. The NHSRCL has acquired 95% of the land required for the 352km stretch of the project in Gujarat but only 23% for the 156km stretch in Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bullet-train-abad-vapi-stretch-in-focus/articleshow/84597174.cms||---

A bench led by Chief Justice Dipankar Datta was urged by advocate Filji Frederick, who filed a public interest litigation for framing of a policy on naming of airports, to hear the matter when convenient. Frederick said the Centre’s response was sought on the status of the draft policy for naming of airports. “In the meantime, very serious threats and statements have been made by the deputy mayor of Panvel municipal corporation,’’ he added. The judges asked if the airport was ready and how much work was left. Frederick answered, “It appears that 60% work is complete. The threat by the deputy mayor is that construction of three runways will be stopped and they will go to the extent of burning the airport.” He said the statements appeared in the press. The CJ said the bench will take up the matter next month. The HC website has notified that the CJ will be presiding at the Nagpur bench till July-end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/panvels-dy-mayor-threatens-to-burn-navi-mumbai-airport/articleshow/84599401.cms||Rosy Sequeira

They have also stepped up vigil across the state, including close monitoring of social media posts, to avert any untoward incident. On Monday, the UP government had re-iterated the ban on the slaughter of cows and camels on the occasion of Bakrid. Besides, gathering of more than 50 people at a place has also been prohibited along with a ban on sacrifices of animals in public places. “We will impose NSA, if anyone is found slaughtering banned animals,” Agra SSP Muniraj G said, adding that social media will also be monitored for posts related to the festival. Police held a meeting with religious heads ahead of the festival to maintain a peaceful atmosphere in the towns. Additional director general (law and order) Prashant Kumar, however, clarified that it is not a new order. “NSA would have been imposed in cases of distortion of a public order at any time,” he said. Deputy inspector general (Aligarh range) Deepak Kumar told TOI that the aim of monitoring social media posts by the cyber cell is to maintain peace across the state and ensure fake information does not spark off rumours. “Strict action will be taken against people indulging in such acts,” he said. Aligarh police has deployed four companies of Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC), one company of Rapid action force (RAF) along with 200 additional police personnel ahead of the festival. To check the arrangements in the communally sensitive areas, police teams staged a flag march for nearly 6 kilometres. Meanwhile, Aligarh shahr mufti Khalid Hameed appealed to the community members to sacrifice animals either at home or in some closed places. “Waste should not be thrown on roads,” he said, adding that they don’t want to hurt the sentiments of any other community. “Though I wanted this year to offer namaz at Eidgah, due to prevailing circumstances, I appeal to the people to offer it in mosques close to their homes, ensuring that gatherings don’t exceed 50 people,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/nsa-on-anyone-found-violating-public-order-on-animal-slaughter-in-up/articleshow/84594778.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The worst hit are those who had sealed the deals and were planning to move into the new apartments by this month after a house warming ceremony or ‘griha pravesh’. According to the Hindu almanac, Tuesday was the last auspicious day to take possession of a new home with no dates available in the next three months. With the scheme offering a saving of nearly Rs 1.25 lakh on a flat purchased for Rs 50 lakh available till only October 30, home buyers and developers are worried about the time lost in rectifying the system. “Since this is a limited period scheme, the government should either extend the time limit or the RA offices in Kolkata and other parts of the state should function for longer hours to compensate for the loss,” said Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai) Bengal chapter president Nandu Belani. While 50 new properties are usually registered at the four offices of Assistant Registrars of Assurances (ARAs) in Kolkata daily, the snag has left 650 buyers waiting on the sidelines. “The numbers could actually be 40% more as the incentives were expected to trigger a boost in sales and registrations,” said a realtor. Inspector general of registration T Balasubramanian said IT experts were working to rectify the error and hoped the system would be up and running in a couple of days. “The registration of queries that had already been raised is continuing. But no new queries are being generated due to the glitch that occurred after the new rates were fed into the system and a trial was carried out the day after the budget,” he told TOI. The IGR assured that the offices would function for either additional hours or on Sundays to give home buyers adequate time to register their properties and take advantage of the incentive. “In a couple of days, we will also issue guidelines for sale deed registration and how much concession will be applicable at the time,” said Balasubramanian. At present, 2% stamp duty has to be paid at the time of registering the sale deed and the remaining 4% for properties priced below Rs 1 crore and 5% for the properties above Rs 1 crore to be paid during the transfer of title or conveyance. According to sources, the government is likely to allow home buyers to take advantage of the 2% discount if they pay the remaining 4%-5% at the time of registering the sale deed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/home-buyers-fret-as-software-glitch-holds-up-registration/articleshow/84597176.cms||Subhro Niyogi

A group of villagers who went into the forest to rescue them is also missing. While police were looking for the missing seven, a former Maoist was savagely stabbed and hacked to death around 65km away, in neighbouring Bijapur district, on Tuesday. The seven are from Kunded village in Jagargunda region, a Maoist hotbed about 500km from Raipur. They went missing on Saturday, but their families didn’t inform the cops. Even on Tuesday, when police teams set out to look for them, none of their kin had filed any complaint. Villagers are terrified of Maoists, more so in such circumstances, and instead of informing the police many try to negotiate their kins’ release. Sometimes it works, often it doesn’t. It was only on Monday that word reached police about the missing villagers. But when they reached out to the families, some of them reluctantly said the youths had gone to attend a wedding or to work elsewhere. Police haven’t ruled out the possibility that Maoists led them away as recruits. Meanwhile, in Bijapur, former Maoist Raju Venjam, who had never surrendered formally, was tilling his land in Paddeda village when a group of rebels dragged him away and murdered him. Police said Raju was associated with Maoists for nine years but chose to return to the mainstream and was leading a normal life.Maoists of Gangaloor area committee have claimed responsibility. claiming that Raju had joined the District Reserve Guards, which is spearheading anti-Maoist ops. Police have denied this. ITBP jawan killed in Maoist attackMaoists attacked a road-opening party deployed for Congress MLA Chandan Kashyap’s tour of Narayanpur in Bastar on Tuesday, triggering a gunbattle in which an ITBP jawan was killed and an officer injured. Kashyap’s convoy had safely passed the area by the time the encounter broke out. ITBP was tasked with clearing the Aamdai valley region for the MLA’s trip. Three to four ITBP men came under sustained heavy fire from a hilltop while they were climbing up to their camp, said police. They fired back immediately and within 15 minutes, forced the Maoists to retreat. However, ITBP constable Shivkumar Meena died due to bullet injuries and ASI Keshav Ram was injured. The ASI’s condition is stable in hospital.  The MLA flew back to Narayanpur from Orcha instead of returning by road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/maoists-kidnap-7-in-sukma-rescue-group-also-missing/articleshow/84602701.cms||---

Activists and residents in some of the areas said that no action is being take to either demolish, repair or vacate the structures that are structurally unfit from several years. “I have raised two complaints about a few old and dilapidated structures in Fateh Darwaza area about a week ago after which I received a message with reference ID saying that the issue will be resolved shortly. However, no action has been initiated till date. The officials should at least visit and inspect these buildings to assess the situation,” Mohammed Ahmed, a social activist. Last year, out of the total 642 dilapidated structures, 231 were demolished and 129 were either repaired or vacated. Therefore, the remaining 282 were added to this year’s list of 610 structurally unfit buildings. Going by this data, another 150 to 200 old buildings are likely to be added this year to the existing list. The situation is despite two persons being killed and five others including two children sustaining injuries when an old building partially collapsed at Hussaini Alam last year. “Leave alone demolition, the authorities haven’t even served notices to the owners of some houses that are about 70 to 80 years old in Himatpura and Dhoodh Bowli. Most of these houses have massive cracks and look like they might fall apart with a single spell of heavy rain,” said Shankar Yadav, a resident of Himatpura. Meanwhile, the GHMC’s town planning wing, which carried out a few demolition activities in Chudi Bazaar, Shastripuram and a few other areas on Tuesday requested the residents to cooperate with the officials to avoid any untoward incidents during rains. “We have already served notices to residents where we need to conduct the special drive to demolish, repair or vacate the buildings. In some cases, people are asking for time because they do not have an alternate place to stay, while some of them are reluctant to vacate despite serving notices,” said K Mallikarjuna Rao, deputy city planner, GHMC. “There are also some issues due to disputes between owners and tenants, where tenants are not vacating the premises on time. So, we are going as per procedure and seeing to it that these issues are resolved at the earliest,” added Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-action-yet-on-350-dilapidated-bldgs/articleshow/84599454.cms||Moulika.KV

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC stays R B Sreekumar’s arrest in ISRO espionage case||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday granted temporary protection to former DGP R B Sreekumar against possible arrest by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in connection with the ISRO espionage case. In that case, several cops are facing charges of criminal conspiracy and custodial torture of two ISRO scientists. Justice A S Supehia ordered that Sreekumar not be arrested till further orders while admitting the former top cop’s petition for temporary transit bail until he obtains anticipatory bail from the court concerned in Kerala. The CBI lodged an FIR on May 1 in New Delhi against 18 officials including Sreekumar. While seeking transit bail, Sreekumar’s advocate M M Tirmizi submitted that the alleged offence had happened in 1994 and other officers arraigned in this case have been protected from arrest by the Kerala high court. The Gujarat high court admitted the bail plea and sought the CBI’s response by July 28. Sreekumar was the head of the state intelligence department during the 2002 riots and later filed affidavits before the Nanavati-Shah commission which was probing the riots. Sreekumar fought a legal battle for his promotion to the post of DGP after he was superseded on the ground that an inquiry was pending against him. He was promoted on the day of his retirement. In the ISRO case, Kerala Police registered an FIR against Mariyam Rashida from Maldives under the Foreigners Act in 1994. After investigation, the Official Secrets Act was invoked against Rashida and Fauzia Hasan on espionage charges. The Kerala DGP constituted an SIT to probe the case. The names of ISRO scientists S Nambi Narayanan and D Sasikumaran emerged, police had claimed. The intelligence bureau deputed senior officials including Sreekumar to help Kerala Police with the investigation. Sreekumar has claimed that he was tasked with interrogating Sasikumaran and that he did not meet Nambi Narayanan at all during the investigation. The probe in the alleged espionage case was later transferred to the CBI, which found that the charges were got up and filed a closure report in a Kerala court in 1996. It also requested suitable action against the erring police officers. In 1999, the central government served a departmental chargesheet on Sreekumar and other officers, but the charges were not proved during an inquiry conducted in 2004. Nambi Narayanan moved the Supreme Court against the false charges alleging conspiracy and the apex court ordered Rs 50 lakh compensation to him. It also ordered a committee, headed by retired Justice D K Jain, to inquire into the case. On basis of the committee’s report, the CBI filed an FIR against 18 officers including Sreekumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-stays-sreekumars-arrest-in-isro-espionage-case/articleshow/84597210.cms||---

Heads of several such groups said their questions and pleas to not conduct the CET were met with no response. In the case of the Cambridge Board, students took the physical exam in March and fail to understand why they should take the CET. The head of a school said, “The idea is hare-brained. Why would students of other boards take a test based on syllabus of the state board?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-schools-parents-question-cet-logic/articleshow/84601298.cms||---

According to police, they had arrested Oniye Heproachi alias Chima alias Anthony (45), Okonkavo Perpetual Gift alias Anabra Asaba (37) and Idumona Kyurti Oniye Yukebu Isele, from New Delhi last week in connection to an online fraud case. The fraud complaint was lodged by a Jamangar-based trader. The trio had shown their residence in India to be in Dombivli, Mumbai. They had been living in India for the last one and a half years, said police. Investigation revealed that the passports of all three were in custody by Indian authorities. However, they were using fake passports and visas documents to move across the country. “After their arrest, we sent passports and visa documents of the Nigerian nationals for verification and found them to be fake. So, we lodged a complaint against them under various sections of Indian Penal Code — 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (forgery) and under various sections of The Foreigners Act, 1946," said Jamnagar police..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/3-nigerians-nabbed-for-using-fake-documents/articleshow/84594916.cms||---

He said the Telangana Congress will organise a Chalo Raj Bhavan rally on Thursday demanding a probe by a joint parliamentary committee and an inquiry by a Supreme Court judge into Narendra Modi-led NDA government’s snooping and tapping of phones of Rahul Gandhi and others. A memorandum will be submitted to the governor. Revanth sought to remind that Kishan Reddy, who was Union minister of state for home in November 2020, had alleged that the phones of several BJP leaders were tapped by the state government ahead of the Dubbak by-election. “When a Union minister had said that phone tapping is taking place in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not respond to it. Was it because the central government feared that its snooping and phone tapping issue would also get exposed?” Revanth said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/probe-phone-tapping-by-t-govt-revanth/articleshow/84599467.cms||---

The boy had slipped into the drain on Monday morning while crossing the temporary iron bridge placed over it. His family has demanded compensation from the government for not building a safe and permanent structure over the drain that is 12 feet deep and is always flooded with filth. Tasneem Ali, the deceased’s father, said his son had slipped because the bridge is only barely 2.5 feet wide and has no boundary wall. “Had this been a properly constructed structure, there would have been walls around it, which would have saved my child,” he added. SK Singh, city magistrate, has ruled out payment of compensation. “It was an accident and not a case of natural calamity, hence the family is not eligible for compensation. We have already made this clear to them. They were not even ready to get the post-mortem done for verification of cause of death, so any other compensation is also not possible in this case,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/20-hrs-after-he-fell-into-drain-body-of-boy-11-found/articleshow/84594880.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh cop thrashed in broad daylight, resigns after departmental inaction||BIJNOR: Brutally attacked in a busy market in broad daylight and left with a fractured leg, a police officer in Uttar Pradesh's Bijnor district resigned when seniors at his own police station refused to file a case against the assailants named by him as they owed allegiance to a saffron outfit. The case was filed against unknown persons at Jhalu police station. The attack had come just hours after sub-inspector (SI) Arun Kumar Rana, 40, was suspended after a spat with a local advocate -- also a member of a saffron outfit. Rana, who had earlier served in BSF and CISF before joining the UP Police, had denied issuing a character certificate to the “influential man”, without running a background check, leading to the scuffle. And to Rana’s shock, when he went to his own police station in Bijnor’s Jhalu area to file a case against his attackers, his seniors registered an FIR against unnamed people, rejecting his demand to book the accused named by him. It proved to be the last straw for Rana, who resigned from his post. Rana’s resignation prompted the police brass to intervene, which “conditionally reinstated” him on the post pending a departmental probe. Two of his alleged attackers were also arrested. It all began with a spat between SI Rana and advocate Umang Kakaran. Rana had refused to issue the certificate to Kakaran leading to a fight last Thursday. It is being alleged that Rana slapped Kakaran during the scuffle. Two days later, on Saturday, SI Rana received his suspension letter and a departmental probe was also launched against him. And within hours of the suspension, Rana was attacked by four masked men in a market as he was buying groceries. He was taken to a hospital with a fractured leg. The SI told TOI, “My fault was that I wanted some verification before signing the papers. I was being forced. When I refused, I was suspended on the complaint of Umang Kakaran. Later, I was attacked in a busy market. I knew all the assailants and named them in my complaint. But the case was registered against unidentified assailants. I was harassed by my own officers. I was summoned to the SP office and told to compromise.” “Therefore, I went to the SP office to tender my resignation but my letter was not received there. Later, I mailed it to the SP, DIG, ADG and other senior officers.” When contacted, superintendent of police (SP) of Bijnor, Dharamveer Singh, told TOI that the SI was suspended for slapping the activist. “Police have arrested two accused, including Umang Kakaran, the right-wing activist. Sub-inspector Rana had allegedly slapped Kakaran days before the attack. The SI was suspended after Kakaran filed a complaint. But later, when the SI was attacked by the four masked men, we registered a case. Probe is on and two persons have been arrested. The rest will be nabbed soon.” When asked about the resignation of SI, the SP said, “SI Rana has not given his resignation to me.” When asked about his reinstatement, SI Rana said it was conditional. “I have not been provided with any order. I heard that I have been reinstated conditionally citing Eid festival security,” he said. Rana also expressed fear of further “harassment” and also claimed threat to his life. “The SP has already set up an inquiry against me. I will be harassed again. I have served in BSF and in CISF for over 10 years. I didn’t see such things there. I want an SIT probe to know the reality,” Rana said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-police-officer-thrashed-in-broad-daylight-resigns-after-departmental-inaction/articleshow/84594871.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Techie arrested for killing live-in partner colleague in New Town flat||KOLKATA: A 29-year-old techie was arrested on Monday night from a New Town flat for allegedly killing his live-in-partner, a senior colleague, four days ago. Debabrata Pati, a resident of Kaliachak in Malda, was picked up from his rented accommodation in New Town on the basis of a complaint lodged by the woman’s brother. According to the police, Pati confessed to having banged the head of his partner, Richa Singh (35), during a heated altercation. The woman fell unconscious and she was taken to a hospital where she was declared dead. Cops are verifying the claims by Pati while awaiting the post-mortem report for confirmation on the time and cause of the woman’s death. Cops said the duo had been in a relationship for the last two years and they were staying in the a rented accommodation at New Town’s Thakdari for the last four months. Employed at a Sector V firm, the duo was working from home since the start of the pandemic. “The youth said that on Thursday morning, they were engaged in an altercation, which had culminated in slapping and punching each other when the woman suddenly lost consciousness after her head was banged against the wall. The youth panicked and tried to feed the woman warm milk and various other home remedies before taking her to a hospital on EM Bypass, where a medical officer declared her dead,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate. An unnatural death case was lodged at Phoolbagan police station in Kolkata, under whose jurisdiction the hospital falls. The officers called up the youth’s landlord, Churamani Das, and the woman’s family members. The woman, a divorcee, hailed from Dhanbad in Jharkhand and her family members reached the city on May 17, following which the post-mortem was conducted. The preliminary post-mortem report revealed that the woman had died of internal injuries. But in the absence of a complaint by the family, cops had let the partner go initially. “The family cremated the woman on May 18. The day after, her brother, Anand Mohan Singh, reached New Town police station and lodged a complaint of murder, naming Pati as the prime accused. We arrested the youth who was produced in a Barasat court and remanded in two-day police custody on Tuesday,” said the officer. The son of a reputed school principal, Pati had been working in the city for the last several years but he had shifted to the New Town flat with the woman recently. His family members said they had no knowledge that he was living with a senior colleague. “We have searched the flat and found certain signs of assault. There is no data stored in the woman’s cellphone. The youth said they had a fight over the woman seeing and speaking with someone else, following which she had deleted all data on her cellphone. We are verifying his claims,” said an officer of New Town police station. The youth’s landlord and other neighbours confirmed that the two had a fierce fight on the day of her death and that Pati had come to the landlord, seeking help as the woman had fallen unconscious. The youth was apparently drunk, neighbours told cops. “The landlord said he had guided the youth to take the woman to a hospital. The youth booked an app cab and took the woman to a private hospital on EM Bypass. Sometime later, the landlord got a call from the hospital and learnt that the woman had died. He had informed New Town police station about the matter. We initiated a case after the woman’s brother had lodged a complaint with the police,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/techie-arrested-for-killing-live-in-partner-colleague-in-new-town-flat/articleshow/84597251.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Chandigarh||Organ donation: Daughter passes, but parents ensure she lives on||Times News Network Chandigarh: Even as they struggled with grief at the demise of their 13-year-old daughter, the bereaved parents made her death give life to four patients suffering from end-stage organ failure by donating her organs. One patient is in Mumbai and three are in PGIMER. On transplantation, the retrieved corneas will restore the sight of two corneal blind patients at PGIMER. The incident took place on July 8, when the 13-year-old donor from Chandigarh fell unconscious due to cerebral oedema and was rushed to Government Multi Speciality Hospital, Sector 16. Due to worsening prognosis, she was shifted to PGIMER in an extremely critical condition the next day. After 10 days of swinging between life and death, she was declared brain dead at PGI. When chances of her survival died down, transplant coordinators at PGIMER approached the grief-stricken father to request if he would consider organ donation. Consent was given and the family wished to keep their identity anonymous. “It’s something no family should have to go through. We said yes to organ donation because we knew this could help someone else and they wouldn’t need to go through the heartache that we are going through. We knew it was the right thing to do,” said the father of the deceased. “We hope our daughter’s story will inspire families who find themselves in the same position. We want to make people aware of organ donation so that they realise that death is not the end of things, people can live on through others, through this,” he added. Prof Ashok Kumar, acting nodal officer, ROTTO (North), said, “Following the family's consent, we secured her heart, liver, kidneys and corneas. Once the donor organs became available, everyone swiftly swung into action, leaving no stone unturned to ensure that the donor’s legacy continued. As cross-matching did not indicate any matching recipient for heart in PGIMER, we immediately got in touch with other transplant hospitals to explore options for matching recipients and finally, her heart was allocated to Sir H N Reliance Hospital, Mumbai with the intervention of NOTTO.” Green corridors were created to transport the organs. Prof Kumar, said, “To ensure safe and speedy transport of the harvested organs, a green corridor was created in conjunction with retrieval timings from PGIMER to technical Airport, Chandigarh at around 6.35am to enable safe passage for the transport of her heart for the onward flight to Mumbai.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/organ-donation-daughter-passes-but-parents-ensure-she-lives-on/articleshow/84594862.cms||---

The park after the expansion will be spread in 4.5 hectares. The officials said that the plantation in the diversity park will be done using the Miyawaki method. Two to four trees will be planted per square metre. Miyawaki forests grow in two to three years and are self-sustaining. They help in lowering temperatures, reducing air and noise pollutions. The officials in the AMC said the biodiversity park serves as an ideal alternative habitat for migratory and resident bird species and has come up at the edge of Vasna Barrage and near the Ambedkar Bridge. It has more than 5,000 trees and has endangered species of trees. The officials said that in the 16,000 sq metres area the park has endangered plants like rubber, rudraksha, aritha, kailashpati, raktachandan, sesame, grape etc. “The park will have rare species like puntrajiva, timbaru, sindoor, siris, umro, sandalwood, raktachandan as well as fruit-bearing species, which will attract more birds,” said officials. In addition, more than 75,000 trees are planned to be planted in the commercial plots and in the central verge of the riverfront area. The AMC has set itself a target of 1,35,000 trees which will be planted on the riverfront.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/biodiversity-park-to-get-2-5-times-bigger/articleshow/84597287.cms||---

Seeing the woman lying on the ground, and surrounded by the monkeys, Tejas Pradhan grabbed a stick and ran towards the screaming woman. Incidentally, the boy, being a dog lover, was feeding a loyal band of four-legged street friends at the time of the attack. Watching the boy in action, they too lunged at the monkeys that got unsettled and fled. An eyewitness, Kapil Bishnoi, who lives in Radha Garden, said, “We heard a commotion and rushed outside. There was an elderly woman lying on the ground inside the park while this child was fearlessly challenging the monkeys with a stick as dogs gave him cover.” The woman, Asha Vij, 70, was all praise for the boy. “I was taking a walk in the park on Monday morning when all of a sudden several monkeys attacked me. I had even fallen, when all of a sudden Tejas and his dogs appeared and scared the simians away,” said Vij, who escaped with a few scratches. The resident welfare association of the colony felicitated Tejas. “It was indeed a brave act for a child of just seven. Though we have been asking authorities time and again to tackle the monkey menace, little has been done in this regard. Maybe, after this incident, the authorities will take note,” said the president of the colony's welfare association, Lokesh Sharma. Speaking to TOI, Tejas said, “All dogs in my colony are my friends. We together defeated the monkeys. I will not allow them to come here again.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/kid-7-fights-off-troupe-of-monkeys-attacking-elderly-woman-70/articleshow/84594935.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Kolkata||Salt Lake suicide: Hyd youth believed he was ‘evil power’||Kolkata: The death of his parents, grandmother and brother within a span of 10 months in 2016 had pushed the 25-year-old bank official, P Samwrith, into a state of depression. He broke down and chose to kill himself when a “sister”, who had helped him come out of his depression, had also died last week. Samwrith, who had apparently killed himself by using a suicide bag — a DIY device consisting of a large plastic bag with a draw cord used to kill oneself using inert gas (helium, nitrogen or argon) — left a two-page suicide note in English. He had ended the letter, stating “I Quit” and that no one was responsible for his death. Cops said that in the suicide note, the youth considered himself as “an evil power” responsible for the death of his loved ones. The youth, a technical manager with a private bank and a resident of Hyderabad, was found dead — with his head wrapped in a polythene bag and a hose pipe fixed to a helium gas cylinder inserted inside the plastic — on his bed at a paying guest accommodation in Salt Lake on Monday afternoon. Two of his roommates-cum-colleagues found him and informed the police who later sent the body for post-mortem. With no one else in his immediate family left, a close friend and an aunt came from Hyderabad on Tuesday and took the custody of his body. Police said that they confirmed his handwriting in the letter, following which the body was cremated in Kolkata. “Going by the contents of the letter and speaking at length with the aunt, we have learnt the youth’s parents, grandmother and brother had died between March and December 2016. All of them died of health ailments and this had broken down the youth from inside and he had gone into a state of acute depression. One of his friend’s wife, whom he used to call sister, helped him recover from the depression. But the woman had died of pancreatitis last week and this had left him devastated,” said an officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/salt-lake-suicide-hyd-youth-believed-he-was-evil-power/articleshow/84597275.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

It has raised eyebrows on the quality of construction material used in the wall. No casualty has been reported so far. The stadium, named after the deceased leader, was scheduled to be inaugurated soon. Amroha district magistrate BK Tripathi has ordered a probe into the matter. Expressing his displeasure over the collapsed wall and negligence in its construction, DM Tripathi said, “I have set up an inquiry into the matter. The probe has been handed over to the sub-divisional magistrate. The investigation is to be completed within three days. If any irregularity is detected in the construction work, strict action will be taken against the construction company concerned.” The construction of the stadium in the city began in 2018. Some minor work is still on. It was to be completed by July 10. The stadium has been built at a cost of Rs 7.34 crore. When contacted, Sangeeta Chauhan, local MLA and wife of the late minister, said, “The sports stadium was a dream project of my husband. No irregularity will be tolerated in its construction. I will inspect the stadium. Besides, I have spoken with the DM to set up an inquiry into the matter. If substandard material was used in its construction, strict action will be taken against the company.” A former cricketer, Chetan Chauhan had wanted the district’s players to get easy access to train in their chosen sport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/days-before-inauguration-main-wall-of-stadium-gifted-to-amroha-by-late-minister-chetan-chauhan-collapses/articleshow/84594912.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala forest minister AK Saseendran again: Tries to hush up sexual harassment complaint||KOLLAM: Forest minister and NCP leader A K Saseendran landed in a fresh controversy over attempts to broker a compromise in a sexual harassment complaint raised against an NCP leader at Kundara here. Controversy erupted after Malayalam TV channels aired a telephonic conversation purportedly between Saseendran and the woman's father, a block committee president of the NCP, seeking to settle the issue amicably. The minister is heard telling the woman's father in the audio clip that he is aware of the incident and the case should be settled in a “good manner". However, after the leaked clip triggered a controversy, Saseendran told reporters in Kozhikode that he was not aware of the attempt to harass the woman. Incidentally, Saseendran had to quit the first Pinarayi Vijayan government in March 2017 after a sleaze audio involving him and a woman had surfaced. He returned as minister after a court cleared him of the charges. On Tuesday, opposition and BJP leaders demanded the minister's resignation. Saseendran called chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan over phone in the evening and explained his version of the circumstances in which he had made the telephone call to the father of the complainant. The minister later left for Thiruvananthapuram. The woman, a BJP activist who contested in the local body elections, had in late June filed a complaint with Kundara police against hotelier Padmakaran, a state executive committee member of the NCP. The police, however, filed a case against Padmakaran and his friend Rajeevan only on Tuesday evening after the controversy. It is evident from the voice clip that the minister was insisting on settling the case in a "good manner", to which the woman's father could be heard asking what the minister meant by saying so. He is also heard telling the minister that there was no problem in the party in Kundara and what they had raised was a complaint against Padmakaran's attempt to harass his daughter. The woman told reporters that the minister was aware of the incident and had intervened in the matter many times. Padmakaran wanted to discuss her decision to join the BJP while all her family members and relatives were NCP members. "He (Padmakaran) asked me if I had joined the BJP after taking money. Catching hold of my hand, he said he could pay me money. Though the incident happened on March 6, I was afraid to speak up, and I filed the police complaint only on June 28," she said. She said the police did not take any action on her complaint. Padmakaran was also repeatedly maligning her and family on social media while police officers were making fun of her and insulting her when she went to the police station, she alleged. Local NCP workers, however, described the incident as a fallout of internal bickering in the party.

Experts, however, blame it on the delayed arrival of monsoon by about three weeks. According to data (updated till July 19) released by the Indian meteorological department, among 33 districts of western UP, 25 have recorded deficit or large deficit rainfall while only 15 out of 42 districts in eastern UP fall under these categories. Till July 19, UP has recorded the total rain deficit at 14%, which is “normal”, but at -36% rain deficit western UP falls under the “red category”, reveals IMD data. Western UP districts such as Agra (-67%), Meerut (-25%), Aligarh (-58%), Budaun (-38%), Shamli (-60%), Mainpuri (-63%), Saharanpur (-32%), among others, have recorded the maximum rainfall deficit, so far. Districts like Bareilly, Bijnor, Muzaffarnagar, Sambhal and Rampur have received normal rainfall, says IMD. In eastern UP, however, districts such as Santravidas Nagar, Shrawasti, Balrampur, Chitrakoot and Prayagraj have received more rains than normal, while Ayodhya, Azamgarh, Basti, Kanpur and Sultanpur have witnessed normal rainfall, so far. However, Unnao, Raebareli, Jaunpur and Amethi fall under the rain deficit or large rain deficit categories. According to experts, the main reason for the deficit rainfall is the continued delay in the arrival of monsoon, which the IMD had predicted would lash the Delhi-NCR region by June 15. RS Sengar, agriculture scientist, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel University of Agriculture and Technology University, Meerut, told TOI: “Monsoon should have lashed the state by the last week of June, but it is delayed by almost three weeks, hitting the Kharif (including pulses and paddy) sowing.” “Most of the farmers will now start sowing Kharif that will further delay the harvesting. As the last few days have witnessed a good rainfall, which is good for crops, we advise farmers to start harvesting rainwater for the future,” added Sengar. State meteorological department director JP Gupta, however, claimed that the rainfall on Tuesday covered the rain deficit across the state, especially in the eastern region. “Only a few districts have now been left with the large rain deficits. But, showers are predicted on Wednesday and Thursday. Besides, another round of heavy rain in the last week of July will cover the present deficit,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-faces-monsoon-deficit-western-region-worst-hit/articleshow/84594934.cms||Ishita Mishra

Kajalba Vala was four months pregnant when she hanged herself to death at her residence in Moti Khavdi village on July 18, said an official of Meghpar-Padana police. Her father, Abhesang Jadeja (49), a resident of Kajurada village in Khambhalia taluka of Devbhoomi Dwarka district, lodged a complaint against Kajalba’s husband Siddharajsinh Vala, his mother Dhrupadba Vala, father Surubha Vala and brother Mayursinh Vala. Jadeja accused Siddharajsinh and his family members of harassing his daughter and abetting her suicide. The FIR stated that Kajalba’s husband and in-laws were forcing her to undergo a sex determination test. As she refused to undergo the test, she was harassed and tortured by her husband and in-laws, alleged Jadeja. Unable to bear the torture, Kajalba took her own life, he further claimed. Police have detained all the four accused in this case and launched a probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/four-held-for-abetting-womans-suicide/articleshow/84594962.cms||---
---||Kochi||E-governance: Even after a year, Kochi Corporation fails to rope in new firm||KOCHI: Even while the state government is planning to ensure online services from all government institutions from November 1, the Kochi Corporation is still unable to implement its e-governance project. All online services, including the issuance of birth and death certificates, which the corporation had planned to start more than a decade ago, still remain a promise and the local body has not been able to handpick a new agency for implementing the project. The Kochi Corporation council had in June 2020 decided to remove TCS, the implementing agency, and rope in a new agency. “A high-level meeting held last week has decided to introduce the facility to provide birth and death certificates online without delay. Kochi Corporation is the only local body in the state that does not have the facility. It will soon be ensured with the help of IKM. At the same time, it will take time to develop modules for providing other online services like tax payment,” mayor M Anil Kumar said. Though, as per the agreement, TCS was supposed to complete the project in 52 weeks, nothing materialised even after nine years. “The dispute between the corporation and TCS should be discussed. We can go ahead with the e-governance project only after settling the dispute. We have held a few rounds of talks with them,” Anil Kumar said. There is a dispute regarding the amount the IT firm owes and the modules it has already completed. A total of 22 modules for providing various online services will have to be prepared. Out of them, TCS has handed over only five modules to the local body. “For preparing the other modules, we will have to computerise all data, including the tax registry. A few months ago, we had decided to entrust Ooralunkal Labour Contract Society for the digitization of data. But, the opposition wanted to invite tenders where multiple firms can compete. Now, we will have to invite tenders for the same. It will take time,” Anil Kumar said. Another issue the local body faces is regarding the procurement of hardware for the digitization project. Though computers had been procured for implementing the project a few years ago, all of them have become either defunct or outdated. Addressing this will be a difficult task for the cash crunched corporation. Moreover, a sizable chunk of the estimated project cost has already been handed over to the TCS. Hence, questions will arise regarding spending money for the same project more than once. In that case, the local body authorities will be answerable to the auditors. At the same time, the opposition councillors see chances of TCS being retained. “I learned that there is a move to bring back TCS. But, I have not been able to confirm it so far,” said M G Aristotle, a Congress councillor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/e-governance-even-after-a-yr-corp-fails-to-rope-in-new-firm/articleshow/84594952.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

While one girl said she wanted to do BA History and became a tahilsdar, another girl said she wanted to get into a bank job after completing BCom. When the third girl said she wanted to study BSc Nursing, there was an uncomfortable silence for a second. The girl is HIV positive, like others in the group. Project manager A Pannerselvam stepped in to clarify why her plan of pursuing nursing was not suitable to the girl. He explained that her compromised immune system requires her not to expose to sick people, and the possible perils of she inadvertently infecting others during her proposed line of duty. The organisers of the session inquired the motive behind her original decision and offered her suggestions to fulfil it through studying other courses. The girl and others are part of Children of Krishnagiri, a programme started by K G Murali, a Bengaluru-based businessman, to uplift the lives of HIV positive children. Murali developed the programme a decade ago along with V R Keshav Raj, the executive director of ARCOD, a rural development NGO that works in Krishnagiri district. The programme started with about 300 children and presently works with 220 children. “About 90% of the children are parentless. When we first came in contact with the kids, most of them were unenthusiastic about life. We motivate them to take medicine and nutritious food, teach them some skills and conduct summer camps and recreational activities,” Murali said. “We give children love and push them to the point where they get a taste for life.” When the pandemic threatened to undo the progress made with children, the organisation prevented it by regularly keeping in touch with the children. “We started making regular phone calls to the children to check upon them. If there is any problem, one of the field workers attends to it personally,” Keshav Raj said. “We call a certain number of children every day and ask them whether they took their medicine and food. We also speak to the children’s caregiver,” said Fathima*, a field worker. Fathima is HIV positive and one of the earliest beneficiaries of the programme. She had completed BA Tamil and worked at a retail chain in Coimbatore for two months before quitting her job and joining in the programme. With enough prodding, she is now thinking of pursuing BEd or MA.

Chaudhary said due to Covid- 19-induced economic slowdown there has been a dip in GST collection of the states. The GST compensation was pending due to fund shortage with Centre also, he said. In his reply, the minister said that the GST compensation for financial years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 was already paid to the states. “The economic impact of the pandemic has led to higher compensation requirement due to lower GST collection and at the same time lower collection of GST compensation cess,” he pointed out. According to the him, GST compensation of Rs91,000 crore was released to all states to partly meet the compensation payable for the period from April 2020 to March 2021 as the amount in GST compensation fund was not adequate to meet the full compensation requirement. After the part payment, the Centre owes Rs2,515 crore for the period April 2020- March 21 and Rs1,558 crore for the period April- May 2021. Telugu MPs Jaydev Galla, (TDP) and Rajit Reddy (TRS) had posted the question on GST compensation dues to be paid by Centre to states. In another reply to question posted by state BJP unit chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar, the Centre said that Telangana was asked to repay Rs 190 crore sanctioned under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). Under this scheme, the Centre had sanctioned Rs849 crore in the last seven years, for not completing the building of houses and not spending the funds. Between 2014 and 2016, the state built 48, 550 houses as against 1.22 lakh sanctioned houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/centre-owes-rs-4073-crore-gst-compensation-to-telangana/articleshow/84599539.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Pune||Maharashtra CET coaching books in market offer quick fix||PUNE: A day after the date of the Common Entrance Test (CET) for admission to the First Year of Junior College (FYJC) was announced, the market is already filling up with books that promise to prepare the students for the objective-type examination. However, teachers have urged students to prepare by marking the chapters identified by the board. “The Maharashtra State Council of Educational Research and Training (MSCERT) has also planned to come out with question banks for each of the four subjects (English, Maths, Science and Social Studies) so that students, who otherwise are trained to write descriptive answers, will have an idea about the objective type questions,” Vikas Garad, deputy director of MSCERT, said. Bhagwan Pandekar, a mathematics teacher at Laxmanrao Apte Prashala, said with only one month remaining for the examination, it will be best to revise from the textbooks and solve the questions in the exercises there. “All the questions will surely be based on the chapters specified by the state board. The students actually read those chapters well. Do not think that all questions will be easy. Some might require a good amount of calculation and it will not be wise for the students to only rely on private books,” Pandekar said. Madhuri Chittewan, principal of Dr Kalmadi Shamarao Junior College, said, “ Since the student has already based his or her entire preparation for the board examination on the textbook, they are already familiar with them. Secondly, the omitted parts are clearly known to the students as they must have been told so at the beginning of the term so it is easier to study the remaining part as marked by the state board for the CET. Lastly, the answers in the textbook are considered final and correct.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cet-coaching-books-in-market-offer-quick-fix/articleshow/84597361.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Mumbai||Builders faces Bombay HC action for not toeing MahaRera line||MUMBAI: A Bombay high court judgment has provided relief to flat buyers fighting builders who refuse to comply with orders passed by the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRera). Last week, a division bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav took suo motu cognizance and directed that a notice be issued under the Contempt of Courts Act against Pune-based developer Marvel Sigma Homes and its director Vishwajeet Jhavar for “obstruction and interference with administration of justice.” The judges pulled up the developer for “deliberately not complying with various orders and disclosures made by this court… and by filing false and incomplete affidavits.” Rustam Mehta, a flat buyer, had petitioned the HC after failing to get possession of a flat worth Rs 10.61 crore in 2014 in a project called Marvel Ribera in Pune. Mehta, who successfully fought all the way to the Supreme Court, said the developer failed to deliver the apartment by June 2016 as mandated in their agreement, and wanted his money back with interest. When a complaint was lodged with the state’s housing regulator, the builder claimed he could not complete the project due to “adverse market conditions and financial issues.” The high court pulled up the Pune district collector and Pune city tahsildar for “failure to discharge statutory duties and responsibilities’’ when MahaRera issued a recovery warrant against the builder. In 2018, Mehta had won the case in MahaRera, which ordered the builder to pay back the amount with interest. Mehta went to the RERA appellate tribunal when the builder did not comply. The collector and tahsildar were empowered to seize the developer’s property but failed to do so. The HC said it is within its jurisdiction “to protect the rights of the petitioner by granting interim relief even against a private party respondent that has wrongly benefitted from inaction on the part of the public authorities in discharge of their public duty.” The tahsildar said his office issued two Demand Notices to the developer, who failed to respond. The tahsildar’s stand was since “there is no project or property card that bears the name (of the developer), no action for recovery could be taken.” The HC noted that an affidavit last year “itself indicates that Marvel Crest is a project of the developer Marvel Sigma Homes Pvt Ltd. A “solitary measure” in February 2021 to recover Rs 6.25 crore from the builder by the tahsildar “after gross inaction is not enough,” said the HC and restrained the developer from selling or creating further third party rights in unsold units as on the uploading date of its order. The HC also directed the developer to deposit Rs 11 crore in four weeks; on such deposit the interim stay on sale of unsold units will stand vacated. The HC noted that the Supreme Court had on July 14 dismissed a challenge by the developer to its March 9 judgment which had held that the recovery certificate had rightly been issued under the RERA Act and rules. The developer was represented by lawyer Amit Gharte and Mehta’s case was argued by senior counsel Sharan Jagtiani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bldr-faces-hc-action-for-not-toeing-maharera-line/articleshow/84599651.cms||Nauzer K Bharucha

However, there appeared to be a slight climbdown from his earlier stand after his meeting with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in the presence of AICC general secretaries K C Venugopal and H K Patil in New Delhi. So far, Patole had claimed that the Congress would contest civic elections as well as the 2024 Lok Sabha and assembly elections independently. On Tuesday, however, he said that while still there is time for the 2014 Lok Sabha and assembly elections, the Congress will certainly contest the civic polls independently. “The Lok Sabha and assembly elections are far away, we will contest all the ensuing civic polls independently,” Patole said. Patole reiterated that his phone was tapped during the tenure of Devendra Fadnavis as chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rahul-effect-now-patole-limits-solo-talk-to-civic-polls/articleshow/84601358.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

College principals fear that the number of applicants would exceed sanctioned seats and that the education department should approve proposals of colleges that have applied for more divisions on an unaided basis.Principal of the Modern College of Arts, Science and Commerce, Rajendra Zunjarrao, said the director of education should anticipate this already and start working towards solving the forthcoming challenges. “The issue of excess applications against the number of seats is going to arise and we are just hoping that there are no last-minute changes in rules that will add to the chaos. Usually the maximum applications are received by popular colleges in the city and just like us there are many others who have applied for more divisions with the directorate of education and if they give approval to the proposals then we will be able to add some more seats and resolve some part of this issue. But, the process should start now so that we are ready when the admissions begin,” he added.With offline exams being cancelled, the evaluations were held based on the internal marks and performance in Std IX. This led to rise in pass percentages not just in Pune, but across Maharashtra.Assistant director of education, Pune region, Meena Shendkar, said, “Not all of these passed students will apply for FYJC. There are many other courses like post-SSC diploma, ITI, polytechnic among others where some students will join. We had nearly 36,000 seats vacant last year so there is surety of a good amount of seats that would suffice excess applications.”Vice-principal of Ness Wadia College of Commerce, Prakash Chaudhary, said students may not get the college of their choice because of competition. “There are a few new colleges, where they would get admissions. Moreover, many universities have distance learning programmes. Students would join such courses as nowadays most of the teaching learning process is online,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ssc-outcome-to-put-stress-on-availability-of-fyjc-seats/articleshow/84597389.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Nearly 70% of the ITI syllabus is based on practical training and 30% is theory so remote teaching was a big challenge for institutes. Considering the needs of students and also given hands-on training, the DVET decided to reopen offline classes and has also issued a set of guidelines to follow inside campuses. Students said that the reopening of institutes would help them in a big way as they had missed out on important concepts due to lack of practical training. Director of DVET, D A Dalvi said, “There were some limitations in imparting some concepts through online methods to students. At the same time, students can polish their skills at the institute workshop only once they get hands-on training. We had requested the state government to give permission to start the ITIs considering the issues with remote learning and it was approved.” The DVET was given permission on the condition that all the guidelines issued by the state government as well as the disaster management department of the state government. The theory part will continue to be taught online whereas the practical training of the students should be conducted in batches. Dalvi said the institutes have been told to ensure that the students are vaccinated on priority. At the same time, the ITI staff, non-teaching staff and officers should also be vaccinated on priority. Dalvi said, “The basic preventive measures including simple public health measures that are to be followed to reduce the risk of Covid-19 infection need to be abided by the students and college staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/with-70-practical-training-itis-will-reopen-tomorrow/articleshow/84597446.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Former state chief secretary Ajoy Mehta had purchased the flat from Anamitra Properties Pvt Ltd, Kothrud, in Pune. He is currently MahaRera chairman. Mehta said, “Like any buyer, I checked that there was no loan on the flat or any dispute on the property before purchasing it from the seller (Nikhil Gokhale). How can I know what his or his company’s background is? I paid all the money through cheques after using all my fixed deposits and retirement benefits. I purchased it at its market rate in the 35-year-old building.” The I-T has issued a show-cause notice to the company after it found that one of the shareholders stayed in a chawl. The department issued a show-cause notice to the principal officer of Anamitra Properties Pvt Ltd, Kothrud, after it found that the person who has 99% shareholding, Kamlesh Singh, denied any connection with the company. I-T officials suspect someone misused his details to show him as owner of the company. Singh lives in a chawl off Western Express Highway at Goregaon East. One of the company’s directors, Nikhil Gokhale, sold the flat last year to Mehta. The I-T notice stated Anamitra Properties Pvt Ltd had purchased the flat in 2009 for Rs 4 crore reportedly from the son of a late judge, who owned the flat. Anamitra had no business activity, and the I-T department suspects it was the flat’s benami owner. It is inquiring about the person controlling the company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-i-t-probing-ownership-of-flat-sold-to-ex-babu/articleshow/84601402.cms||Vijay V Singh

The state government cancelled the Std XII examination due to Covid-19 and declared a formula to calculate the internal assessment marks of students. The formula gave 40% weightage to internal examination marks obtained by the student in class XII, and 30% each for class XI and X final examination marks. Medha Sinnarkar, principal of Laxmanrao Apte Prashala, said that uploading the data is the easy part but actually getting the data was the tough part, at least in the case of some students. “There were some students who were not at all in contact, or whose contact number was not uploaded. These students had not submitted any assignments or had not appeared for the internal examinations. Our teachers actually had to go searching for their homes in this pandemic. In some cases, the house was locked. They got the contact number from the neighbours, called up the families who had gone to their home towns and got the students to submit their assignments online,” said Sinnarkar. Savita Datar, principal of SP College, said that while it was a bit difficult to get the data of seven students, her college was still able to get all the data at the end. “One of the students we contacted said he wants to take a drop year and we agreed. But other than that, our teachers were able to secure all the submissions from students. I will advise students not to stress over results at all,” said Datar. Mahendra Ganpule, state spokesman, Maharashtra Headmaster Association said that the link to upload the data for schools is available from July 16 to 23.  “All schools will be able to complete their updation by then. Mumbai region is lagging behind a bit because of the heavy rainfall which is preventing teachers from showing up for work. The result will be declared on or before July 31. Secondly, everybody is working hard and the process is much smoother as they are already familiar with the process due to the similarity in class X assessment,” said Ganpule. Dinkar Patil, the chairman of the state board, also said that the process of updating the data of HSC was happening at considerable speed and data of over 5.9 lakh students has been compiled by the junior colleges. Classes for existing technical education courses will have to start latest by October 1, but those for the first-year students will begin by October 25, as per the latest schedule declared by the AICTE for 2021-22. Students will be able to cancel their admissions and get full refund only if they apply before October 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/junior-colleges-compile-nearly-6-lakh-hsc-results/articleshow/84597415.cms||Ardhra Nair

But now, Shah who is pursuing doctoral studies in the Department of Postgraduate Business Studies, has started using a special facility that helps him not only listen to books written in any language but also translate these using the internet — all thanks to Bhaikaka Library of Vallabh Vidyanagar. The Sardar Patel University (SPU) installed a cusers of this library. The special facility of a screen scanner – Kibo – has been made available for the disabled students at the library, the largest facility in the education hub of Charotar region of Central Gujarat. “With the help of this screen scanner, a visually impaired student can listen to a book written in any language in the same language. In addition, since this scanner is connected to Google translate through internet, it is also possible to translate the book into English, Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi so that the student can understand the book written in any language in his own language,” said Shishir Mandaliya, the main librarian. “There are limited documents or resources available in braille and it is too much costly to convert our regular book into braille. This Kibo scanner provides a better option to read all regular books and convert them into audio form,” said Mandaliya. “We want more visually-impaired and disabled students of Anand and Kheda regions to take advantage of this facility,” he said. The library which has been named after Bhaikaka, who had established SPU to cater to the educational needs of rural students, has a rich collection of 2.65 lakh books and reading material. More than 3,000 members register every year to avail its facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vv-nagar-library-shows-vision-for-blind-people/articleshow/84594941.cms||Prashant Rupera

One of its residents, Prasad Kawre, was anything but, until he was arrested last week by the Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terror Squad (ATS), for carrying out illegal conversions. Kawre lived on the second floor for around five years. He was discreetly arrested with two of his associates; one of them staying at the flat since over a month, and the other a regular visitor, said sources here. When TOI visited the apartment on Tuesday afternoon, the 35-year old Kawre’s neighbours said the family had little interaction with others. The neighbours only came to know about his arrest through the newspapers next day. Prasad used to stay with his mother Shalini and sister Aarti, both of whom left the flat two days ago. The neighbours TOI spoke to said Prasad spoke little to others, leave aside talking about religion. In front of his locked house, the only religious symbol is a swastika engraved on an empty pot. A neighbour said on condition of anonymity that a team of cops in plain clothes reached the apartment in the afternoon, and took away Prasad after questioning. “There were some people in the corridor, after some time they went inside. I thought they must be relatives but later came to know they were cops,” said a neighbour, himself a retired policeman. Prasad’s father, who was employed in a mining PSU, passed away in 2018. Prasad spent most of his time at home, and was not known to be working anywhere, the source said. He had got married a couple of years ago and his wife was from Malaysia. She always wore a scarf around the face and did not interact with others. For some months they stayed at a separate rented flat. Later, his wife went back and Prasad returned to Rahul Complex, said an acquaintance. In the neighbourhood, Kawre was known as a person who would not interact much with others, but was well-behaved. The arrests were part of the investigations in UP’s Umar Gautam case. Gautam, a cleric from UP, has been arrested for luring nearly 1,000 persons into conversion. The arrests had been made under the UP law against unlawful religious conversions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/quiet-man-never-spoke-let-alone-of-religion-arrested-for-illegal-conversions/articleshow/84595025.cms||Shishir Arya

Chetna Kerure, joint managing director of Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML), told TOI that they were identifying certain spots along the corridors through which private vehicles mostly enter. Barriers would be installed at these spots to prevent the entry of private vehicles. “Most of the BRTS corridors in the PMC area are mixed or hybrid. The PMPML is identifying spots and crossings through which vehicles enter. The plan is to plug those spots with boom barriers. Letters have been sent to both the municipal corporations, requesting them to provide funds for the same,” the official said. The PMPML had come up with a plan to install boom barriers at the entrances of all corridors in February this year. These automatic boom barriers would open to allow entry of PMPML buses. However, in May, former PMPML chairman and managing director Rajendra Jagtap said that the plan had been suspended as the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations lacked funds. “The project has been postponed for now. The transport body is facing severe fund shortage. the money which comes from both the municipal corporations is not forthcoming. The situation is prsently such that if the Pune Municipal Corporation and the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation don't provide funds we will not be able to pay salaries to our employees for May,” Jagtap had said. Another PMPML official said that a request has been made to the Pimpri Chinchwad civic body to provide funds for installing boom barriers. “There are four corridors in Pimpri Chinchwad and one is under construction,” the official said. These include Nashik Phata-Wakad, Nigdi-Dapodi, Aundh-Kiwle and Chikli-Kalewadi Phata. A new corridor connecting Dighi to Alandi, spanning 8km, is under construction. There are three corridors in the Pune Municipal Corporation limits— the Yerawada-Wagholi corridor, Sangamwadi-Vishrantwadi corridor and the Swargate-Katraj corridor. The BRTS corridor on the Pune-Solapur Road has been dismantled. Transport activists have raised doubts over the new plan. “The PMPML has already said that money is a problem. Then what is the guarantee that the Pune civic body will pay for the boom barriers? Also, isn’t it a better idea to install these barriers at the main entrances of the corridors?” PMP Pravasi Manch activist Sanjay Shitole said. A PMPML official said that the main entrances of the corridors were relatively safe and guards could be posted to prevent private vehicles from entering. Parth Jadhav, a regular commuter, said, “Commuters disregard rules, abuse guards and enter the corridors. At the Swargate-Katraj corridor, the PMC didn’t even care to install automated gates at bus stops.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/boom-barrier-project-back-on-pmpml-radar/articleshow/84597479.cms||Joy Sengupta

The crime branch on Monday brought Pujari to Ahmedabad from Bengaluru and later in the day produced him in a court in Borsad. After competition of 24-hour custody, the police produced him again in the court and asked for his remand for 14 days. The court granted a week’s police remand, sources said. The Karnataka police got Pujari extradited from Senegal in January 2019. The Gujarat police obtained the home department’s sanction to obtain his custody. This is because out of nearly 70 offences filed against Pujari, the Ahmedabad’s crime branch has filed as many as 14 FIRs against him, which include charges of murder, extortion and criminal intimidation. The Gujarat police obtained Pujari’s custody from the Karnataka police in connection with a shootout on independent councillor Pragnesh Patel in Borsad. According to the FIR, Patel was attacked by two motorcycle-borne men who fired four rounds at him outside his house on January 13, 2017. Later, the attackers were revealed to be Pujari's henchmen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ravi-pujari-sent-to-police-custody-for-seven-days/articleshow/84597509.cms||---

The village has been working systematically since last month to get its residents, especially the most vulnerable, vaccinated. Regular meetings are held online to clear misconceptions about the vaccine and to work out strategies to ensure no one is left out. The panchayat has also been distributing ‘Vaccinated Assolnekar’ badges to vegetable and fish vendors who have taken the jab. Sarpanch Xavier Almeida said certificates/posters are distributed to shopkeepers, commercial establishments and restaurants where all the staff has been vaccinated. These specially designed certificates ‘Welcome to Safe Shopping- All Who work here are Vaccinated’ and ‘Vaccinated-Welcome to safe restaurant- All those who work here are vaccinated- Keep Assolna Healthy and Covid free’ which are pasted at the premises, act as an assurance to customers and promote the vaccination message, he said. The most difficult task for the team was establishing the baseline data of the resident population and finding out how many of them have been vaccinated. They also took it upon themselves to get those who come into the village for work, vaccinated and have been taking into account youth who have just turned 18 and even that of tenants living in the village. Assolna resident and volunteer Simitra Rodrigues said the parish pastoral council collected information of the resident population, noting down those vaccinated, Covid positive and reasons for not taking the vaccine, and have been working together with panch members, who are mapping these against the electoral rolls to ensure nobody is missed. They have also found that around 6.4% of the population tested positive recently and will have to wait till they are eligible to take the vaccine. Dr Ira Almeida and Dr Nickson Fernandes at the primary health centre Chinchinim have been supporting the vaccination drives. Parish priest of Assolna church, Fr Sertorio Rodrigues has been sending out WhatsApp messages to the faithful in Konkani motivating them to take the jab and protect themselves. Some are hesitant and others afraid, he said. “I tell them that if they don’t get vaccinated, we won’t be able to open our church,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/peoples-movement-in-assolna-combating-vaccine-hesitancy/articleshow/84597646.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Pune Municipal Corporation’s water supply department has initiated repairs to the pipeline but said it might take a couple of days further for the supply to be restored. In the meantime, local corporators have hired water tankers to meet the needs of their constituents and urged the PMC to speed up the repair work. A civic official said, “A water pipeline that comes from Ravet has developed a leak. It is not easy to access the spot, as the pipeline is located under other pipelines. A few of the PCMC’s pipelines also pass through this location. It is close to the river, which has made moving machinery difficult. We are going all out to restore the supply.” The areas affected include Dhanori, Bhairavnagar and Dhanori’s suburbs. Corporator Anil Tingre said around 10,000 residents have been affected. “We have urged PMC to make temporary arrangements for water from alternative sources, like the Bhama Askhed pipeline network. PMC will provide a temporary solution by Wednesday,” Tingre said. A resident Sanjay Kadam said, “Some parts of Dhanori now get supply from Bhama Askhed. The administration should lay pipelines in the rest of the area.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pipeline-leak-disrupts-water-supply-to-dhanori/articleshow/84597507.cms||Sarang Dastane

All other arrangements are also in place. On the ground floor, we have developed an eight-bedded ICU ward to take care of the critical patients. Last year, we didn’t have this ICU facility and hence, we were referring all serious patients to other hospitals,” said a senior SDMC official. A project to set up oxygen plants at its Nehru Nagar and Kalkaji hospitals is also in progress. “At Purnima Sethi Hospital in Kalkaji, the process for installing the plant is going on. It will take another 10 days. The plant will supply oxygen to 50 beds and thus, reduce our dependence on oxygen cylinders. As far as the TB Hospital in Nehru Nagar is concerned, we have signed an MoU with an organisation for setting up an oxygen plant under the CSR activity. We will soon initiate the installation process,” said the official. Plants at Tilak Nagar and Kalkaji hospitals are being installed by IGL. The civic body, in association with an NGO, has, meanwhile, launched a 60-day campaign titled ‘Win Covid-19 through awareness & action’. “It has been launched in association with Society for All Round Development. A vehicle will take rounds in different areas every day and make people aware about the third wave. The aim is to make people follow the Covid norms strictly,” said SDMC mayor Mukesh Suryan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/eye-on-3rd-wave-tilak-ngr-hosp-to-get-icu-ward-o2-plant/articleshow/84597610.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Ahmedabad||Ankita upbeat about Tokyo challenge||A tough initiation into the Grand Slam club (three first-round exits in doubles at Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon) notwithstanding, India’s top-ranked doubles player Ankita Raina exudes confidence ahead of her Olympics debut. She reached Tokyo on Tuesday along with her doubles partner Sania Mirza, a multiple Grand Slam winner. “I’m pumped up for my debut at Olympics. I want to enjoy and play my heart out there,” Ankita told TOI just before she left for Tokyo. Ankita flew down from London to Hyderabad along with Sania after playing at Wimbledon. She and Ramkumar Ramanathan had lost to the experienced Sania-Rohan Bopanna pair in the opening round of the mixed doubles. “Sania and I practiced together over the last few days. My coach Hemant Bendrey was also there to train me,” Ankita said. Acknowledging that the competition at the Olympics would be tough, the 28-year-old Asian Games bronze medallist said it would not deter the pair from giving their best. “Every athlete competing at the Olympics goes for gold. Having said that, I know how tough the competition will be at the Olympics. But with Sania on my side and her experience (the Hyderabadi is playing her fourth Olympics), I’m ready to take on the best. I’ve had good performances this year and so I’m feeling confident,” she further said. When queried about the nerves ahead of her maiden appearance at the Olympics, the Ahmedabad-born player said, “That’s there in every match but my best performances have come when playing for the flag.” Bendrey told TOI, “For me, before any match the chances are always 50:50. It depends how you play on that day to change the odds in your favour. Both have the game to beat any pair. Ultimately it will depend on how they perform on that particular day.” Another person who knows the games and style of play of both Ankita and Sania is Vishal Uppal, captain of the Indian team at the Billie Jean King Cup. He said, “ Both are fighters. If they can gel together and play to their respective strengths, the chances are good.” Ankita plays on the ad court and Sania on the deuce court. “Sania will have to be the leader on the court obviously because of her experience. The first match is important. If they can win that and settle down quickly, they have the chance to progress deep into the draw,” the Delhi-based Uppal said, adding that the surface for the Games is hard court, which would be to the liking of both the players. Ankita Bhambri, who has coached Ankita Raina in the now re-christened Fed Cup, said that the exposure Sania has will play a vital role in crunch moments. “Ankita is constantly trying to better herself after every match and has improved a lot over the last three-four years. Also, Sania’s experience will be an important factor in crunch moments,” Bhambri told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ankita-upbeat-about-tokyo-challenge/articleshow/84597563.cms||Sabu Cherian

Especially in the first 4 months of 2021 — when the Covid-19 second wave was wreaking havoc, Lower Segment Caesarean Section (LSCS) deliveries increased significantly. According to doctors, Covid-19 is not the only reason behind this change. In Indira Gandhi Government Medical College (IGGMCH) and Mayo hospital, 55% of deliveries in year 2021 were LSCS, which is significantly more than its annual average of 40%. Mayo Hospital caters a huge number of Antenatal Care (ANC) patients from poor as well as middle-class families. Patients reach here from peripheries for delivery. However, normal deliveries are generally at the higher side here, said doctors. “But in last six months, we conducted 1,577 deliveries out of which 870 were C-Sections. This is unusual. Late presentation of ANCs due to Covid fear could be one major reason,” said a senior doctor from Mayo’s Gynaecology department. Daga Memorial Hospital is dedicated to women and child care and patients reach here from all parts of the division. Here, 58.3% of deliveries in 2021 were LSCS against its three-year average of 44%. “Total 2,585 out of 4,430 deliveries conducted between January and June 2021 were C-Section deliveries. Many patients presented in complicated conditions due to which doctors had to go for the surgical delivery,” said the doctor here. In Government medical college (GMCH), 43.7% of total deliveries were LSCS in 2020. This percentage increased to 51.3% in 2021 (up to June). Out of 2,772 deliveries, 1,421 were C-Sections. Charity nursing homes like Matru Seva Sangh and private nursing homes run by the gynaecologists attached to Nagpur Obstetricians and Gynaecology Society (NOGS) have also shared similar experience. “Uncertainty due to Covid-19 is one of the major reasons behind patients opting for C-Sections,” said Dr Alka Mukherjee, President of NOGS. According to her, patients and relatives wanted planned deliveries to avoid the uncertainty of medical facilities and doctors during Covid times. There are many metabolic reasons too. “Staying at home without exercise increased metabolic problems like obesity which added into complications of pregnancy. Depression is also a reason. Due to increased stress and depression during the second wave, patients avoided taking any chances risking their pregnancy by waiting for normal delivery,” added Dr Mukherjee. A veteran in gynaecology Dr Natachandra Chimote had told TOI in April that third-trimester pregnant women when turning corona positive can cause preterm deliveries even in 28-30 weeks of pregnancy. “This is a global phenomenon and it happened locally too. Pre-term deliveries were conducted in large numbers through Caesarean section,” he added. Doctors said that the number of C-sections will gradually decrease as life will come to normalcy post-second wave. But, it will still take some time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nearly-10-rise-in-c-section-deliveries-in-govt-hosps-data/articleshow/84597570.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The ceremony in Gandhinagar also had Jagruti Pandya, chairperson of Gujarat State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, and C K Patel, president of Shishu Gruh. The couple — Roberto Bacchin and Annalisa Poletti — had started the procedure of adoption through CARA in 2020, but due the waves of Covid, first in Italy and then in India, delayed the procedure, said officials. “The girl has spastic limbs, and thus she was listed in special care category on the website. She was abandoned by her biological parents within the fortnight of birth probably because of the health issues she was fighting with and low birth weight,” said an official associated with the process. “She was first kept in Palanpur facility and then in an NGO based in Ahmedabad.” State adoption agency officials said that during the pandemic, it’s second international adoption from the city, and eighth overall adoption. “Shreya learnt Italian through numerous video calls in the past one year, as the couple had made all preparations to get her home. The formalities have been completed, and they will soon fly back home,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/girl-abandoned-after-birth-gets-home-in-italy/articleshow/84597605.cms||---

By evening, however, a few students had managed to get onto the link and complete their registration within minutes.The link made available for the SSC results on Friday had crashed, prompting state education minister Varsha Gaikwad to set up a five-member committee to probe. The committee will find out, among other things, if a trial run was done by the state board before throwing open the link.TimesViewThe state board seems to have not learnt from its past mistake. Its site has crashed twice in a week, leading to questions on whether trial runs were done before launching the site. The state should have anticipated large numbers of students logging on and ensured enough back-up servers.On Monday, the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) announced that CET registration was going to be open from July 20 to 26. When students got onto the website http://cet.mh-ssc.ac.in on Tuesday, the link did not open. Students who got onto the link in the evening said registering was a smooth affair. Several schools in the city helped their students register for the CET. Parents are even approaching schools to help students prepare for the CET. With the syllabus for the CET also being released by the state on Monday, schools are asking teachers of English, maths, science and social sciences to help students prepare for the test. The optional CET will be held on August 21. Only CET scores will be considered for the first round of admissions, when most top-notch colleges and subjects are grabbed. Junior college principals and academicians feel the CET should have been held earlier as the Covid situation is under control. “There is no guarantee that the third wave will hit by the third week of August. The admission process will also stretch to the end of September-October,” said the principal of a city college. A college lecturer said that the CET in the second week would have been ideal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-ssc-results-link-website-for-cet-too-crashes/articleshow/84600043.cms||Sandhya Nair

India had banned nearly 250 Chinese apps after a bitter border stand-off. Students allege that the varsities are forcing them to download the banned mobile applications to continue with their courses. Most universities in China are using apps like WeChat, DingTalk, SuperStar and a video chat app by Tencent. They have asked students to manage access to these apps and study. These students, who are members of the Indian Students in China (ISC), have raised the issue with both the Chinese and Indian authorities. As a temporary solution, students are accessing these apps through Virtual Private Network (VPN) to attend classes. “Earlier my classes were conducted online on WeChat app. But after it was banned by the Indian government, my university started using another Chinese platform DingTalk, but that too got banned,” said Shahrukh Khan, a student from Delhi and currently studying in Soochow University. These students pay annual tuition fees ranging between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 4.5 lakh. Moreover, travel to China too is still banned. “Due to network issues, we can’t attend lectures and it is certainly not smooth learning. Due to a lot of disturbance, we do not even understand the basic details sometimes,” said a student in Vadodara, who is also the national coordinator of ISC. Nimrat Singh, a student from Jaipur, recently completed second-year MBBS in Harbin Medical University. Singh is now preparing for the National Exit Test (NExT) exam that is mandatory for foreign students to practice in India. “I don’t know when I can attend the regular classes and we face major issues in attending online classes as well. My university is conducting classes on the Tencent app, which is banned in India,” Singh said. Various organizations from India are trying to raise the issues with competent authorities. “On behalf of Gujarat students, I and some others are trying to arrange a meeting with ministers in the central government to discuss the issues of these students,” said Manish Kapadiya, a member of Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce (SGCCI).

Former leader of house Narendra Chawla and other councillors said that despite rolling back some points of the reports in the house meeting earlier, including those stressing upon charging increased taxes from the rented commercial properties by changing the factor use, the department continued to charge taxes at increased rates. On being questioned, a senior SDMC official said that the matter was being looked into by the department concerned. “We are looking into the matter and there is no official order issued in this regard so far. As soon as we get directions, changes will be implemented immediately. If required, we will either adjust in the next financial year or reimburse the amount in future to the taxpayers,” said the official. The order, once implemented, will benefit non-residential rented commercial properties as they will receive relaxation from exorbitant tax rates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-councillors-seek-rollback-of-tax-hike/articleshow/84597659.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

This has been more so in rural areas than the urban areas. To address this issue, the community health centre at Varappuzha has developed an innovative model for detection of early diabetes complications and submitted a proposal to the Alangad block panchayat to start screening as the Covid situation comes under control. The CHC team of doctors and health workers has developed the model for detection with zero expense for the patient. They hope it will address the challenge of their follow-ups and continued monitoring. “Diabetes is a condition which needs a lot of attention. We have developed a model that could be replicated across the state,” said Dr Appu Cyriac, diabetologist and chief medical officer, CHC Varappuzha. He said that they have trained the physiotherapist at the centre to work as a diabetic educator and have also engaged all clinical and field staff of the CHC. “The diabetic educator and diabetic nurse, both are essential for a comprehensive approach to diabetes complications,” he said. Dr Appu said that often when patients come after being detected with diabetes, they would already have developed other complications like retinopathy or a renal condition which, if the patient has not been made aware of, could lead to fast deterioration. The role of the diabetic educator, along with the primary care physician, is very much useful to plan the strategies to be followed for effective diabetes management like giving advice on diet, lifestyle and self-care practices, foot assessment at each visit, surveillance for microvascular complications, medication, cardiovascular risk reduction, and identifying and tracking patients with poor glycemic control. “We used this model to check around 150 patients at our centre. Of the 150, we saw that nearly 20% have retinopathy, more than 50% have renal problems and a few have diabetic foot complications. Nearly 10% have cardiac issues,” he added. Also, most of the patients with complications have good blood sugar values in the accepted level and none of them have any symptoms of complications which show the importance of this project. All these can be done at the PHC/CHC level, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/chc-level-diabetes-detection-mooted/articleshow/84595214.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

While the opposition accused the government of not being prepared for the second wave, the treasury benches countered the charges, citing timelines of decisions and measures taken by the government — ranging from augmenting oxygen supplies and speeding up vaccination. Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge led the charge criticising PM Narendra Modi for “breaking the trust” of people who followed what he said. Questioning the official death toll, he asked, “Will the number of deaths due to Covid remain a mystery?” He also alleged that the PM had made Harsh Vardhan, who was the Union health minister till the recent reshuffle, a “scapegoat”. Reacting to the criticism, BJP member Vinay Sahasrabuddhe wondered why the opposition chooses to attack every action of the government and the PM and termed it “ideological jaundice”. Union minister Hardeep Puri refuted the charge that the government’s response to the pandemic was delayed and said India was the first to stop flights from China.

The department has invited tenders for data collection and investigation, which is crucial to identify the exact strategy for shore protection at Kovalam. The investigation work will be carried out at Rs 14.68 lakh. “The investigation will focus on factors which have led to erosion at Kovalam. We also need to do a comparative analysis of pattern of erosion over the years,” said an official with the Harbour engineering department. As per the annual report on shoreline change of Vizhinjam coast between 2018 and 2019 submitted to Kerala coastal zone management authority (KCZMA), the beach on the northern part of the port between Kovalam-Panathura and Poonthura showed erosion trend for both post monsoon and fair weather periods. In the pre-monsoon period of 2019 (April to May), significant erosion was noticed at the northern side of the port, Valiyathura to Thumba. Kovalam, Panathura and Cheriyathura showed accretion. The beach volume changes for February 2015 and February 2019 showed accretion at Valliyaveli to Vettucaud, Mullur to Adimalathura and Poovar and erosion at Shangumugham to Beemapally, Punthura, Pannathura, Kovalam, Poovar to Edapadu beach, as per the report. The shoreline change reported for 2019-20, however, showed Kovalam was one of the areas where accretion was reported. Recently, owing to recurring instances of sea erosion, beach nourishment technique was proposed by transport minister Antony Raju. Raju has demanded that the sand being mined as part of the construction of Vizhinjam harbour shall be deposited on the coast from Poonthura to Veli. The minister gave a letter to fisheries minister Saji Cherian citing the need for preparing a project report. According to experts, natural and manmade factors have contributed equally to depletion of sediment deposit on the beaches along the district coast. Cumulative erosion has been detrimental to the beaches. Earlier, the district used to have a regular weather pattern like monsoon from June to September and then there would be a fair patch which will begin from October till April. This period used to witness a natural beach building process. Even if beaches got washed away during rain, part of it or even more would come back in the following months. Periodic cyclonic activity, storm conditions, extreme rainfall situations and some manmade reasons may have resulted in this, the officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/harbour-dept-to-initiate-study-on-shore-protection/articleshow/84595231.cms||Aswin J Kumar

---||Delhi||Road Leading To Old Delhi Rly Station Up For Revamp||New Delhi: An integrated corridor-improvement plan has been prepared to revamp Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Marg near Old Delhi Railway Station. This will involve creating a parking site for 50 buses, a multilevel parking for 1,100 vehicles and lanes for non-motorised vehicles, all of which would decongest the area. A Public Works Department official said that a separate loading-unloading area had also been incorporated in the plan. The stretch, starting from Hanuman temple, has been divided into five sections with local interventions for decongestion in each phase. The largest parking space in the Walled City will be created at Dangal Maidan and will have the capacity to slot 1,116 cars on its eight floors. “The four-storey basement will hold 648 vehicles, while the ground floor and three stories above it will accommodate the rest," a PWD official elaborated. Points have been marked along the stretch for parking bicycles, handcarts and non-motorised vehicles. Due to the location of one of the city’s busiest railway stations, the area currently faces a big parking problem for buses. With this in mind, parking space for 50 buses has also been earmarked in the plans. While these will also help improve the walkability in the region, an added protection for pedestrians will be provided by 600-mm red Agra stone bollards that will prevent entry of vehicles in areas meant for non-motorised vehicles and walkers. The plan provides for a fully segregated path for non-motorised vehicles alongside the main road, developed by putting up roadside planters with 2-feet-high parapets. Table-top road crossings will be created and reduced vehicular speed will be enforced to provide traffic calming measures at the crossings. PWD carried out a vehicle density analysis and lane width changes have been recommended. On the Hanuman temple-Netaji Subhash Marg segment, there were 1,414 vehicles during the morning peak hour and 2,742 in the evening. PWD has proposed that instead of the current lane configuration, a three-lane, one-way configuration could be implemented for traffic moving in both the north and south directions. "This will ease traffic congestion for motorists passing through the Shahjahanabad area and improve interchangeability to public transport," an official explained. The plan states that there will be fixed hours regulating the loading and unloading of commercial goods while preserving the heritage character of the area. Parking and pickup points for app-based taxis, autorickshaws and tempos will be made outside Old Delhi Railway Station plus a halt-and-go area for 70 cars. The taxi parking will have space for 70 rickshaws, 35 autorickshaws, 25 tempos and 155 handcarts too. A 6-metre skywalk connecting the railway station and taxi stand and the parking lot has also been proposed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/road-leading-to-old-delhi-rly-station-up-for-revamp/articleshow/84597740.cms||Paras Singh

---||Kochi||Corp staff suspended for tax money mismanagement||Thiruvananthapuram: The latest instance of disciplinary action against a corporation staff for irregularities in handling tax collection amount has brought to fore the shortcomings in the system. An office attendant was placed under suspension on Monday for failure in remitting the amount collected as tax promptly in the bank. He was also found to have committed forgery by furnishing a fake counter foil to mislead the supervising official that the amount was deposited. The fraud came to light after the revenue inspector cross verified it with the bank statement which showed that amount of around Rs 1.5 lakh was missing in the statement. When questioned again, the office attendant admitted to have committed the fraud. The matter was soon taken up with the secretary who suspended him and also filed a complaint with the police for forgery. It has also been forwarded to local fund audit for further action. Two years ago the performance audit wing had found out during inspection that three bill collectors had delayed in depositing the amount collected as tax with city corporation and that the revenue inspectors who were supposed to monitor the collection and remittance failed to ensure prompt deposit of collection. Six officials with the revenue wing of the city corporation had faced suspension following the performance audit report regarding mismanagement of money collected as tax amount from residents. Earlier local fund audit wing had also pointed out instances where bill collectors failed to deposit the money collected as tax with city corporation. Directions were issued to the officials concerned to monitor the daily collection register and record the remittance accordingly. The city corporation had even conducted a series of reform measures in the revenue wing like a refresher course after the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-staff-suspended-for-tax-money-mismanagement/articleshow/84595276.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Covid wave ebbs, but focus upped on enforcement||NEW DELHI: The number of Covid-19 cases might be down, but the district authorities are not taking any chances. The decline in the number of containment zones and active cases has led to higher contact tracing and surveillance, apart from more emphasis on enforcement. July saw around 7,000 challans being issued on average every day, except for a dip on Monday and Tuesday due to heavy rainfall. Sources in Delhi government said that district authorities had been asked to strictly fine people violating Covid-19 norms and the target was to raise the number from 7,000 to 11,000 challans a day, with 1,000 challans on average from each of the 11 revenue districts. “We have been told to ramp up enforcement. We are focusing mainly on markets and keeping a very close watch on violators. However, challan figures were comparatively lower on Monday and Tuesday due to heavy rainfall,” a district official said. This month, the highest number of challans, 17,560, was issued in Shahdara district, followed by South East (17,167) and North (16,784). The lowest number of challans, 6,599, was issued in South West district. With the number of containment zones down to 406 and active cases being as low as 569, the district authorities were able to follow surveillance and contact tracing much more strictly. “During the peak of the second wave, our staff was stretched thin due to the high number of cases. However, now that the number of cases is very low, we are ensuring to stop the spread of the virus as much as possible,” the official said. “For instance, we are asking everyone testing Covid-positive about their movement not during the previous week, but going as far back as possible. We are asking them about details of everyone they met during that period. After we make a detailed history of a patient’s movement, we inform officials in those places to immediately contact those people and get them tested,” said the official. The official added, “During April and May, it was getting difficult to do intensive contact tracing, but now we are easily tracing more than 30 contacts or more for each individual. We are going into the depth while charting all the possible places a patient has been.” Surveillance in and around containment zones has been increased. “A very close watch is being kept not only inside the zones, but also in areas around them. Regular and intensive testing in these areas is also being carried out,” the official stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-wave-ebbs-but-focus-upped-on-enforcement/articleshow/84599854.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Nagpur||Redness of eye mistaken as mucor in post Covid phase||NAGPUR: Apprehensions of having contracted the dreadful mucormycosis — early symptoms of which are seen in eye, nose or teeth — among recovered Covid patients has led to an increased detection of ocular surface inflammation (OSI) and retinal vasculitis (RV), say doctors. Some city eye specialists said home isolated patients are reporting OSI (redness in eyes) while those who were admitted for Covid treatment are generally suffering from RV (clotting in eye). Both the disorders were seen during the first wave too, but as large number of people were infected and many mucor, also known as black fungus, cases emerged, these two ophthalmic post Covid complications have doubled this time. Well-known eye specialist Dr Gopal Arora, however, observed that the two disorders are commonly seen in ophthalmology and presently co-related with other factors and not just Covid. “Dry eye syndrome has come to be known as digital eye strain or computer vision syndrome. It is due to increased screen time. Clotting in eye can result due to multiple factors, with Covid being one of them,” he said. Other doctors said patients are self-diagnosing the redness in eye as mucormycosis, which following diagnosis doesn’t turn out to be the case. Retina surgeon Dr Sandeep Anjankar said he has been getting patients with complaints of redness in eye. “Mostly, patients are suffering from OSI or conjunctivitis. But these symptoms are misdiagnosed to be mucormycosis by the patients themselves. Retinal vasculitis or vascular occlusion (blockage of a blood vessel, usually with a clot) occurs either due to increased inflammatory or coagulating factors,” he said. Dr Anjankar added, “In 90% cases, vision loss is reversible if the disorder is detected early.” Consultant ophthalmologist Dr Ashish Kamble said, “When a new virus or bacteria infects a body, sometimes cross-antigenicity can occur. This means certain viral antigens mimic those of the body which mount an immune response in the body, including in the eyes which is most commonly presented as redness of eye.” He added inflammation means body’s immune system is activated. When the inflammation occurs in ocular surface, the eye turns red. “I have commonly seen this in post-Covid patients,” said Dr Kamble. Not just Covid, it can happen after any viral infection. “It can be seen in any post viral inflammation, even in bacterial infections like tuberculosis too,” he said. Regarding retinal occlusion, Dr Kamble said it is known that clotting in heart or brain is a post-Covid problem. “Same types of clots are formed in blood vessels of eye. This is called vascular occlusion. Sometimes, there are clots in artery which supplies blood to the eye. This is a bad situation as it can result in permanent loss of vision. Veins, which pump out blood from eye, may also get clots. In this case too, vision is affected, but to some extent can be restored,” he said. In mucor, artery occlusion was found along with other complications like drooping of eyelids, diplopia (double vision) and proptosis (prominence and forward displacement of eyeballs). It is very rare for mucormycosis to cause vascular occlusion alone, said Dr Kamble.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/redness-of-eye-mistaken-as-mucor-in-post-covid-phase/articleshow/84597746.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Delhi||Delhi: Crooks pose as Microsoft representatives to dupe US citizens||NEW DELHI: A fake call centre that was duping US citizens by posing as representatives of Microsoft has been busted in west Delhi’s Moti Nagar and nine people have been arrested. The gang sent fake pop-ups like “ransomware detected”, “security warning” etc and then contacted the target offering to resolve the issue in lieu of money. The cyber cell had received information about some people running an international-level online cheating racket at Sudarshan Park in Moti Nagar in an organised manner.  “It also came to notice that fraudsters were engaged in using illegal techniques, VOIP calling, bypassing the legal international long distance gateways and thus causing wrongful loss to the government exchequer while making money illegally,” said Urvija Goel, DCP (west). Surveillance was mounted and Intelligence developed about the syndicate, which revealed that they were cheating people based abroad (USA/Canada) on the false pretext of providing them technical support by pretending to be members of tech-support team of Microsoft/Windows. Accordingly, a team led by inspector Arun Chauhan was constituted to catch the criminals involved in the racket. The team raided a flat where several people were found engaged in making and receiving calls. International numbers were being displayed on many of the screens installed at their desktops. Nine persons were taken into custody from the spot. Six of them claimed to be owners, while three said they had been hired as tele-callers. The accused were in the age group of thirties. During questioning, it was revealed that the accused, through their pop-up vendors, sent fake pop-ups on targets’ computers and instructed them to call a telephone number specified on the pop-up in order to pay for technical support to resolve the threat. “The given telephone number were of the fake call centre,” Goel said. The victims were made to pay the amount through e-cheques, which were drawn in US-based bank accounts of the gang’s overseas contacts. Cops have seized six computers, a laptop, nine phones, routers, cheating script, telecommunication software, VOIP dialers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/crooks-pose-as-microsoft-reps-to-dupe-us-citizens/articleshow/84597821.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||TNSTC sees rise in passengers, turnover as Covid-19 cases dip||Coimbatore: The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) seems to be limping back to business slowly but steadily. To start with, the passenger traffic has increased within two weeks of resuming services and the daily turnover has touched 60% of the pre-lockdown figures. The number of women passengers has seen a spike, thanks to the free ride that the government has offered them. Presently, TNSTC buses see 4.5 lakh passengers, 1.5 lakh of them women, a day on an average in the district. The daily turnover now stands at Rs 61.09 lakh. After suspending operations in May because of the rising number of Covid-19 cases, the TNSTC had resumed town and mofussil bus services in the state on July 5. A TNSTC official said, “When we resumed operations, people were initially reluctant to use the public transportation for fear of contacting the virus. The passenger traffic was considerably low and the turnover was Rs 27 lakh to Rs 30 lakh. Now that the government has further relaxed the lockdown norms with the caseload plummeting, both the passenger traffic and revenues have increased. But, we are nowhere near the pre-lockdown figures.” TNSTC is now operating 764 buses - 254 mofussil buses, 463 town buses and 47 hill station buses - in the district. This is just 72% of the total buses that TNSTC used to operate in the district earlier. “When the lockdown was relaxed, we resumed operations with 511 buses.” Pointing out that around three lakh people were using town buses now, he said 1.5 lakh of them were women. “Following the state government’s move to provide free ride to women, transgender and disabled people in ordinary town buses, there has been a significant rise in the number of women passengers.” There are 300 ordinary town buses in the district. Confirming that the daily revenue flow has touched 60% of the pre-lockdown figure, which is close to Rs 1 crore, the official said they were earning Rs 33.60 lakh from mofussil buses, Rs 24.3 lakh from town buses and Rs 3.16 lakh from hill station buses a day presently. “We are hopeful that both the passenger traffic and revenue will increase further.” M Velankanni Raj, a bus driver and general secretary of district unit of CITU, said the passenger traffic was high during peak hours. “Within a short period, the passenger traffic has touched 60% to 70% of the normal times. When educational institutions and tourist spots reopen, the footfall will increase further.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tnstc-sees-rise-in-passengers-turnover-as-covid-19-cases-dip/articleshow/84597791.cms||Nivedha Selvam

The Youth Congress even approached governor Arif Mohammad Khan urging him to direct the chief minister to sack Saseendran from the government. Opposition leader V D Satheesan said the chief minister should immediately seek the resignation of the minister from his government. “The minister has committed a serious offence by lobbying for settling a woman harassment case. The woman and her father have come out with ample evidence to prove this. Hence the minister has no moral authority to continue in office,” said Satheesan. The woman herself has made it clear that the minister has intervened to settle the case after realizing that it was a woman harassment case. A minister has breached the oath of office by trying to settle a woman harassment case, he added. Meanwhile, Youth Congress approached the governor seeking the resignation of the minister. “It is an unprecedented and unheard of incident that a minister himself has tried to settle a woman harassment case. He has acted against the values of the Constitution which the country upholds and also has defied the oath of secrecy he has taken while assuming the post of a minister,” said Veena S Nair, general secretary of the Youth Congress in her letter to the governor. UDF convener M M Hassan also demanded the resignation of the minister in the wake of an audio clip coming out in which it has become clear that the minister has intervened in settling a woman harassment case. “The chief minister should immediately act against this,” said Hassan. BJP state president K Surendran also demanded Saseendran’s resignation and claimed that the minister breached the oath of secrecy. “A minister intervening in settling a woman harassment case is a serious matter and at no cost can he continue in office,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/oppn-wants-forest-mins-resignation/articleshow/84597818.cms||---

The Vizhinjam police have arrested a member of a gang that had allegedly snatched the gold chain worn by an eight-year-old boy. The police identified the accused as Sreedag, 28, of Chengal near Parassala, an autorickshaw driver. The police said that the alleged crime took place at Mulloor near Vizhinjam in January. The gang had allegedly snatched the gold chain weighing 1.5 sovereigns worn by the child who was standing on the courtyard of his house. As per the complaint filed by the boy’s mother, Preetha, the gang approached her pretending to be mattress sellers. When she told them she did not need any of their products they left. But, while exiting the house premises, they snatched the chain from the boy who was standing outside. Vizhinjam police station house officer Inspector Prajeesh Sasi said that Sreerag was traced and arrested following an elaborate investigation. “Though we recovered images of the rickshaw from surveillance cameras in the locality, they were not good enough to identify the registration number of the vehicle,” the Inspector said. However, they noticed that there were several stickers as well as some quotes painted on the vehicle. Thus, the police started looking for rickshaws with similar features. Finally, they found Sreerag’s rickshaw from near Balaramapuram on Monday. Following this, the cops also recovered the chain that the accused had pawned at a finance firm at Neyyatinkara, the Inspector said adding that a probe was on to nab the remaining two members of the gang. Sreerag was produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/stickers-and-quotes-on-auto-give-away-a-gang-wanted-for-chain-snatching/articleshow/84595290.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Property registration rates up, Telangana govt to rake in Rs 12,000 crore||HYDERABAD: Come Thursday, property buyers in Telangana will have to shell out more towards registration charges as the state government has enhanced the basic value of registration of agriculture land and non-agricultural properties like plots and flats between 30% and 50% on the existing rates. The government is hoping to earn about Rs 12,000 crore from the enhanced charges in the current financial year. The state has also jacked up registration charges and stamp duty to 7.5% from existing 6%, which will come into force from July 22. A GO on revised basic values and registration charges was issued on Tuesday. Following the revision, the basic land value in the upscale Jubilee Hills will go up to Rs 67,750 per square yard from the present Rs 52,000 for property registration. Similarly, the existing basic value of land in Madhapur will go up to Rs 28,000 per square yard from Rs 20,000 and to Rs 21,000 from Rs 15,000 in Gachibowli and Kondapur. In property hotspot areas like Banjara Hills, Jubilee Hills, Madhapur and Kondapur, the registration rates had been enhanced to 40% where the land values are already high. In the eastern part of Hyderabad such as Uppal, Peerzadiguda, Boduppal and other parts like Qutbullapur and Suraram, the registration rate has been increased to 50%. The government also fixed the lowest value for registration of agricultural land at Rs 75,000 per acre. For the purpose of easy revision of rates, properties have been divided into categories such as GHMC, HMDA, urban development authorities, municipal corporations, municipalities and villages and further divided into higher, mid and lower ranges. For agricultural land, the existing values have been enhanced by 50% in lower range, 40% in mid range and 30% in higher range. Similarly, for open plots, the basic values have been revised by 50% in lower range, 40% in mid range and 30% in higher range. The lowest value, which was Rs 100 per square yard, has been revised to Rs 200 per square yard. The existing lowest value for a flat in an apartment complex, which was Rs 800 per square ft, has now been revised to Rs 1,000 per square ft.

---||Coimbatore||‘Don’t demolish temples during encroachment removal’||Coimbatore: Heads of four mutts from across the state have called upon the state authorities not to treat temples on par with other encroachments and demolish them during the encroachment removal drives.Claiming that two temples which were demolished by the Coimbatore corporation along with other encroachments on the bunds of Muthanankulam recently were more than 100 years old, the mutt heads said such actions would erode the confidence people have in the government.In a joint press meet in Coimbatore on Tuesday, pontiff of Perur Adhinam Shantalinga Marudhachala Adigalar, pontiff of Siravai Adhinam Gowmara Mutt Kumaragurupara Swamigal, pontiff of Varahi Peetam, Manikanda Swamigal and Sri Shivalingeshwara Swamigal of Kamatchipuri Adhinam said the demolitions have hurt the religious sentiments of the masses. They said that the temples were rich in history and were being worshipped by generations of people.They said that temples in other parts of the state were also facing similar fate. A Goddess Mariamman temple which was three centuries old was demolished in Chennai near Basin Bridge railway station and a two-century old temple was brought down at Ilandhiyendal in Madurai.Shanthalinga adigalar said that it was Hindu tradition to offer prayers and worship deities along river banks and lake bunds. A structure built by an individual and a temple built and worshipped by a community should not be deemed as equal and demolished, he said.If at all a temple has to be removed the state authorities should consult religious heads and jointly explore ways to shift the temple without hurting the religious sentiments. “Agama rules should be followed while shifting and the religious heads would guide the authorities,’’ he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dont-demolish-temples-during-encroachment-removal/articleshow/84597831.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Joint action committee to contest in Huzurabad bypoll||HYDERABAD: The OC Samajika Sanghala Samakhya, a joint action committee (JAC) of various communities including Reddy, Velama, Brahmin, Vysya among others has decided to contest the by-poll to Huzurabad Assembly constituency. The objective of the JAC to enter the by-poll fray is to exert pressure on the TRS government to implement the 10 percent EWS quota for the upper caste. Though the state government had issued a G.O. in February itself for implementation of EWS quota in Telangana and the officials maintained that it was being implemented, JAC national president Poladi Rama Rao told TOI that it was not being implemented in toto. “We had to go to court to make the 10% EWS quota applicable in agriculture, veterinary universities and police recruitment process recently. A clear-cut direction should be given to all the departments and institutions in education and employment sectors to implement the 10% EWS quota for the poorer sections from communities other than SC, ST and BC,” he said. To begin with their programmes to exert pressure on the state government, the JAC-led by Rama Rao will take up hunger strike from July 31 in Karimnagar district. “If the government fails to respond to it, we will launch other agitational programmes before finally entering the electoral fray in Huzurnagar,” Rama Rao said. Rao is from Velama community and a resident of Huzurabad Assembly constituency. “We are not against any caste or community. WE support the reservations being extended to other communities from past several decades. All we are demanding is 100% implementation of EWS quota for OC communities in Telangana,” he said. The JAC is trying to meet the community elders and welfare association members of SCs, STs, BCs and minorities in Huzurabad constituency and seeking support for their candidate in the by-poll.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jac-to-contest-in-huzurabad-bypoll/articleshow/84599877.cms||Roushan Ali

At the same time, there will be no vaccination in the district on Wednesday for lack of Covishield doses. In June and July last year, over 300 inmates and staff had tested positive for novel coronavirus. Later, some inmates had contracted the disease in February and March. Chief medical officer of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) Dr Sanjay Chilkar told TOI, “1,788 inmates and frontline workers (FLW) were administered first dose in Central Jail in last 20 days. The team of NMC is holding special camp on daily basis in the jail. We have been given target of 2,100 persons. By now, 16 persons, including 15 FLWs and one inmate, have taken second dose.” As on July 16, 1,690 had taken first dose, including 55 FLWs, 1,255 in the age group of 18-44 years, 334 in age group of 45-60 years, and 46 were 60-plus. The civic body also continued organizing such special camps for different category of people. As per NMC’s data, 408 inmates of Regional Mental Hospital has also been vaccinated till date, of which some had no documents for address and age proof. Their inoculation was done after obtaining special permission from the state government. Also, 57 homeless people were vaccinated with special permission from the government. In last two days, 315 persons from third gender were vaccinated in a special camp. NMC will continue this for next few days. Special vaccination of pregnant and lactating women was started by establishing a special centre at NMC Pachpaoli Women’s Hospital. Special counters have been started at Daga Maternity Hospital, GMCH and IGGMCH too. The NMC has also started to collect details for vaccination of bedridden people. NMC is also planning to identify comorbid and 45-plus people who are yet to be vaccinated. They will be inoculated in a special drive. NMC continued vaccination in 154 centres on Tuesday but in a limited manner due to shortage of Covishield doses. On Tuesday, 17,028 people took the jab at NMC’s centres, with 1,001 people administered vaccine at 13 private centres. Thus, 18,029 people took the jab in the city on Tuesday. Vaccination was also hit in rural parts of the district for shortage of doses. Only 1,986 people could get the jab at centres of the Zilla Parishad (ZP). Thus, total 20,015 people were vaccinated in the district on Tuesday. Highest vaccination in a day was 63,485 in the district on July 7, when NMC and ZP had sufficient doses. The demand for vaccination increased manifold since resumption of vaccination of 18-44 years age group on June 23. Unfortunately, the district is not getting regular supply of doses. Due to lack of Covishield doses, there will be no vaccination in the district on Wednesday. Vaccination could not happen on 16 of last 28 days due to lack of doses. Wednesday will be the 17th day without vaccination in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-inoculates-85-inmates-staffers-of-central-jail-no-vax-in-dist-today/articleshow/84597828.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Delhi||Delhi riots: Court acquits man, says probe is ‘way short of desired one’||NEW DELHI: In the first order in a case related to the northeast Delhi riots in February last year — out of the cases linked to 755 FIRs — a city court on Tuesday acquitted the sole accused of all charges, observing that the investigation was “way short of the desired one”. While acquitting Suresh, the court, however, noted that the testimony of the witnesses had proved that the formation of an unlawful assembly of 15-20 people, rioting and ransacking of the shop of the complainant had indeed taken place. But Suresh was the only person arrested in the matter. Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat said the testimony of the witnesses in the case were contradictory and there were “glaring inconsistencies”. “In the light of the testimonies of the witnesses of the prosecution and their careful scrutiny, it is well apparent that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove its case, forget about beyond reasonable doubts. All the major witnesses are at variance with each other on material terms, impacting the prosecution version…There is no testimony worth its salt which connects the accused to the present offence in question,” the judge said in his order. A 27-year-old labourer, Suresh, who was arrested in the case on April 7 last year, was acquitted of all the offences punishable under sections 143 (punishment for unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 427 (mischief), 454 (house-breaking) read with 149 (unlawful assembly) and 395 (punishment for dacoity) of IPC. North-east Delhi had witnessed largescale communal violence from February 24-26 last year when clashes broke out between pro-CAA and anti-CAA protestors, in which 53 people lost their lives and several hundreds were injured. Suresh had got bail in the case on February 25 but was still languishing at the Mandoli jail as he was unable to furnish the amount of his bail bond, said his counsel, Rajeev Pratap Singh Tomar. The case was registered on the complaint of one Asif, a tenant at the shop, which was vandalised and looted during the riots. Asif had claimed in his complaint that he had closed the shop on February 25, 2020, when he heard a commotion outside his house and saw 15- 20 people armed with ‘danda’ and ‘sariya’. Asif had alleged that the mob was inciting others to damage and loot the shop because it was owned by a Muslim, and when he tried to intervene, he was threatened with dire consequences. The court, in its order, noted that Asif was not an eyewitness to the incident of rioting and another witness, Bhagat Singh, on whom the prosecution relied upon the most, had denied having ever identified Suresh either on February 25, 2020, or when the police officers came to him with one apprehended individual. “He (Singh) specifically deposed that PW6 & PW7 (police officials) told him that the accused was involved in the rioting…In fact, as per PW2 (Singh), he informed the police and PW6 head constable Sunil Kumar had reached the spot even before he had reached the shop. The testimony of PW2 is, by itself, fatal to the prosecution case,” said the order. The court also said the deposition of the prosecution witness, head constable Sunil Kumar, that he had identified Suresh at the time of the rioting was “untenable”. If he had identified the accused at the time of rioting, then why did he not record any entry about it till the FIR was filed on February 28, 2020, the court asked. “As can be made out on the cumulative reading of the entire testimonies of all the witnesses, the identification of the accused is not established at all. The investigation carried out is way short of the desired one,” it said. The police had recorded the statements of seven witnesses in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-acquits-man-in-riotcase-slams-prosecution/articleshow/84599911.cms||Usha Das

The DRI team intercepted four passengers at the airport on Monday who arrived from Sharjah. As much as 3.29kg of gold worth Rs 1.6 crore was seized from them and based on inquiry with them three people who were waiting outside the airport to collect the gold too were picked up. Customs department sub-inspector Dharmendra was picked up for inquiry by the Trichy regional unit of the directorate of revenue intelligence from the airport over his alleged involvement in aiding gold smuggling. According to a senior DRI staff, the needle of suspicion turned towards Dharmendra as his mobile phone contained the photographs of the four passengers coming from Sharjah with the smuggled gold. The officials suspect that Dharmendra could have helped many passengers to pass through the airport with smuggled gold. All the eight people were booked for smuggling gold and lodged in Trichy central prison.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/airport-customs-cop-held-for-aiding-gold-smuggling/articleshow/84597838.cms||---

---||Ludhiana||132 century-old buildings declared unsafe in Ludhiana||Ludhiana: With the onset of monsoon season, the Ludhiana municipal corporation has come out with the list of 132 unsafe buildings, a majority of which are more than 100 years old, in the city. Concerned about the safety of people living in those buildings, the MC has served notices to the owners to vacate the same. The corporation has also requested the police department to vacate the unsafe houses if people don’t abide by the notice. The civic body has also appealed to the public to inform it in case they notice any unsafe building around. The maximum unsafe buildings are in Zone A that covers old part of the city. There are 64 buildings in Zone A, 21 in Zone B, 14 in Zone C and 33 in Zone D. The owners of these buildings were told to vacate the buildings so as to avoid any untoward incident, but people are yet to do the same. The officials claimed that the rainy season has set in and heavy rainfall is expected which can trigger collapse of these buildings. Importantly, the civic body is also sleeping about condition of some of its own buildings which are in a pathetic condition and either should be demolished or repaired urgently. Municipal town planner S S Bindra said, “We had issued notices to the owners of such buildings whose structures are very old and are unsafe, but these houses haven’t been vacated yet. We have also asked the police in this matter for legal action.” He said they have also received a complaint about unsafe building in Kesar Ganj mandi area for which officials concerned have been told to act. MC Commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “In some other cities, building collapse incidents during rainy season have come to my notice. So, I have asked officials to take care of the matter on time.” Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal could not be contacted for comments. The process: Identification, notice, vacation, demolition The bridges and road wing of MC conducts a survey about unsafe buildings in city and further building branch of MC serves the notices to the owners of these unsafe buildings to vacate the same. However the civic officials claimed that they do not take the responsibility to demolish the building as it results in litigation. The responsibility lies with the owner to get the building demolished. Alongside, MC sends a letter to the police department for vacating the buildings. MC’s appeal to public If people notice any unsafe building, they can contact executive engineer (bridges and road department) of zones concerned, assistant town planners concerned, joint commissioner of branch concerned and municipal town planner for the protection of general public. Dangerous buildings Most of the dangeorus buildings are located in old part of city, including Chaura Bazaar, Chauri Sadak, Jawahar Nagar camp, Daresi, Gill Road, Field Ganj, Narriyan Mohalla, Jawaddi, Model town Extension, Islam Ganj, Ajit Nagar, Moti Nagar, Amarpura, Tajpur Road Yearly practice In every rainy season, notices are issued to owners of unsafe buildings, but little action is taken afterwards. Last year, there were about 100 such unsafe buildings, whose numbers have gone this time. The officials blame the public for not vacating the buildings despite notices and in some of the buildings there is dispute among the owner and tenants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/132-century-old-buildings-declared-unsafe-in-ludhiana/articleshow/84580292.cms||---

During our conversation, he said that it was a complaint by his daughter and he explained the nature of her complaint. I didn’t know that it was a woman’s complaint,” Saseendran told the media on Tuesday. He added that when he realized the seriousness of the case, he did not compel him or ask him to withdraw the complaint or settle the matter. When asked why he was repeatedly heard telling in the audio tape of the conservation to settle the matter even after the woman’s father told that it was a harassment complaint, the minister said that he had only asked to resolve the matter in the right manner. “When he told me about the matter, I ended my conversation by asking him to resolve the matter in the right manner and without any difficulties. I said that as part of winding up the conversation,” he said. “It was a matter involving two of my party leaders and the conversation I made was not in my capacity as a minister but as a party functionary,” he added. Saseendran called chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan over phone in the evening and explained his version of the circumstances in which he had made the telephone call to the father of the complainant. The minister has left for Thiruvananthapuram.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/didnt-know-it-was-a-womans-harassment-complaint/articleshow/84597894.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Sero survey finds 42% of people having Covid antibodies in dist||Coimbatore: Seropositivity rate has doubled from 20.5% to 42.8% after the second wave of Covid-19 in the district.The sero survey conducted in July second week found Igg (Immunoglobulin) antibodies against Covid-19 in 540 people among the 1,260 samples, pointing to a positivity rate of 40%.This is a massive jump from the sero survey conducted in February which saw only 22% of the people having antibodies.The director of public health had ordered all the districts to take up sero survey to check the spread of the virus during the second wave and identify pockets prone to a third wave, thus requiring more medical attention.In Coimbatore, 1,260 blood samples from 42 clusters (30 samples per cluster) were collected in the third round of sero survey.People above the age of 18 from areas that reported Covid-19 clusters during the second wave were tested randomly.“One reason behind the increase in positivity rate is that the second wave infected thrice as many people as the first wave and the random sampling method chose areas that reported relatively large virus clusters,” an official said.“The other reason for the jump in positivity rate is the ongoing vaccination drive in the district that began as early as February,” he said.The district has already conducted two sero survey this year. While April’s sero survey found a positivity rate of just 20.47%, the sero survey in October last year had found a positivity rate of 22.15%.Epidemiologist and member of the expert committee advising the government on Covid-19 Dr K Kolandasamy said the 40% finding is encouraging because it shows the extent of people in previous Covid-19 clusters with resistance to the virus.“We can assume that their bodies know how to recognize and fight the virus in moderation. It also shows us how far we are on the path of herd immunity, for which more than 60% of the people need to be immune to the virus and not be able to transmit it,” he said.“We further need to study cluster-wise data to see if any clusters have extremely high positivity rates and if any have very low positivity rates, because those clusters with low positivity rates may be more vulnerable for a third wave,” he added.The samples to assess the extent of Igg antibodies were run through the CLIA (Chemiluminescent immunoassay) device in the district health department office at Race Course.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/sero-survey-finds-42-of-people-having-covid-antibodies-in-dist/articleshow/84597858.cms||---
---||Delhi||BSES pact to double Delhi’s green power||NEW DELHI: The share of “green power” in powering a large section of Delhi is going to more than double by the end of next year. The BSES discoms, which supplies electricity to a large part of the city, has inked power sale agreements with Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) to procure 510MW solar and bundled hybrid power. Of this, 300 MW is solar power and 210MW hybrid, a BSES spokesperson said. According to officials, this deal will ensure green and clean power at economical rates for BSES’ consumers. “Inked for 25 years, the solar and hybrid power is expected to be available to the BSES discoms 18 months after signing of the agreement at a competitive tariff of Rs 2.44 per unit for solar and Rs 2.48 per unit for hybrid, determined through an e-auction,” an official said, adding that this includes SECI’s trading margin. He said BSES had become the first discom in Delhi and among only a handful in the country to procure hybrid power. “Hybrid power is a bundled mix of solar and wind power, wherein one component is at least 33% of the contracted capacity. Moreover, in hybrid power, both sources of power are at the same location and the pooled power is injected into the electricity system at the same point,” he said. One of the biggest advantages of hybrid power is optimum cost utilisation of the power evacuation network and loading of the transmission lines as solar power is primarily a day phenomenon and wind, round the clock, he said. “We have been procuring renewable energy from all available sources at economical rates, ensuring minimal burden on the consumers. These agreements are yet another proof of our efforts in this direction,” he said. He said this was one of the lowest tariffs for renewable power and priced substantially lower than the average cost of power purchase agreements, which is around Rs 5.50 per unit. “This agreement will also help BSES discoms fulfil their renewable purchase obligations,” he said. “While solar power will help the discom meet the day peak, the wind power sourced from the coastal areas is expected to support the night peak demand,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bses-pact-to-double-citys-green-power/articleshow/84599955.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Mumbai||Congress is confused, RSS has a strong network: Saamna||MUMBAI: Shiv Sena’s mouthpiece Saamna on Tuesday stated while RSS did not participate in the freedom struggle, Congress contributed immensely to it and boasted several courageous leaders and party workers. It then went on to criticise Congress, its alliance partner in the state, saying now it is a confused party, unable to decide on its future course of action and lacks a sense of direction. “Now, the Congress does not have the courageous cadre it had during the pre-Independence era. Rahul Gandhi says the party does not have a place for cowards, which is correct. But if all cowards leave the party, it needs to be seen if the party owns a factory which can generate courageous workers,” the Saamna editorial stated. It stated earlier Congress had leaders who displayed strong patriotic values. “But now the Congress is struggling for its existence. How would the Congress or the so-called secular parties be strong by targeting the Sangh Parivar?” While applauding the RSS, Sena said the Sangh has a strong network across the country, which is the BJP’s strength. “Although there could be differences of opinion on ideology, the work they (RSS) are doing in many sectors is important. And one cannot ignore those dedicated swayamsevak and pracharak. Even Congress had such devoted workers earlier, but in some states there are none now. Shiv Sena has such devoted people.”  Meanwhile, state Congress president Nana Patole on Tuesday said he had not read Saamna so would not be able to comment on the editorial. “Everyone has a right to criticise in a democracy, but it is our right to whether react to it or not. We would have to think if our alliance partner repeatedly criticises us on the same issues.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cong-is-confused-rss-has-a-strong-network-saamna-in-mumbai/articleshow/84602262.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||India||Legislature won’t act against criminalisation of politics: SC||NEW DELHI: Alarming rise in candidates with criminal antecedents despite its repeated orders to restrict them from contesting polls prompted the Supreme Court on Tuesday to frown at the lack of attempt by the legislature to stop criminalisation of politics but it realised that ingenuity of ‘realpolitik’ may impede judicial interventions in this regard. “The legislative branch is not going to take any step in this regard, neither in the foreseeable future nor in the distant future, that much is certain,” said a bench of justices RF Nariman and BR Gavai. It was dealing with 10 political parties which, during the Bihar assembly polls, allegedly breached the SC’s 2020 order that mandated all parties to upload in their websites criminal antecedents of candidates, reasons for their selection and why clean candidates could not be selected. The SC had said the explanation should not be “mere winnability”. The February 13, 2020 order was in supplementation of the SC’s September 25, 2018 judgment in Public Interest Foundation case mandating all parties to submit to EC details of criminal antecedents of each candidate put in the fray by them. Advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for EC, said in the Bihar assembly polls last year, RJD led parties by putting up 104 candidates with criminal antecedents. Other parties’ candidates with criminal antecedents were: BJP 77, LJP 67, JDU 56, RLSP 57, INC 45, BSP 29, NCP 26, CPI 5, and CPM 4. He said while all others have complied with the direction to submit details, most haven’t complied with putting the information in the website or publishing an ad in a daily. He said CPI, CPM and NCP haven’t bothered to inform the EC. When the court was debating if non-compliance of SC and EC directions should lead to freezing of election symbols of parties, advocates Kapil Sibal and Dinesh Dwivedi, for NCP and BSP respectively, and Harish Salve, for EC, said winnability is the prime consideration in electoral politics and direction to choose candidates without criminal antecedents would be tough as in many instances cases are foisted against leaders. Sibal said most parties at national level don’t know what is happening at the panchayat, district or even at the state level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/legislature-wont-act-against-criminalisation-of-politics-sc/articleshow/84602988.cms||---

While many people have successfully raised funds for the treatment of their loved ones through crowdfunding, police and activists have come across several cases, where scamsters have made a killing on social media. “From what we know, two fake fundraisers were created for my son’s treatment and not even a single rupee reached us,” said M Harish Raj, whose nine-month-old son Charan has undergone surgery for a rare ailment in July. Harish, who has been unemployed for the last one year, said that his son was in immediate need of surgery and required a significant amount to meet medical expenses. He shared his son’s medical documents with friends and relatives and sought their help. “I don’t know how they ended up on social media. Unknown people collected money for my son’s surgery, but did not help us,” he added. While some are said to be starting fundraisers by using bills of random patients, others are asking for financial help by falsely claiming that their loved ones are sick. Covid warriors have come across several fake fundraisersKVM Prasad, ACP, cybercrime, Hyderabad and S Harinath, his counterpart in Rachakonda urged people to immediately contact the cybercrime police, if they face any such issue. “Online cheating has always been rampant. The same was the case during the pandemic as well as many lost their hard-earned money by trusting and transferring money to unknown people for medicines and injections. People have to be careful,” said Harinath. Covid warriors, who are help people in finding medicines, raise funds, get hospital beds, among others, said that they came across several fake fundraisers and got them removed from the crowdfunding platforms in the last one month. Another woman, who started a fundraiser for her husband’s mucormycosis treatment, also had a terrible experience. “I am not sure if funds are directed to someone else’s account, but after a point in time we did not get any funds,” she said. In most of these cases, the phone number and account details mentioned along with the request do not belong to the family members of the patient. “Recently, I saw a request on Twitter asking money for a rare surgery. I recognized the child’s photograph. His surgery was already done and the application seeking funds from the chief minister’s relief fund was also accepted. When I called the number mentioned, he said that he is raising funds for his nephew’s surgery. When I confronted, he promised to send the money to the parents of the boy, but failed to do so,” said Sheik Rafeeq, a Covid warrior. Sai Charan K, another activist who coordinates with crowdfunding groups said that he got about seven requests blocked from crowdfunding platforms in the last 20 to 30 days. Activists said that not just for surgery or treatment, people are also trying to get easy money by asking for groceries, diapers, baby food, among other things. “Instead of seeking help from one, few are approaching six to seven people and taking help from everyone. To counter this, all of us started communicating among ourselves and only one of us is helping only if the request is found to be genuine,” said Srinivas Bellam of Feed the Needy NGO. “It’s sort of an emotional blackmail as scamsters plead they need funds for infants or children,” Bellam added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fraudsters-make-a-killing-on-crowdfunding-platforms/articleshow/84601747.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

One speaker and one deputy speaker will be chosen each day. In the first two days, there will be discussion over the APMC Act. Later, the other bills will also be discussed every two days,” the leaders said.  Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Mahasangh national president Shiv Kumar Kakka said that farmers, wearing identification badges, would go to Jantar Mantar from the Singhu border to hold the protest.  The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of over 40 farmer unions spearheading the stir against the central farm laws, had planned that around 200 farmers would protest outside Parliament every day during the monsoon session, which started on Monday and is scheduled to conclude on August 13. “When police asked us to reduce the number of protesters, we told them to focus on the law-and-order situation and gave assurance that the protest will be peaceful,” Kakka said, adding that no written communication had been received from police yet. “We will sit at Jantar Mantar from 10am to 5pm. Nobody will go to Parliament and neither will we allow any political person to come to the protest,” he said.  A tractor parade in Delhi on January 26, that was to highlight the demands of farmer unions to repeal three new agri laws, had dissolved into anarchy on the streets as thousands of protesters broke through barriers, fought with police, overturned vehicles and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of Red Fort.  On Sunday, Delhi Police asked farmer unions to reduce the number of protesters, which was declined by the leaders. A day later, SKM accused Delhi Police of spreading misinformation by describing their protest as 'Sansad gherao'. SKM has already stated that there were no plans of laying siege to Parliament, and the protest would be peaceful and disciplined, it said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/farmers-to-hold-kisan-parliament-from-tomorrow/articleshow/84600017.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Airport Express Line likely to reach deeper into Dwarka by March 2022||NEW DELHI: Despite the Covid-19 pandemic slowing down the high-speed Airport Express Line’s extension deeper into the Dwarka sub-city, the project is expected to become operational by March next year. A large part of the tunnelling work of the 1.7 km long stretch of the corridor and civil work of an underground station are almost complete. The 1.7 km long underground section will extend the standalone corridor of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) between New Delhi Metro Station and Dwarka Sector-21 to Dwarka Sector-25, to link it to the upcoming India International Convention and Exhibition Centre (IICC). The civil work of the underground station, which is coming up inside the IICC complex, is almost complete. DMRC plans to provide connectivity from the underground station to the Convention Centre through subways, which have been constructed already. Construction work of the Rs 310 crore project had started in 2018 and was expected to be completed by 2021 but Covid-19 put a spanner in DMRC’s work. The corporation has, however, been working on a war footing to complete the project by March 2022. Officials said that the tunnelling work was mostly complete, and the station’s civil work had been completed too. DMRC is now working on laying standard gauge tracks and finishing other necessary installations at the station. “This will be an important extension of the Airport Line as IICC is expected to attract visitors from across the world,” an official said. DMRC is also procuring 24 special coaches, which will be turned into four six-coach trains and operated on the Airport Line. The extra trains will help DMRC maintain adequate frequency on the high-speed corridor, when it is extended to IICC in Dwarka Sector-25. The coaches, which DMRC is procuring, are different from the usual coaches used in the Delhi Metro network. The trains will be standard gauge with a top speed of 132 kmph. As DMRC would be deploying additional trains on the Airport Line with the commissioning of this extension, the corporation is going to construct three additional stabling lines at the Dwarka depot. Apart from special coaches, DMRC also plans to engage a firm for providing the train control and signalling system of the stretch. At present, Airport Express Line connects New Delhi station to Dwarka Sector-21 station with four stations in between — Shivaji Stadium, Dhaula Kuan, Delhi Aerocity and IGI Airport (Terminal 3). IICC of Dwarka will be the first-of-its-kind facility in west Delhi. The centre will be on the lines of Pragati Maidan and India Habitat Centre. The state-of-the-art centre will be able to host seminars, conventions and large-scale exhibitions. DMRC was requested to extend the Airport Line to the exhibition-cum-convention centre to provide high-speed connectivity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/airport-express-line-likely-to-reach-deeper-into-dwarka-by-march-2022/articleshow/84598041.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Another accused in the case is on the run. The Pollachi all-woman police said the girl, a Class X student, was alone at her house most of the time, as her parents used to go for daily wage work. “She was in love with a 16-year-old neighbour boy, a Class XI student, and they had physical relationship. He boasted about his sexual encounters with the girl among his friends, who started to threaten and rape her for two months,” an investigation officer said. The officer said while one of the accused was the girl’s uncle, the remaining were her neighbours. “They raped her separately on different occasions in January and February. The girl was taken to Pollachi government hospital on Monday evening with severe abdominal pain. Doctors found the minor was five months pregnant and alerted us.” Preliminary inquiry revealed that the girl was raped by her lover, another 17-year-old boy, who is a wall painter, 19-year-old S Nagaraj, 20-year-old T Praveen, 19-year-old V Muthumurugan, who were daily wagers, and the girl’s uncle M Maharajothi, 31, a welder. “They raped the girl from three different places,” the officer said. Based on the girl’s complaint, police registered a case against the six under Sections 5(g) (gang penetrative sexual assault), (j)(ii), (l)(n) read with 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and Section 506 (i) of the Indian Penal Code and arrested five of them on Tuesday. “Praveen is still at large. We have launched a manhunt for him,” the officer said. The arrested five were, meanwhile, produced before the special court for Pocso cases and lodged in jail under judicial custody at night.

He made this announcement while speaking at a function organised at Curtorim to felicitate Covid warriors. Rane also said that a grant of Rs 270 crore has been sanctioned by the central government for setting up a cancer treatment facility in the state. Responding to an appeal made by Curtortim MLA Alexio Reginald Laurenco for upgradation of the Curtorim primary health centre, Rane said that the file pertaining to the proposal has gone to the finance department for appointment of a consultant and that the matter would be “fast-tracked”. He also stressed on the need for expansion of other PHCs where land is available for the purpose so that more facilities could be introduced and newer diagnostic equipment installed. Lauding the nurses, para-medical and multi-tasking staff for the commendable job they did in taking care of the patients during the pandemic, Rane further said that it would be government’s endeavour to regularise the services of the contractual employees. “We will never use the policy of use and throw. Such a policy should be discarded. The state government will take care of its Covid warriors. In the next 3-4 months, we will sort out the issue,” he said. Earlier, Laurenco brought to the attention of the health minister the “dilapidated” condition of the Curtorim primary health centre and the need for its upgradation. He stressed on the need for setting up a trauma unit, a mini operation theatre and full-fledged casualty department for the larger benefit of patients coming from other neighbouring talukas as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gastro-care-facility-in-super-specialty-block-soon-rane/articleshow/84597990.cms||---

The official indicated that the project had been delayed by eight months because of the pandemic-induced restrictions. An airport official said, 55% of the work have so far been completed. “The project has been partially affected because of the current restrictions, as only workers living at the site were allowed to work,” a senior airport official told TOI. As per an official of Egis India, the company facilitating the design and construction of the new building, had said work was stopped for around 40 days during the first lockdown last year. “The second wave of the pandemic and the ensuing restrictions further affected the work. Some workers have left for their homes. However, the work did not stop. The unpredictability of the pandemic is such that it is difficult to commit anything,” another airport official said. The new building, which is expected to increase the daily flight movements, including international flights, is coming up on the eastern side of the existing terminal building. “We are planning to complete construction of all important aspects of the building, which include the integration with the existing building so that flights can start seamlessly,” the airport official said. Construction of the building started in December 2018 and a multi-level car parking facility (ground, three-storey and two basement floors) was being simultaneously constructed at ‘parking number-1’ of the airport. An official in-charge of the parking facility’s construction said getting the workers back had become a problem and air tickets were sent to them to return to Pune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-airport-terminal-building-likely-to-become-operational-by-i-day-2022/articleshow/84598007.cms||Joy Sengupta

As a result, people who wish to get jabbed are waiting for the vaccines. On July 17, the health department vaccinated just 1,908 persons as it didn’t have adequate stock of vaccine. The health officials said last stock of around 21,000 vaccines (Covishield) was received from the state health department on July 15 evening and same was used by the next day.

He said they at least need to vaccinate about 60 to 70% of the eligible population to ensure there is a herd immunity. “Given the vaccine supply or lack of proper stock, it seems difficult to get achieve that target. We hoped to carry out vaccination of around 24 lakh eligible population (of people more than 18 years age), but it is not possible if vaccine is in short supply. The agency concerned should ensure that we get proper supply of vaccine to vaccinate more people,” said the officer. The data of health department revealed that till July 17 evening, 13,86,685 vaccinations had been done in Ludhiana district of which 11,24,142 persons had received the first dose only.

However, I have come to know that there is no vaccine supply. Even my wife wants to get vaccinated,” said 47-year-old Gurpreet Singh of Chandigarh road, who works as an accountant in a firm. Youth also waiting to get jabbed “After I heard that vaccine is beneficial under the present circumstances, I decided to get myself immunized.

---||Coimbatore||Use CSR funds to vaccinate public free of cost, Tamil Nadu health minister tells private hospitals||COIMBATORE: Health minister Ma Subramaniam conducted a meeting with representatives of private hospitals in Coimbatore, Tirupur and Erode districts at the Kovai Medical Center and Hospital (KMCH) here on Tuesday to discuss the feasibility of using corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds to procure vaccines to inoculate the public free of cost. The minister said they had collected Rs 61 lakh from CSR funds of private hospitals so far and 7,878 people could be vaccinated free of cost with the same. The meeting was attended by the representatives of 117 hospitals. The minister said the state government was encouraging all private companies to contribute their CSR funds to procure vaccines. The funds would be routed to private hospitals, which would use them to procure vaccines and inoculate the public free of cost. “The Union government has allotted 75% of a state’s quota to the government and 25% to private hospitals, which are not fully utilizing the quota, as cost is involved in it. So, they are now encouraged to tie up with corporate firms to vaccinate the public for free,” Subramaniam said while speaking to the media at Walayar check post. The representatives of the hospitals said six to seven private hospitals would launch the scheme initially. “The directorate of public health should provide the hospitals with facilities to store and transport the vaccines for rural camps,” a source said. Pointing out that many corporate firms were donating oxygen concentrators, generators, and cylinders to the hospitals, he said the state had adequate number of them presently. “We want private hospitals to procure vaccines with the CSR funds and conduct camps in rural areas.” The source said they had received 180 petitions from people stating their villages weren’t allotted enough vaccines. Earlier in the day, the minister inaugurated a vaccination camp for disabled people at Chinniyampalayam. He said Coimbatore was allotted the highest number of vaccines after Chennai. The district has vaccinated 10.97 lakh people so far. “The state has received 1.8 crore doses of vaccine so far and we need another 10 crore doses. We could achieve the target soon if private hospitals use their full quota.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/use-csr-funds-to-vaccinate-public-free-of-cost-health-min-tells-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/84597998.cms||---

Ladeeda, who was active during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests, said that though the app was removed after Delhi Police filed an FIR earlier this month, the online attacks against her and other women were continuing as the screenshots of the app containing their photographs were still being posted online in platforms like Twitter. Sulli is a derogatory term used to refer to Muslim women. The complaint said that the creators of ‘Sulli Deals’ were still continuing their online harassment of around 100 women Twitter users who are active in various spheres. The Twitter accounts connected with ‘Sulli Deals’ are active and engaged in promoting the website and targeting selected IDs, it said. The complaint cites a message posted by a Twitter user on July 4 stating that ‘I am the guy who created ‘Sulli Deals’ app. I used paid VPN and protonmail. You guys won’t be able to track me so stop crying in front of GitHub. It will go up soon, just wait and watch’. The hosting platform GitHub had removed the app after the illegal activity was revealed. She said in the complaint that the act of the accused was dangerous and against the Constitutional principles. “By selectively targeting and attacking Muslim women, the accused also tried to foment communal divide,” the complaint said. Kannur police authorities said that the complaint has been forwarded to Cyber Police wing for further action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/jamia-student-files-plaint-over-online-harassment/articleshow/84598043.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Only VIP area roads good, rest have potholes: Telangana HC||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Tuesday pulled up the GHMC for maintaining roads near VIP areas only while leaving the rest of the city to grapple with potholes on bad roads. “Property tax and other taxes are being paid by all citizens, but unfortunately the GHMC is concentrating more on VIP areas such as MLA and MP colonies and Prashasan Nagar where IAS and IPS officers reside. All other areas have been ignored, leaving people to struggle with horrible potholes on Hyderabad’s roads,” said a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy while resuming hearing in a PIL highlighting bad city roads. A tree branch and an iron frame informs motorists of a manhole under PVNR flyoverThe bench, which took up a report published by ‘The Economic Times’ on an old couple spending their pension money to fill potholes to prevent road accidents, asked the GHMC to explain the steps it was taking to make roads safe. It said that the municipal body was undermining the image of Hyderabad as an emerging global city by neglecting maintenance of roads.With the bench making its displeasure public, GHMC on Tuesday roped in senior counsel S Niranjan Reddy who said that they have now come out with a new system known as comprehensive road management project (CRMP) where contractors were made accountable. “Under the new policy, laying of roads and maintenance was the contractor’s job and he was responsible for potholes,” the senior counsel said. “We have also started using polymer modified bitumen which is water resistant and can withstand heavy water logging,” he added. The bench, however, said that using polymer bitumen was nothing new. “May be it is brought to city now,” the bench said. On why the GHMC could not fix roads much before the monsoon, he admitted that they could not do enough but attributed the failure to lack of sufficient finances. The bench reminded the GHMC counsel that the municipal body could act in advance as the water-logging areas were mostly the same spots during every rainy season. When senior counsel L Ravi Chander, appearing for another PIL petitioner, brought to the notice of the bench that the Centre has selected Hyderabad for developing roads and other infrastructure, the GHMC counsel said that they were facing funds problems even after factoring in all such financial support. “We are generating funds on our own, but maybe we have to now seek state help. We filled as many as 28,000 potholes in the last five years,” he said when the bench enquired if GHMC had sought financial help from the state. Niranjan Reddy also said that GHMC has been doing a good job despite the constraints and today Hyderabad was next only to Delhi in providing civic amenities. “Delhi being the national capital will never suffer funds crunch. We also made use of empty roads during lockdown to repair several roads,” the senior counsel said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/only-vip-area-roads-good-rest-have-potholes-hc/articleshow/84601792.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The woman, in her 30s, was physically challenged and seven months pregnant. The unidentified body had posed a tricky challenge for the Gondia police. The cops, under SP Vishwa Pansare, had to toil for almost a month to crack the case with the help of technical evidence. Shaikh, who had roped in his relative Asif Pathan and his friend Praful Shivankar for the murder, wanted to get rid of his partner as she was proving to be a hurdle for his marriage with a family-preferred alliance. Shaikh started for Gondia with his live-in partner on his bike and was followed by Pathan and Shivankar, who were on another two-wheeler. After reaching a desolate place near Dashgarh forest, Pathan is learnt to have first assaulted his partner on the neck. Later, he rained blows all over her body. Earlier, Shaikh took her cellphone and switched it off. The assailants then dragged the body inside the forest and hid it in a bush on June 22, leaving the cops clueless the following day. SP Pansare of Gondia police formed four teams before sending them to Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and the adjoining districts like Gadchiroli and Bhandara to collect information about the missing physically challenged woman. It was during the investigation that the cops managed to lay their hands on a SIM card whose number was traced to Buti Bori. Gondia cops led by SDPO Jalindhar Nalkul and senior inspector Baban Awadh, cyber cell incharge Vaishali Patil and senior inspector of Chhichgadh Atul Tawade traced the victim’s family and later zeroed in on the assailants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/man-kills-his-pregnant-partner-dumps-body-in-gondia-forest/articleshow/84597994.cms||Soumitra Bose

The spas can be allowed to start subject to conditions, such as permitting only vaccinated employees and clients and curtailing the number of people at a time, the court stated. “If they don’t take a decision, we will see. I have given an indication,” Justice Rekha Palli observed, while hearing a bunch of petitions to reopen spas, which have been shut since April on account of the second wave of Covid-19. Delhi government’s counsel Naushad Ahmed Khan informed the court that the issue was under active consideration, and the relevant file had been sent to the lieutenant governor, who is the chairperson ofDelhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA). Taking note of the submission, the court said, “It is expected that the respondent will take a final decision within 2-3 days and take into consideration the fact that conditions, such as permitting only vaccinated employees and clients and curtailing the number of people who can use the spa at a time will be considered.” Delhi Wellness Spa Association, one of the petitioners, had urged the court to intervene, saying it was an association of 300 plus owners and the livelihood of 30,000 people was at stake. But the government said the issue was before DDMA, which was expected to take a call soon. It also pointed out that schools, colleges, courts had not opened and in any case “there is no social distancing in spas.” The petition stated that, while all similar activities such as gym and salon, had been permitted to be opened, Delhi government was yet to permit spas to resume operation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/expect-govt-to-decide-on-reopening-spas-in-2-3-days-hc/articleshow/84600081.cms||---

The Class XII student had met the accused, who posed as an event manager, on social media. West Bengal police came to Mumbai on Tuesday to pick up the trafficker and take the girl back home to her parents. The teenager lives with her family in Palashipara, 150 km from Kolkata. The accused, Subhan Shaikh, 43, is a Mira Road resident. Police said he befriended the victim on Facebook by posing as a youngster and putting up his son’s image as his display picture. After the two started to converse regularly, he lured her with the promise of meeting the superstar. Shaikh knew the girl would not join him once she found out he was not the youngster she had been chatting with. So just a few days before they met, Shaikh sent the girl a message saying he was down with Covid and his father would be accompanying her to Mumbai. Hence, when an older person landed up in Palashipara on July 15, the girl did not sense anything amiss. “He picked her up from her coaching class, destroyed her Sim card to prevent her location from being tracked and brought her to Kolkata, where they boarded the Howrah Mail to Mumbai,” said senior inspector Dnyaneshwar Katkar, Dadar GRP. Meanwhile, after the girl’s parents approached the police, an alert was sent to all railway stations. The CCTV footage at Howrah Junction had captured the girl and the images were immediately sent to the Mumbai GRP as the train terminates at CSMT. “The girl was wearing a mask so we couldn’t see her face. Based on her description, our team intercepted her and Shaikh on Sunday. When she took off the mask, we were able to verify her identity,” said inspector Avinash Powar, Dadar GRP. The girl was sent to a shelter for children. “We suspect the girl was trafficked to Mumbai by Shaikh. He wouldn’t tell us what he intended to do. We visited his home and found he comes from a decent background,” said Katkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bengal-girl-trafficked-to-city-with-promise-of-meeting-srk-rescued/articleshow/84602284.cms||---

A forest officer, who didn’t want to be named, said David Solomon, of Kovaipudur, had cut 17 teak trees that he had grown on his land without obtaining permission from the forest department. “When environmental activist K Syed came to know that the wood was being transported to Trichy Road from Kovaipudur in a truck, he alerted us.” The officer said Solomon did not know that he should get permission from the forest department to axe the teak trees on his land and transport them. “We have registered a case against him and truck driver Karuppusamy under Section 35 of timber transport rule of the Tamil Nadu Forest Act, 1882,” he said. He said teak was a scheduled timber and people growing them should get permission to axe and transport them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/2-booked-for-felling-teak-trees-illegally/articleshow/84598020.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Tadoba tiger death in Chandrapur: Postmortem inconclusive||CHANDRAPUR: Mystery continues to shroud the death of the male sub-adult tiger that was found dead in Tamsi forest in the core area of Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) on Monday. The team of veterinary doctors that carried out the postmortem on Tuesday failed to derive any conclusion about the cause of its death following highly decomposed condition of carcass. Senior vets Dr PD Kadukar, Dr Kundan Podchelwar and Dr Vinod Ramteke conducted the postmortem at Transit Treatment Centre (TTC), where the carcass was kept in cold storage overnight. Chief conservator of forests (CCF) and TATR field director Jitendra Ramgaonkar said there were no superficial injury marks on the body and all the body parts were intact. But the postmortem has remained inconclusive following the body’s highly decomposed condition. Viscera samples have been collected and sent to forensic lab for analysis and its report may shed light on the cause of death. Ramgaonkar said the deceased sub-adult tiger was the offspring of tigress T31 and had two siblings. Foresters have spotted its female sibling in a camera trap, while combing operations are underway to trace the male sibling. The mother tigress is safe and away in Katejhari area inside the tiger reserve for the last few days, he added. Fifty camera traps have been laid in the area to track the missing third litter of tigress T31, Ramgaonkar said. The postmortem was performed in the presence of Ramgaonkar, deputy director (core) NV Kale, dy director (buffer) G Guruprasad, ACF BC Yede, PCCF and National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) representatives Bandu Dhotre and Mukesh Bhandakkar. Later, the remains of the tiger were incinerated at TTC before the witnesses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tadoba-tiger-death-postmortem-inconclusive/articleshow/84598038.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Mumbai||Penalise firm for delay in setting up oxygen plants: BJP||MUMBAI: BJP on Tuesday sought blacklisting of a company awarded a Rs 84-crore contract for installing oxygen generation plants at 16 locations here. The party alleged that the company had failed to install and commission the plants in 30 days, as per the work order on July 16. BMC first claimed that while the 16 sites were handed over to the company on June 16, final site clearance was given for all plots on June 25, and said that it would calculate the deadline for the work as July 25. BMC claimed that plants were revived at all 16 locations and installation work was in progress. TimesViewBMC has received praise from across quarters for its oxygen management, including from Supreme Court. Before awarding any contract, BMC should come clean on allegations of tainted firms taking part in contracts for setting up oxygen plants and ensure that the work is awarded to competent firms transparently. BMC must ensure the project is completed swiftly. Stern action must be taken for delays and irregularities must be probed.BMC has received praise from across quarters for its oxygen management, including from Supreme Court. Before awarding any contract, BMC should come clean on allegations of tainted firms taking part in contracts for setting up oxygen plants and ensure that the work is awarded to competent firms transparently. BMC must ensure the project is completed swiftly. Stern action must be taken for delays and irregularities must be probed. “The tainted Highway Construction Co failed to install and start the 16 plants at hospitals. BMC must immediately blacklist the company and file an FIR as it is playing with people’s lives. An enquiry must also be initiated against BMC’s mechanical and electrical (M&E) department officials who are conniving with the contractor,” said BJP MLA Ameet Satam, who inspected plants at Juhu’s Cooper Hospital. Satam said BMC had pushed the deadline to July 25 to help the company. “The contractor is part of a nexus that is looting BMC. The new Rs 320-crore contract must not be given to this company. I have written to municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal about it,” Satam said. Mumbai city guardian minister Aslam Shaikh had recently alleged ‘match-fixing’ in BMC’s oxygen generation plant contracts worth around Rs 320 crore. In a letter to Chahal, the Congress minister said a cartel of contractors was operating hand in glove with BMC officials. Highway Construction was allegedly penalised in the penguin enclosure project at Byculla zoo and its oxygen plant manufacturer was allegedly blacklisted for shoddy work by Jaipur’s Sawai Man Singh Medical College in November last year, Shaikh had said. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said BMC extended the deadline to favour the firm. Additional municipal commissioner (projects) P Velrasu said, “Some were handed over on June 16, others between June 16-26. Expected work completion is 30 days. A penalty will be imposed from July 17.” Romin Chedha of Highway Construction did not respond to queries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bjp-penalise-firm-for-delay-in-setting-up-oxygen-plants-in-mumbai/articleshow/84600148.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt tells HC: Doorstep vax drive to start August 1 in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Over three months after a public interest litigation (PIL) in Bombay high court sought doorstep Covid vaccination for the elderly and ailing, the Maharashtra government and the Mumbai civic administration told the court they will launch a drive in Mumbai on August 1 to immunise 3,505 bed-ridden, wheelchair-bound, terminally ill and physically disabled persons in their homes. The HC bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Kulkarni, which conducted over 17 hearings of the case, responded to the assurance saying, “There were enormous expectations of such persons from the central policy...we record our satisfaction that the State has done its bit.” State advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said the policy was being given final touches and BMC’s senior counsel Anil Sakhare said its health department has green-lit the plan to start home delivery of jab from August 1. Advocates Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari had filed the PIL seeking a direction to bring in a doorstep immunisation policy for senior citizens and the specially-abled who cannot step out or even be transported to vaccination centres. Kumbhakoni said the state has, in fact, “widened’’ the scope of persons to be included. At the last hearing, the government had said a pilot project would begin in Pune. The HC had proposed Pimpri Chinchwad as a test site after noting that it had almost 2,000 bedridden persons registered on the state’s email and social media sites, in contrast to Pune’s 50. After public notices were placed in newspapers and on the state’s website following the last hearing on July 16, number of patients expressing interest in being vaccinated at home in Mumbai rose to 3,505. Hence, Kumbhakoni said, they would start the drive in Mumbai. The vaccines “will be free of cost” he added. “Kumbhakoni also submitted that the policy guidelines shall be finalized, without major modifications to the draft that was placed before us, and a status report with regard to progress made in vaccination of the eligible individuals would be placed on August 06, 2021,’’ said the HC in its order. “We hope and trust that the State as well as the MCGM shall leave no stone unturned to ensure that eligible bedridden and immobile individuals/patients also have the benefit of Covid vaccines in the manner as proposed by the State,’’ added the HC. On June 9, the HC in its order had likened the Centre’s near-to-home vaccination policy as “taking the war against the enemy to the borders but falls clearly short of a ‘surgical strike’ on the virus which is the need of the hour and could have been possible by administering the vaccines to the bedridden.’’||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-govt-tells-bombay-hc-doorstep-vax-drive-to-start-aug-1-in-city/articleshow/84598045.cms||Swati Deshpande

The carcass of the dolphin was recovered in the midstream near the Barari Ghat at Bhagalpur, which comes under the VGDS, last Saturday. The VGDS, a 60km stretch of the Ganga from Sultanganj to Kahalgaon, was declared a protected area in 1991. A preliminary offence report was lodged with the Barari police station under Wildlife Protection Act by the forest department officials following recovery of the carcass. A departmental investigation is also underway to ascertain the exact reason for the death of the dolphin and whether it was a case of illegal hunting by fishermen or a natural or accidental death due to some reasons. Divisional forest officer (DFO) Bharat Chit Palli said postmortem has already been conducted. “The carcass was in a precarious condition when it was recovered. Through postmortem it came to light that the carcass was almost three-day-old. We are investigating to find out whether it was a case of any foul play or natural death of the dolphin,” the DFO added. Use of fishing net in the Ganga for fishing purposes is banned. Accidental deaths of dolphins from the propeller of boats and steamers have been a major concern for the forest department officials. According to forest department sources, five Gangetic dolphins were killed in 2006. After the 2006 incident, the recovery of dead Gangetic dolphins from time to time, including one in June 2019, had alerted the forest department and prompted it to take further steps for the conservation of the endangered species. Deepak Kumar, a nature and wildlife conservation activist associated with Wildlife Institute of India (Dehradun), said awareness about the conservation of dolphins and vigilance were very much required. He also demanded an in-depth probe by the state government into the recovery of the carcass of dolphin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/forest-officials-worried-as-carcass-of-dolphin-found-in-bhagalpur/articleshow/84595534.cms||---

The directorate of education (DoE) has said that schools cannot give admissions to students to Class XI science stream only based on marks allotted at Class X for the 2021 batch. “It is once again clarified that admissions to Class XI science stream should be done based on the results of an examination that will be conducted by the Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education and any admissions granted without the basis of the said Goa Board entrance exam result will be rendered invalid,” director of education D R Bhagat has said in a new circular. There were some reports of higher secondary schools providing ‘provisional’ admissions to Class XI science stream seats, violating orders. The Class X public exam was cancelled in 2021 due to the pandemic, in view of safety of the students. The results were prepared by individual schools. And while admissions to Class XI commerce, arts and vocational streams have begun based on this result prepared by the schools, entry to Class XI science stream seats and diploma programme seats will be carried out based on a common entrance test. The idea is to keep the entry to science stream seats competitive. The exam is expected to be held on either July 27 or 28, the board has announced. “It is therefore directed that all the higher secondary schools desist from enrolling students for Class XI science stream without the results of the said examination by Goa Board. Any violations of this process will be viewed seriously,” Bhagat said.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Only 3 out of 40 Covid victims died after taking two shots, says study||KOLKATA: A hospital-based study on the comparative effectiveness of two vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin — found no significant difference in terms of Covid-19 and in-hospital mortality. In other words, the study has found both vaccines equally effective in lowering the mortality as well as disease progression. Peerless Hospital had conducted the study on 294 patients with moderate to severe infection. The study found that of the 294 patients, 201, which is 68.4%, were unvaccinated while 15 had received Covaxin and 78 had got the Covishield jab. Of the 93 patients who contracted the infection post-vaccination, 73 had taken the first dose while only 20 had taken both the doses of either of the vaccine. The in-hospital mortality rate among 294 patient was 13.4% when 40 patients died during treatment. Among the deaths, 26 were completely unvaccinated while 11 of them had got only the single dose. Only three had received both the doses — two of them Covishield and one of them Covaxin. “Even among the three deaths who were fully vaccinated, they had contracted the disease within 14 days of the second jab. And patients who died post vaccination had severe co-morbid conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and malignancy. We found no significant difference in the effectiveness of the two vaccines,” said Peerless hospital clinical research and academic director Subhrojyoti Bhowmick, co-author of the study. Doctors said that the human body takes about two weeks from the second dose to develop optimum immunity. Published by a team comprising doctors Abhraneel Parames Guha, Aritra Chakrabarti, Subhrojyoti Bhowmick, Saibal Das, Rahul Khandelwal, Aditya Singh, Ajoy Krishna Sarkar, Anupam Das, Krishnangshu Ray and Sujit KarPurkayastha, the study was conducted between April and June. This perhaps is the first time such a data on Covid-19 infection on post-vaccination has been published in the eastern India. The state government, too, has taken up such a project to study post-vaccination infection trends. “Available data shows that home-grown Covaxin has good efficacy. Now since most hospitals are taking vaccination history on Covid-19 patients during the second wave, they should also come out with their findings,” said immunologist Dipyaman Ganguly, a scientist at the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata. “CMRI is collecting data to analyse exactly how many people got infected post vaccination, treatment outcome and mortality,” said CMRI pulmonology director CMRI Raja Dhar. “Though the number is less, we are still finding some patients with severe Covid infection even after two doses,” said Sauren Panja, medicine and critical care head at RTIICS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hosp-study-only-3-out-of-40-cov-victims-died-after-taking-2-shots/articleshow/84595590.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

After the previous day’s mayhem, all hands were on deck, with the leaves of employees of the road owning agencies and traffic police having been cancelled. Pul Prahladpur, of course, had no respite and the railway underpass had to be closed once due to inundation.A couple and a motorist were rescued in Greater Kailash I after trees fell on their vehicles following the rains on Tuesday evening. Atul Thakur, (DCP (South), informed, “Around 5.40pm, police received a call about cars damaged by fallen trees and a team led by ACP Lakshay Pandey and SHO G K Ritesh reached the site. A tree had fallen on the windshield of a couple’s i20 car. They were rescued through the boot of their i20 car. Another motorist on the same stretch sustained minor injuries when a tree fell on his car. He was rescued and rushed to AIIMS and his condition is fine now.” A taxi was also damaged, but fortunately all the three passengers and the driver escaped unhurt. Police officers moved the fallen tree and ensured there was no danger to the quartet’s lives. An hour-long traffic jam was reported on Aurobindo Marg due to massive water logging under the AIIMS flyover. Parts of central Delhi were also affected by flooding and the consequent traffic jams.The municipal corporations received water logging complaints from Rajnagar, Mahavir Nagar Dabri, Suredha Village, Roshanpura, Sangam Vihar, Mandi Road Dera Village, A-Block Uttam Nagar, Sitapuri, among other areas. South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) stated that parts of buildings were damaged in Bengali Colony Jharoda Road and Mansa Ram Park in Matiala. Tree-falling cases were logged in Sector 6, Dwarka, DPS School Sector 3, Dwarka, Dakshinpuri, Basant Lok Market complex in Vasant Vihar, Malviya Nagar, Hari Nagar, Subhash Nagar, Okhla Phase 3, Jangpura and Chhatarpur Enclave.A senior PWD official said that the agency had cancelled the leaves of the staff and everyone, no matter the rank, was posted on the ground to ensure smooth functioning. Talking about the road cave-ins, the official said that the spots where these were reported had been cordoned off and traffic diverted.

In all, Tuesday saw 25 traffic guards remove as many as 91 such beacons from the official cars. “Most senior police and government officers forgot they are entitled to beacons only in their zone of work. Others were not aware that they can use simple beacons, not flashers,” reminded an officer. “The crackdown will continue. For those who have claimed that they are entitled, we have noted down their vehicle numbers. We will send them notices and they need to show us the notification that allows them to enjoy this privilege during working hours,” said a senior officer. DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha stated that since last Saturday, they have brought down 282 unauthorized beacons. "None of those whom we have checked is fake people.

---||Delhi||Delhi: July turns rain-surplus||NEW DELHI: After Delhi received rain for three straight days, Safdarjung, which is the city’s base station, has crossed the monthly normal mark for July. The capital saw two spells of rain on Tuesday. While light rain was recorded in some parts in the morning, the rain activity intensified in the evening hours, causing traffic snarls and waterlogging at many places. India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasts very light rain or thundershowers on Wednesday and Thursday. “The rain activity is expected to intensify on Friday. There is a possibility of thundery development over the weekend, but light showers are predicted on July 26,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD and head of Regional Weather Forecasting Centre. According to IMD, Safdarjung has received 220.4mm of rainfall in this month till 8.30am on Tuesday while the normal mark for July is 210.6mm. In June, Safdarjung stood at a deficit of 47% as it received just 34.8mm rainfall against the normal mark of 65.5mm. A Met official said that as Delhi witnessed 10 rainy days in July so far, it helped in pushing the Safdarjung station above the normal mark. As rainy days are expected through the month, it will add to the “surplus” category, he said. The IMD data showed that in July last year, Safdarjung was at a surplus of 13%, recording 236.9mm rainfall. After light morning showers on Tuesday, Safdarjung recorded 6.3mm rainfall between 8.30am and 5.30pm. Palam, Ayanagar, Lodhi Road and Ridge received 29.3mm, 13.4mm, 6.7mm and 4.2mm rainfall, respectively, during the same period. An intense spell of rain lashed out across the city in the evening and Safdarjung recorded 54mm rainfall from 5.30pm to 8.30pm. Palam witnessed 9.4mm rainfall along with gusty winds at the speed of 50kmph during these hours. The maximum temperature was recorded at 31.9 degrees Celsius, three degrees below normal. The minimum temperature dipped to 24 degrees Celsius, three notches below normal. The relative humidity oscillated between 79% and 98%. Safdarjung recorded 38.4mm rainfall till 8.30am on Tuesday, but some stations — Najafgarh (79.5mm), Narela (71.5mm) and Palam (67.6mm) — reported heavy rain during the same period. IMD classifies more than 64.5mm rainfall in a day as “heavy”. As the rain washed out pollutants, the air quality remained “satisfactory” on Tuesday. The overall air quality index (AQI) of the capital was recorded at 81.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/safdarjung-crosses-july-rain-quota/articleshow/84598078.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||DD checks based on body language: ADGP||Hyderabad: The body language of a person matters not only while attending a business meeting or a job interview but also while you are driving your vehicle. Telangana police informed the high court that they stop motorists during their drive against drunk driving based on the body language of a motorist. This was informed by additional director general of police (Legal) Rajiv Ratan, who filed a counter reply few days ago at the behest of Telangana director general of police M Mahendar Reddy, after an advocate, M Venkanna, challenged the manner and method employed by police department during the enforcement against drunk driving. Out of the several issues raised by the advocate about the enforcement was the risk posed to motorists who have health ailments like — blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems and others — in contracting coronavirus by coming in contact with unsafe persons or material from close proximity. “Police don’t stop and check all vehicles but only a few vehicles either randomly or based on body language of the driver and check for alcoholic consumption level of the drivers duly following Covid-19 protocol. The overall objective is to create deterrence rather than detecting every commuter driving in drunk condition,” police said in their reply. Defending the manner and enforcement method employed against drunk driving, the police claimed they have a standard operating procedure in written form ‘Reference Hand Book for Covid-19 policing’, which mandatorily insists for maintaining safe distance from the persons who are being subjected to drunk and drive check. “It is germane to mention herein that the police is using disposable straws which are replaced after each and every check and are disposed of properly taking all precautions to prevent spread of Covid-19 from potential carriers. The devices are properly sanitised before use,” police said while mentioning the precautions being taken. However, Venkanna, while speaking to TOI, contested the police claim by saying that usage of a straw is not being strictly implemented in all cases. “Even if the breath analyser is sanitised before its use on every occasion as said by police, there is a possibility that a non-drinker might also be declared drunk since sanitiser will have alcohol content. Apart from Covid-19, the present enforcement mechanism, according to me, can spread other contagious diseases too. I am in favour of enforcement against drunk driving but the mechanism has to be foolproof,” Venkanna said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dd-checks-based-on-body-language-adgp/articleshow/84600193.cms||Srinath Vudali
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: You may soon be allowed to cycle around Maidan for two hours every Sunday morning||KOLKATA: Kolkata Police, along with KMDA and PWD, are mulling to allow cyclists an undisturbed couple of hours to promote a healthy and pollution-free lifestyle. The development comes a few weeks after Kolkata Police communicated to KMDA that dedicated cycle tracks on any city road was not feasible. However, the new idea may be seen as a concession to long-standing demand to promote cycling in the city. “Kolkata Police is not against cycling per se. We are only pointing out that the city’s roads do not have the infrastructure to allow cycling,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar. Sources in Lalbazar said the proposal is likely to be sent for vetting from both the detective department and traffic as this involves both ensuring security of cyclists and a paradigm shift in vehicle movement. Though Lalbazar had said that the recent visit to the Maidan-Babughat stretch last Sunday by police commissioner Soumen Mitra, detective department chief Murlidhar Sharma and other senior officers was merely to take stock of the enhanced security now in place, the very fact that the top cop and his colleagues chose to cycle down had indicated that Lalbazar might have some more plans for the Maidan area. “At present, everything is in theory. Even if police and agencies arrive at a consensus, a necessary nod from both the government and Indian Army — the custodian of Maidan — will be required. Working out the modalities — followed by a formal notification — will need time,” said an officer at Lalbazar. KMDA officials said the proposal for cycling in the Maidan area was only for recreational purposes. “Since there is no matter of using cycles as a means of public transport for the Maidan area right here, the proposal should not be facing too many hurdles. If police inform us of their approval, we will communicate it to PWD, which looks after the area. As for the rest of the Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA), which is looked after by KMDA, we will place a fresh proposal to police if they tell us that they were still considering the proposal,” said a KMDA official. Earlier, KMDA had submitted a proposal to police for having bicycle corridors in the city, covering around 120km along 15 major roads. But police were not game with the proposal. The traffic police brass — in a communication to KMDA last month — had said that there are multiple parking lots on main roads and the absence of any alternative sites to shift these parking lots was the biggest stumbling block in this project. The cops said that bus stops at regular intervals and encroachment of the left lane at several points were other major challenges. “In a city that has very little road space, we cannot block a lane for cycles. The cycle enthusiasts must realize our limitations,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/you-may-soon-be-allowed-to-cycle-around-maidan-for-2-hrs-every-sunday-morning/articleshow/84595628.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

With the monsoon and Covid-19, the service is expected to stay shut and resume operations only in September. Due to the unavailability of a maintenance facility or pandemic-induced restrictions, seaplane operations have been suspended for about 157 days since its inauguration on October 31. “SpiceJet, which operates the seaplane service, has said the service will resume operations in September. A date has not yet been finalized. Sea plane operations are based on Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and since the aircraft flies over a hilly region, due to the monsoon season, it is not safe to operate according to the airline,” said Captain Ajay Chauhan, director, civil aviation, government of Gujarat. VFR simply means that the aircraft is intended to operate in visual meteorological conditions i.e. clear weather condition. Clouds, heavy precipitation, low visibility, and otherwise adverse weather should be avoided under VFR, said sources. A SpiceJet spokesperson said, “A meeting with GUJSAIL and the civil aviation department was held recently to review the Covid situation, access to market conditions and viability. We will soon come up with a plan for resumption of services.” The seaplane made 284 flights, and carried 2,458 passengers during its operations, according to SpiceJet. The seaplane aircraft is currently in the Maldives, from where it has been leased. It will now be brought back in September. In December 2020 too, the aircraft was sent to the Maldives for thorough maintenance as a wet and dry dock which is required is not available in India. Even though a dock was being constructed at the Sabarmati riverfront for maintenance, and was expected to be operational earlier this year, according to an earlier email from the airline, work on the dock is still in progress according to SpiceJet officials. Sources said an inspection of the dock by experts from the Maldives is pending.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/seaplane-unlikely-to-take-to-skies-before-september/articleshow/84598148.cms||Niyati Parikh

Delhi Police and DTC were asked to ensure that old vehicles, junk, tyres and buses were not left in the open and auctioned or disposed of to avoid accumulation of water.EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand said, “While the corporation is continuously checking breeding sites and spraying larvicide, the nodal officers of other departments, hospitals and offices should act responsibly for prevention of mosquito breeding.”It was also emphasised that lack of desilting and cleaning of drains may result in puddles, which would automatically lead to breeding of mosquitoes during monsoon. “The PWD nodal officer was directed to get all drains cleaned regularly, while Delhi government’s education department was asked to cover all overhead tanks,” said an EDMC official.The Shahdara ADM pointed out that during heavy rain there was overflow and backflow of drains, thereby making it difficult for free flow of rainwater. The commissioner assured to take up the matter with the engineering department.An EDMC official said that besides roads, waterlogging in fields of sports stadiums, open ground in hospitals, railways and mandir complexes for 6-7 days was a cause for concern.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/agencies-hold-meet-to-beat-waterlogging/articleshow/84598108.cms||---

This includes nine vacancies of tahsildars, 168 vacancies of deputy tahsildars, 71 vacancies of village officers, head clerk and revenue inspectors and 92 vacancies of senior clerks. These vacancies will be temporarily downgraded to entry-cadre posts, and appointments will be made from existing rank-lists. When necessity arises, these will be filled through promotions, the land revenue commissioner has informed the government. In the wake of the land revenue commissioner’s recommendations, the government had asked all collectors to send a detailed list of vacancies. The maximum number of vacancies was reported from Ernakulam (42) and the least from Wayanad (12). The vacancies in other districts are as follows Thiruvananthapuram (25), Kollam (19), Pathanamthitta (20), Alappuzha (32), Kottayam (32), Idukki (27), Thrissur (18), Palakkad (23), Kozhikode (14), Malappuram (36), Kannur (21) and Kasaragod (19).

At the previous cabinet, CM Pinarayi Vijayan had instructed all ministers to assess vacancies in their respective departments and report them to PSC at the earliest as 500 PSC rank lists are set to expire on August 4. Orders are in force on the basis of which there are provisions to de-cadre the promotion posts, the appointments to which are pending because of court cases, seniority disputes etc. The chief minister had warned that stringent action will be taken against those who show lapses in reporting vacancies whenever they arise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/340-vacant-posts-in-revenue-dept/articleshow/84598183.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Narrowed artery induces fear of food, causes weight loss: Doctor||MUMBAI: KEM Hospital dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh, who has performed thousands of interventional procedures, has got a patent for a new device to help control obesity. “As interventional radiologists, we treat arteries and veins by opening up or closing them as the situation demands,” he said. What is not well known is that plaque buildup not only affects the heart vessels but even the vessels in the abdomen. When the superior mesenteric artery that supplies blood to the small intestine develops blockages, the patient starts suffering from “abdominal angina”. “The patient develops this angina whenever he or she eats. As a result, they develop fear of food and avoid it, leading to 10 to 20kg weight loss,’’ said Dr Deshmukh. Medical literature mentions some such patients develop cibophobia, which is defined as the fear of food. It is this connection between the blocked mesenteric artery, cibophobia and weight loss that he, along with Dr Krantikumar Rathod, worked on. “We felt we can narrow the mesenteric artery in morbidly obese people by introducing a stent-like device, which would trigger weight loss,” he said. The narrowed artery induces cibophobia, which, in turn, leads to weight loss. The doctors applied for the patent in April 2016, and got it earlier this month. The device they designed is 8mm in diameter, shaped like an hourglass, and is 15-20mm long. “We now have to devise the delivery system, make prototypes and plan animal studies,” he said. These steps need to be followed before human trials. A surgeon TOI spoke to said deliberately narrowing an artery with a device could trigger clots. “As morbidly obese people usually have diabetes or hypertension, introducing such a device needs to be well thought out,” said a bariatric surgeon who didn’t want to be identified. Another doctor said an idea that sounds good on paper may not always work in practice. Dr Deshmukh said the device, cited in the patent document with an “objective of obesity reduction”, could be used as a bridge treatment before morbidly obese patients go for weight-reduction bariatric surgery. “It will help lose 10-20kg in a few weeks and can be removed thereafter.” The team is also studying its use in managing cardiac disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-narrowed-artery-induces-fear-of-food-causes-weight-loss-says-doctor/articleshow/84598154.cms||Malathy Iyer

Chaudhari showed that he took Rs 2 crore loan from Benchmark Buildcon Pvt Ltd, a shell company, for purchasing the land. The witness gave the ED all details after which the officials confronted Chaudhari with the statement on Monday. Chaudhari denied the witness’s claim in his further statement to the ED.

---||Delhi||Inn & out: Plan to link Delhi zoo with Sunder Nursery nixed||NEW DELHI: Plans to connect Delhi zoo with Azimganj Sarai in Sunder Nursery have been scrapped, officials say, stating multiplicity of agencies and the need to break portions of the zoo’s boundary walls made the project complex. In addition, permissions were also required to fell around 90 trees under the Forest Conservation Act with the area being a ‘deemed’ forest.  Under the plan, visitors from the zoo could cross over towards Sunder nursery through the sarai, while visitors at Sunder nursery could also enter the zoo through gates in the area falling between the two. Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC), which was working on restoration of the 16th century Mughal inn and its 108 individual rooms for over five years, says the restoration work has also been halted. AKTC had already completed Phase-I of the restoration, while Phase-II conservation work was to take an additional three years, consisting of repair work of the nine-metre high walls of the sarai. This was being done in partnership with the department of archaeology, which comes under the Delhi government. Ratish Nanda, project director, AKTC, said restoration work was no longer continuing for the sarai with the zoo unable to come up with an agreement over certain project plans. “We are no longer working on its restoration. It may be resumed later if any fresh plan is put into work,” said Nanda. AKTC had earlier stated that a majority of the walls of the sarai, which has a large courtyard in the middle, were in a dilapidated state when the restoration work had resumed, with some walls collapsed towards the zoo and animal enclosures. AKTC said the project would not only conserve this Mughal structure but also prevent further damage towards Delhi zoo enclosures. During this first phase, stabilisation work had been undertaken on two wings of the sarai, which consisted of 54 vaulted cells and their arched openings. For the second phase, trees falling within the vicinity needed to be transplanted. Ramesh Pandey, director, Delhi Zoo, told TOI that on their end, the plan had been scrapped nearly six months ago with four agencies, including the zoo, AKTC, the department of archaeology and the urban development department, failing to come to a consensus over some matters. “The area around it is a deemed forest and would require permissions under the Forest Conservation Act, with some trees to be felled under it. Walls of the zoo were also to be broken down and openings made, which we objected to,” said Pandey, stating the proposal may be considered in the future if the sarai is fully restored.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/inn-out-plan-to-link-zoo-with-sunder-nursery-nixed/articleshow/84598182.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The last time the city had a low case count was on February 2 (334). “The Covid situation is improving across the state, including in Kolhapur that saw a worrying spurt in cases last month,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state task force on Covid-19. Maharashtra registered 6,910 cases on Tuesday as compared to 6,017 the previous day. In the same period, deaths rose from 66 to 147, but active cases dropped to 94,593 from 96,375. In Mumbai, 10 deaths were registered, taking the total toll to 15,787 so far. The BMC conducted 22,015 tests as compared to an average of 30,000 daily, but the positivity rate is below 2% at 1.59%, said the BMC daily Covid update. Dr Joshi said the task force conducted a review on Monday of the 10 worst-hit districts where the daily test positivity rate is over 10%. “The Covid rise in Kolhapur, despite the highest vaccination percentage in the state, was a paradox, but it has been explained,’’ he said. The second wave began late in Kolhapur and due to failure of people to self-isolate, many households tested positive. The daily tally in Kolhapur administrative circle has dropped from 3,000-plus daily to 2,272 on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-348-cases-in-city-lowest-in-over-5-mths/articleshow/84598287.cms||---

A forest official said that following this, they may issue notices for adoption of more trees under Delhi Preservation of Trees Act (DPTA) 1994. Though Section 13 of DPTA allows adoption of a tree for a specified period, no tree has so far been adopted in Delhi. In January this year, the department had issued a notice asking individuals, organisations and local bodies to help them keep the banyan tree alive. A petition has also been filed in Delhi High Court for its protection. The petitioner had claimed that extensive damage was caused to the tree, following which the forest department informed the court that the tree officer was hopeful that it could be saved and restored to good health. The high court had estimated the tree to be around 300 years old but the forest department put its age at at least 150 years. “We have received more than 300 applications. The process of selection was delayed due to the Covid-19 lockdown. We are examining the applications and their experience on taking care of trees will be considered,” said a forest official. According to Section 13 of DPTA, a tree authority can allow, by a written permission, an individual, a corporate or an institution to adopt a tree for a specific period and maintain and preserve it. “In the past, no application was sought for adoption of any tree. However, we may consider giving other trees for adoption, considering the response we get after the adoption of the banyan tree,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/30-apply-for-adoption-of-150-year-old-banyan-tree/articleshow/84598225.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Goa||Govt may auction 88 leases cancelled by apex court in 2018: Goa CM||PANAJI: Stating that his government respects the Supreme Court’s order on the mining review petition, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday said that after the dismissal of the review petition, the state government can now opt to auction the 88 mining leases which had been cancelled by the apex court in 2018. Further, he said that the state government will resume mining activities in the state through the Goa Mining Corporation or by auctioning mining leases. “The Goa Mining Corporation bill will be passed in the upcoming assembly session,” he said Sawant said that the government waited for the Supreme Court’s order before taking any decision, but that with the dismissal of the review petition, the state can now go ahead with other options to restart mining activities in the state. “The state is serious about restarting mining,” he said. He also said that once the bill pertaining to the corporation is passed in the assembly, the state government will fast track the process of forming its rules and regulation Sawant said that the memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd (MECL) will help the state find mineral reserves in the state. “MECL will start work from next week and once we receive their report, we will auction the reserves or operate them through the corporation,” he said Reacting to the Supreme Court’s observation, that there was a delay in filing the review petition, Sawant said that once he took over as chief minister, he studied the matter and filed the review petition within seven months. “When I realised that there was no option except to file the review petition, the government filed it,” he said Sawant also hit out at Congress for not renewing mining leases in 2007 when it was in power, thereby creating the present day situation. “When mining companies had approached the government for a second renewal in 2007, Congress must explain why this was not done. If the leases were renewed back then in the interest of the state, this situation would not have arisen today,” he said. Meanwhile, former South Goa MP Narendra Sawaikar welcomed the announcement that the bill on the mining corporation would be introduced in the forthcoming assembly session, saying this is in the larger interest of resumption of mining in the state. “I am sure the legislators, irrespective of political affiliations, will support the bill”, he said in a tweet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-govt-may-auction-88-leases-cancelled-by-apex-court-in-2018/articleshow/84598229.cms||---

She is one among the 4,600 people in Manikandam block who cannot read and write. They will be made literate within the next two months under ‘Karpom Ezhthuvom Iyakkam’ – a scheme of the directorate of non-formal and adult education. The minister along with the district collector S Sivarasu and district chief education officer R Arivalagan visited the school for the inauguration of the programme on Tuesday. Manikandam block in Trichy district has been selected by the Trichy district chief education office to achieve 100% literacy which will subsequently be spread to other blocks. According to K Marudhanayagam, Manikandam block education officer, there are 14,89,977 people in the block as of January. Out of them, 4,599 are illiterate - 3,676 are women and 913 men. They will be trained at the nearby government schools for the next 69 days to learn how to read and write. The collector said his office receives petitions from elders saying their children took advantage of their illiteracy to take over property by false means. “We have retrieved such properties and handed them back on few occasions. By becoming literate, they can avoid such incidents and lead a dignified life,” he said. “The practise of using thumb impression by illiterates, especially the elders, is prevalent in rural areas. We want to change this by making the state 100% literate in the next 2-3 years. While Tamil Nadu’s literacy rate is 80%, we must reach out to the 1 crore population. To achieve this, merely focusing on school children would not work. We will ask all the district chief education officers to identify illiterates in their district and give them training,” said the minister. “I was told that it would take 69 days to make them read and write. I have told Anjalai Ammal that I would return after 69 days to check if she is able to read and write,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/manikandam-to-achieve-100-literacy-in-69-days/articleshow/84598190.cms||---

To fill the gap in online learning, city colleges are planning to conduct two week-long bridge courses to freshen up basic concepts in Class XII before ushering them into regular syllabus for 2021-22. The colleges have, therefore, urged the government to allow them to conduct bridge courses offline while following all Covid-19 protocols. The online application and admission process will commence from July 26. “Bridge course is absolutely essential for first year students. We will have to quickly revise the Class XII syllabus based on the programmes they have chosen. If needed, we will teach them fundamentals. Without providing that hand holding, if we teach students the syllabus, they will struggle to understand,” said Thomas Amirtham, principal of Loyola College. Colleges will have to face challenges including low concentration levels, retaining their focus for five hours and easing them into advanced learning, he added. D G Vaishnav College is planning to refresh both existing students and freshers since they have all undergone only online mode of learning in the past year. “Even students with high marks in Class XII may have learning gaps due to the online mode of learning,” he said. Madras Christian College principal Paul Wilson said conducting bridge courses online will not be meaningful. “We are conducting bridge only because of the issues in online classes. Faculty members can assess the students well and understand their learning gaps only during the offline classes,” he said. Guru Nanak College has framed syllabus for all departments to conduct bridge courses for first year students. “Usually, we will conduct bridge courses for maths, computer science and English courses. For this academic year, we have asked all departments including physics, chemistry, botany, zoology to prepare the syllabus for bridge course to ease the transition,” said principal M G Ragunathan. “After admissions, we will conduct bridge courses to fill the gaps. Only after this course, will we begin the regular syllabus for first year students,” he added. Lilian Jasper, principal of Women’s Christian College, said the college is planning to conduct bridge courses for up to one week for freshers. “Depending on the subject, the duration of the bridge course may be extended to help the children refresh the basic concepts,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/city-colleges-plan-two-week-bridge-course-for-freshers/articleshow/84595728.cms||---

Greening guidelines 2000 and a 2007 Delhi High Court order had asked each corporation to have one such unit in place.Ranjit Batra, a resident of Defence Colony, has been trying to save an Alstonia tree for the last 45 days, which tilted in June after a spell of rain. Batra says while after repeated attempts, staff of the horticulture department of the south corporation did arrive, they only pruned the top half, leaving the tree in its place. Locals have written to South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), not only asking for assistance to protect such trees and prevent them from falling but also for a dedicated tree disease surgery unit.Batra says that on June 4, a spell of rain led to a nearly 40-foot long tree tilting by around 10 degrees. “Following that, another spell of rain occurred and the tree tilted further. No one came for weeks, so I contacted a local activist, who put me in touch with a senior horticulture official and subsequently, a team of officers arrived, who said the tree could not be put upright, but its top could be pruned to make sure it does not fall,” said Batra, stating while the tree has now been pruned completely from the top and has no leaves, it is still tilted at an angle of 45 degrees.“I am unsure if the tree will grow leaves again and the staff also did not seem certain. They said that the tree would require physical support, but left without providing any further assistance,” Batra said.Bhavreen Kandhari, a tree activist, says while pruning trees or felling them is the easiest solution on paper, no efforts are made to protect trees, which become tilted, or develop a disease. “No corporation has a tree disease surgery unit at present. Even a basic team that can treat and fix such trees will help thousands of citizens. At present, there is no department willing to help,” claims Kandhari.An SDMC official said that no such unit was in place currently and also, there were no immediate plans to make a tree ambulance operational.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/residents-seek-ambulance-surgery-unit-to-keep-tilted-infested-trees-alive/articleshow/84598189.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

If they are interested in a debate, then I can ask my booth level president to hold it with them,” Tanavade said.Not only is AAP not in power, they are not sure of whether they will get even one seat in the next assembly election, he said. “Instead of having a debate in Goa, AAP should hold a debate in Delhi and solve the problems faced by the people there,” Tanavade said.He said that the debate should be on how many people have to pay electricity bills after 300 units, in Delhi.Last week, Arvind Kejriwal, while on a visit to Goa, had stated that when AAP came to power in Goa it would give up to 300 units of free electricity while ensuring 24x7 constant power supply. He had also said that all old power bills will be waived off and farmers will get free electricity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tanavade-moots-bjp-booth-prez-for-debate/articleshow/84598258.cms||---

Roads for a total length of 5,090m will be laid in the industrial zone to facilitate the basic needs of the companies that are planning to invest in the food park proposed in the industrial estate.After acquiring land at Kannudaiyanpatti, K Periyapatti, and Chathirapatti villages in Manapparai situated on the Trichy-Dindigul NH, Sipcot established the industrial park on 1,096 acres. In November 2020, around 127 acres in the industrial park was allotted for establishing a mini food park, while 93 acres was allotted for general engineering industries. Around 120 acres of the total area is reserved for green space development. To facilitate the allied infrastructure to support the requirements of investors planning to launch production in the mini food park immediately, Sipcot has initiated road development work. While the main access road is 30m wide, the interior roads leading to the industries will have 25m width. Work on the stormwater drain and street lights are underway. Sipcot sources said that development work including the 5 lakh litre overhead water tank and the 2,100-sqft administrative building are progressing.Requirement of water for the entire industrial park will be addressed by using the Cauvery water, which will be drawn from the river bed near Perugamani hamlet, a suburb of Trichy city. The park is anticipated to require 6 MLD of water. “Despite the pandemic, we have managed to launch and complete 15% of the civil work on a short notice. Construction activities will conclude by March 2022,” an official source with Sipcot said. Inquiries for using the food park were coming from dairy units, food and beverage companies and local MSMEs. As the industrial estate is situated only 60km from Dindigul and 65km from Karur, Sipcot expects Dindigul and Karur-based industries to make use of the park. Sipcot has conducted a couple of discussions with key investors by highlighting the fund support available for the investors with Union and state governments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/sipcot-begins-development-work-at-manapparai-industrial-park/articleshow/84598259.cms||Deepak Karthik

According to P P Joseph, president of Catholic Congress, the high court on January 7 had directed the state government to implement the section fully within four months based on the writ petition filed by him. Since the order has so far not been implemented by the government, Joseph is moving contempt of court. He also said that he had served a notice for contempt of court to the chief secretary and director of minority welfare. The Catholic Congress wants the initiatives of the minority welfare department like civil service coaching centres, job-oriented learning centres, etc, provided through minority development finance corporation to be implemented in proportion to the population of the minority communities. Like in the minority scholarships, the ratio of 59:41 should be followed in these matters too, said Joseph.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/catholic-congress-to-file-contempt-of-court-case/articleshow/84598270.cms||---

---||Trichy||3.5K pregnant women get Covid jab in Ariyalur||Trichy: Ariyalur district has vaccinated more than 3,000 antenatal mothers in less than two weeks to become a frontrunner in the state in vaccinating pregnant mothers against Covid-19. One-to-one interactions with antenatal mothers and their spouses by doctors have helped young mothers come forward to take the jab. Villupuram is on the top spot in vaccinating antenatal mothers in the state closely followed by Ariyalur and Erode. Trichy district recorded 23 maternal deaths in the three months ending mid-June. The quick progression of Covid-19 infection among young mothers has resulted in mortalities to surge. Health officials said the scenario was the same across the state. After Covid-19 impacted the maternal mortality rate (MMR), the health department started vaccinating mothers in the antenatal and postnatal period in July 2021. But many young mothers were hesitant to take the vaccine shots. An exclusive vaccination camp organised in Trichy turned out a damp squib last week, as poor patronage made the health workers return the unused vials. Meanwhile, the vaccination coverage data for antenatal mothers released by the health department saw Ariyalur district securing the second-highest spot for vaccinating antenatal mothers across the state. Ariyalur district collector P Ramana Saraswathi said that sensitisation programmes for young mothers and their family members helped them achieve the coverage. “Block medical officers in all the six blocks invited the mothers for a casual discussion. We built confidence among them and our doctors spent time with the antenatal mothers during and after the vaccination,” the district collector told TOI. Ariyalur district has enumerated around 9,327 mothers (including postnatal) to vaccinate them on priority. Close to 3,500 of those were vaccinated till Tuesday. As on July 18, Villupuram, which vaccinated 3,108 antenatal mothers, stands first closely followed by Ariyalur with 3,070 antenatal mothers and Erode in third place with 2,487 mothers taking the jab. Health officials in Trichy said that they will attempt confidence building measures among young mothers to overcome their fear of vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/3-5k-pregnant-women-get-covid-jab-in-ariyalur/articleshow/84598251.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Trichy||Farmers still await payment for paddy procured through DPCs||Thanjavur: Farmers in Thanjavur district, on Tuesday, said that they are still waiting for the payment for the paddy procured through direct procurement centres (DPCs) run by Tamil Nadu civil supplies corporation (TNCSC).K Subramanian, a farmer from Umayalpuram, said that it has been 11 days since his 65 sacks of paddy were procured at the DPC.“Usually, the payment would be credited to our bank account in maximum three days. Now, it is the 11th day. The reply from the TNCSC officials is not convincing. I have no idea as to when the payment will be credited to my account,” Subramanian told TOI and added that due to the delay, he failed to repay the loan he took for cultivation and the interest on jewellery loan in the bank.TNCSC priced the grade ‘A’ variety of paddy at Rs 1,958 per quintal and common variety at Rs 1,918 per quintal. Around 250 DPCs were opened in the district to facilitate the farmers to sell their paddy harvested in the summer crop season for the past couple of months.T Murugesan, another farmer from Maruthuvakudi, said that he sold 450 sacks of paddy to the DPC at Maruthuvakudi on July 10. “No one is giving a clear reason for the delay over the payment. Waiting for the payment for such a huge volume of paddy causes financial loss to the farmers,” said Murugesan.District secretary of Thanjavur district Cauvery farmers’ protection association, S Vimalnathan, was the one who flagged the issue to the Thanjavur district administration. “Our inquiry brought to light that the farmers who supplied paddy even on July 6 are yet to get the payment. The district administration or TNCSC should come out with an explanation as to why there is a delay. If they give us the reason, we can consider,” said Vimalnathan.Senior regional manager of TNCSC Thanjavur, Uma Maheswari, was unavailable for comment despite repeated attempts.Meanwhile, Thanjavur collector Dinesh Ponraj Oliver told TOI, “The payment is being released.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmers-still-await-payment-for-paddy-procured-through-dpcs/articleshow/84598234.cms||Gokul Rajendran
---||Delhi||Delhi: Scolded, house help kidnaps child, flees to Alwar||NEW DELHI: A three-year-old girl was rescued on Tuesday from a house help after the latter had allegedly kidnapped her from Patel Nagar for being scolded by the child’s mother over her work. The child was rescued from Alwar in Rajasthan within three hours of the kidnap, a senior official said. The Patel Nagar police station received a complaint that a help, Shivani (23), had fled with her employer’s daughter. The victim’s mother told police that Shivani had called and said she would have to pay a hefty ransom to get her daughter back. The woman also said she suspected that the help had done so to take revenge as she was scolded in the morning. The accused had also warned the mother not to inform police or she would kill the girl. Shivani was working at the house for a long time and earned Rs 25,000 a month. She was hired through an agency and her verification was also done. Police said the help had asked for salary and around Rs 45,000 were also transferred. Police circulated pictures of both the help and the child and a search operation was launched. Multiple teams were formed to scan several CCTV footage while other teams activated technical surveillance. “Surveillance revealed that Shivani was travelling to Alwar with the child. Immediately, the SSP Bhiwadi, the SSP Alwar and the SSP Sikar in Rajasthan were alerted. Check points were put up by Rajasthan Police while Delhi Police teams also left by road for Alwar,” said an officer. Within three hours, a team led by the SSP Bhiwadi intercepted the help at a check point. “The girl was safely rescued, while the help was arrested and booked for kidnapping,” the officer said. A police team left for Rajasthan along with the mother. “The rescue in such a short time was possible due to minute-to-minute coordination between Delhi and Rajasthan police,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/scolded-house-help-kidnaps-kid-flees-to-alwar/articleshow/84598257.cms||---

Civic officials said the possibility of landslides was discussed at a monsoon safety review meeting held by the Thane municipal commissioner in May following which reminders were also issued to the forest department in June advising them of evacuating residents from perilous locations if required. “We alerted the forest department to survey and take appropriate action in either removing or relocating the residents as there were possibilities of landslides during heavy rains. As the land belongs to the forest, we have no power to take action but had offered our manpower during drives. We had also put up signboards warning residents of imminent dangers,” confirmed Sachin Borse, assistant municipal commissioner at the Kalwa ward. Following the incident, officials said the forest department had plans to conduct a survey of all dangerous spots along the stretch and take appropriate action. Forest officials could not be reached for their comments. Activists said it was the combined responsibility of the authorities as the majority of homes here had electricity and water connections which hinted at a nexus among the authorities. “How can one get so many facilities in illegal constructions? I have demanded action on those government officials found to have allowed these encroachments to flourish and also MCOCA to be slapped against the land mafia,” said Praveen Darekar, BJP neta and leader of opposition in the Legislative Council, who visited the surviving Yadav girls Tuesday at the Kalwa Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj Memorial hospital. Meanwhile, the corporation, late Monday, evacuated nearly 150 families from the stretch to safer places to avoid any recurrence following instructions from guardian minister Eknath Shinde. “We are also monitoring the health of these residents on the backdrop of Covid as many had come in close contact over the evacuation drive on Monday,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/land-belongs-to-forest-dept-it-was-alerted-repeatedly-in-mumbai-tmc/articleshow/84602325.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: BJP, Congress spar over Pegasus row||GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat units of the BJP and Congress are at loggerheads over the Pegasus spyware row. Chief minister Vijay Rupani on Tuesday accused the Congress and other opposition parties of “playing into the hands of foreign forces” and displaying an “anti-national mentality” by creating a controversy over the Pegasus spyware issue “to malign India’s image”. An international media consortium reported on Sunday that more than 300 mobile phone numbers, including those of two ministers, over 40 journalists, three opposition leaders and one sitting judge, besides scores of businesspersons and activists in India, could have been targeted for hacking through the spyware. The issue has rocked the monsoon session of Parliament, with the Centre and opposition parties trading charges. “The Congress and other opposition parties are playing into the hands of foreign forces and have created a controversy over the Pegasus issue just to malign India’s image. The Union government has denied using Pegasus. Raising this issue just before Parliament’s monsoon session shows the anti-national mentality of the opposition,” the CM said in a statement. He added that the agency that had raised the issue had given no evidence that the spyware or its data were used in this country. “Though it has been claimed that 45 other countries also use this software, only India is being targeted,” he said, adding that the Congress was trying to come back to power even at the cost of national security. He said the Congress had tried to put the Centre on the mat over the Rafale deal, surgical strikes on terror camps and farm laws but had failed. The Congress always stood in support of “urban naxals” and “Tukde tukde gang”, the CM further claimed. “In response to an RTI plea filed in 2013, the UPA government had admitted to spying on 9,000 phone numbers and 500 email accounts. Recently, a phone tapping issue connected to the Congress-led Rajasthan government had also emerged,” Rupani said. Senior Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia in a statement said, “The CM should apologize for his party leaders’ Snoopgate. I suggest that the CM be alert as he may be tracked by his own party leaders.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bjp-cong-spar-over-pegasus-row/articleshow/84598289.cms||---

Vaccinations for this group started in the first week of July. But early turnouts were extremely low. Now, however, hospital sites said they are seeing small improvements in response. “The pace is picking up, slowly. About 60 women have taken the shot at our hospital so far,” said Shirish Yadkikar, an administrative official of the Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital (DMH). At Jehangir Hospital, an official said, “We have vaccinated 10 to 15 pregnant women. Coverage is gaining momentum, but at a slow pace.” Health experts have urged authorities to use all mass media tools to boost coverage. Compared to urban centres, coverage has been particularly low in the fringes. Bharati Hospital, which mainly caters to those living in the outskirts and rural areas, said they have inoculated only five pregnant women so far. “We have started counselling sessions. There is still considerable vaccine hesitancy among women living in fringe areas and rural parts,” said Bharati’s gynaecologist Vaishali Taralkar. At Gupte Hospital — a maternity unit in the central part of the city — doctors said many women turning up for antenatal care have been vaccinated. “About 70% of the pregnant woman registered for antenatal care at our hospital are vaccinated. Awareness is quite high among the educated classes,” said the hospital's chief gynaecologist and medical director, Sanjay Gupte. Abhay Tidke, additional district health officer, said response to the jabs has been slow among pregnant women. “Very few have been vaccinated in the district so far,” Tidke said. Some experts said the situation is improving. “More pregnant women are opting for the jabs, based on positive feedback from their peers," said gynaecologist Pankaj Sarode, vice-president of the Pune Obstetrics and Gynaecological Society (POGS).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vaccination-of-pregnant-women-work-in-progress-docs-say-awareness-vital/articleshow/84598284.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Goa||Goa should restart mining via corp or e-auction: BJP||PANAJI: Reacting to the Supreme Court dismissing the state’s review petition to restart mining, BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade on Tuesday said that the government should restart the industry immediately through either a mining corporation or e-auction of leases. “We thought the state would win the mining battle legally, but considering Tuesday’s SC order, the state government should give relief to the people in the mining belt by resuming mining activities through corporation or auctioning,” he told reporters. He also said that BJP was hoping the SC would deliver a favorable order to resume mining activities in the state. “We are confident that the state government will come out with some solution to restart mining in the state,” he said. Mining in Goa came to a halt in March 2018 after the SC quashed the second renewal of 88 mining leases. The state government on Monday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd (MECL) to identify new iron ore mines in the state. Keeping in mind the delay in resumption of mining activities in the state, Sawant had decided to form a mining corporation and identify new mineral blocks to restart the industry. The mining companies had filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the apex court after the high court of Bombay at Goa dismissed their petitions challenging the Goa, Daman and Diu (Abolition and Declaration of Mining Leases) Act, 1987. During the Portuguese era, the mining companies were granted mining concessions, which were then converted into mining leases under the act. The SLP had stated that the Act should be made applicable from 1987, instead of 1961.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-should-restart-mining-via-corp-or-e-auction-bjp/articleshow/84598274.cms||---

This comes at a time when the state has directed the administration of all districts to base their weekly positivity rate (WPR) only on RT-PCR tests. At least 17 districts, which also include the ones with a high positivity rate, are conducting more Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) than RT-PCR tests. Public health department data revealed that after almost three weeks since the state issued the directions, the share of RT-PCR tests by all the 35 districts in Maharashtra is 52% as against 48% of RAT this week. The rate of RT-PCR tests by these districts was 50% last week. Though the RT-PCR numbers are steadily increasing, many districts do not have the required infrastructure for the tests. Districts such as Sangli, Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri and Thane are heavily dependent on Rapid Antigen Tests though the authorities have been told to ramp up RT-PCR testing. The public health department data revealed that from July 13 to July 19, around 14.54 lakh tests were conducted in the state. Of these, RT-PCR tests were 7.51 lakh and the remaining 7.03 lakh were Rapid Antigen Tests. Most of the districts in western Maharashtra with a high positivity rate did not have enough laboratories to conduct RT-PCR tests and the facilities continued to conduct more Rapid Antigen Tests Deputy commissioner of Pune division Santosh Patil said, “We have directed all the districts to focus more on RT-PCR tests. The division comprises Pune, Satara, Solapur, Kolhapur and Sangli districts. Barring Pune and Kolhapur, the rest of the districts are conducting more Rapid Antigen Tests.”  Health experts said when the ICMR had allowed the Rapid Antigen Tests, the state should also consider that for assessing the weekly positivity rate. “If an alternative is provided, the weekly positivity rate should be assessed on both the tests,” a retired public health official said. Public health expert R Jotkar said, “ We have to depend on both RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen Tests ahead of a possible third wave of the pandemic. Under-testing will lead to false conclusions and we will get complacent.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/inadequate-rt-pcr-testing-units-trigger-high-wprs/articleshow/84598261.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Delhi||New Streams For XI Kids In Govt Schools||New Delhi: When the students get to Class XI this year in Delhi government schools, they will find new streams to choose from. The Schools of Specialised Excellence announced during the budget speech given by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia will soon open, becoming in the process the first institutions under the new Delhi Board of School Education. The announcement regarding this will officially be made on August 15, according to an education official who has knowledge of the matter. The Delhi cabinet had approved in March the setting up of 100 Schools of Specialised Excellence (SSE). For now, the streams finalised for these schools include humanities, science technology engineering & mathematics (STEM), 21st century skills and art & craft. “These new schools will at present functio n from the already existing Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalayas and Schools of Excellence. The RPVVs and SoEs will eventually be phased out and all of them turned into Specialised Schools of Excellence,” disclosed the official, who did not want to be named. “Ultimately, only the Sarvodaya Vidyalayas and the regular schools will remain under Delhi government’s education directorate.” In the pilot phase, there will be 20 SSEs with student intake for classes XI and XII. At present, there are 22 RPVVs with classes from VI to XII. There are five SoEs which admit students in nursery and go up to Class XII. Students in these Delhi government school are taught in the English medium. As per the earlier notification, SSEs will offer choice-based classes for students from IX to XII, covering the last phases of the new 5+3+3+4 framework of schooling under the National Education Policy. With these schools being affiliated to the Delhi Board of School Education, they will move away from the usual practice of rote learning and stress instead on continuous formative assessment that encourages mental growth. “These schools will help nurture the talents of children and help them explore their interests. Delhi government is also working on where these children can go to complete their higher education after passing out from the schools,” revealed the official. Alongside, the implementation of the Virtual Model School, also announced in the budget speech, is in full swing. As part of the school, a state-of-the-art studio is nearing completion in one of the Delhi government schools. The teachers from the core academic unit will prepare the content for the virtual school. This is a new type of school and anyone from any part of the country can enroll and pursue schooling without being physically present in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-streams-for-xi-kids-in-govt-schools/articleshow/84598301.cms||Shradha Chettri

The Manapparai Sipcot industrial estate that has over 600 acres of unutilised area exclusively available for industries was yet again ignored despite having a supportive infrastructure and transport connectivity. Tamil Nadu government on Tuesday had signed MoUs for 35 projects touted to generate over 55,000 employment opportunities. However, a majority of the investment continued to focus on districts around Chennai and industrialised districts like Coimbatore. “While the export through Trichy international airport is growing steadily despite restricted air movement, lack of will to utilise the land bank near the airport is saddening. Trichy can serve as a hub for central districts that have significant human resources,” said A R Yoagandran, Trichy-based entrepreneur. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/central-dists-say-state-ignored-it-in-investments/articleshow/84598267.cms||---

Opposing the anticipatory bail plea filed by S Vijayan in the high court, Fousiya alleged that she witnessed Mariam Rasheeda throwing the officer out of her room when he tried to sexually molest her, Fousiya alleged. As per Fousiya’s petition, she and Mariyam Rasheeda had visited Thiruvananthapuram city police commissioner’s office as it was also the office of foreigners regional registration office 18 days before the visa expiry date of Mariyam. Vijayan then collected the passport and tickets of Mariyam and kept it with him. After a few days, Vijayan came to the hotel in which they were staying and returned after asking some questions. On October 8, Vijayan came to the hotel again and asked Fousiya to go out. When he tried to sexually assault her, Mariyam asked him to go out of the room. Mariyam was later on arrested alleging that she overstayed her visa and was later implicated in the spy case, the court was told. This occurred at a time when flights to Maldives were cancelled due to a contagious-disease outbreak. Further, Fousiya has contended that the spy case was registered under provisions of Official Secrets Act despite the legal bar that such a case cannot be registered without a complaint by the central government or Isro.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rasheeda-implicated-as-she-opposed-sexual-advances/articleshow/84598323.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Suburbs more vulnerable to Covid as air pollutants linger’||MUMBAI: Mumbai’s suburbs such as Ghatkopar, Vikhroli, Bhandup, Mulund, Kurla, Andheri, Vile Parle and Kandivli are more prone to Covid-19 due to prolonged and excessive exposure to air pollutants, states a new study. The first-of-its-kind ward-level study by the International Institute of Population Sciences (IIPS) points to a significant association between pollution and Covid-19 in Mumbai. While the concentration of particulate matter (PM10) is much more than the WHO-specified guidelines in the entire city, higher prevalence of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in suburban wards such as S, T, N, R-South and K-East may have compounded the Covid crisis, states the study. Wards in southern Mumbai, on the other hand, saw a relatively lower impact of pollutants, and therefore lower clustering of Covid cases too. The study also noticed more Covid-related deaths in suburban wards where the population had prolonged higher exposure to NO2. Mumbai’s suburbs with higher NO2 exposure due to industrial emissions and an increase in traffic in recent years are already at a higher risk of respiratory morbidity, say the researchers. The researchers used ward-wise Covid data released by the BMC till August 15, 2020, and statistically correlated it with the data on pollutants. “While Mumbai has only 10 pollution monitoring stations, we used the Kriging interpolation technique (a popular method used in pollution modelling) to estimate the concentration of pollutants in neighbouring regions to get ward-wise data,” said Subhojit Shaw, co-author of the paper. The final edit of the study, authored by IIPS professor Aparajita Chattopadhyay and Shaw, was published in the American Geophysical Union’s journal GeoHealth on Monday. The study also revealed that hotspots for Covid-19 and pollution exposure closely matched low-lying areas or wetlands, which face maximum waterlogging in monsoon. These include Kurla, Sion, Matunga, Mulund, Kalina, Ghatkopar, Juhu, Santacruz and Andheri, said Chattopadhyay. Along with NO2, the presence of drains significantly increases chances of Covid-19 fatalities, said Shaw.  V M Motghare, joint director, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (who is not part of the study), though, said they did not come across high levels of NO2 during the lockdown. “But studies have indicated that long-term exposure to air pollution affects human lungs’ efficiency and makes them vulnerable to respiratory diseases,” he said, adding MPCB is conducting an emission inventory study with NEERI and IIT-Bombay, which will help determine the contribution of each pollutant in 18 cities, including Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-suburbs-more-vulnerable-to-covid-as-air-pollutants-linger/articleshow/84598371.cms||Yogita Rao

A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that earlier a public interest litigation was filed before this court seeking not to construct a collectorate complex in the land proposed for medical college in the district. In December 2020, the court, which took note of the state’s stand that there was no proposal for construction of a medical college in the district, dismissed the petition. “The present petition is also virtually for an identical relief, though the prayer is slightly differently worded. In any event, as on date there appears to be no concrete proposal to establish a medical college in the newly-formed Tenkasi district,” observed the judges. The judges observed that it would be premature for this court to express any opinion on the proposal to construct a collectorate complex in the place ear-marked as a challenge to such a project has already been rejected earlier by this court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-to-reserve-land-for-mc-in-tenkasi-dismissed/articleshow/84598290.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Rs 2.27 crore seized from Class 2 government official in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) officials on Tuesday, in one of its biggest seizures, found Rs 2.27 crore cash from Nipun Choksi, a government official who was arrested on July 16 for allegedly demanding and accepting a bribe of Rs 1.21 lakh. The ACB officials were quick to issue a statement and termed it as the biggest ever seizure in its history. The official statement of ACB stated that it has also recovered 300 grams of gold worth Rs 10 lakh from one of the lockers of accused Nipun Choksi, state project engineer (class 2) with the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) office in Gandhinagar. The gold was found from the locker of Canara Bank in Gandhinagar. The ACB officials said that during the search they had found a locker in the Gandhinagar Nagarik Co-operative Bank Gandhinagar Sachivalaya Branch and recovered Rs 74.50 lakh from this locker. In other two lockers in Gandhinagar Co-operative Bank they found Rs 1.52 crore.  Choksi was held in a trap on July 16 while accepting Rs 1.21 lakh after a contractor who had completed some work for the SSA in Patan approached the ACB with a bribery complaint. The probe has found that Choksi used to charge a ‘commission’ of 1% on the amount paid to contractors for work completed, the ACB release informed. The ACB has stated in the release that earlier a cash and gold-silver ornaments totalling to Rs 1.27 lakh was recovered from Bhaya Sutreja, regional officer of the Gujarat Pollution Control Board. The cash and ornaments were recovered from the Jamnagar locker of Sutreja. In yet another incident, Rs 37.19 lakh was seized from the locker of Raman Charel, director boiler of the labour and employment department. Choksi was arrested following a complaint by a sub-contractor. The sub-contractor had completed the work of Kastuba Gandhi Girls School in Shankheshwar Taluka and Boys’ Hostel in Sami Taluka of Patan district under Shiksha Abhiyan. The accused had allegedly demanded 1.25 per cent cut for approval of bills. However, later it was decided to pay 1%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rs-2-27-crore-seized-from-class-2-government-official/articleshow/84598406.cms||---
---||Madurai||CB-CID probe ordered in illegal sand mining case involving govt officials||Madurai: Ordering CB-CID probe in a case pertaining to illegal sand quarrying which was facilitated by several officials from revenue, mines, police and agriculture departments in Tirunelveli district, the Madras high court on Tuesday suggested the authorities to explore the possibility of installing CCTVs in all the quarrying/storage sites and to constitute taluk, district and state level monitoring units for periodical inspections in order to prevent such illegal activities.The court passed the order in a batch of two petitions - seeking to restrain a person involved in illegal sand mining activities in Therku Kallidaikuruchi village in the district and to transfer the illegal sand mining case registered by Kallidaikuruchi police to any other investigating agency.A division bench of justices N Kirubakaran and B Pugalendhi observed that Manuvel George, a resident of Kerala, who does not have any land or quarry in the state obtained permission from the authorities for a stock yard for storing the minerals. However, by exploiting the licence, he was involved in quarrying the river sand from a nearby check dam and the adjacent patta lands.The judges said that when the sub-collector of Cheranmahadevi inspected the site, it was assessed that 27,773.66 cubic metres of sand had been illegally quarried and imposed a penalty of Rs 9.57 crore under the provisions of Tamil Nadu Mines and Minerals Concession Rules, 1959. Subsequently, the permission issued to George was cancelled.The judges observed that the assistant engineer of the agricultural engineering department has also facilitated the offence by creating seven farm ponds at the village, meant to benefit the farmers, but the same was misused by the government officials, for exploiting the sand.The judges observed that a criminal case was registered against George and 22 other people of which nine were arrested. However, no action was taken against the concerned officials, who facilitated George to commit the offence.The affidavit filed by the inspector of police shows that several transit passes were issued by the mines department, with and without signature. “243 hologram stickers were seized from the accused. The hologram stickers are government records, containing government emblem and serial number, which would be pasted in the transit pass. Therefore, prima facie, it appears that large scale exploitation took place, with the connivance of various government officials,”the judges said. Observing that though the inspector of police is conducting the probe in a fair manner and recovered several worthable materials, the judges said that they are inclined to transfer the case to CB-CID by taking into account the sensitivity of this issue as there was involvement of several government officials in this case which is yet to come to light.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cb-cid-probe-ordered-in-illegal-sand-mining-case-involving-govt-officials/articleshow/84598312.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Madurai||Roads in Madurai’s ward 31 inaccessible, say public||Madurai: The road connecting wards 29 and 31 through Thazhai Street near Gomathipuram in Madurai has been damaged for years now leaving it inaccessible by motorists. Residents from various areas like Angel Nagar, Vandiyur, Yagappa Nagar, Pandian Nagar, Aavin Nagar, Jubilee Town and Gomathipuram said that they find it difficult to use this road as it gets easily inundated and is uneven. The residents said that they could not remember the last time the roads in the areas were repaired by the Madurai Corporation. These areas were annexed with the city in 2011 and before that they came under the panchayat. Shahul Hameed, 70, a resident of Ambigai Street said, “The road has been in bad shape for several years now. I bought a house a few years ago since the area is next to Gomathipuram, a decent residential area, but, I feel sorry now. The corporation has neglected the areas, which is quite evident from the damaged road.” All the taxes are collected on time by the civic body, but it is not ready to provide even the basic amenities, he said. P Vanitha, a resident of Aavin Nagar, said roads in the rural areas are much better compared to the roads in their locality. “The condition is such that two-wheeler riders struggle the most. We have to get the vehicle serviced once every three months because of the road,” she said. Residents said that they have raised the issue with the authorities concerned many times, but there has been no proper response. An official from the corporation said that there is a proposal to lay new roads in the areas but funds are yet to be sanctioned. Soon, the roads in the area will get a facelift, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/roads-in-madurais-ward-31-inaccessible-say-public/articleshow/84598373.cms||V Devanathan
---||Delhi||HC questions delay in deciding Kalra’s plea to reopen restaurants in Khan Mkt||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Tuesday asked police to respond to a plea by businessman Navneet Kalra challenging the closure of his restaurants ‘Khan Chacha’ and ‘Town Hall’ in a case related to alleged black marketing of oxygen concentrators during the second wave of Covid-19. Kalra, arrested by Delhi Police on May 16, during the peak of the second Covid-19 wave, was later granted bail. Justice Rekha Palli, while seeking the stand of the authorities also questioned why a final order following the show-cause notice issued to Kalra’s eateries, has not yet been passed. “You compel people to come here. You should have passed an order by now. Ultimately, he wants to run them. If he is not entitled in law, please pass an order. What is this – he is involved in an FIR – and that is the end of it?” the judge remarked, while asking police to make its stand clear by July 30. The court was hearing Kalra’s plea challenging the May 11 order-cum-show cause notice issued by the joint commissioner of police (licensing). Following the notice, police also said it is suspending the registration certificate to run the two eateries in Khan Market. Kalra was then asked to submit his reply within 15 days. Senior advocate Maninder Singh, representing Kalra, informed the court that the businessman submitted his reply on June 9, however, since he did not hear anything from the authorities, he again wrote to them on June 17, but till date authorities have neither withdrawn the suspension order nor decided on the show-cause notice. He argued that the suspension was contrary to the provisions of the Delhi eating houses registration regulations as it does not confer power of suspension at the stage of issuance of a show-cause notice. “There is no provision to suspend registration certificates merely on the ground of registration of FIR,” he contended, urging the court to step in. In his plea, Kalra has submitted that the order of suspension was issued without first affording an opportunity to show cause or to give an explanation and on that ground alone it is punitive and illegal. “The order of suspension is also bad as recovery of oxygen concentrators made from the restaurant premises is no ground nor is it given as a ground for suspension of licence. The order of suspension adversely affects the business, reputation and livelihood of all employees working in the restaurant,” the plea argued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-questions-delay-in-deciding-kalras-plea-to-reopen-restaurants-in-khan-mkt/articleshow/84598611.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The party said the Supreme Court should take a suo motu cognisance of the matter that poses serious threat to nation’s security and privacy of its citizens. Accusing the Modi government of dismantling national security and ‘murdering’ fundamental right to privacy and constitutional duties in broad daylight, Congress president Girish Chodankar demanded that the prime minister answer on treason and breach of national security. “The Modi government is the deployer and executor of this illegal and unconstitutional snooping and spying racket through Israeli surveillance software ‘Pegasus’,” he said. Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat said the snooping and hacking is clearly ‘treason’ and total abdication of ‘national security’ by the Modi government, more so when the foreign company could possibly have access to this data. Former Union minister Ramakant Khalap said the spyware ‘Pegasus’ not only breaches WhatsApp, but is able to turn over the phone’s camera and microphone to capture all activities in the vicinity of the phone, besides hacking all the security features of the phone, including listening to and sending passwords, contact lists, calendar events, text messages and live voice calls. Former MLA Agnelo Fernandes said that this snooping act is nothing but a dictatorial approach of Modi-led government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/congress-seeks-probein-pegasus-snooping/articleshow/84598337.cms||---

The agricultural assistant rank holders association alleged that PSC has included BSc agriculture graduates in the list while diploma in agriculture and VHSE agriculture were the primary and secondary qualifications as per the notification published in 2016. PSC published two rank lists (List 1 and List 2) in December 2020, in which list 1 features the names of around 740 candidates among which majority are graduates and the remaining are diploma holders. In the list 2, all the 491 candidates are the ones who completed VHSE agriculture. As per reports, there are only 268 vacancies at present. The candidates said that the inclusion of degree holders will affect the probability of diploma holders or VHSE candidates securing the job. Association Idukki district secretary Laila M A, who has figured in the rank list 2, said that PSC considers BSc agriculture as equivalent to diploma in agriculture. “However, Kerala Agricultural University has made it clear in its RTI documents that a degree in agricultural science is not equivalent to an agricultural diploma. Among those figured in the list 1, which gets priority in appointment, 90% are graduates,” she said.  Meanwhile, PSC sources said the commission has the right to include candidates with higher qualification in the absence of enough diploma holders. Kerala Administrative Tribunal has ordered a stay on the rank list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pscs-agri-assistant-rank-list-sparks-controversy/articleshow/84598423.cms||---

The girl, who along with her little sister is presently recuperating at a civic facility, said she was playing with her siblings while her parents who had just finished their lunch had gone to sleep along with her sister. When she heard some shouts outside and came out of her hut, she saw the mass of slush and immediately alerted her father, but he ignored her. “She immediately alerted my brother about the same but he initially ignored her. However, by the time they were woken up to the situation, the slush had already swallowed their hutment burying them inside. Luckily, my two nieces were rescued by alert residents else we would have lost them too,” said her teary-eyed uncle, Avdhesh Yadav, while talking to TOI. The family has now rested the responsibility of the orphaned girls on Avdhesh who works in the fabrication industry. Incidentally, Avdhesh, who stays downhill had alerted the family, two hours before the mishap, to relocate till the rains subside to which the deceased had ignored.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-teen-who-survived-mudslide-saw-it-coming-had-alerted-parents/articleshow/84602339.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Madurai||Take steps to fill up vacancies for addl superintendents in central prisons: HC||Madurai: The Madras high court on Tuesday directed the state to take pragmatic steps at the earliest to fill up the vacancies to the post of additional superintendent of prisons at all central prisons in the state and disposed of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by K R Raja, a social activist from Madurai district.A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that the petitioner has flagged an important issue to fill up vacancies of 24 additional superintendents of prisons and 12 social workers in the central prisons. The petitioner has highlighted the vital role of additional superintendents and as to how the absence of this post would hamper the administrative process.The judges observed that though concern of the petitioner should be treated with utmost seriousness, the court should be conscious of the fact that there may be several reasons for not filling up the posts on a timely basis.The judges observed that drawing of the tentative panel is an exercise which is required to be done by the government. Cases may be filed before the courts for determining the seniority which may also be one of the factors which may delay a recruitment process. Vexatious petitions would also be filed before the courts by unsuccessful candidates.Hence, the judges observed that it would not augur well for the writ court to exercise its jurisdiction in a public interest litigation and dwell into the area concerning the police services.The judges observed that this court is also of the opinion that the vacancies need to be filled up at the appropriate time and the panel for promotion should be made ready well in advance. Unless and until the government approves the panel, promotions cannot be effected.Hence, the judges requested the authorities to look into the matter and bestow their attention so that the posts can be filled up as vacancies not only affects the prison administration but also causes difficulty to the prisoners as they are unable to meet their counsels when they fix the prison visit. Vacancies to the post also cause difficulties when orders are passed for parole and ordinary leave.Considering all these factors, a pragmatic decision should be taken by the state in this regard at the earliest, observed the judges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/take-steps-to-fill-up-vacancies-for-addl-superintendents-in-central-prisons-hc/articleshow/84598326.cms||---

For Erendro’s father L Raghmani Singh, advocate Shadan Farasat pressed for fixing accountability and compensation before a bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah, which asked the Manipur government to file its counter affidavit to petition by Singh within two weeks. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the state, requested the court to give a quietus to the issue and dispose of the petition as Erendro has already been released pursuant to Monday’s order of the SC. However, when the petitioner’s counsel refused to back down from his demand, the SG said then the state would file documents to justify its actions in detaining Erendro and that it had much more to show than detaining him only for social media posts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/activist-looks-for-payout-sc-seeks-manipur-reply/articleshow/84603060.cms||---

As many as 4,00,24,701 vaccines have been administered in the state so far,” said additional chief secretary (health) Dr Pradip Vyas. The total number of citizens who took the first dose is 3,06,99,339, while 93,52,362 are fully vaccinated. “Around 1.2 lakh people were inoculated across the state till Tuesday afternoon and this number may increase till evening,” added Dr Vyas. The state usually vaccinates three to four lakh people daily, but sources said the turnout was less than two lakh on Tuesday because of low availability of vaccines. Even Mumbai, which saw 70,000-plus turnout on Monday, saw only 42,483 on Tuesday. While 14,262 took the free vaccines from BMC centres, 26,257 took the paid vaccine from private centres in the city. However, state officials said that the vaccine drive would continue with the available stock. “We have asked districts with stocks to continue with the vaccination,” said state immunisation officer Dr D Patil. Regarding Maharashtra’s low turnout for Covid vaccination, state director of health services Dr Archana Patil said, “We are giving vaccine as per supply received from the government of India.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-milestone-first-state-to-cross-4-crore-vaccination-mark/articleshow/84598468.cms||---

Stalin said that it has turned out to be an important issue of grave concern to Tamil Nadu, particularly among the coastal districts. “Many provisions in the proposed bill go against the interests of the local fishermen communities and certain clauses infringe upon the rights conferred to the states under the State List of the 7th Schedule of Constitution of India. It appears that the Bill is being moved without adequately addressing the concerns and well-being of Indian fishermen who are traditionally engaged in this for their livelihood for generations,” the CM said. According to the CM, the disturbing clauses in the proposed bill include criminalisation and imprisonment of fishermen, use of force against fishermen, levy of charges and levy of huge penalties. Stalin attributed these clauses have resulted in widespread protests and disquiet. Citing these factors, he urged the Prime Minister not to move the Bill and to also put it across for wider debate and discussions. Appreciating the government’s efforts to protect and preserve the marine ecosystem, he asked the PM to also consider equally important the livelihood and interests of the traditional fishermen are clearly protected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cm-asks-pm-not-to-proceed-with-fishermen-bill/articleshow/84598389.cms||---
---||Goa||BJP is fooling people, not sincere about mining: Cong||Panaji: Congress on Tuesday charged the BJP government of fooling people by making false promises about restarting mining with every approaching election since the past eight years. The party said that the Supreme Court’s dismissal of the mining review petition clearly indicates that BJP was not sincere in restarting mining in Goa. “People should now understand BJP’s real game plan and teach them a lesson,” Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) president Girish Chodankar said. “Former chief minister Manohar Parrikar stopped mining in Goa in 2012 with the sole intention of handing over the mining industry to the crony club of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP,” Chodankar said, adding that the Bahujan Samaj community was the worst affected as many members lost jobs. “BJP government deliberately fooled the people of Goa, giving them false promises of resumption of mining. Today, the dismissal of the review petition by the Supreme Court has vindicated Congress’ stand that the ruling party is playing with the sentiments of the people,” he said. Former union law minister Ramakant Khalap said the apex court’s strongly-worded order exposed the deliberate, misleading and misguiding approach of the BJP government on the mining issue. The Supreme Court, he said, disapproved the way petitioners file the review petitions late, without adhering to the timeline as well as after the retirement of the judges who had given the order. “Such practice must be firmly disapproved to preserve the institutional sanctity of the decision making of this court” the court stated in its order. The strongly-worded order also exposes the legal bankruptcy of the BJP government which doesn’t even know the time limits for approaching the courts,” Khalap said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-is-fooling-people-not-sincere-about-mining-cong/articleshow/84598422.cms||---

The cops said that a few citizens of the city are still undergoing treatment. “We are not planning to convert the Covid hospital into a general one right now. We wish to be prepared for the third wave,” explained an officer. The police hospital — housed in the same old building at Bhowanipore as the old Kolkata Police hospital — will have 40 HDU beds.

He said this in reply to an unstarred question raised by Tuticorin MP Kanimozhi Karunanidhi in the Parliament on Monday. Kanimozhi had asked if the government had started developing the iconic site project and on-site museum in Adichanallur as announced in the budget 2020-21. The minister said that exposition and excavation of selected parts of the site for open air display of trenches and objects presently buried underground would be undertaken wherever required. Kishan added that repairing the boundary wall and construction of public amenities such as toilets, drinking water kiosks, solar powered lights, illumination, souvenir shops, cafeteria, audio-visual guides, public display board, information boards and pathway with tourist circulation are being undertaken at Adichanallur. Reddy also said that it has been decided to reconstitute the ‘committee for holistic study of origin and evolution of Indian culture since 12,000 BP (before present) and its interface with other cultures of the world.’ He said this in his reply to unstarred questions raised by Madurai MP Su Venkatesan in the Parliament on Monday. The minister said the earlier committee that was set up in 2016 only had two meetings -- on January 3 and May 2 , 2017. “While reconstituting the committee, all the suggestions on diversity in membership would be given due consideration,” he added. Venkatesan had asked if the Union government planned to dissolve the 16-member committee that came under criticism for lack of diversity to ensure fair representation with diversity. Venkatesan told reporters on Tuesday that the earlier committee had no representation from south India, northeast India, minorities, dalits and women. The MP raised the issue in the parliament on September 14, 2020. He added that almost all the members of the committee were from the creamy layer of the caste table and from north India. On September 23, a representation for diversity was given to the President of India by 32 MPs from across India. Venkatesan called the minister’s reply on Monday a victory for effort taken by the 32 MPs. However, he said that the intention of the government in this regard should be cautiously monitored and debated. Awareness should be created on the Union government’s efforts to twist history and attack on diversity, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/adichanallur-to-be-made-an-iconic-site/articleshow/84598426.cms||---

Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao directed animal husbandry minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav to make arrangements to distribute 3.5 lakh sheep at the rate of 20 sheep to each Golla Kuruma community beneficiary. The CM said Rs 6,000 crore would be spent on the scheme. The government had spent Rs 5,000 crore in the first phase and distributed 3.74 lakh sheep units. The CM has decided to increase the sheep unit price to Rs 1,75,000 and directed officials that revised price should be implemented for 14,000 eligible candidates, who have already paid their demand drafts. “The sheep distribution scheme for Golla Kurumas and Yadavs and fish distribution programme for Mudiraj community have yielded good results so far. The state has surpassed Rajasthan and became number one in sheep population in the country,” KCR said at a review meeting with officials at Pragati Bhavan on Tuesday. He said agriculture in Telangana region when AP was unified was in a bad shape Former governments had also neglected and destroyed hereditary professions, he said and added that a hereditary occupant’s life was always intertwined with BC communities who have excellent trade skills. He said the state has emerged on top in the dairy sector in the country. For dairy farmers, the government was providing subsidies and extending support in several ways. The state-run Vijaya Dairy and Karimnagar Dairy were working efficiently, he said. He said after agriculture, handloom sector was the largest among hereditary professions. Padmashali community, which was given respect on a par with Brahmins in the past, became a victim of starvation and suicide deaths under united AP rulers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rs-6k-cr-for-sheep-distribution-3-5-lakh-units-in-2nd-phase/articleshow/84602009.cms||Koride Mahesh

The mining sector contributed about 40% to Goa’s economy. Nearly three lakh families that were completely dependant on mining are now finding themselves in even more difficult situations due to the pandemic and the closure of mining in the state of Goa, the party stated, blaming chief minister Pramod Sawant for not restarting mining. "Goa should have mining operations which are sustainable for the long run and are in the interest of the people of Goa and for the benefit of the state economy,” AAP Goa convener Rahul Mhambre said. Despite the state government saying that it would e-auction over 2.6 million tonnes of iron ore lying at jetties to help generate revenue, Sawant, instead of following the judgements of the Supreme Court, filed a review petition which has “further delayed the resumption of the mining sector in Goa,” AAP said. Mhambre also reminded Goans about the Rs 35,000cr mining scam which Congress government was involved and said BJP government till date has failed to recover even a single rupee from the mining scam, failing to follow up on the case or arrest culprits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-says-bjp-govt-to-blame-for-mining-sector-collapse/articleshow/84598449.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Tribal students’ education suffers after school shuts||IDUKKI: As the education department has decided to temporarily shut down the primary school at the first tribal panchayat in Edamalakudy, 124 students are missing out on school education. The officials decided to stop the school from functioning after two Covid-19 cases were reported in the tribal hamlet. Due to the absence of network, power and digital gadgets, students from 24 hamlets in Edamalakudy panchayat reached the Government Tribal LP School at Edamalakudy. According to the education department sources, in the absence of the Covid-19 threat, most students went to school regularly and attended the class through television and from teachers. Saseendra Vyas, deputy director of education, Idukki, told TOI that the school has been closed after the panchayat decided to do so. “The school was shut as a precaution when two Covid-19 cases were reported. In fact, the education department or government has officially not yet opened the school,” said the official. However, Edamalakudy panchayat secretary-in-charge Anish Kumar said that the panchayat committee has not taken any decision to close the school. “The health department has already confirmed that the two people from the tribal hamlet, who tested positive for Covid-19 after visiting Kottayam medical college, and there was no need to panic,” said the official. A senior official in the education department under anonymity said that shutting the school will affect the future education of tribal kids. “Now the students reach the school through a one to two-hour-long walk from distant settlements to attend the classes. Due to the absence of mobile networks and power, online education is not possible here,” said the official. “If we stop their education for a long period, the students in the community will show reluctance in returning to education,” he said. According to the education department sources, after two months of the new academic year, many students from tribal and plantation areas still lack proper digital education. “Of the 1,02,762 school students in the Idukki, over 14,000 students are still facing connectivity issues hindering their online education. The education department and government are trying to provide personal gadgets to all students in the district. But the reality is that the proper network issue is a major problem to conduct the study,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tribal-students-education-suffers-after-school-shuts/articleshow/84596010.cms||Sandeep Thomas

Members of the Vivekanander Street Residents Welfare Association have said that they live in constant fear of contracting diseases due to mosquitoes as they do not have a UGD system and the drains overflow often. R Vasanthi of Adaikalam Pillai Colony said that the area, which started developing in 2002, is still probably the most backward area in the corporation limits. Madurai city is being developed into a smart city, but these wards have no basic amenities and people live in very bad living conditions, especially during the rainy season. People have to wade through rainwater and sewage, said the residents. There are mini sewage tanks in Packiam Street and Abirami Street in ward number 55. These have been here for more than a decade, and are filled with sewage, says V Chitra, a resident. M Manikandan, president of the residents’ welfare association, said that people’s representatives assured us of laying UGDs and drinking water pipes during elections. “They all remain as poll promises,” he said. He said that all of them have septic tanks and the overflowing tanks led to frequent alterations among the residents. “The civic body can at least clean the tanks at a subsidised rate,” they said. Corporation sources said that a scheme had been chalked out for laying UGD system in the northern part of Madurai. This region, which is in the southern part, would be taken up for development in a phased manner. A project report with an estimate of Rs 400 crore would be prepared, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/residents-rue-open-sewers-in-wards-55-54/articleshow/84598452.cms||---

Under this scheme, an elderly citizen can be driven to the nearest KMC-run vaccination centre located in select neighbourhoods for the jab. Instead of entering the centre, the recipient will need to wait in the car till a registration process is over. Once done, the vaccinator from the KMC clinic will administer the shot in the car. According to a KMC health department official, such a drive-in scheme was being held at a mega centre being run at Bhowanipore Education Society. According to the KMC ward coordinator Ashim Bose, who had introduced a vaccination at home scheme and was later barred from carrying on with it, the drive-in vaccination was gaining good response. “Elderly citizens suffering from serious illness, who want to avoid the crowd, are now being given an opportunity to be administered the shot in the car outside the vaccination centres,” Bose said. Bose said people from Chakraberia Road (south), Aston Road, Sarat Bose Road, Elgin Road and Dr. Rajendra Road were taking the advantage of the drive-in vaccination scheme. A doctor’s prescription is a prerequisite for availing this opportunity, that prove that the recipient has a health hazard threat. “Our medical officers in some other select vaccination centres are also using their prudence to decide who is eligible to avail the opportunity,” said a KMC health department senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/drive-in-vax-for-elderly-citizens/articleshow/84596060.cms||Saikat Ray

Then we sent a request to the chief minister and the food and agricultural ministers who agreed to our proposal."

The Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) has decided to allot plots to successful allottees in another scheme named Amirt Kunj-2 in zone-12.

In the scheme, 1,417 plots were developed, out of which allotments were made for 1,182. The remaining corner plots were held back for auction. An official said, “As colony was falling under the catchment area, 733 plot owners were not provided with allotment.” The Amrit Kunj scheme was in some controversy since its inception.

Speaking to reporters after a review meeting with revenue officials of Madurai, Theni and Dindigul district on Tuesday, Ramachandran said that the rules laid down by the former AIADMK government, for obtaining the pension, had made it difficult for many people to get the pension. “There are people who have children (sons), which makes them ineligible for the OAP, but in reality these children do not take care of the parents and they need some financial support. So, we are trying to find a solution to it,” he said. Sources from the revenue department said that there were already more than 5,000 petitions for old age pension pending in Madurai district alone, of which one-third are eligible, but till date the lack of funds forced them them to enroll new beneficiaries only after the death of an existing beneficiary. Earlier, it was specified that people applying for these benefits should come under the below poverty line (BPL) category, but this is no longer mandatory, as identifying BPL category people in villages was easy but not in the city. The previous AIADMK government had said that old people who had children could be given the pension, even if they had sons but did not take care of the parents, but this was not issued as a circular. Sources said that till date there were many cases in which very rich people were benefiting from the OAP scheme in the state and real beneficiaries are not able to get due to lack of funds. The pension is denied if the elderly are found to be residing with their sons. “But, sometimes we have the sons themselves walking in and telling us that their mothers had not got last month’s pension,” said an official. The minister said that 14,567 petitions of the revenue department received under the Ungal Thoguthiyil Mudalammaicher in the region had been discussed. Action had been taken on 5,000 of these petitions and officials were asked to dispose of the remaining petitions at the earliest. The minister also said that the files pending for long for the expansion of the Madurai airport were reviewed by him and minister for finance P T R Palanivel Thiagarajan. Minister for commercial taxes P Moorthy, minister for cooperatives I Periyasamy and minister Thiagarajan were also present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/govt-plans-to-relax-norms-for-oap-min/articleshow/84598489.cms||---

Smita Zagade, deputy commissioner, told TOI that all the manpower in the tax department would be diverted for this special drive. “In our earlier survey this year, we had identified a few unassessed properties on the campuses of some big companies, which owe huge tax. We have received information that there are many other companies, which also have similar unassessed properties,” she said. According to Zagade, there is a possibility of many structural changes on the campuses and this could provide good scope for revenue generation. Hence, all the staff members would be deployed for the drive, she said. “We are identifying the areas and teams are being formed accordingly,” she said, adding that this was the first time they would be conducting such a drive in the industries. “We got to know that one of the major companies has unassessed construction of over 1 lakh square feet on their campus, while another company has reportedly constructed a club house, which needs to be regularised,” she said. Zagade said that all the companies or factories must take prior permission from the civic body before constructing new structures and all the necessary permissions from the respective departments, including the fire brigade. If they do not take permission and construct buildings, it would be deemed illegal, she said. Zagade said in a survey done earlier around 19,438 unassessed properties were identified in the twin towns, which are liable to pay property tax. Notices have been sent to the owners, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-to-inspect-over-3k-factories-for-unassessed-properties/articleshow/84598477.cms||Piyush Bhusari

According to the orange alert issued by the Met centre, medium landslides and rock falls are likely to occur at isolated places in the hills and vulnerable places on Wednesday. People were advised to be cautious and take shelter during thunderstorms and lightning. Besides, people residing near rivulets and streams have been advised to remain alert. Three people were killed while three others injured and one is still reported missing following a cloudburst in Uttarkashi district late on Sunday. Another incident of cloudburst occurred in Tehri district causing severe damages to houses. In the past 24 hours, Haldwani recorded the maximum 230mm rainfall, Nainital 110mm, Khatima 100mm, Devprayag 90mm, Champawat 80mm, Kashipur 70mm and Haridwar recorded 50mm rain. Meanwhile, the regional meteorological centre has forecast improvement in weather from July 21 onwards with light to moderate showers likely to occur at many places in the state. Over 125 roads -- mainly village link roads -- are still blocked, while all four Char Dham highways, which also got blocked on Monday following incessant rainfall, were opened for traffic on Tuesday. Meanwhile, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who was set to visit Kedarnath on Tuesday, cancelled his trip and chaired a meeting of senior state officials and district magistrates to review disaster preparedness in the state. During a video conferencing session, Dhami directed the officials to stay alert and ensure proper coordination between various government departments to facilitate smooth rescue and relief operations in the event of any calamity. He said, “In the wake of any natural calamity, relief and rescue operations should be conducted at the earliest and the response time should be minimized. There should be no negligence anywhere. When necessary, use helicopters so that relief and rescue is not delayed. People should understand that the administration is with them.” He added that any issue should be resolved at the grassroots level itself to avoid pendency. “Zero pendency should be the mantra.” The CM also noted that mock drills are must to ensure proper disaster preparedness and to handle emergencies more effectively. He said, “Mock drills should be done from time to time. The disaster control room should always remain active. Steps should be taken to restore blocked roads, and repair damaged power and drinking water lines at the earliest. Also, the affected people should be paid compensation immediately and have access to safe accommodation, food, drinking water and medicines.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/landslide-warning-in-hills-as-rains-continue-to-lash-ukhand/articleshow/84593850.cms||Gaurav Talwar

The defence spokesperson said the utilization of drones is governed by guidelines issued and amended by the Ministry of Home Affairs on a regular basis. Approval to operate a drone can be obtained from the Director General Civil Aviation (DGCA) via the DigitalSky website (digitalsky.dgca.gov.in) and a copy of the letter is to be submitted, one week prior to the scheduled flight, to the WNC headquarters. Without an approval, the Indian Navy will confiscate or destroy drones found in restricted areas and the operators would be liable for prosecution under the relevant provisions of law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-navy-orders-3km-drone-no-fly-zone/articleshow/84598545.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Lohiyanagar becomes second slum to get ‘near-home’ vaccine site||PUNE: After the Harkanagar slum in Kasewadi, residents of Lohiyanagar — another Bhavani Peth slum pocket — are set to get a near-home Covid vaccination centre. The pocket was a hotspot when the pandemic began. The centre, working out of the Savitribai Phule Memorial auditorium, will be ready by Friday (July 24), officials said. There are at least 10,000 small dwellings scattered across six slum pockets within the Bhavani Peth ward, according to Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) records. So far, an estimated 50 to 70% of residents have been partially vaccinated (first dose). The area has 16 free vaccination centres at PMC-run hospitals, dispensaries or schools. Officials said the near-home centre is just another way to reach out to those who haven't been able to reach the vaccination centres. Overall, the PMC hopes to cover more than 4.6 lakh residents, living across the city's 390 slum pockets, over the next two months. Swift coverage in these densely populated neighbourhoods has been a priority for the civic body. “It is herd mentality that is prominently at play when it comes to vaccinating the city’s congested hutments. So, we do not see much of a challenge. In fact, if we get more doses, we can vaccinate more,” said ward medical officer Sarang Kalekar. The PMC’s staff vaccinated 550 slum dwellers at Harkanagar last week. “In Lohiyanagar, we aim to vaccinate those who have not reached vaccination centres by holding the camp near their homes on July 24,” Kalekar said. Activists have stressed on rapid vaccination of slum dwellers. “It is prudent to step to vaccinate them on priority as infection among them can spread quickly,” said healthcare activist Sanjeev Dabhade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lohiyanagar-becomes-2nd-slum-to-get-near-home-vaccine-site/articleshow/84598512.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: Vaigai’s water level rising, second flood warning likely||MADURAI: Rains in the catchment resulted in water level in the Vaigai dam increasing and with the first flood warning already in effect, the second flood warning is expected to be issued by Wednesday morning. The southern districts have been experiencing rains intermittently for the past few days, and the climate has remained cloudy. In Theni district, the catchments of the major dams received moderate to heavy rainfall, resulting in the inflow to the dams increasing. Vaigai dam’s water level has hovered at around 65ft since the first week of June this year and the first flood warning was issued in Theni district twice in the last two months. It was issued on May 27 and now again on July 9, when the dam’s water level crossed the 66ft mark. Water level in the Vaigai dam stood at 68.29ft against its maximum level of 71ft at 8am on Tuesday. The first flood warning is issued for Vaigai river when the dam’s water level crosses 66 feet, the second when it touches 68.5ft and the third at 69 feet. Meanwhile, as the inflow decreased the level did not increase as expected on Tuesday evening. Mullaperiyar dam’s catchments have been receiving heavy rainfall for the past few days resulting in the inflow increasing and it stood at 1717 cusecs on Tuesday. This resulted in the dam’s water level going up to 130.05ft at 8am and 1,200 cusecs was discharged from it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/vaigais-water-level-rising-second-flood-warning-likely/articleshow/84598506.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Despite increased patrolling, leopards attacks account for more than half of the deaths in Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN: The first half of this year has already recorded 27 deaths in man-wildlife conflict incidents, with 14 people, or 51%, dying and 23 injured in leopard attacks, data from the forest department showed. Two of these deaths have occurred in just the last 72 hours in Tehri district. Last year, 31 out of 63 deaths in man-wildlife conflict incidents were attributed to leopard attacks. A total of 65 people had suffered injuries. The state has resorted to increased patrolling in areas with high leopard population as well as radio-collaring the animals. It even has plans to send some maneaters to sanctuaries in Gujarat. Between 2000-2020, 75 leopards have been declared maneaters in Uttarakhand. In the past five years alone, 27 maneaters have been put down, according to the forest department. The scientists of Wildlife Institute of India are going to give their report on the behavioural changes in the leopards of Uttarakhand for implementing conflict mitigation measures. Almost 75% deaths are of females as mostly they go out in the fields for collecting fodder, grazing cattle or to relieve themselves early in the morning or late evening when the leopards are mostly on prowl as per the chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand forest department, JS Suhag, who is monitoring the field situation. Uttarakhand is highly riddled with the problem of human-leopard conflict and its latest evidence is killing of a man-eater leopard in Devprayag on Tuesday evening by three shooters’ team. The animal had killed a women in Durogi Hindolakhal this morning while another women of Chaam village was mauled to death by the leopard on Sunday. The operation to terminate the leopard remained tricky as the entire area had full-grown bushes and rainspell were wreaking havoc in the area. “Both the women were brutally killed by the man-eater leopard, these animals have frequently started moving around human habitation and this has to be stopped on priority in Uttarakhand else people will abandon their villages due to rising conflicts with wild animals,” said Magan Singh Bisht, former block head, Devprayag. TOI sources in the department disclosed that this year as many as ‘5’ leopards have already been declared and killed after being tagged ‘problem leopards’ in the state after they attacked and killed villagers. The expert scientists are now going to evaluate the behaviour of these wild cats, “We have already shared our leopard data for the ‘behavioural study’ of the leopards to the Wildlife Institute of India based on that we will try to find out solution to reduce this problem,” said JS Suhag, chief wildlife warden, Uttarakhand forest department. And, almost two dozen (23) people were brutally injured in the human-leopard conflict out of 64 cases of brutal injuries that had happened in the past 6.5 months. 7 people were brutally injured by the leopard in Pauri forest division followed by 3 each in Lansdowne and Pithoragarh forest division in the same time span. Incidentally, Uttarakhand has resorted to radio-collaring leopards as well as increasing patrolling of the sensitive areas; however, the negative interaction of leopards and humans continues. Previous year also, the state lost 31 human lives to leopard attacks out of the total 63 deaths caused due to human-wildlife conflict from January till December 31st, 2020. State has plans of sending away its excess leopards to Gujarat however, the exercise is yet to see the daylight. Laying stress upon controlling the leopard attacks JS Suhag, told to TOI, “Leopard’s favourite food is a dog and they are mostly found around human habitation. The human-leopard conflict is prevalent pan-India be it Rajasthan or Maharashtra or Madhya Pradesh. We can not completely eliminate this problem but we can always minimize it by increasing visibility in the forest fringe villages by cutting big bushes, installing solar lights and providing more toilets inside the houses to the villager. But to say that it can be completely eliminated from the roots will be incorrect,” While remaining 13 human deaths have been attributed to negative interactions with the venomous snakes (6), Elephant (4), Tigers (2) and Wild Pig (1) as per the data. The latest forest department data, accessed by TOI, reveals that the majority of these casualties took place in Terai East (8), Pithoragarh (5), Almora (3), Pauri (3) and Lansdowne (3) forest divisions from January till date. 2 people were killed in Kedarnath Wildlife Forest Sanctuary forest division followed by 1 each death in Narendernagar forest division, Rjajai Tiger Reserve and Ramanagr Tiger Reserve Forest Division.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/despite-increased-patrolling-use-of-radio-collars-on-leopards-big-cat-attacks-account-for-more-than-half-of-the-deaths-in-man-wildlife-conflict-incidents-in-ukhand/articleshow/84593849.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Kochi||Kerala's market borrowings dip by a third||KOCHI: Although, the reimposition of lockdown across states since the start of FY22 has resulted in the loss of economic output and thereby income for the government, the borrowings by the majority of the state governments, including Kerala, thus far have been lower than that in the comparable period of FY21 which was also a period of lockdown and restrictions, says a report from CARE Ratings. “When compared with a year ago (April-July), 14 states have either borrowed less or not borrowed at all. In case of Kerala, it is 33% lower and for Tamil Nadu it is 21% less than year ago. Borrowings by Gujarat has been 19% less than last year and that of Punjab and Maharashtra has each been 14% lower. Karnataka has not raised funds from the market thus far in FY22. This is a notable change from a year ago when the states had raised Rs 12,000 crore during the comparable period,” the report said. Kerala had borrowed Rs 13,430 crore during the period April 7-July 21, 2020, in comparison with Rs 9,000 crore borrowed during April 9-July 19, 2021, a decline of 33%. Among the major states, the year-on-year borrowings have been higher for Uttar Pradesh (by 67%), West Bengal (17%), Telangana(14%) and Rajasthan (6%). Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have been the top five borrowing states so far in FY22, accounting for around 60% of the total borrowings. On Monday, six states raised a total of Rs 8,700 crore at the auction of the state government securities or state development loans (SDLs). Haryana did not accept any amount of Rs 1,000 crore notified amount of the auction. The other states accepted the notified amount of the auction. The borrowing cost for the state governments at Monday’s auction declined marginally when compared with a week ago. It nevertheless was sustained at elevated levels. The weighted average cost of borrowing for the state governments through the auction of dated securities; across states and tenures was 6.96%, 3bps lower than that at the auctions held a week ago. This declined could be attributed to the easing of the global crude oil prices following the major oil producers agreeing over the weekend to boost oil output, the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/states-market-borrowings-dip-by-a-third/articleshow/84596084.cms||---

They should tell they have tapped the phones of who all, if they have any morality, left,” said Rathore. He said that Gehlot’s OSD Lokesh Sharma released audio-video files to target their opponents. “They have gone to the extent of slapping four FIRs against its own leaders. Recently Congress leader Ved Prakash Solanki alleged that 2-3 MLAs had told him that his phone is being tapped. It shows the character of the Congress party which is facing the allegation of phone tapping is demanding supreme court probe,” said Rathore. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gehlot-should-reveal-details-of-phone-tapping-rathore/articleshow/84600436.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: KEM Hospital dean gets US patent for ‘stent’ that aids weight loss||MUMBAI: Can a device control blood flow in such a way that one loses weight? The head of one of the country’s most prestigious medical schools, KEM Hospital in Parel, recently earned a patent for such a concept from the US Patent Office. Dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh, an interventional radiologist, thought of the device while fixing narrowed blood vessels around the small intestine. Cardiologists fix narrowed vessels around the heart and interventional radiologists are trained to similarly fix vessels in other body parts such as the brain, lungs, legs and the abdomen, among others, to prevent strokes and gangrene. “The self-expanding, blood-flow resisting device we have devised is about an idea taking shape,” Dr Deshmukh, who has performed thousands of interventional procedures. said. “As interventional radiologists, we treat arteries and veins by opening up or closing them as the situation demands,” he said. What is not well known is that plaque buildup not only affects the heart vessels but even the vessels in the abdomen. When the superior mesenteric artery that supplies blood to the small intestine develops blockages, the patient starts suffering from “abdominal angina”. “The patient develops this angina whenever he or she eats. As a result, they develop fear of food and avoid it, leading to 10 to 20kg weight loss,’’ said Dr Deshmukh. Medical literature mentions some such patients develop cibophobia, which is defined as the fear of food. It is this connection between the blocked mesenteric artery, cibophobia and weight loss that he, along with Dr Krantikumar Rathod, worked on. “We felt we can narrow the mesenteric artery in morbidly obese people by introducing a stent-like device would trigger weight loss,” he said. The narrowed artery induces cibophobia, which, in turn, leads to weight loss. The doctors applied for the patent in April, 2016, and got it earlier this month. The device they designed is 8mm in diameter, shaped like an hour glass, and is 15-20mm long. “We now have to devise the delivery system, make prototypes and plan animal studies,” he said. These steps need to be followed before human trials. A senior surgeon whom TOI spoke to said deliberately narrowing an artery with a device could trigger clots. “As morbidly obese people usually have diabetes or hypertension, introducing such a device needs to be well thought out,” said a bariatric surgeon who didn’t want to be identified. Another doctor said an idea that sounds good on paper may not always work in practice.Dr Deshmukh said the device, cited in the patent document with an “objective of obesity reduction”, could be used as a bridge treatment before morbidly obese patients undergo weight-reduction bariatric surgery. “It will help them lose 10-20kg within a few weeks and it can be removed thereafter,’ he added. The team is also studying its utility in managing cardiac disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/kem-dean-gets-us-patent-for-stent-that-aids-weight-loss/articleshow/84600423.cms||Malathy Iyer

Officials said the badly damaged railings will be replaced and the other railings refixed after minor rectifications. The median railings are broken in certain stretches after vehicles rammed into them during road mishaps, officials said. At many places the road median railing were corroded, the earlier surface colour paint having rubbed off. Authorities had taken up work to paint the railing to provide a protective layer along with giving a fresh clean look. Some paint work was also done on the roadside stone kerbs. To make up for the green cover loss post cyclone Amphan last year, authorities had also conducted a tree plantation and greenery drive on a 7-km long stretch of the road median divider. KMDA has also been periodically conducting patch work of the EM Bypass stretch where potholes had developed during the monsoon season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/em-bypass-median-railings-to-be-repaired/articleshow/84596097.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Cabral stated that he’s ready for a debate with the power minister of Delhi, turning down a debate with AAP’s national spokesperson Raghav Chadha. Kickstarting the party’s election campaign in Goa, Kejriwal last week promised to waive off all pending power dues and provide free electricity for agricultural purposes. Cabral reacting to Kejriwal had stated that Goa government provides subsidised power to all and that it doesn’t seek to take loans to provide free electricity.

Dotasra told reporters here that his party workers will lay siege to the state Raj Bhavan over the issue on Thursday. “An inquiry should be conducted by the Supreme Court into the matter. Home minister Amit Shah should be sacked and an inquiry into the role of the PM should be conducted,” Dotasra demanded in an interaction with reporters at the party office here. He alleged that phones of several leaders, including former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje, were tapped and this cannot be done only at the level of the home minister. “The home minister cannot take this step without the involvement of the prime minister. An illegal, anti-national act has been committed by them, which is very unfortunate and their real character, face and lies have been exposed,” he said. “The constitutional bodies like Election Commission, the Supreme Court, former chief ministers of his own party's government were not spared. Those who became ministers in their cabinet were also spied upon. Leaders of major opposition parties were not spared,” said Dotasra adding that the unity and integrity of the country is in danger. The state education minister said there is strong resentment among the public across the country against such “anti-national” people with “dictator-like” tendencies. “They have not spared anyone. They spied on their own leaders, conspiring to finish off the opposition. The truth behind dropping the ministers in the recent cabinet reshuffle should also come out in the open,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pegasus-row-cong-seeks-shah-sacking-probe-against-modi/articleshow/84600474.cms||---

Interacting with party rank and file from Khammam district, Sharmila wanted to know if chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao does not consider lives of unemployed youth important. “The state government does not have empathy for the unemployed youth,” she said. She said parents of students were worried as the latter were resorting to suicides due to lack of jobs. She said the parents were anguished over the fate of their children. “The youth are frustrated as they do not have jobs,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/increase-job-eligibility-by-7-yrs-sharmila/articleshow/84602014.cms||---

The arrested man and the beauty parlour employee were not acquaintances. But both were tenants of the booked landlord, police said. Sub-inspector Shivaji Jadhav of the Hadapsar police said on Tuesday, “The arrested suspect procured the cellphone number of the parlour’s woman employee from the landlord and started sending her obscene messages on a social networking site. He also called her for meeting him in person so that he could take her out for a party.” Jadhav said, “After getting constant calls and deluge of messages, the woman and one of her friends met the man and sought the reasons for troubling her. The man told her that her landlord had shared her number. He threatened her and her friend with dire consequences after she asked him to maintain distance from her.” The woman later registered a complaint related to sexual harassment, stalking and criminal intimidation under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. “We have arrested the suspect based on the information from the woman. The landlord, also named in the FIR for sharing her cellphone number without seeking her consent, will be arrested at the earliest,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-held-on-charge-of-sexually-harassing-stalking-beauty-parlor-employee/articleshow/84598552.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||I finally found time for art and craft||When the lockdown hit, I didn’t know what to do. Initially I spent all my time cooped up at home. But gradually I decided I should take advantage of this lockdown and started engaging myself with online classes and interesting activities. Before the lockdown my daily schedule was always stable -- go to school, come back, complete my homework and then go to bed. But after the lockdown my schedule changed drastically. Since I had enough leisure time, I devoted it to doing various art and craft work, as this activity always pulled me towards it for the intense amount of creativity that was needed. I indeed learnt to cook many mouthwatering dishes like cakes from my mother who usually was busy before the lockdown. I even picked up gardening during these days and sowed seeds of different plants. Soon, tomatoes, bitter gourd, chillies were readily available in our little garden. I also discovered that a lot could be learnt from the internet. But just when I thought I had it under control, the second wave of Covid-19 hit India and my whole family including myself got affected. It threw me off for a while, but I emerged stronger from inside and my will power increased a lot as I slowly yet steadily recovered from the virus. I learnt to be optimistic and not pessimistic.

---||Jamshedpur||Saryu Rai demands action against Bokaro Steel Plant for ‘polluting’ Damodar||BOKARO: Jamshedpur East MLA Saryu Rai has raised concerns over the condition of pollution in Damodar river, accusing Bokaro Steel Plant (BSL) of callously discharging its effluents into the waterbody posing health hazards to local population dependent on the river, considered as one of the lifelines in this part of the state. On Monday, he met with Union minister of steel RCP Singh in Delhi to draw his attention and demand action against BSL. Rai, who is the president of Damodar Bachao Andolan, also showed photographs of the current condition of river to the minister. The pictures depicted how the colour of the water has turned red. He also showed pictures of the discharge of effluents through BSL’s canal flowing into the river. Rai said, “I have also shown photos to the steel minister, in which, it is clearly visible how Damodar’s water is turning red due to contaminated acidic effluents of BSL. I told the minister that after the continuous efforts of Damodar Bachao Andolan, the industrial units located on the banks of Damodar controlled releasing their effluents in river in the last 15 years but violations have again started taking place.” He maintained that sustained efforts to save Damdoar river from industrial abuse since 2004 helped in its cleansing in 2018 as a result of which local residents were again able to use the water for domestic purposes. But BSL management’s disregard to its earlier agreement of zero discharge of its effluents is posing problem. He said, “One of the drains of BSL got closed in 2018. BSL promised zero discharge from the second drain by December 2019. But BSL broke it promises and is again discharging its polluted effluent into Damodar.” Responding to the allegations, BSL’s chief of communication Manikant Dhan said, “Zero liquid discharge system has been installed in BSL. In outfall-1, this system was installed in January 2018 and it is fully functional. In outfall-2, this system was installed last year and its trial was done for the first time on August 11, 2020.” He added, “Since then the system installed in Outfall-2 is also working but it is currently in the stabilization stage. The water used in the plant is treated and recycled again for use in the plant itself by the effluent treatment plants (ETP) installed at both the outfalls. Sometimes due to technical reasons, ETP in Outfall-2 has to be shut down for short period for testing and trial but even then 100% treatment of the water is ensured. Water quality testing is done twice a day in the plant’s lab and also through third party labs accredited by NABL. Also, 24x7 real-time monitoring of post-treatment quality of water discharged outside is carried out.” Damodar is considered a lifeline of Jharkhand. Several major industries, including power and steel plant are situated on either side of it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/saryu-demands-action-against-bsl-for-polluting-damodar/articleshow/84597599.cms||Divy Khare
---||Ranchi||Ensure locals get jobs at Deoghar AIIMS: Jharkhand CM tells Union health minister||RANCHI: Chief minister Hemant Soren has sought intervention of the Union government to ensure local natives of the state get duly employed at AIIMS Deoghar. In a letter to Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Monday night, the CM cited that more than 90% of the security personnel employed at the site are from outside the state. He said that the state government is committed to provide jobs to locals and have also come up with the Jharkhand State Employment of Local Candidates Bill, 2021, mandating 75% reservation to locals in private sector jobs with a salary of up to Rs 30,000. Following the letter, BJP Godda MP Nishikant Dubey on Tuesday accused Soren of playing politics over the ‘local-outsider’ issue but said the chief minister remains indifferent towards operationalisation of the out-patient department (OPD) of the AIIMS, whose inauguration has been delayed due to petty politics. Dubey said, “If the chief minister is serious towards ensuring recruitment of locals, he should have come forward with the details of candidates recruited for the house-keeping and other services at the CM House first.” He further claimed that majority of the recruits hired by the respective outsourcing companies for different services in Rims or any other hospitals of the state including Dumka based Phulo Jhano Medical College and Hospital (PJMCH) were so called outsiders. “The fact is the chief minister always has problems with AIIMS or any other landmark projects that have come up in my constituency,” Dubey said. Notably, the formal inauguration of Deoghar AIIMS OPD, which was scheduled earlier this month was deferred owing to the issue of in-person presence of Dubey at the inaugural venue. The district administration had objected to the gathering during the inauguration citing Covid-19 norms. After which, the Centre postponed the inauguration to a later date, which is yet to be announced. AIIMS Deoghar director Saurabh Varshney could not be contacted for his comments on the points raised by the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ensure-locals-get-jobs-at-deoghar-aiims-cm-tells-union-health-min/articleshow/84597535.cms||---

While Congress announced on Tuesday announced to take out a protest march to the Raj Bhavan on July 22 demanding a Supreme Court-appointed judicial inquiry into the report and resignation of Union home minister Amit Shah, the opposition BJP accused the parties raking up the issue of trying to derail the monsoon session of Parliament with a concocted story. Addressing media persons here, state Congress president and finance minister Rameshwar Oraon said, “Following directions from our party high command, we, too, have decided to hit the streets to safeguard the rights and privacy of our countrymen.” He further said, “On Thursday, all wings of the state Congress will take out a protest march to the Raj Bhavan to demand the ouster of Union home minister Amit Shah and initiate an inquiry into the report by an entity no less than a Supreme Court-appointed authority.” He added that the Pegasus Project, a report by an international conglomerate of media houses, is an exposé that “reveals the extension of the continued attempts by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government to violate all constitutional provisions and rights of an individual in this country”. Key ruling alliance partner and Congress ally in the state, JMM, had on Monday demanded a joint parliamentary probe into the report while coming down heavily at the BJP-led Union government. The tribal party had also cast doubts on the dropping of Ravi Shankar Prasad as the Union IT minister during the recent reshuffle, claiming that the development must have links to the Pegasus snooping case. Meanwhile, speaking to reporters at a separate press conference, former chief minister and BJP leader Babulal Marandi termed the ongoing controversy as part of the opposition and anti-Modi camp’s “tool kit” to defame the country. He said, “Congress and all anti-Modi forces are used to such cheap tricks to try and derail the country’s progress and defame the nation. They have been at it for a long time. Even when Modiji was the chief minister of Gujarat, Congress ran such unsubstantiated campaigns against him, but he grew much stronger and went on to become the prime minister of the country. “In recent years, renewed attempts were made one after another to target him and the country. So far, they try to create unrest in society through NRC/CAA, triple talaq, farm bills and so on. The latest issue seems to be a new trick from their failed armoury,” Marandi added. Union IT minister Ashwani Vaishnaw had on Monday rubbished the report dubbing it as an attempt to malign the country ahead of the commencement of the Lok Sabha session. Many other leaders of the BJP-led government, including Shah, reacted on similar lines but the impasse in Parliament continued on the second consecutive day on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/pegasus-fallout-cong-plans-protest-march-to-raj-bhavan/articleshow/84597643.cms||ASRP Mukesh

SDM Sandeep Kumar Meena along with officials from the district administration made a spot visit at the centres and took stock of the problems faced by beneficiaries. Notably, due to the irregular supply of vaccines across the state including Jamshedpur, people anyway faced a lot of problems in availing their doses. And, on top of it, some vaccine centres suffered from inadequate infrastructure. Sharing her experience, Namita Chattopadhyay (76), an elderly woman who got her second dose of Covishield from Ramjanamnagar centre in the city in the recent past, said: “I had to go to the centre at 8am and wait till 12.15pm to get my dose. All the while I had to wait in the open under the scorching sun.” She added: “Taking pity on my condition, a couple there gave me their umbrella.” Namita said that even drinking water facility was not available at the centre. Like Namita, several others have complained that at many centres there were no proper arrangements for beneficiaries. Many also pointed out there were hardly any sitting arrangements and the long queues at the centres made a mockery of social distancing rules. In the past there have been several instances where beneficiaries have ransacked several centres protesting against mismanagement. There have also been accusations of corruption against vaccine centre staff. Taking note of the problems, the district administration has decided to shift some of the centres. At the new centres, adequate arrangements have been made for providing a comfortable waiting area and drinking water facility, among others. The SDM said that civil defence volunteers in adequate numbers would be put on duty at each centre so that they can help the beneficiaries to maintain social distance. Meena further said separate queues will be there for senior citizens and pregnant women beneficiaries so that they do not face any hassles at the centre. He said Dathkidi centre would be shifted to Andhra Association School, Ramjanamnagar to Kerala Public School (Kadma), Seva Sadan Sonari centre will be shifted to Carmel Convent School and Birsanagar Zone 5 to Gyandeep School.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/lack-of-amenities-forces-e-sbhum-to-change-some-vaccine-centres/articleshow/84597508.cms||Debasish Chatterjee

The Santrampur police said that Kali Sangada has been changing her statements and isn’t cooperating with the investigators. Sangada was produced before a local court on Tuesday and was remanded to police custody for four days. “She says she doesn’t remember the identity of the girl who was seen in the video. Sangada has maintained that the girl was unmarried and she had a miscarriage. The girl’s family brought her to Sangada to clean her womb,” said P Bhoi, Santrampur police inspector. Bhoi added that Sangada isn’t co-operating in the investigations. “She initially said that doctors at the hospital where she worked told her to help the girl. And then changed her statement and said that she did the act on her own for some money. Our focus is on tracking down the girl seen in the video,” Bhoi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/nurse-keeps-changing-her-statements-cops/articleshow/84594951.cms||---

Two other patients admitted in the wards have also died. There were at least four others whom we managed to resuscitate at that point, but they died of the complications caused by oxygen shortage minutes later,” said Dr S C L Gupta, the hospital’s medical director. Reacting to Batra Hospital deaths, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said: “This news is very painful. Their lives could have been saved by giving them oxygen on time. Give Delhi its quota of oxygen. Can’t watch our people dying like this anymore.” In another tweet on June 25, after BJP accused the Delhi government of exaggerating the city’s oxygen demand, he said: “People have lost their dear ones because of shortage of oxygen. Do not call them liars, they are feeling very bad.”  Goa: According to TOI reports, at least 83 people died due to oxygen-related issues between May 11 and 15, maximum deaths (26) on the first day. On May 11, Goa health minister Vishwajit Rane said: “Due to interrupted supply of oxygen, we feel that between 2am and 6am many people are dying in Goa Medical College and Hospital… On one day, the requirement was about 1,200 cylinders but 400 cylinders were received.” Hearing several PILs, Bombay high court remarked that material placed before it established that some patients succumbed for want of oxygen supply.  Karnataka: As many as 24 patients died in Chamrajanagar district on May 2 and 3 after acute oxygen depletion levels. A panel formed by the Karnataka high court concluded that in fact 36 patients, and not 24, had died due to oxygen shortage. The lack of buffer stock of medical oxygen in the district led to acute shortage resulting in the deaths, the report by the HC panel had said. Compensation so far given to 24 patients.  Andhra Pradesh: According to reports in TOI, 45 Covid patients died from shortage of oxygen in the state in May, but state government admitted only 23 such deaths. All deaths reported from Rayalaseema region. On June 28, govt admitted before HC that 23 people had died at the Ruia hospital, a government institution, in Tirupati. Government pleader told the high court that the deaths were due to delay in the arrival of the oxygen tanker.  Haryana: Government ordered probe into at least 19 deaths which had occurred due to oxygen shortage between April 5 and May 1. These were reported from Virat Hospital in Rewari (4), Kathuria Hospital in Gurgaon (4), Soni Burn Hospital in Hisar (5) and Kriti Hospital in Gurgaon (6)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-least-195-deaths-from-5-states-blamed-on-shortage-of-oxygen/articleshow/84603084.cms||---

In India, aglobal study suggests, almost 1.2 lakh children lost one of their parents — 25,000 lost their mother and 90,751 lost their father — and at least 12 children lost both their parents. According to the study, published in The Lancet, one of the top medical journals, there was an 8.5-fold increase in the number of children orphaned (43,139) in April 2021 compared to March 2021 (5,091) in India. Kids who have lost a parent or caregiver are at risk of profound short- and long-term adverse effects on their health, safety and wellbeing, such as increased risk of disease, physical abuse, sexual violence and adolescent pregnancy. Dr Susan Hillis, one of the lead authors of the study, from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says: “For every two Covid deaths worldwide, one child is left behind to face the death of a parent or caregiver. Our findings highlight the urgent need to prioritise these children and invest in services to protect and support them.” Study author Professor Lucie Cluver, Oxford University, UK, and the University of Cape Town, South Africa, says: “We have strong evidence from HIV and Ebola to guide solutions. We need to support extended families or foster families to care for children. And we need to respond fast because every 12 seconds a child loses their caregiver to Covid.” Before this report, there were no global figures to quantify how many kids have been affected by the loss of a caregiver during the Covid-19 pandemic, either directly (due to the virus) or indirectly (due to another condition that was exacerbated due to the pandemic). The study’s researchers developed mathematical models using the best available data as an initial attempt to estimate the magnitude of this hidden impact of the pandemic on children||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/1-2l-kids-lost-at-least-one-parent-to-the-pandemic/articleshow/84603123.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Over a six month period, more than 93,000 primary school students in Goa are expected to be given eggs as part of their supplementary nutrition once schools reopen for physical classes. The state had proposed to introduce eggs in the midday meal scheme during the last academic year, but as schools remained shut due to the pandemic, the implementation could not take place. Instead, students’ families were provided dry rations in lieu of midday meals during 2020-21. The funds for the addition to the midday meal diet were recently approved at a meeting conducted by officials of the Union education ministry held to review the scheme’s implementation in Goa. This supplementary nutrition will be provided over and above the existing midday meal being served in the state. The Union government will contribute 60% of the funds, while Goa government will put in 40% of the share in the Rs 1.1 crore required to implement the addition to the midday meal. Many other states are already supplementing the midday meal with eggs, milk and fruits. The Goa government too, had considered serving fruits some years ago through the horticulture corporation, but plans fizzled out as retaining the freshness of the fruit till the time it reached the student had posed challenges. Now, students will get an egg as part of their midday meal, which, until now, only saw vegetarian meals being served in Goa. In previous reviews , Goa had been asked to consider adding supplementary nutrition to the meals, like milk, eggs or fruits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-midday-meal-budget-hiked-by-over-1-crore-to-add-an-egg-to-diet-plan/articleshow/84597077.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

The 700-metre spit – an L-shaped tongue of sand - which had formed with sand deposition over the years, was broken by Cyclone Tauktae in mid-May to open a new 15-metre access for the river. The turbulent tidal action has largely flattened the sand bar, leaving a small stretch with some vegetation on the southern Mashem stretch. “It is no longer a sand bar now as it is cut and spread out. If there is a cyclone, the remnants of the sand bar will be further cut, opening a wider access for the sea,” senior geographer and environmentalist F M Nadaf, said. With the protection of the sand barrier gone, settlements in low-lying areas and large swathes of mangroves face a threat. Nadaf, who had studied the Canacona disaster of October 2, 2009 with geologist Joseph S R D’Souza after the taluka’s rivers burst their banks, suggested mitigation measures to minimise erosion at the spot. “A rubble mound seawall with suitable netting, the type erected on the adjoining Talpona beach, is needed on a temporary basis to protect the 100-metre sand bar remnant on the Galgibaga side,” Nadaf said. Various options should be considered, Hector Fernandes, a geologist, said. “This is a natural phenomenon which has impacted the geomorphological setting of the area and planners need to consider this coastal eco-fragile micro-zone for any future planning by taking into account the experiences of past flooding and factors that lead to erosion in extreme weather events,” he said.  “We are examining the matter to work out modalities,” P Badami, chief engineer of the WRD, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/erosion-at-galgibaga-river-mouth-needs-mitigation/articleshow/84597147.cms||Paul Fernandes

However, the decision should be considered only after all the staff — teaching and non-teaching — are vaccinated and depending on the public health situation of any particular district, Bhargava said. “Children can handle viral infection better than adults. Moreover, it has been seen that young children have lower numbers of ACE2 receptors in their lung cells. However, the antibody exposure we have seen in this sero survey among children is very similar to adults." "Some countries, especially Scandinavian countries, did not shut down primary schools at all. So once India starts considering, it is wise to open primary schools first and then secondary, and that too when all staff including teachers, drivers etc are fully vaccinated,” Bhargava said. According to the findings of the fourth national sero survey, over half the kids of 6-17 years showing presence of antibodies. The sero-positivity was 57.2% in the 6-9 years age group, whereas 61.6% in the 10-17 years age groups showed presence of antibodies. On the other hand, the overall prevalence of 67.6% with 66.7% showing presence of antibodies in the age group of 18-44 years and over 75% in the higher age brackets. Highlighting that the situation may differ from state to state, officials said the decision to start schools need to be taken at the district level depending on their positivity rate, vaccination status and public health situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kids-handle-virus-better-open-primary-schools-first-icmr/articleshow/84603160.cms||---
---||Goa||Conservation network seeks reference to sand mining in draft coastal plan||Margao: Goa River Sand Protectors’ Network has demanded that until all reports of the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) and the Goa State Biodiversity Board on Goa’s tidal rivers are submitted to the government, the ban on sand mining should continue to be in force and that the Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) should contain a statement to that effect. In their written submission on the CZMP, the network pointed out there was “absolutely no reference to the issue of extraction of sand in Goa’s tidal rivers despite the fact that the activity is taking place in CRZ IV areas and falls squarely within the scope of the draft CZMP”. NIO has been commissioned by the Goa government to do a study of the status and impact of sand mining in all the rivers of Goa. At present only one report has come out, which is a preliminary survey of the Chapora river. The network said that as per the report, “There is no replenishment taking place of the sand in the traditional areas and that, in fact, some of the mined areas are yet to be restored to their original status.” The biodiversity aspect of the report is now under preparation by Goa State Biodiversity Board, The network said that several fishing villages upstream of the river, like Amona, Volvoi and Akhada and St Estevam, are not shown in the CZMP as required by law “since residents of fishing villages are entitled to not just livelihoods, but also to right to raise dwellings, etc, in CRZ areas, which extend up to 100m on either side of these coastal rivers.” Stating that indiscriminate sand mining has altered the geomorphology of many rivers, the network in its submission said, “The present activity of sand mining has caused enormous damage to the tidal rivers and their ecology. In several places, islands have disappeared and river banks have collapsed and several more are in danger of doing so.” However, it expressed its disapproval over the absence of any reference to these developments in the CZMP. Further, the network pointed out to the issue of damage to the biodiversity of these areas from the impact of indiscriminate sand mining, and made a case for protection of traditional livelihoods dependent on clam collection. “The traditional fishing industry based on clam collection has almost been destroyed permanently by sand mining, but it is commonly known that proper protection provided to these areas will ensure reversal of some of these trends, which must be part of the CZMP proposals,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/conservation-network-seeks-reference-to-sand-mining-in-draft-coastal-plan/articleshow/84597350.cms||---

Under an innovative project called – Clenoroboflex — Om Prakash Shukla has developed a remote controlled vacuum cleaner with a 15-meter long working range, making it convenient for usage in infectious diseases wards. The device can be operated by a single person and can operate it from a safe distance. The invention has been made for use at the university’s 750-bed Parul Sevashram Hospital. “This distinctive robot is battery operated with two hours of continuous work along with provisions for battery back-up. This extended battery life is significant because a single charge can cover a wider radius and ensures a continuous flow of uninterrupted usage,” said Shukla. It has been made from local materials without the use of any welding and has a body structure of PVC, resulting in very lightweight and battery sustaining. “Since the robot is made of PVC, it can be easily disinfected by standard disinfecting solutions used in hospitals,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/robots-can-help-clean-coronavirus-wards/articleshow/84594974.cms||---

Heavy rain prompted Anjunem dam authorities to discharge excess dam water as the level rose to near capacity. “The water level in the dam as on July 19 is 86.9ms, and it is expected that it will rise up to 89.6m (i.e. 3.6ms below full reservoir level) within a few days, necessitating release of excess water. The excess water in the dam will be routed through Costi Nadi and Valvanti River during low tides,” the water resources department (WRD) has said. There is a possibility of increase in water level in the two rivers. “Villagers are urged to be vigilant while washing clothes, bathing, grazing cattle by the riverside, and avoid crossing the rivers,” WRD said. Similarly, Tillari dam authorities also had no option than to continue discharge of water which began a few days ago. The water level from Bicholim river at Bicholim, Par river at Mulgao-Assonora, and Chapora river at Sal are in spate due to heavy rains. Due to the release of water from the dam, there are fears of flooding in the surrounding areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bicholim-taluka-rivers-in-spate/articleshow/84597529.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The accused, who is from Quepem, was arrested by crime branch officials in May, for allegedly trafficking women from Goa to Iraq. The court was told that the accused allegedly used the phones to contact unemployed ladies seeking overseas employment and lured them on the pretext of providing them jobs in Dubai. Instead they were illegally transported to Baghdad, Iraq, where they were physically and mentally exploited. During the course of the investigation, it was submitted that the accused transported around 10-12 victims. The court was told that Mulla used the phones to contact the victims, associates and agents. They were also used to send photocopies of passports and visas of the victims to agents. “Therefore, these mobile phones would be material evidence,” the court noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cant-release-accuseds-phones-court/articleshow/84597566.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
