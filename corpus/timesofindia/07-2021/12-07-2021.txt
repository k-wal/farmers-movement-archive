While Cubbon Park and Lalbagh have traditionally been the only two spots in the city where one could go to literally get a breath of fresh air, three tree parks — one each in one each in Turahalli, Kadugodi and Machohalli — are welcome lung spaces in the otherwise densely populated and polluted Bengaluru. Developed under the Bengaluru Mission 2022 for rejuvenation and revitalisation of the city, the over 22 acres Kadugodi tree park was recently thrown open to the public. It has a children's playing space, medicinal plants, a mini gym, parking space, toilet and public walk area. As the Turahalli park (40-acres) and Machohalli park (over 90-acres), designed in a similar fashion, are slated to be opened soon, environmentalists in the city state that more such tree parks will help drive the idea of conservation among people in the long run. ‘There is a big need for public spaces in Bengaluru’“Cities with heat islands and exposed to climate change are 10 degrees hotter in concrete areas. Any city in India, including Bengaluru, will be intolerable during summer 10 years in the future. Where will you take your kids to spend time with them during their summer break? It’s very important to have such parks since we don’t have public spaces in many parts of the city. Families need a place to hang out together,” says ecologist Harini Nagendra. A boost to the city’s biodiversityWhile it is undisputed that these parks are a great place for city folk to visit, what about the ecological benefit, if any? Environmentalist Manvel Alur says that there is a huge ecological benefit as long as they are not monoculture plantations. “The tree parks will attract all kinds of fauna. It will attract bees and birds, which play a significant part in terms of pollination and enabling the forest to grow. The other benefits are increased retention of water and improved biodiversity of plantation, which will bring down the microclimate. This will invariably improve the quality of life,” she points out. Being around trees automatically drives conservation‘Tree Doctor’ Vijay Nishanth grew up in the lush environs of Jayanagar, where he formed an emotional bond with many trees. “When you have a tree park close to home that you visit often, there is a connection that is formed. It’s like when I hear people fondly talking about a tree that they have seen for over 20 years, this gives them a sense of ownership and they automatically want to conserve it,” he says. Adding to this, Harini says that parks needn't be too manicured and have to be designed in such a way that allows for kids to touch, feel and play with and on the trees. “The tree parks need to cater to everyone. Most parks have kids’ play areas, with swings and slides that are not maintained well and become unusable over time. All you need is a sandpit and access to, say a mango tree with low branches — that is all that kids need to have a good time; it will make them want to return often,” she says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/three-new-tree-parks-in-bengaluru-add-a-breath-of-fresh-air-to-the-original-garden-city/articleshow/84314046.cms||Dhwani Desai

Any lenient treatment to the accused will lead to loss of confidence of the public in the judicial system, the court said, while pronouncing judgment in the case on July 7. The convict is Vinod Kumar, a resident of Gubbalala on Kanakapura Road. The case against his co-accused Babajan was split due his absence in court in the same case. According to the prosecution, Kumar and his associate approached RBI Layout near Konanakunte around 2.15pm on January 28, 2017. The duo came on a bike and pillion rider Kumar got down and threatened the victim Deepika at knifepoint, snatching her gold chain weighing 45 grams. Kumar pushed her on to the road, got on to the bike and the duo sped away. Konanakunte police took up a case of robbery and managed to arrest the suspects within two months of the offence. The woman identified the suspects who had snatched her chain. Counsel for the accused argued the woman could not have identified the chain-snatchers as they were wearing helmets while committing the crime. The woman deposed that she had identified the accused persons based on their height and physique. The prosecution argued that the woman’s chain was recovered from the accused duo. The court considered this as one of the main pieces of evidence. The court found Kumar guilty and convicted him. The defence counsel prayed for leniency while awarding him punishment. Rajeshwara, 64th additional city civil and sessions court judge, stated in the judgment that an offence like chain-snatching is likely to harm the law and order situation and shock the general conscience of society. Apart from being awarded the seven-year RI, Kumar was fined Rs 5,000. Any failure to pay the fine will result in him having to undergo simple imprisonment for six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/chain-snatcher-gets-7-yr-jail-term/articleshow/84327660.cms||Santosh kumar.B

The arrested truck driver confessed that the weapon consignment had been air-dropped from Pakistan using drones and he was tasked with transporting it to Kashmir Valley, claimed a senior cop. Jammu SSP Chandan Kohli said, “Based on intelligence reports about suspected weapon smuggling bids, a high alert was issued across Jammu on Sunday and mobile vehicle checking nakas were laid at more than a dozen places.” “During the exercise, personnel manning such a naka at Purmandal Morh under Gangyal police station stopped a truck for checking. The driver, however, tried to evade the policemen by giving excuses, which made the cops suspicious. After a thorough search, one pistol and two hand grenades were recovered from the vehicle and the driver, a resident of Pulwama, was arrested,” the SSP said, adding that the driver is being questioned further to unearth more links.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jammu-police-foil-arms-smuggling-bid-one-held/articleshow/84328387.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||India||Islamic seminary head among six detained in NIA raids in Jammu and Kashmir||SRINAGAR: A day after the J&K administration sacked 11 employees for alleged anti-India activities, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Sunday picked up six people — including the head of a Darul Uloom-affiliated seminary — during raids in Srinagar and Anantnag districts as part of a concerted crackdown on online radicalisation of youth by the banned Islamic State. Two sons of Hizbul Mujahideen chief Muhammad Yusuf Shah, alias Syed Salahuddin, were among the 11 fired on Saturday on the basis of the NIA’s investigation into an alleged terror funding case, the government said. The raids that followed a day later were carried out simultaneously across seven locations by joint teams of the NIA, CRPF and J&K Police. In Srinagar’s Dalal Mohalla, NIA sleuths raided a seminary — Siraj-ul Uloom — and detained its head, Adnaan Ahmad Nadvi, besides seizing a laptop, bank statements and other documents. Darul Uloom, under which the seminary supposedly functions, is in Uttar Pradesh’s Deoband. In Anantnag, an NIA team headed by Dinesh Gupta carried out raids in Pushroo, Sunsooma, and Achabal villages and detained five others — Sunsooma’s Javaid Ahmad Mir, an MBA graduate; Achabal’s Umar Bhat; Ovais Ahmad Bhat, Tanveer Ahmad Bhat, and Zeeshan Ameen Malik, the official said. Electronic gadgets including mobile phones, tablets, laptops, hard disks; bank statements and other documents, besides T-shirts bearing the ISIS logo, were seized. At the time of filing this report, similar raids were underway in two Baramulla locations, an NIA spokesperson confirmed. The proscribed outfit had launched a campaign on cyberspace, supplemented by on-ground terror financing activities, the spokesperson said, adding that the agency had registered a case in this regard on June 29 this year under relevant sections of the IPC and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. “IS terrorists operating from various conflict zones along with ISIS cadres in India, by assuming pseudo- online identities, have created a network wherein ISIS-related propaganda material is disseminated for radicalizing and recruiting members to the fold of ISIS,” the spokesperson said. An India-centric online propaganda magazine called “Voice of Hind” was published monthly to brainwash youth by projecting a skewed narrative of imagined injustices in India to feel a sense of alienation and communal hatred. Last Friday, a special NIA court in Delhi framed charges against 12 accused, including Hizb chief Syed Salahuddin and United Jihad Council chairman Ghulam Nabi Khan, in a 2011 terror funding case under relevant sections of the IPC and UAPA, the NIA spokesperson said. The probe had revealed that from 2004-2011, illegal funding was made to the tune of over Rs 80 crore from Pakistan to Hizb to fuel terror activities in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/islamic-seminary-head-among-six-detained-in-nia-raids-in-jammu-and-kashmir/articleshow/84328663.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Branson visited the city in December 2019 and many Mumbaikars will recall him saying that he will always carry fond memories of this city and its people. He had come to explore the possibility of launching a hyperloop project between Mumbai and Pune. However, for several reasons the project did not take off. After meeting Maharashtra chief minister Uddav Thackrey, Branson tweeted: “I’ve always been so inspired by the entrepreneurial spirit of the Indian people.” Branson also met businessman Anand Mahindra, during his visit to Mumbai. Branson wrote on Instagram: “Great to be in India to celebrate @ virgin galactic’s new route to Mumbai and join Anand Mahindra for ‘Our Business Is An Adventure’ event. We also unveiled our newest flying icon named Aria after my great great grandfather’s wife who was an Indian virgin family.” Apart from business and the hyperloop project, Branson was also in Mumbai to be what he called “third time lucky”. This was in regard to Branson’s airline Virgin Atlantic making a third-time entry into Mumbai through the Mumbai-London sector. Virgin Atlantic started flights to Mumbai and then stopped. Later, it restarted its service but pulled off again. When Branson was in Mumbai in December 2019, it was his third effort to restart Virgin’s operations. Regarding his India connections, he said that his great great grandmother was an Indian from Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu. He tweeted: “Since 1793 we had four generations living in Cuddalore. Every time I meet an Indian, I’m proud to say we may be related. A few years ago, I traced my roots and was thrilled to discover that I’m actually part Indian. I loved finding out how some of my ancestors on my father’s side moved to India in search of fortune and started their own successful businesses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/will-always-carry-fond-memories-of-india-richard-branson/articleshow/84329027.cms||Srinivas Laxman

Sarang Ravindra from Jayanagar has been interning with the company over the past six months, before he attended interviews and got his placement confirmed. “I want to believe that it is only my intent to learn and curiosity that the company saw in me. It will overshadow all the other talents. With virtual internships, networking and visibility might come down. But your hard work will show and help you get noticed,” the student said. Sarang said he spoke to his manager and got interviews organised and cleared them. While the joining date is in July-end, travel will depend on the pandemic scenario, Sarang added. “I took science in PU and we had computer science in the junior college. That’s when my interest started building. My elder brother is also a computer science engineer. I started coding with him and enjoyed it,” said Sarang. A tabla player, Sarang completed his schooling from Kumaran’s School and pre-university education from RV PU College. PES stated that 1,283 sixth-semester students across its campuses had virtual internships during the pandemic year, with them receiving monthly stipends ranging from Rs 15,000 – Rs 87,000. The highest stipend offered was around Rs 1.3 lakh per month. ‘Placements on track’“The Covid-19 pandemic has had no negative impact on placements. The internship offers are good and conversion rates to pre-placement offers are over 90%. Companies want to catch the students young and train them before anyone else can offer them jobs. The numbers are very encouraging. The final placements for the next academic year will start by August and not July because of the pandemic,” said Shridhar KS, registrar, PESU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/pes-student-gets-1-5cr/yr-offer-in-uk/articleshow/84327187.cms||---

The Indian mission is now manned only by local Afghan staff and while it is technically open, for all intents and purposes, India is out of the region. In an announcement, the Taliban claimed this week they control 85% of the country. Security sources feel Taliban are incharge of about a third of the country but have a significant presence at choke points that control cities and important highways. The MEA spokesperson said on Sunday, “India is closely monitoring the evolving security situation in Afghanistan. The safety and security of our personnel is paramount. The Consulate General of India in Kandahar has not been closed. However, due to the intense fighting near Kandahar city, India-based personnel have been brought back for the time being. I want to emphasise that this is a purely temporary measure until the situation stabilises. The consulate continues to operate through our local staff members.” For the time being, the Mazar-e-Sharif consulate is still open, and with Indian personnel, but that may not be for too long as the Taliban sweep through the western part of Afghanistan. The Kabul embassy is the only one that is still fully functional with Indian personnel. The Indian ambassador to Afghanistan, Rudrendra Tandon discussed the deteriorating security situation with new Afghan defence minister Bismillah Khan Mohammedi earlier this week. The Indian government on Thursday indicated that they were watching the situation “carefully”, before pulling out personnel on Saturday. India had already closed down its missions in Jalalabad and Herat in 2020, citing Covid, but it was clear that the security situation had played a part. Despite some optimistic assessments by the departing US military forces, the Afghan government security forces are collapsing with barely a fight. The Taliban too are playing a smarter game this time — by controlling and closing off the northern borders as well as on the Iranian side — to capture border revenue sources as well prevent the growth of any Northern Alliance-like formation to challenge them. Many Indian security officials monitoring the Taliban advance believe the Taliban are getting military advice, most likely, from Pakistan. The Taliban’s progress may mean that it can soon control most of the country. Most other countries, from Australia to China as well as NATO members, have all pulled out their personnel. The Afghan Taliban has activated its traditional support from among Pakistan’s terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba. Several IDs of Pakistan security forces have also been found fighting alongside the Taliban. Kandahar is the birthplace of the Taliban and in the past week it took over Panjwai and Zharey, and its forces are heading towards taking over Spin Boldak on the Pakistan border. In the west, Taliban captured major border crossings at Islam Qala at the Iran border and Torghundi on the Turkmenistan and have been collecting customs revenue from there.

As Delhiites suffered yet another oppressively hot and humid day with teasing clouds that didn’t deliver, the India Meteorological Department postponed monsoon’s onset by one more day, saying the system is likely to reach Delhi-NCR on Monday. This was the third likely date of monsoon’s arrival issued by the IMD in as many days. Earlier, the department had said the system could hit the region on Saturday, later revising it to Sunday. “Easterly winds and cloudiness conditions have increased in the region and the onset of the monsoon is likely to happen on Monday. Rain is also expected by Monday morning. The onset date has been extended by 24 hours on Sunday as it has to be supported by cloud and rain,” said R K Jenamani, scientist at IMD. Another met official said, “As per the standard operating procedure, the onset of monsoon is declared based on the rainfall reported during the past 24 hours ending at 8.30am on the day. No rainfall was recorded between 8.30am of July 10 and 8.30am of July 11.” This year, the monsoon has repeatedly defied IMD’s onset forecast for the capital. The department had originally predicted an early onset over the region, saying the rain system could arrive around June 15, 12 days ahead of its normal date of June 27. But the system stalled at the doorstep of NCR before going into a weak phase for over two weeks. “As on Sunday, lower-level easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal have further extended northwestwards, reaching up to Delhi, Haryana and east Rajasthan. Low level relative humidity has also increased over the region. Hence, the conditions continue to remain favourable for further advance of southwest monsoon over Delhi, remaining parts of west Uttar Pradesh and some more parts of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan during next 24 hours,” IMD’s bulletin said. It added that conditions were also becoming favourable for further advance of southwest monsoon over the remaining parts of the country during the subsequent 48 hours. If the monsoon arrives in Delhi on Monday, it would be the most delayed monsoon in 19 years. The last time Delhi witnessed a more delayed onset was in 2002, when the monsoon arrived on July 19. In 1987, the monsoon hit Delhi as late as July 26, an all-time record delay, IMD data shows. Some parts of Delhi on Sunday received ‘trace’ rainfall while IMD has predicted light rain along with gusty winds from Sunday night to Monday morning. The maximum temperature at 39 degrees Celsius was three degrees above normal. The minimum temperature settled at 28.8 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal. The relative humidity oscillated between 76% and 51%.

---||World||Tourism eyes final frontier as Richard Branson soars into space||NEW YORK: Swashbuckling entrepreneur Richard Branson hurtled into space aboard his own winged rocket ship Sunday, beating out fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos. The nearly 71-year-old Branson and five crewmates from his Virgin Galactic space-tourism company reached an altitude of about 53 miles (88 km) over the New Mexico desert _ enough to experience three to four minutes of weightlessness and see the curvature of the Earth _ and then safely glided to a runway landing. “The whole thing, it was just magical,” a jubilant Branson said after the trip home aboard the gleaming white space plane, named Unity. The brief, up-and-down flight — the rocket ship's portion took only about 15 minutes, or about as long as Alan Shepard's first US spaceflight in 1961 — was a splashy and unabashedly commercial plug for Virgin Galactic, which plans to start taking paying customers on joyrides next year. Branson became the first person to blast off in his own spaceship, beating Bezos by nine days. He also became only the second septuagenarian to go into space. Astronaut John Glenn flew on the shuttle at age 77 in 1998. Bezos sent his congratulations, adding: “Can't wait to join the club!” though he also took to Twitter earlier in the week to enumerate the ways in which be believes his company's rides will be better. With about 500 people watching, including Branson’s family, a twin-fuselage aircraft with Unity attached underneath took off in the first stage of the flight. Unity then detached from the mother ship at an altitude of about 8 1/2 miles (13 km) and fired its engine, reaching more than Mach 3, or three times the speed of sound, as it pierced the edge of space. Spectators cheered, jumped into the air and embraced as the rocket plane touched down. Branson pumped his fists as he stepped out onto the runway and ran toward his family, bear-hugging his wife and children and scooping up his three grandchildren in his arms. “That was an amazing accomplishment,” former Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, a one-time commander of the International Space Station, said from the sidelines. “I'm just so delighted at what this open door is going to lead to now. It's a great moment.” Virgin Galactic conducted three previous test flights into space with crews of just two or three. The flamboyant, London-born founder of Virgin Atlantic Airways wasn't supposed to fly until later this summer. But he assigned himself to an earlier flight after Bezos announced plans to ride his own rocket into space from Texas on July 20, the 52nd anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. Branson denied he was trying to outdo Bezos. Branson's other chief rival in the space-tourism race among the world's richest men, SpaceX's Elon Musk, came to New Mexico to witness the flight, wishing Branson via Twitter, “Godspeed!” Bezos’ Blue Origin company intends to send tourists past the so-called Karman line 62 miles (100 kilometers) above Earth, which is is recognised by international aviation and aerospace federations as the threshold of space. But Nasa, Air Force, the Federal Aviation Administration and some astrophysicists consider the boundary between the atmosphere and space to begin 50 miles (80 km) up. The risks to Branson and his crew were underscored in 2007, when a rocket motor test in California's Mojave Desert left three workers dead, and in 2014, when a Virgin Galactic rocket plane broke apart during a test flight, killing one pilot and seriously injuring the other. Ever the showman, Branson insisted on a global livestream of the Sunday morning flight and invited celebrities and former space station astronauts to the company's Spaceport America base in New Mexico. R&B singer Khalid performed his new single “New Normal” — a nod to the dawning of space tourism — while CBS “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert served as master of ceremonies. Before climbing aboard, Branson, who has kite-surfed the English Channel and attempted to circle the world in a hot-air balloon, signed the astronaut log book and wisecracked: “The name's Branson. Sir Richard Branson. Astronaut Double-oh-one. License to thrill.” Upon his return to Earth, he announced a sweepstakes drawing for two seats on a Virgin Galactic jaunt once tourist flights begin. Virgin Galactic already has more than 600 reservations from would-be space tourists, with tickets initially costing $250,000 apiece. Blue Origin is waiting for Bezos' flight before announcing its ticket prices. Kerianne Flynn, who signed up in 2011 to fly with Virgin Galactic, had butterflies ahead of the launch Sunday. “I think there's going to be nothing like going up there and looking back down on the Earth, which is what I think I'm most excited about,” she said. She added: “Hopefully the next generations will be able to explore what's up there.” Musk's SpaceX, which is already launching astronauts to the space station for Nasa and building moon and Mars ships, plans to take tourists on more than just brief, up-and-down trips. They will instead go into orbit around the Earth for days, with seats costing well into the millions. The company's first private flight is set for September. Musk himself has not committed to going into space anytime soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/tourism-eyes-final-frontier-as-richard-branson-soars-into-space/articleshow/84330479.cms||---

The vaccine has been tested on adults as well as children above 12 and if the regulatory committee is satisfied with the submitted data and documents, the vaccine will be approved for emergency use soon, officials said. An approval can hasten the opening of schools although vaccine supply will remain a concern. “The preliminary assessment of the application submitted by the company is going on and we have sent it to the SEC for further consideration. The SEC will be meeting in the coming week, representatives of the company will be also asked to make presentations,” an official said. If the SEC finds the phase 3 data submitted by the company satisfactory, the emergency use authorisation for the vaccine can be granted this week itself. The official said that once approval is given, supply of the vaccine is expected to start by August-September. If it gets the nod, ZyCov-D, a locally developed DNA vaccine candidate would be the fifth vaccine against coronavirus to get EUA in India. Currently, Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V are being administered under the national Covid-19 immunisation programme. Cipla has also got an EUA to import Moderna’s anti-Covid jab but it is yet to be available in the country. ZyCoV-D is a three-dose, intradermal vaccine which is applied using the PharmaJet needle-free system. It can be stored at 2-8 degree Celsius and has shown good stability at temperatures of 25 degree Celsius for at least 3 months. While Zydus Cadila has indicated it will initially manufacture one crore doses per month and later increase production, the vaccine's availability will be a boost to supplies as well as offer cover to children of 12-18 years, particularly in the wake of concerns about a potential third wave as children are seen to be vulnerable to the virus. Besides, the government may also focus on inoculating children going forward as it will be crucial to opening of schools. Apart from Cadila, Bharat Biotech is also testing Covaxin on children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/zydus-vaccine-for-kids-above-12-to-come-up-for-approval-this-week/articleshow/84330859.cms||Sushmi Dey

Vinay Prakash was on Sunday named as the key officer meant to address user grievances. He would sit out of the company’s local office in Bangalore and work alongside Twitter’s global officer Jeremy Kessel, who is based out of San Francisco. The move comes days after the Delhi high court refused interim protection to Twitter and allowed the Centre to act against it for any violation of the new IT rules. Twitter was also asked to regularise the appointment of designated officers within two weeks. Twitter’s ‘India Transparency Report’ was filed for the period May 26-June 25 this year and the company said it has removed 133 URLs over various content complaints, including abuse and harassment (38 URLs), defamation (87), impersonation (1), misinformation/synthetic and manipulated media (1), and privacy infringement (6). However, it did not take any action on complaints around “sensitive adult content”, despite receiving four grievances. “In addition to the above data, we processed 56 grievances which were appealing Twitter account suspensions. These were all resolved, and the appropriate responses were sent. We overturned seven of the account suspensions based on the specifics of the situation, but the other accounts remain suspended,” it said, without giving specific details. The company, which faced a spate of FIRs recently, including one related to posts around child pornographic material, reported pro-active monitoring data around “child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and similar content”, though this was not India-specific data but global numbers (the period was not mentioned). It said 18,385 accounts were suspended on the subject. Globally, it also suspended 4,179 accounts for “promotion of terrorism”. On the controversial issue of appointment of statutory officers (such as nodal officer and chief compliance officer) in line with the new IT rules, it has already told the courts that steps have been initiated. The company had previously appointed lawyer Dharmendra Chatur as the local grievance officer, but he quit the position as soon as regulatory troubles mounted for the social media platform and a number of FIRs were filed against its top management over carriage of “objectionable and illegal” content. Twitter’s turn to come around on India’s new IT rules coincides with the change of guard in the Central government’s ministerial portfolios that saw Ashwini Vaishnaw replace Ravi Shankar Prasad. The new minister had said in his opening comments that companies working in India, including Twitter, have to follow the law of the land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/twitter-names-grievance-officer-files-user-report/articleshow/84331204.cms||Pankaj Doval

Gadkari said the use of ethanol as vehicle fuel would help save at least Rs 20 per litre despite its lower calorific value compared to petrol. His ministry is likely to announce a policy for flex-fuel engines soon, which will encourage automobile manufacturers to produce them. These engines can run on more than one fuel and also a mixture of fuels. The minister said indigenous fuels such as ethanol, methanol and bio-CNG would give tough competition to imported crude oil and that’s the only way to get the best price for consumers. Gadkari said he had urged the government to privatise the petroleum and natural gas sector, which has already been opened up. Last year, the petroleum ministry simplified guidelines for authorisation for bulk and retail marketing of petrol and diesel. This was done to increase private sector participation in the marketing of petrol and diesel. “Now, we have invited all private companies, including PSUs, in the field. Even you can import LNG,” he said, adding the clean fuel has a great future in the country. LNG is emerging as the most preferred fuel for long-haul transport across the globe. “In our economy, we are spending Rs 8 lakh crore for the import of petrol, diesel and petroleum products which is a big challenge… Being a nationalist I want that our import should reduce and export must increase.” Read AlsoSoaring petrol, diesel prices pose threat to Indian recovery and inflationIndian pump prices are in unchartered territory as ever-increasing government levies coincide with crude’s recovery from the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic.Highlighting the economic advantage of LNG, the minister said data showed that the average cost of conversion of a conventional truck engine to an LNG engine was Rs 10 lakh.

The petitioner, Anu Pant, has filed the application in the special leave petition (SLP) moved by the Uttarakhand government, challenging the HC’s order that stayed the phased opening of the Char Dham shrines. Speaking to TOI, Abhijay Negi, counsel appearing for Pant, said that the state government had informed the HC that it has decided to cancel the kanwar yatra this season but media reports indicate that the government is reviewing its decision. “This is against what they told the HC and we will inform the apex court how the HC has been misled by the government,” Negi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/uttarakhand-misled-hc-on-kanwar-yatra-petitioner-to-sc/articleshow/84331775.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: After spat, HD Kumaraswamy and Sumalatha soften stand||BENGALURU: There seems to be more to the spat between former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy of JD(S) and independent Mandya MP Sumalatha Ambareesh than meets the eye. On the surface, they are arguing over the safety of Krishnarajasagar (KRS) Dam, which faces risks from illegal stone quarrying, and the reopening of Mysore Sugar unit. But it’s likely that they are fighting for the control of the Vokkaliga-dominated Mandya segment with the long-term aim of setting the stage for the political careers of their sons. Kumaraswamy’s son, Nikhil, lost to Sumalatha in Mandya in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Kumaraswamy wants to improve JD(S) position in the district so that Nikhil has a better shot in 2024, say political observers. Sumalatha, they add, is hoping that her connection with constituents and her late actor-husband Ambareesh’s strong appeal will benefit their son, Abhishek. Both Nikhil and Abhishek are actors who have had some success in movies. Politics is an obvious destination for them. Sumalatha told TOI that Abhishek had political aspirations and wanted to continue his father’s legacy in Mandya. “I don’t deny the prospects of Abhishek entering politics. In fact, he is made for it as he has done his master’s in international politics. He is still young, so for now, he is focusing on acting in movies,” the MP said. Sumalatha has faced some criticism for reportedly being inaccessible and not visiting her constituency regularly during the pandemic. Railing against illegal mining and quarrying, an important local issue, may help her win people back. She is already receiving support after Kumaraswamy made controversial comments against her. She hinted that she won’t be an independent candidate in the next Lok Sabha elections and may go with Congress or BJP. She will try to use the upcoming zilla panchayat polls to reinforce her position as the district leader. She said that she would start visiting all eight assembly segments in Mandya from next month. “The clash between Kumaraswamy and Sumalatha is being projected as a battle for a cause, but actually, it is an extension of the bitter electoral fight witnessed in 2019. Both are looking to regain their sway over Mandya to help their sons,” said KS Sudheer Kumar, Mandya district president of the Karnataka Rajya Sangha. JS(S) won all eight assembly seats in the district in 2018, but suffered a jolt in the Lok Sabha elections the next year. Sumalatha, with the silent backing of BJP, succeeded in mobilising more support than Nikhil. Even a section of Congress members tacitly backed her.  Some JD(S) functionaries believe that in the KRS Dam issue, the party missed a chance to challenge Sumalatha’s claims as Kumarswamy’s personal attack against her shifted the focus of the discussion. Recently, she claimed that the dam faced the risk of cracks because of stone quarrying nearby. The government and experts clarified that no such activities were happening in the 10-km radius of the reservoir. “Kumaraswamy is desperately trying to retain his party’s stronghold ahead of the next assembly polls and wants to ensure Nikhil wins in the 2024 Lok Sabha contest. But he lost the plot by making distasteful comments,” said Malavalli Shivanna, the president of the Lohia Thinkers’ Forum. Shivanna added that concerns over illegal mining and stone quarrying were genuine. “Kumaraswamy seems to be jittery after Sumalatha became proactive and raised the issue last week. He reacted sharply to make his party’s presence felt, but chose the wrong words,” Shivanna said. Upset over the controversy, Kumaraswamy has decided to stay silent for now. “I have decided not to talk about these issues for some time. And it is too early to talk about Nikhil’s future plans,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/after-spat-hdk-and-sumalatha-soften-stand/articleshow/84331742.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka can fix fees for CBSE schools?||BENGALURU: In a letter to Karnataka’s department of public instruction (DPI), the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is understood to have said the state government is empowered to decide the fee structure for schools affiliated to the board. The June 9 letter is in response to a query from DPI on regulating fees in CBSE-affiliated schools in the state. A copy of the letter was widely circulated on social media, but V Anbukumar, commissioner, DPI, to whom the letter was addressed, said he has yet to see a hard copy of it. “I can comment only when I see the letter,” Anbukumar said. However, he confirmed writing to the board in March, seeking clarity on whether regulation of fees falls under the ambit of the state government. In January this year, schools affiliated to central boards like CBSE had taken exception to the state government’s diktat of capping fees for the academic year 2020-21 at not more than 70% of that levied during in 2019-20. The move was induced by the pandemic. The government said fees had to be reduced as classes were not being held on campus and there was enormous financial distress due to Covid-19. But CBSE schools argued that the state government had no authority to decide fees. An organisation representing CBSE schools, among others, even approached the high court. The matter is pending. In its letter, CBSE quoted from its bye-laws 2018. “That as per rule 7.3 of affiliation bye-laws 2018, fees shall be charged under the heads prescribed by the department of education of the states/UTs (the state government is empowered to decide the fee structure.) That as per rule 7.8 (sic 7.6) of affiliation bye-laws 2018, the acts and regulations of the central and state UT/ governments enacted/ framed in connection with regulation of fee in respect of various categories of the schools situated in the state will be applicable to the school affiliated with CBSE,” it said. Signed by the joint secretary affiliation, the letter states the affiliation bye-laws 2018 is available on the board’s website. However, in response to the letter, CBSE schools said their grouse is with the Karnataka Education Act. D Shashi Kumar, secretary, Association of Primary and Secondary Schools of Karnataka, said the matter is sub judice and its best for the court to decide. “The Karnataka Education Act has been challenged on various grounds including violating fundamental rights of private institutions. While the Supreme Court had said it has to be revised and be on par with the TMA Pai judgement, the matter is still pending. Including CBSE and ICSE schools under the Act has also been challenged,” Kumar said. But VP Niranjanaradhya, senior fellow, Centre for Child and Law, NLSIU, pointed out that CBSE schools have been misleading the public and courts by saying they do not come under the state government’s ambit. “The CBSE bye-laws are clear: They do come under the ambit of the state government and fees can be fixed. The government should now take steps to resolve the issue,” Niranjanaradhya said. "CBSE may not be aware of affairs in Karnataka. The Karnataka Education Act states CBSE and ICSE schools do not come under its purview. That’s what we are fighting in court. This note from CBSE may be in general to all states. However, with this letter, CBSE is also overstepping the Supreme Court’s TMA Pai judgement. States can regulate fees, but they cannot decide the fee structure," said M Srinivasan president, management of independent CBSE schools association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/state-can-fix-fees-for-cbse-schools/articleshow/84331745.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Mahadevapura has 20 containment zones||BENGALURU: Covid cases may be decreasing, but some parts of Bengaluru are registering far more cases than others,a fact reflected in the spread of micro-containment zones across the state’s capital city. While there are 48 active micro-containment zones across Bengaluru, 20 of them are in Mahadevapura zone alone. Micro-containment zones became a part of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s (BBMP) Covid-19 strategy when cases began to recede after peaking in the second wave. Prior to that, the civic body only identified apartments/streets as containment zones if cluster cases were reported. Bengaluru had 587 microcontainment zones during the second wave, but 538 of them have been deactivated. Mahadevapura, which had about 119 micro-containment zones, now has only 20. Bommanahalli once had 115 such zones, but now has five. In micro-containment zones, health officials have been told to test residents of at least houses on either side of the house where a case has been reported, besides the ones opposite and behind it. Randeep D, special commissioner (health), BBMP, and zonal commissioner, Mahadevapura, told TOI all streets or apartments that report three or more Covid cases are now declared microcontainment zones. “We put a sticker on the door and also inform neighbours so that patients don’t violate protocol,” he said. “Luckily, we do not have a road or an apartment that has more than five cases. However, we are analysing some cluster outbreaks and are taking measures to prevent the spread of the virus.” Officials on the ground say most Covid-19 cases in Mahadevapura are among people with inter-state travel history and who are associated with the construction sector. Pattern of casesMeanwhile, a health official said a meeting has been scheduled to prepare the ground for an anticipated third wave of infections. “Every zone has epidemiologists and BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta will hold a meeting on Monday to analyse the pattern of Covid-19 cases in the city,” Randeep said. Another official said Gupta approved a serosurvey and genome sequencing of samples in Bengaluru on Sunday. “This will help us understand which pockets are already protected by people with antibodies. If people in some areas are more prone to the virus, authorities will ramp up vaccination drives there,” an official said. “We may not be able to stop the third wave, but we can blunt its severity. This survey will help us better understand the situation on the ground.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/mahadevapura-has-20-containment-zones/articleshow/84331746.cms||Kiran Parashar

The SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group meeting on July 13-14, which will also be attended by Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, is expected to come up with a joint statement on Afghanistan where a hasty US withdrawal has emboldened the rampaging Taliban insurgents. Afghanistan foreign minister Hanif Atmar is also expected to participate in the meeting. India has used the Contact Group meeting in the past to share its perspectives on the security situation in Afghanistan, including security challenges posed by terrorism and extremism “imposed from beyond its borders”. Jaishankar and Qureshi were together in Dushanbe in March too this year for a Heart of Asia conference on Afghanistan. They didn’t have any bilateral exchange though. Official sources said there was no proposal again by either side for a meeting in Dushanbe. NSA Ajit Doval and his counterpart Moeed Yusuf also together attended a meeting of SCO NSAs last month in Dushanbe but again there was no meeting between the two. The SCO summit is also expected to be held physically this year in Tajikistan, the current chair of SCO. On this occasion though, Jaishankar and Qureshi will face each other in back to back meetings as both are expected to participate in a south and central Asia connectivity meeting later this week in Uzbekistan’s Tashkent. Wang will also participate in the meeting in Tashkent. Announcing Wang’s participation in the Afghanistan Contact Group meeting, China said last week it was ready to work with all parties to "give full play to the role of the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group, promoting the SCO to contribute more in maintaining stability and peaceful reconstruction in Afghanistan”. The Chinese foreign ministry said it was ready to jointly promote the peace and reconciliation process in Afghanistan, and effectively safeguard regional security and stability by stepping up efforts to combat the “three evils (terrorism, separatism, and extremism)”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/s-jaishankar-pakistan-counterpart-to-come-face-to-face-this-week/articleshow/84331803.cms||---

People shared mixed views. For some, a tech-enabled company should be valued differently than a traditional one despite its losses. For others, the IPO is an opportunity for venture capital and private equity investors to offload their liability to retail investors. Then there are those that believe Indian food tech companies will reflect valuations earned by global peers like DoorDash to a significant extent. Zomato’s IPO is set to be open from July 14 to July 16 at a price band of Rs 72-76. The offer size is about Rs 9,375 crore.

While the decline in vaccination has raised concerns, the government is expecting to maintain a daily average of 40-45 lakh doses in July with an estimated supply of at least 12 crore doses this month, an official source said. According to the source, the slowdown in vaccination is primarily because of some disruptions at Bharat Biotech’s Bengaluru plant which resulted in delay in supply of some batches of Covaxin that were expected in the beginning of this month. “It is a new facility with large scale fermentation plant. The trial batches were disrupted during standardisation process and therefore, the supply of Covaxin was less than expected. That has been sorted out now,” the official said. CoWin data shows the decline is mainly driven by less number of people initiating first dose and a lower uptake in rural areas.  Between June 25-30, the number of daily doses administered in rural areas were in the range of 9.9 lakh- 40.4 lakh. However, it dropped to 8 lakh-38.1 lakh doses between July 1-9. In urban areas, the daily doses varied from 8.2 lakh-31.8 lakh doses during June 25-30, whereas during July 1-9, around 7.6 lakh -27.8 lakh doses were given. “The combination of progressive reopening and declining vaccination numbers is dangerous. We are not really protected against the current delta variant until we fully vaccinate 60-70% of the population by December. For that we need to administer 90 lakh to 1 crore doses per day. And that needs vaccine stocks which we seem to be running short on. If we can’t vaccinate enough, I’m afraid we need to be obsessed about Covid-appropriate behavior and re-think relaxing restrictions,” says Dr Arvinder Soin, chairman, Medanta Liver Transplant Institute. However, the average daily vaccination still remained above the pre-June 21 level and officials said pace of vaccination is likely to pick up again in the following weeks.

Despite the recently-imposed restrictions to enter Nainital and Mussoorie — a mandatory RT-PCR negative report, registration on the Smart City portal and hotel reservation — heavy traffic jams were reported from both Nainital and Mussoorie. A total of 33,000 people visited Nainital from Friday to Sunday, according to data available with the police department. Around 2,500 people found without the necessary documents were sent back from checkposts. “Checkpoints have been set up at all entry points to the town and almost every vehicle was screened to make sure no one entered without the proper documents,” said a police official. Meanwhile, hotels remained full over the weekend in Nainital and tourist spots brimmed with people. There was heavy police presence in front of restaurants, at Pant Park and the town bus stand, with patrolling cops frequently disbursing crowds. Similar scenes played out in Mussoorie on Sunday. A serpentine queue of vehicles stretched from Kincraig to Library Chowk. Verification of RT-PCR reports and other documents at the Kuthal Gate check post stalled traffic flow. “We were stuck for nearly 45 minutes at Kuthal Gate. From Dehradun to Mussoorie, it took us nearly two and a half hours whereas on normal days, it just takes about an hour,” said Ashutosh Arora, who was visiting the town from New Delhi. The move to strictly check documents was welcomed by people in Mussoorie.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-curbs-fail-to-deter-weekend-rush-to-the-hills/articleshow/84331950.cms||Prashant Jha

They said any increase in capacity at Srisailam would lead to reduced or zero water release to Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir. This would hurt farmers in Prakasam district who are dependent on it for irrigation and drinking water. In a letter to the CM, the MLAs said over four of the total 11 lakh acres of cultivable land had turned into desert due to lack of water supply. The farmers depend on Sagar water and underground water. Darsi, Addanki and Yarragondapalem depend entirely on Sagar water while Kondepi, Parchuru, Santanutalapadu and Ongole partially depend on Sagar. “If the Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir does not receive required water from Srisailam, there will be a crisis,” the MLAs said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/tdp-mlas-against-raising-rlip-capacity/articleshow/84326731.cms||Samdani MN
---||Business||Insurance biz: MNCs can own 74%, but FIIs, PEs hold the key||MUMBAI: The government last week notified amendments to regulations for the insurance sector that enabled an increase in foreign investments — up to 74% from 49% earlier. The revised norms dilute the earlier restrictions that discouraged foreign investors when the foreign limit was hiked to 49% from 26% in 2015. “Foreign investors can rejoice that ‘Indian Owned and Controlled’, which was introduced in 2015, has now gone. It will give confidence to foreign investors. Indian insurance sector needs capital and expertise and, with enhanced ownership and control, foreign insurers will be encouraged for a deeper commitment to Indian ventures,” said Consortia Legal senior partner Satyendra Shrivastava. The government had amended the Insurance Act, 1938 in February, which was followed by notification of enabling rules by the finance ministry in May and amendment of the FDI policy in June. “With notification of regulations by sector regulator Irdai, the necessary amendments in the regulatory framework have now come into effect. Insurers can now formally apply to Irdai for an increase in foreign investment up to 74%,” said Shrivastava. The new norms only state that majority of the directors and key management persons should be Indians. Also, either the chairperson, managing director or chief executive officer should be a resident Indian. However, insurers say that the game has now changed, and the deep-pocketed investors are not multinational companies but foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and private equity (PE) investors who face separate hurdles. Ashvin Parekh, a consultant who has been advising the insurance industry for two decades, said that it made sense for companies to have local management as the Indian market is different from the West when it comes to investment products, actuarial tables or even reinsurance. Also, the contribution of foreign MNCs is not the same as earlier. Parekh points out that 70% of business is concentrated with the top five non-life companies and top seven life companies. Additionally, in most of these, the Indian partner is driving the business with the foreign partner pulling back. The restrictions on transfer pricing and management compensation also limit the contribution that a foreign partner can make. After the foreign investment limit was hiked to 49% in 2015, what became clear was that the money would come in from FIIs and PE funds — the new deep-pocketed investors. “One pre-requisite for FIIs is listing of the companies that they invest in (only the insurance arms of SBI, ICICI & HDFC have listed till date). At the time of liberalisation, the objective was to have a mandatory listing in 10 years. This was later interpreted as an indicative timeline. PE investors face separate hurdles — they are classified as promoters if they hold more than 10% and this is a disincentive as they do not want to take on the responsibility of committing to keeping the business solvent. If an enabling environment is created, the insurance industry can easily attract anywhere in the range of Rs 2-2.5 lakh crore by way of foreign investment,” said Parekh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/insurance-biz-mncs-can-own-74-but-fiis-pes-hold-the-key/articleshow/84329243.cms||Mayur Shetty

Andhra Medical College (AMC) conducted a webinar on ‘Covid-19 Variants: An Update’ on Sunday. Participating as the distinguished speaker, Dr Kelly spoke about the Delta, Delta plus, Lambda and other variants of the SARS-Cov-2 virus. Dr Kelly explained the major concerns with the new variants such as increased transmissibility, virulence, severity of illness and vaccine efficacy. “According to World Health Organisation, the Delta variant is fastest and fittest. The Delta variant also doubles the risk of hospitalisation,” said Dr Kelly. “Compared to the earlier pandemics, I think this (Covid-19) is quite different. The virus mutates so quickly and so much. I think unfortunately we are going to see more waves,” said Dr Kelly. Dr Sridhar Chilimuri, physician-in-chief and chairman, department of medicine, BronxCare Hospital Center, New York, acted as the moderator of the sessions. In reply to a question by AMC principal Dr PV Sudhakar on genome sequencing for new variants, Dr Kelly said it was better to conduct genome sequencing of samples of people with a second infection and those infected after the first dose of vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/new-variants-fitter-and-transmittable/articleshow/84326567.cms||---

Shahnawaz, who was on a two-day tour of Bhagalpur division to review the industrial growth in the region, visited BIST, which has been closed for a long time. He directed the Khadi Mall CEO, Ashok Sinha, to monitor the plan to restart the BIST, so that it is able to provide qualified and technical graduates for textiles industries. Shahnawaz said the institute was imparting education in the field of handloom textiles, silk and other related streams of learning. Referring to the staff issue, the minister said there are 71 sanctioned posts but 63 are vacant. “We will try to fill up the vacancies and get the works related to recognition of the BIST and its courses by All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) as soon as possible. We will also take steps for its affiliation to Aryabhatta Knowledge University (AKU). The courses and syllabus will be in accordance with AKU. BTech (textile) course will be resumed after restarting the BIST,” Shahnawaz said. “It will provide the necessary technical knowledge to the handloom and tussar silk weavers and also provide vocational training,” he added. Shahnawaz also directed Bhagalpur DM Subrat Kumar Sen and other officials to coordinate the BIST revival and help the weaving community and the beneficiaries of the handloom clusters while reviewing the silk testing laboratories and computer aided design (CAD) premises at BIST. BIST, under the directorate of handloom and sericulture in the department of industries, was established in 1922 and reconstituted in 1978. “Spread over an area of 10 acres, BIST was providing vocational and educational diploma courses related to silk and textile and BTech (textile). In 2005, two-year diploma courses in various branches of textile engineering were started. However, the institute has been closed for several years as there is acute shortage of academic teachers and staff,” Ashok Sinha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/min-orders-revival-of-bihar-institute-of-silk-textiles/articleshow/84324811.cms||Kumar Rajesh

The move is aimed at providing convenience to those willing to apply in IPOs but usually do not get the time to do so during market hours. Paytm Money is the broking and financial assets distribution arm of digital payments solutions company Paytm. Under the service, christened ‘Pre-Open IPO Applications’, Paytm Money’s customers can apply in the forthcoming offer for the food delivery company before the actual opening of the IPO on July 14. Currently, investors with demat accounts can apply in an IPO only during the days an offer is live on an exchange platform, and that too during market hours — that is, between 9am and 3.30pm. The closing time could be extended by a few hours if there’s a heavy rush of applications on the last day. Investors cannot apply in an IPO beyond these hours. Under the new system, Paytm Money has already allowed its customers with a demat account to apply for the Zomato IPO. Once the IPO goes live on the exchanges on July 14 morning, these orders will be sent to the exchanges. These investors will be required only to authorise their payments of application money through a UPI authorisation code. The application will then be uploaded on the exchanges’ servers. This process is aimed at helping mainly those investors who do not trade actively. “This is particularly true in case of millennials and young investors,” a company release said. According to Paytm Money CEO Varun Sridhar, interest in IPOs has surged in the past few months. There have been cases of investors missing out on applying in IPOs because of issues like tight schedules during market hours, and demand-led processing delays. “We wanted to make the lives of our users easier and ensure that they don’t miss out on good opportunities,” Sridhar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/zomato-ipo-on-paytm-money-before-opening/articleshow/84328836.cms||---

The matter came to light after their bodies were found floating on Jham Das pokhar (pond) in the village on Sunday morning, which were fished out and identified to be of a youth Akshay Kumar (20) and a girl Hema Kumari (19) who were neighbours. Madhubani SP Satya Prakash said that the girl and the boy were missing since Friday but none of their family members had reported the incident to police. “There were no external injury marks on the bodies. Prima facie it seems both had committed suicide after their family members refused their proposal for marriage,” he said. Pandaul police station SHO Shankar Kumar said that Hema’s family members had fixed her marriage with another boy. Infant rescued: A seven days old baby girl was rescued by police while she was allegedly being buried alive by her mentally unstable mother near her residence at Punjabi Mohalla under the Kabaiyya police station area in Lakhisarai on late Saturday night. SHO Rajeev Kumar said the infant was admitted to sadar hospital for treatment after being rescued. 138 constables suspended: Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma suspended 139 police constables within few days after their reinstatement in the New Police Lines revolt case which took place near Lodipur on November 2, 2018. The Patna high court had ordered their reinstatement observing that they were dismissed without following the proper norms. Altogether 175 police constables of which 167 were newly-recruited and under training constables were dismissed from service and 30 were placed under suspension on November 4, 2018 after the rampage in which they had allegedly attempted to lynch lines DSP Mohammad Masluddin. At least 60% of the dismissed constables were females.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lovebirds-commit-suicide-in-madhubani/articleshow/84324894.cms||---

People shared mixed views. For some, a tech-enabled company should be valued differently than a traditional one despite its losses. For others, the IPO is an opportunity for venture capital and private equity investors to offload their liability to retail investors. Then there are those that believe Indian food tech companies will reflect valuations earned by global peers like DoorDash to a significant extent. Zomato’s IPO is set to be open from July 14 to July 16 at a price band of Rs 72-76. The offer size is about Rs 9,375 crore. Interestingly, the Zomato IPO’s valuation at about Rs 60,000 crore is equivalent to the combined market value of all the quick service restaurants (QSRs) listed on Indian bourses. Its value is also more than the market value of all the listed hospitality chains operating in the country, taken together. This second list includes the behemoth like Indian Hotels that runs the iconic Taj chain of hotels in India and abroad, and also Oberoi Hotels. India has half a dozen listed QSRs with a combined market value of more than Rs 60,710 crore and about 20 listed hospitality companies with an aggregate market capitalisation of nearly Rs 44,000 crore. Jubilant (which operates the Domino’s Pizza India franchisee), Westlife (McDonald’s) and Indian Hotels (runs Qmin gourmet food ordering app) had introduced contactless delivery services after the dining-out culture got impacted by the coronavirus crisis. Jubilant, which said that over 90% of Domino’s deliveries are currently linked to online orders as compared to a few years ago, is the most valued QSR stock at Rs 41,007 crore, while Indian Hotels (Taj) is the most valued hospitality company at Rs 17,589 crore (see graphic). Qmin, which Taj launched last July, is ramping up its coverage to 25 cities from 16 cities, Indian Hotels chairman N Chandrasekaran said at the company’s annual shareholder meeting held last month. While the loss-making Zomato is seeking a rich valuation, uniquely it is a delivery partner as well as a competitor to QSRs and hospitality chains. It’s also facing some challenges from the pan-India body of individual restaurants. Food service body NRAI, which represents more than five lakh restaurants in the country, plans to launch its own food-ordering app to take on Zomato and other food tech platforms, amid a growing dispute between them over discounting, data masking and other alleged unfair business practices. Industrialist Harsh Goenka on Twitter said: “Can anyone explain to me- top 20 hotels including global Indian hotel brands - total market cap - Rs 44,000 crore. Top 6 QSR chains serving millions of consumers - total market cap- Rs 60,000 crore. Zomato - continuing huge losses. Hold my vadapav! Market cap - Rs 60,000 crore???” Replying to Goenka, NRAI president Anurag Katriar said, “Welcome to the new world where you can be termed ‘valuable’ despite never making a penny of profit since your inception.” Former JP Morgan India director and partner of RippleWave Equity Advisors, Mehul Savla, said Zomato cannot be compared with hospitality chains. “It straddles pure play QSR and technology-driven disruption, an ‘in-between’ space, which is evolving at a rapid pace, driven by changing consumption, lifestyle and convenience factors. Commensurately, the valuation approach also steers away from traditional parameters towards futuristic assumptions, almost like valuing ‘abstract art’. There is no defined formula to it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/zomatos-rs-60k-cr-ipo-valuation-creates-buzz/articleshow/84329387.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) officials and forest department are jointly conducting the clean-up drive in the river that frequently witnesses flood frequently during monsoon. The activists, though, are planning to issue a notice to the civic body. “The river cleaning drive is being done in a planned manner. We are aware that Vishwamitri is an abode to crocodiles and many other aquatic creatures. So, utmost care is being taken to ensure that the reptiles aren’t disturbed,” said Shailesh Naik, deputy municipal commissioner. The civic body and forest officials had conducted a three-day survey in the 16m stretch of the river that passes through the city. The river is home to over 270 crocodiles. “The forest officials said that the dens won’t be having eggs now. But the areas where crocodile dens are located are being left out of the clean-up drive. Our teams aren’t venturing in the spots where the reptile presence is high,” Naik said. VMC initiated the river cleaning drive wherein the shrubs and plants on the river bank are being removed to ensure smooth flow of water. The soil on the river bank is also being levelled and garbage is being cleared. “We have asked the civic officials to not conduct the cleaning exercise in the morning as it is basking time for the reptiles. VMC men are working between 12 pm to 4 pm. Our team accompanies the VMC men during the drive,” said a forest official.  Raj Bhavsar of Gujarat Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (GSPCA), however, said, “This is not the right time to clean up the river as it is breeding time for the reptiles. Many of the crocodiles may become aggressive to protect their little ones. Such a cleaning drive will damage the crocodile dens and it is possible that the disturbed reptiles may venture out of the river.” “Crocodile is a protected reptile and the civic body can’t just enter its abode and start cleaning up the riverbank. They need permission from the wildlife warden. We plan to issue a notice to the civic body and the forest department for starting this drive without proper permissions,” said Vishal Thakur of the Canine Group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/croc-dens-not-being-disturbed-during-vishwamitri-clean-up/articleshow/84325066.cms||Tushar Tere

The state accumulated 5.9 lakh Covid-19 cases in May alone, equivalent to 35% of the cumulative cases that had surfaced in the state by then. The nearly 640 Covid-19 hospitals buckled under the pressure of the unprecedented surge in transmission levels. For instance, there were only 433 vacant oxygen beds on May 17 with patients in major cities trying in vain for a bed at several hospitals. Now, there are over 15,000 unoccupied oxygen beds and only some 300 hospitals serving Covid-19 patients. The case positivity rate has dropped to the 3% range from the peak of about 25% in mid-May. Covid-19 recoveries have continued to outnumber fresh cases for the last 50 days, starting from May 23. About 3.5 lakh new Covid-19 cases surfaced in the last 50 days, while the state recorded 5.3 lakh recoveries during the same time. The active caseload plummeted to 28,680 on Sunday from the peak of 2.11 lakh cases on May 17. Meanwhile, the state recorded 2,665 Covid-19 cases on Sunday, taking the cumulative caseload to 19,22,843. The toll increased to 13,002 as 16 more patients succumbed to the pandemic. Preparing for the third wave, the health department has decided to expand 104 call centre services to all urban local bodies and mandals across the state. The health department has identified about 50 community health centres and area hospitals to offer treatment in the third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/recoveries-outpace-fresh-cases-for-50th-straight-day/articleshow/84326521.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

While for microfinance loans, it is back at 66.9% from 63.6% and for small business loans it is back at 85.1% from 76.8%.Its MD P N Vasudevan, “The Bank’s borrowers are largely in the informal segments dealing in daily use products and services which were temporarily disrupted due to the Covid-19 restrictions imposed. However, during June, states in the West and North experienced improved collection efficiencies as lockdowns eased while Southern states opened up towards the end of the month. We anticipate a sharp improvement in collections in the coming months as Covid wave recedes.”For Indian Overseas Bank, the loan collection efficiency rate for small loans, vehicle and housing loans has improved to 85% between June and July from 70%-75% in May.

Police did not pay heed to Udayabhanu’s requests that he was going to visit the project and not the power plant. Although Pulichintala project is located in Andhra Pradesh, the main entry to the project site is provided via Telangana. The situation at Pulichintala project has turned volatile since the Telangana government started power generation at the plant without giving any indent to AP. According to the AP government, Telangana’s decision has resulted in wastage of nearly 1 tmc water into sea. After waiting for over half an hour for police clearance, Udayabhanu routed his convoy to Maktyala village in his constituency from where he took a boat to reach Madipadu in Guntur district before reaching Pulichintala project. Speaking to the media at the project site, Udayabhanu criticised Telangana police for creating unnecessary tension between the states. He lashed out at Telangana government for blocking the road for visitors to Pulichintala project. “Our chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy is trying to continue the cordial relationship with Telangana. However, Telangana leaders are not cooperating to ease the tension,” said Udayabhanu. He said that the Telangana government had taken a unilateral decision to utilise water from Pulichintala project for power generation without giving prior information to the AP government. He said that Pulichintala project was constructed only to meet the irrigation needs of the Krishna delta and not power generation. He said Telangana had so far wasted nearly 30 tmc from Srisailam, Nagarjuna Sagar and Pulichintala prjojects. “One tmc of water is sufficient to cultivate about 10,000 acres. Telangana leaders should keep in mind ordeal of upland farmers in both states before making provocative statements,” said Udayabhanu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/t-cops-thwart-mlas-visit-to-pulichintala/articleshow/84326705.cms||Samdani MN
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: One-way airfare to Canada costs students 10% of total course fee||AHMEDABAD: Parents of Chetan Khatri (name changed), a Ghatlodia resident, were in for a shock when they started checking the availability of flights to Canada. “I have got admission in a PG diploma course for business management at a reputable university in Canada for the Fall semester (starting from September). I need to be there by the last week of August,” said Khatri. He has the entire course fees of Rs 20 lakh whereas the current one-way airfare by airline carriers is Rs 1.75 lakh to Rs 2 lakh – accounting to 10% of the total course fees. “The tickets were costing between Rs 50,000 and Rs 70,000 in January this year. While it was still costly, we justified it due to the prevailing Covid conditions. But air fares rising three times is too much when the majority of the passengers during this time are only foreign-bound students,” said Khatri's father. “As he has already secured the admission, we would have no option but to shell out the money, but it is not fair," the father felt. It’s not just students – even the regular passengers are also bearing the brunt. Naranpura resident Subhash Ghonchala said that a one-way ticket for his daughter-in-law from Ahmedabad to reach Toronto, Canada on July 5 cost Rs 1.77 lakh which was three times the conventional ticket price of average Rs 70,000. “More than the money, she and her small baby had to go to Toronato via Belgrade in Serbia where there was a mandatory stay of 2 nights and one day to get the RT-PCR test done. So, she went from Ahmedabad to Toronto via Mumbai-Frankfurt-Belgrade-Frankfurt- Toronto,” said Ghonchala. Sanket Patel (name changed), 21, said that he had deferred his travel to Canada due to the second wave in May. “My visa expires in December. While I’ll still wait for a month to get the economic deal, what if the third wave starts or Canada changes its rules? There’s a strong buzz that there would be relaxation in some categories announced in the last week of July, but it’s always a gamble,” he said. “Getting the visa was a great feeling, but it’s now turning into desperation.” Travel and visa consultant Sabina Advani said that Covid-19 specific sanctions imposed by various countries have pushed the travel duration and cost of travellers, especially students. “Countries like Canada do not accept Indian RT-PCR reports mandating travel via third countries for RT-PCR reports. For the US, currently there is a 14-day quarantine in a third country hotel. We are hopeful of Maldives and Dubai opening post July 15 which would be preferred by Indian travellers due to easy availability of Indian food,” says Advani. Due to these rules, travellers are going via Mexico, Belgrade and Armenia currently where 14-day quarantine stay with meals pushes the ticket price to upwards of Rs 1.75 lakh on confirmed flights. Sameer Yadav, a city-based student visa and immigration consultant, said that there are a few sites offering cheaper tickets. “But often the travellers are not going for it – the chances of cancellation of flights are high. Currently there are no direct flights to Canada due to Covid regulations, and most are taking detours. While the cancellation amount comes back, it cannot help the students who have to reach Canada in a time-bound manner,” he said. "There are no less than 10 students with me who are waiting for the availability of tickets to reach Canada any time soon."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/one-way-airfare-to-canada-coststudents-10-of-total-course-fee/articleshow/84328700.cms||Parth Shastri

Amit Shah, who is on a three-day visit to home state Gujarat, said this on Sunday while laying foundation stones of projects worth Rs 244 in Ahmedabad and surrounding areas which fall under the Gandhinagar Lok Sabha constituency, which he represents as MP. He said the government has started a massive work of providing a 'suraksha kavach' (protective shield) against the coronavirus by taking up the vaccination drive. “I am pleased to inform you that around 86 % of those aged above 45 and 32 % of people in the age group of 18 to 45 have been vaccinated in Ahmedabad. But, this is not enough,” he said. The remaining 14 % in the 45 plus age group and 70 % youths (in the 18-44 age group) should get vaccinated and all should take their second doses also. “This will provide protection to all,” he said. Shah said although there was a shortage of oxygen in the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Union government has taken up the task of setting up oxygen plants in hospitals and substantially augment the production capacity of the life-saving gas. He asked BJP workers to ensure everybody in their area is vaccinated. The BJP leader also advised party workers to fight vaccine hesitancy and spread the message that the medicine (against Covid-19) is safe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/86-amdavadis-above-45-vaccinated-says-shah/articleshow/84328665.cms||---
---||Surat||Gujarat: Second wave dulls fear of corona among the lawless||SURAT: Fear of Covid seemed to have lost its sting among the criminal minded during the the second wave unlike in the first wave of the pandemic. While there was considerable drop in the number of gambling and prohibition cases during lockdown and fear of killer virus during 2020 in the city, the number of cases this time around has gone back to 2019’s pre-Covid times. Cocking a snook at social distancing norms, gambling activities never ceased in the city. Compared to 355 gambling cases in January to May 2019, police registered 390 cases this year for the same period. In these cases, 2,018 accused were arrested against 2,110 in 2019. In case of bootlegging, spirits were literally high among the crafty bootleggers who innovated their ways to smuggle in liquor. In January to May 2019 police had registered 790 cases under prohibition Act for selling Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL), while in 2021 total 703 cases were registered. In the first five months of 2019, 1,001 bootleggers were arrested, while this year 966 persons were caught ferrying liquor illicitly. Not only IMFL, even country liquor figures show a rise in the second wave. It should be noted that gambling and liquor dens are hubs that see large gatherings.  A booze party held in Man Darwaja tenement was believed to be the trigger of the first wave in the city, according to senior health officials. Apart from the arrests for gambling and bootlegging, police fined 78,508 people for not wearing masks and collected Rs 7.85 crore penalty between April and May this year. “The numbers itself shows that police took strict actions against all criminal activities. We ensured that people do not get involved in any activities that can spread infection,” said city police commissioner Ajay Tomar. “Both gambling and liquor are addictions. The addicts would try to get it at any cost, even their life. Addicts have more liking for their addiction compared to their life,” said Rudresh Vyar, head of psychology department, MTB Arts College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/second-wave-dulls-fear-of-corona-among-the-lawless/articleshow/84325576.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

However contact services sectors including travel, hospitality, and conventional retail are still recovering, with the expectation of return of buoyancy for the rest of the year if the pace of vaccination continues and the pandemic is contained. TimesJobs’ monthly RecruiteX index showed that the healthcare and pharmaceuticals sector posted maximum talent demand to ramp up resources in the industry in preparation of tackling a third wave of Covid-19. These witnessed a maximum growth of 18% in talent demand in June compared to May. On an overall basis, June recorded 5% MoM and 11% YoY growth in talent demand, as per RecruiteX. Manufacturing, IT/Telecom, BFSI, and petrochemicals are other gainers as the economy limps back to normalcy. Jobs portal Naukri.com in its monthly JobSpeak Index noted that hiring trends grew by 15% in June vis-a-vis May, going up to 2,359 in June from 2,047 in May. “The strong recovery of the hiring sector at 15% in June, close on the heels of a decline in May, is encouraging. Hiring in the IT sector has seen a 5% sequential month-on-month growth and more than 52% increase from June 2019,” Pawan Goyal, chief business officer, Naukri.com said. Tech hiring has remained relatively insular to the pandemic thanks to digitization push. On a YoY basis, hiring in the tech sector grew 163% in June. Hiring has also picked up in Insurance (+87%), Banking/Financial Services (74%), and Pharma/Biotech (+38%), Naukri’s data shows. Staffing firm Xpheno noted a 32% rise in hiring action in June over May 2021. “With over 2,70,000 active white collar jobs, June has emerged as the second top month for 2021 after the 2,90,000 active openings registered in March 2021,” the firm said. The growth in active job openings in June was powered by the IT services sector with a 37% growth over May. “The technology sector was the top contributor at 81% of the job count in June. Right now, there is a huge supply-demand friction in the industry due to rising digitisation and because the IT services, IT products, global captives and startups are all dipping into the same tech talent pool,” Kamal Karanth, founder of Xpheno, said. A significant proportion of new roles posted across industries involves a fair bit of technology element, Sashi Kumar, MD, Indeed India, said. BFSI, e-commerce, IT, and healthcare have robust requirements but sectors such as travel/hospitality and beauty/wellness are down around 52% and 60% respectively, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/job-market-gets-a-boost-injune-as-economy-opens-up/articleshow/84328660.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Teaching and non-teaching staff will attend duties at the schools and take up online classes. The sudden spike in Covid-19 cases had forced the school education department to stop classes in March 2021. The education department, which is firm on starting the new academic year, decided to reopen schools after August 15. In the meantime, the officials decided to take up bridge courses and introduction classes through the online mode for a month from Monday. However, educationalists and teachers’ associations have expressed doubts on conducting online classes successfully. Many students in rural areas do not have access to internet connectivity though many have smart devices such as mobile phones and tablets. “Online classes need good internet connectivity. It is viable in urban areas. But students in rural and tribal areas will have to face problems. Many poor students don’t have smart phones and don’t have knowledge about applications. Government should provide proper connectivity and awareness before starting online classes,” said A Ravichandra, state president of PDSU. Education officials said they are using easy to use applications such as Google Meet to conduct online classes for students. “Work sheets will be distributed to the students and weekly meetings will be conducted to rectify their doubts. Students can directly visit schools and interact with their class teachers. School uniforms, textbooks, shoes, workbooks and other materials will be distributed shortly,” principal secretary B Rajasekhar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/teachers-across-state-to-take-e-classes-from-school-today/articleshow/84326617.cms||Venu Lanka

Rajak described their meeting as personal. It was the first meeting of a senior RJD leader with Chirag after Lalu’s son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav offered the Jamui MP to join the opposition camp. The meeting also assumes significance as Chirag suspended his ‘ashirwad yatra’ abruptly on Friday and rushed to Delhi after the Delhi high court rejected his petition against the Lok Sabha Speaker’s decision to recognise his uncle and Hajipur MP Pashupati Kumar Pras as the LJP parliamentary party leader in the House. Paras was subsequently made food processing industries minister in the Union cabinet despite Chirag’s opposition. The state president of Chirag faction of LJP, Raju Tiwari, said his leader was seeking legal opinion against the high court’s decision. “Chirag will resume his ‘yatra’ on July 16,” Tiwari said. Before his meeting with Chirag, Rajak also met RJD chief Lalu Prasad, who is recuperating at the residence of his elder daughter Misa Bharti, a Rajya Sabha member. Both Chirag and Rajak belong to the scheduled castes. Both Chirag and Tejashwi have predicted the fall of the NDA government government in Bihar. Chirag also said mid-term poll in the state appeared to be imminent due to internal conflict between BJP and JD(U). Sources said Rajak also met Congress’s in-charge of Bihar Bhakt Charan Das and former Congress MP Meira Kumar, another scheduled caste. JD(U) chief spokesperson Neeraj Kumar, however, described both Chirag and Tejashwi as ‘Funka hua kartoos’ (used cartridges), which have no use. To drive home his point, Neeraj referred to the last assembly poll results when Chirag’s LJP and Tejashwi’s RJD contested against the NDA. “There is no match for CM Nitish Kumar, who has a vision and is also hardworking,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-leaders-meeting-with-chirag-in-delhi-triggers-speculations/articleshow/84324933.cms||Ramashankar

Streetlights, neon signs, and illumination of buildings cast the jaundiced pallor, blocking Amdavadis’ view of the glimmering canvas of the cosmos. A study led by IIT-Kharagpur; School of Planning and Architecture, Bhopal; and ITM University, Gwalior, has focused on severe light pollution. The study said that over the airport and Maninagar in Ahmedabad, the nighttime sky is even worse, assuming the flaming orange hue. Track the pollution level in your cityAmong 10 large cities analyzed by the study, Ahmedabad stands sixth in light pollution and Surat takes the eighth spot. Above them lie New Delhi, Hyderabad, Bangalore, and Mumbai in that order. In Ahmedabad, the sky turns yellowish in areas such as Bodakdev, Satyagraha Society, Sarkhej, Corporate Road, and Jodhpur Tekra. In Bopal-Ghuma, the sky appears greyish. To spot stars, one will have to travel 6km north from Sanand. Moving towards Nidhrad, Chandrasan, Dodar, Kanjari, Kunvar, Mankol, Vasan, Jetalpur, or Khoraj, one will notice the sky clearing up and stars will become visible. The study said that 45% of the city’s sky registers light pollution in the range of 13-25 nano-watts per centimetre square per steradian (nano-watts/cm2/sr). Another 40% records 25-50 nano-watts/cm2/sr. The sky over the airport and Maninagar has the worst reading, at 50-100 nano-watts/cm2/sr. The researchers are Tanya Kaur Bedi (IIT-Kharagpur), Kshama Puntambekar (SPA, Bhopal), and Sonal Singh (ITM, Gwalior). They have cited a 2020 study of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The US study said that each kilowatt of electric energy releases 1.3 pounds of carbon dioxide gas, 2gm of sulphur dioxide, and 1.60gm of nitrogen dioxide gas into the atmosphere. Bedi told TOI: “Very few studies are underway in the field of light pollution.” Bedi added: “In fact, light pollution has been rising especially in New Delhi, Gujarat, West Bengal, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh from 2003 to 2013.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/yellow-veil-dims-stars-in-75-of-abad-sky/articleshow/84328784.cms||Paul John
---||Delhi||Delhi: Extortion racket busted, 2 engineers & MBA graduate held||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has busted an extortion racket and arrested a software engineer, an MBA graduate and a computer engineer-turned spa owner for blackmailing mostly businessmen, possibly over a dozen, after filming them in objectionable positions. Shalini (29), the software engineer, lost her job last year during the lockdown and joined the gang. She would attract middle-aged businessmen on Tinder by swiping right, meeting them at hotels and film the targets in compromising postures using a hidden camera attached to her handbag, said Alok Kumar, joint commissioner of police (crime). Later, the three would blackmail the victims by threatening to send the pictures and videos to their families. Most paid up fearing a scandal. This time, they asked for Rs 1 crore from a victim, but he approached the crime branch instead. Dating trap: How a swipe to right netted over a dozenShalini was aspiring to make it big in life. A software engineer by profession, she was hoping to get a promotion last year but Covid-19 struck. She first faced a pay cut and then lost her job. She shared her ordeal with her friend Aryan Dixit (28), an MBA graduate from Noida currently living in Chhatarpur Enclave. Dixit had a friend called Rajkishore Singh (31) living in DLF III in Gurgaon. He was a computer engineer as well and came to Delhi from Bihar in 2012 and was arrested for molesting and threatening his love interest in CP in 2013. Singh soon quit his job to run a spa with his friends and soon started recruiting girls as escorts. As expenses rose, Singh started blackmailing businessmen to shell out money by threatening to implicate them in false rape cases. Dixit, who had once availed Singh's spa services, joined hands with him in the business as well. He discussed Shalini's problems with Singh after which he suggested she could be roped in the gang. According to police, Shalini agreed and made a profile on Tinder and began to "swipe right" to businessmen in the age group of 40-50 having business background and then trap them in hotels. Dixit and Singh would then threaten them with their photos and videos. To hide their tracks, they used social media sites to contact the victims. Fearing their reputation, the victims, most often than not, paid up and did not complain. The last target, though, filed a police complaint. The cops filed an FIR of extortion and formed a team under inspectors Arun Sindhu and Dinesh Kumar to investigate. "A lot of technical and manual information was collected and analysed after which the instruments used for blackmail and location of the suspects was identified. Singh was subsequently apprehended from Gurgaon. During interrogation, he revealed the role of the other two," joint CP Kumar added. Dixit and Shalini were subsequently arrested as well. Two handbags fitted with spycam, memory cards, USB Pen Drive, laptop containing videos/pictures of victims and six mobile phones used in crime was recovered from the two. The cops are now investigating to ascertain the exact number of victims that were targeted by the gang. Initial questioning and recovered evidence suggests there were over a dozen victims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/extortion-racket-busted-2-engineers-mba-grad-held/articleshow/84332259.cms||---

During the days of lockdown last year, the CCSE (counter child sexual exploitation) unit of the state police had monitored and found that websites offering child sex abusive material (CSAM) that used to have 600 hits per hour on any day, increased steeply to 1,300-1,400 hits per hour in the state. “There was an alarming increase in the number of those accessing child pornographic material on the web, which in all probability would also had an impact on the increased sexual abuse of children,” said ADGP (headquarters) Manoj Abraham, who supervises the CCSE unit. National human rights commission had last year conducted a webinar exclusively on this topic, and had suggested several steps to the state for creating awareness among children. These included discussing with and making children aware of their bodies and sexual expression through sex education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/over-600-child-rape-cases-filed-till-may-this-year-in-state/articleshow/84327672.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Mumbai||Over 75% parents in Maharashtra want schools to reopen: Survey||MUMBAI: More than three-fourths of parents across the state indicated that they were in favour of schools reopening in a statewide survey that had nearly 2.5 lakh respondents. Highlighting the digital divide, parents in rural and urban areas differed in proportion on the question of whether it is time to switch back to physical classrooms. While 88% of parents in villages are in favour of schools resuming proper classes, the corresponding proportion in cities is 78%. The results are part of an online survey by the State Council of Educational Research and Training to assess parents’ willingness to allow children to return to a physical classroom. Not surprisingly, parents in rural and semi-urban areas, with poor power and internet infrastructure, are keener than their city counterparts for schools to reopen. Of the 2.5 lakh parents across the state who participated in the survey, 1,40,424 were from rural Maharashtra, 1,00,727 from cities and the rest from semi-urban areas.  Apart from a widening learning gap, online-only classes have resulted in higher dropout rates, especially of girls, a corresponding increase in child labour and caused mental health issues, particularly in villages. Rural students suffered higher loss of learning because of poor internet connectivity. The reopening of schools will be decided by seven-member committees set up in villages that have been Covid-free for a month. Along with keeping Covid protocols in place, parental consent is a must to start physical schools. Classes each day cannot exceed four hours and only main subjects will have to be taught. Each class should not have more than 20 students and attendance is not compulsory. The permissions will be for Classes VIII-XII. Though the survey was restricted to finding out if parents were willing to send their children to school, the fear of a third wave persists. Parents and teachers told TOI that all teaching and non-teaching staff should be vaccinated before reopening schools. In rural areas, parents and teachers want schools to reopen for all classes. In Mumbai, all schools have been online since last year. While few schools may reopen from July 15 in rural areas, a decision regarding starting degree colleges offline is still to be taken by the state. Higher education minister Uday Samant said last week that degree colleges were unlikely to start for at least a month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/over-75-parents-in-the-state-want-schools-to-reopen-in-mumbai-survey/articleshow/84329892.cms||Sandhya Nair

The NCB team, led by zonal director Sameer Wankhede, also found groups of youths, including teenagers, indulging in illegal activities and rounded 15 of them. The youths were issued a warning and brought face to face with their parents. “We counselled the youths, aged between 15 and 20, about the ill effects of drug abuse.

If implemented, Mascarenhas said, the concept would be the first of its kind in India, “as restoration, conservation and management initiatives of coastal sand dunes are rarely attempted, and still in their infancy”. The concept of sand dune parks, Mascarenhas said, was approved by the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) in 2015 and by the Goa State Biodiversity Board (GSBB) in 2017, for which four specific sites at Mandrem, Morjim, Agonda and Galgibaga were chosen. Miramar was also considered. However, no efforts were made towards its execution. “Establishment of notified coastal ecosystems would put Goa in the forefront in the conservation of (degraded) coastal sand dunes. This scheme does not involve any major financial commitment, except for plantation programmes and fencing for protection of dune flora,” Mascarenhas said. Stating that such landscapes would facilitate researchers in studying natural distribution and evolution of dune flora and fauna in space and time, Mascarenhas said that the dune parks could also serve as natural nurseries/laboratories to understand the role and functions of sandy coasts and its vegetation. Pointing out that Goa’s entire sandy coast was characterised by linear dune fields of variable heights and dimensions, Mascarenhas said that the geomorphic features were found in various stages of degradation. “However, the dune mapping by the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management(NCSCM) is full of discrepancies. These flaws need urgent consideration, revision and (re)mapping considering ground realities,” Mascarenhas said in his written submission. Stressing that a robust CZMP must contain a dune conservation and restoration package, Mascarenhas suggested a three-pronged approach towards conservation of sand dunes — conserve natural, healthy dunes with sparse vegetation at all costs, initiate aggressive plantation programs on degraded dunes, rebuild/recreate/rejuvenate lost dunes by known dune-building methods. Summing up his submission, Mascarenhas said that coast of Goa needed “wide/high beaches for the complete attenuation and dissipation of onrushing powerful sea waves, tall/massive sand dunes so that marine incursions into the hinterland can be blocked or avoided, and dense dune vegetation that acts as sand binders, curtails movement of sand by wind, reduces erosion of pioneer dune face, ensures total stability of dune complexes, and consequently contributes towards the protection and conservation of the beach–dune ecosystem.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dune-mapping-in-draft-czmp-has-flaws-needs-revision-scientist/articleshow/84327848.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

Overcoming the grief and irreparable loss, Lunawat and his family has now set up an NGO in the loving memory of Snehal, a dentist who was associated with SMBT College at Dhamangaon in Nashik. “My late daughter had a deep passion for the betterment of society and for the very cause she chose to become a doctor. While she is no more with us due to unfortunate chain of events, we decided to fulfil her dream by setting up an NGO for the benefit of underprivileged students,” Lunawat said. Named as Dr Snehal Lunawat Education and Research Foundation, the NGO has carried out a slew of welfare activities including free health check up of girl students from Bhagwan Baba Balika Ashram, distribution of free meals to needy and poor and tree plantation drives. Snehal was vaccinated against Covid-19 on January 28 and started having a headache from February 3. She left for Gurgaon for attending an important workshop where her health started deteriorating and needed hospitalization.

During the action, police have collected a total fine of over Rs 66 lakh from the violators. Going a step ahead, during the same period city police registered 2,658 cases under IPC section 188 (disobeying orders duly promulgated by authority), for violating Covid-related norms, including social distancing. All these cases are independent of the special squads formed by Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) as well as the district administration for similar purposes. Aurangabad commissioner of police Nikhil Gupta said, “We do not believe in using any kind of force against the citizens caught violating Covid-19 norms.” Due to the considerate view taken by city police, barring one incident, there has not been any ugly instance of friction between police and the citizens during the second wave, eventually making it easier for us to implement restrictions, Gupta said. The officer said that those who paid fine for either not wearing or inappropriately wearing of mask at public places, included several policemen. The RTPC to commissioner of police, while being on field, have imposed fine on 47 such violators. All these actions have been taken between February and June this year. Of all the 17 police stations, Satara police station slapped fine on 2,165 violators, followed by Jawaharnagar police station with 1,671 cases and 1,386 by Cantonment police station. The police stations of Waluj, MIDC Waluj and Daulatabad police station recorded zero cases. Though MIDC Waluj police did not slap fine on those failing to wear masks, it registered 318 cases against people for violation of Covid-19 norms,” said a senior police officer.

AAP’s corporation in-charge, Durgesh Pathak, said the party had given BJP 24 hours on Saturday to solve the water problem. He said AAP was protesting as Delhi was facing a shortage of 100MGD water every day. “On Saturday, we told BJP’s Delhi president Adesh Gupta that if he does not solve this problem, his water connection will be disconnected. But BJP has not taken any step,” Pathak said. AAP youth wing in-charge Rohit Lakra, Delhi unit president Ramesh Matiala and MLA Rajkumar Anand were also present at the demonstration.

---||Nagpur||New drugs, local production may prove game changer||In big change since the second wave, availability of medicines, new therapies and enhanced manufacturing capacity might aid in tackling the projected third waveNagpur: The most difficult phase in the second wave of Covid-19 was when hospitals faced acute shortage of drugs like Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and most importantly — oxygen. In case third waves hits, most of these issues have already been fixed. Moreover, doctors and administration too now better understand which medicine/drug/ injection is more in demand and when. Local manufacturers have built up capacity to manufacture these injections on mass level. Medicine distribution on administrative as well as private level is possible now. Most relieving fact is that many new medicines/drugs have received Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) approval for emergency use. “We have antibody cocktail available for high risk population, for which we had to wait and observe in initial two waves,” said Dr Ashwini Tayade, infectious disease specialist. Indicated for restricted use in emergency cases, the cocktail can treat mild-to-moderate Covid-19 in adults and paediatric patients who are at increased risk of developing severe disease and do not need oxygen. In May 2021, the Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO) granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to the antibody cocktail in the India. Cipla is marketing it in country. Cipla has noted that the cocktail demonstrated ability to lower the risk of hospitalisation and death by 70% and cut down symptom duration by four days.Intensive care specialist Dr Nirmal Jaiswal is also principal investigator for the stem cell therapy trial, final phase of which is to be initiated in probable third wave. “The therapy has shown fabulous results in initial phases of human trial. We are hopeful, it will be a game changer in third wave,” said Dr Jaiswal. Pharmacists want proper distribution of new medicines. “Virafin of Zydus Cadila can play important role in third wave. The government should make adequate supply of Virafin across the country,” said pharmacist Kailas Tandale, who heads Maharashtra Registered Pharmacists Association (MRPA). “Apart from the medicines, government should approve more vaccines to speed up the inoculation and allow pharmacists to stock the doses for open market sale,” he said. Another important drug 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) has been commercially launched in India ahead of the third wave on June 28. 2-DG was developed by Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Sciences (INMAS), a laboratory of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), in collaboration with Dr Reddy’s. It’s an oral drug. It can be administered to hospitalised moderate to severe Covid patients. DRDO has claimed that the medicine is effective against all variants of the virus. “Ideally, 2-DG should be prescribed as early as possible by doctors for moderate to severe Covid patients for a maximum duration of up to 10 days,” reads DRDO guidelines on 2-DG. A senior member of district Covid task force told TOI that the most important medicine for Covid-19 patients is oxygen. “Be it Favipiravir or Remdesivir or Tocilizumab — no medicine has proven mortality benefits in Covid-19.

---||Delhi||Physical PTM at Delhi govt schools from July 19 to 30||New Delhi: Following the latest round of Covid lockdown relaxations on Sunday, Delhi government schools will conduct parent-teacher meetings (PTMs) physically, but in a staggered manner between July 19 and 30. Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Sunday removed academic and training activities from the list of completely-prohibited activities. It has allowed use of auditoriums and assembly halls at educational institutions for academic training and meetings at up to 50% seating capacity, along with all Covid-appropriate behaviour. The schools and all other educational institutions will, however, remain closed and teaching-learning activities will continue in the online mode. “This notification by DDMA provides an opportunity to the educational institutions to resume their academic preparation, including trainings, meetings for reopening whenever the situation improves. This decision will also give boost to ongoing education projects of Delhi government like teachers’ trainings in offline mode in a phased manner,” said a statement issued by the government. The scheduled PTMs are meant mostly for students transitioning from corporation schools in Class VI to Delhi government schools. The meetings will be held jointly by teachers of both schools. “These meetings can provide an opportunity to the schools to get the views of parents on school reopening as well,” the statement added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/physical-ptm-at-delhi-govt-schools-from-july-19-to-30/articleshow/84330033.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Delhi: Woman trying to sell infant for Rs 3.5L caught in decoy operation||NEW DELHI: In a case that indicates an ongoing racket involving trafficking and sale of infants, a woman was caught red handed on Friday, during a decoy operation steered by National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, when she tried to strike a deal to sell a less than a week old baby girl for Rs 3.5 lakh. The child was rescued and sent to a children’s home. An FIR has been registered at the Paschim Vihar (West) police station under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Juvenile Justice Act pertaining to trafficking and inflicting cruelty on a child. Acting on a tip-off, NCPCR chief Priyank Kanoongo led a decoy operation posing as a customer and presenting himself as the brother of a woman in need of a baby. The Anti Human Trafficking Unit of the Delhi Police was part of the operation. It is learnt that that during the preliminary interrogation, the accused identified as Priyanka revealed that she works as an agent with a diagnostic centre for the purpose of surrogacy. “Prime facie, the involvement of nursing homes, diagnostic centres, doctors, the agency responsible for issue of birth certificate etc., with the racket involved in trafficking and selling of children including infants, cannot be ruled out,” Kanoongo said. The NCPCR chief said that he was apprehensive that such activities might be taking place at a larger scale in Delhi and therefore the commission will be inquiring into this and taking action. According to the case details shared by NCPCR, a complaint was received regarding a trafficking racket selling children including infants operated by one Kavya alias Komal in west Delhi area. The commission was informed that she was planning to sell a baby girl who was just about 2- 3 days old. “Acting on the information we planned a decoy operation. The woman Kavya was contacted on her mobile from a mobile number of an NCPCR official and she said that she was ready to sell the baby girl for an amount of Rs 3.5 lakh. She called us near the Nihal Vihar Sai Baba temple, to see the baby with an advance of Rs 25,000 and told us to pay the remaining amount of Rs 3.25 lakh when the baby is handed over,” Kanoongo shared. Kanoongo along with two officials from NCPCR reached the spot after informing AHTU (West) about the decoy operation plan. Kanoongo was asked by the woman to reach the Sai Baba temple, Pashim Vihar (West) and she shared the mobile number of one Priyanka and also the details of a Google Pay account. The team of NCPCR and AHTU, Delhi Police reached the spot. Priyanka was contacted on her mobile and she came to the spot after some time with the baby girl. Kanoongo in the disguise of a decoy customer met Priyanka to see the baby. The accused Priyanka asked for an advance of Rs 25,000 and was caught red handed by the police. “We will be following up on the case, any more arrests made and the investigation with the police on Monday,” Kanoongo added. The FIR (TOI has a copy) records the sequence of the operation as part of Kanoongo’s statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/woman-trying-to-sell-infant-for-rs-3-5l-caught-in-decoy-op/articleshow/84327976.cms||Ambika Pandit

Formulated in 2015, the scheme was extended in February this year till March-end. “The government is pleased to extend the validity of the scheme’s exit policy for distressed beneficiaries under CMRY VKRY to September 30,” finance under-secretary Pranab Bhat said. The exit policy offers CMRY and VKRY beneficiaries, who have suffered some disability or of those who have lost their lives, a chance to close the loan account. In some cases, based on recommendations of EDC’s task force committee, it offers a waiver of outstanding dues. EDC Ltd has been supporting entrepreneurs through the CMRY scheme since 2001 and though the repayment rate remains over 90%, in some cases, borrowers and entrepreneurs have not been able to repay their loan due to factors beyond their control, such as death, disability, natural calamities, serious illnesses or adverse market conditions.

He made it clear during a news conference in Thiruvananthapuram on Sunday. He said he was not afraid of any kind of investigation and he was ready to appear before anyone, anywhere. However, if the investigation is going as planned by the CPM, then there will be strong reaction against such kind of investigation, he said. He said he has informed the police team that he would appear before them at Thrissur Police Club at 10:30am on Wednesday. The investigation team had first issued a notice asking him to appear on June 6. However, he did not appear as the BJP state committee meeting was scheduled on that day. He was again served a notice on July 2 at his house in Kozhikode. The case is that Dharmarajan, who had lodged a complaint regarding the robbery that took place on April 3, had reportedly contacted eight BJP leaders, including Surendran, from the crime scene. The investigators, who checked Dharmarajan’s call list, said that he had also contacted Surendran’s son and BJP general secretary in-charge of the organisational affairs Ganesh. At least Rs 3.5 crore that was allegedly meant for BJP’s election campaign, was robbed in Kodakara. The probe team had arrested 21 accused in the hawala heist case and recovered Rs 1.25 crore till now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/bjp-state-chief-to-appear-before-cops-on-wednesday/articleshow/84327929.cms||---
---||Thane||Maharashtra: Family feud rocks 30-storey tower with helipad||KALYAN: The 30-storey premium Mohan Altezza building project in Kalyan is mired in a family feud. Mahesh Lalchandani, brother of developer Jitendra Lalchandani who constructed the luxury tower, has moved Bombay HC against his brother, claiming several building violations in the project. Mohan Altezza is the only building in Kalyan with a helipad. The petitioner (Mahesh Lalchandani), also a builder, said he has procured documents from Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) which suggest that the developer has committed several violations. Meanwhile, Jitendra alleged that ever since he separated from his brother 13 years ago, he (Mahesh) has been filing false cases to blackmail him for money. “When I learnt my brother is cheating customers with illegal constructions, I obtained details related to the project and then complained to KDMC,” Mahesh told TOI. According to Mahesh, the refuge area, servant room, servants’ toilet has not been built on each floor of the A, B and C wings of the building and the common passage area has been illegally taken into the flats. After Mahesh’s complaint, the KDMC issued a notice to the builder, after which the builder through his architect wrote to the KDMC seeking to regularise the illegal work by revising the building plan. Mahesh said KDMC did not pursue the matter and he was forced to approach the court last week. He has asked the court to direct the agencies to act against all partners of Mohan Group involved in the project under the MRTP Act and sought demolition of the illegal constructions. “The developer made illegal constructions in the internal areas which we cannot demolish and, hence, we have decided to charge a fine to regularise them,” Maruti Rathod, additional town planner of KDMC said. “My project is completely legal and as per the plan approved by KDMC,” Mohan Group MD, Jitendra, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-family-feud-rocks-30-storey-tower-with-helipad/articleshow/84330096.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Ahmedabad||Lights keep insomnia burning bright||AHMEDABAD: Not many institutions have studied the impact of night-time light pollution on individuals, trees, birds, and insects in our cities. But a collaborative study of IIT-Kharagpur; School of Planning and Architecture, Bhopal; and ITM University, Gwalior, has cited research on night-time lights suppressing melatonin, the sleep hormone, and causing insomnia. “An hour-long exposure to midnight lighting ranging from 3,000 lux to 200 lux can suppress melatonin by 71% and 16% respectively,” the study says. A 39-minute exposure to light from a normal incandescent bulb at home causes human melatonin levels to dip by 50%. Fluorescent light takes 15 minutes and white LED takes 13 minutes to suppress melatonin to that level, the study says. Coming back to light pollution in Indian cities, the study developed a brightness index ranging from 0 to 100 nano-watts/cm2/steradian. The study found that Delhi had the maximum area under light pollution. The second was Hyderabad, followed by Bengaluru, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Pune, Jaipur, and Surat. The study posits that the area under the “white range”, very high light pollution, scores 100 or more. Hyderabad showed considerable light pollution. The area beneath the orange range, or falling in the 25-50 band, has Delhi again on the top, followed by Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Pune, and Surat. The light pollution maps for Indian cities were prepared using high-resolution satellite imagery. The study also suggests measures to control light pollution. “New buildings should not include the use of glass that produces horizontally-polarized light,” the study says. “Furthermore, asphalt road surfaces near environmentally sensitive zones can be converted to a non-polarizing substance by incorporating a comparatively rough surface on the top or by the usage of granules to scatter light.” The study says that trees with large canopies can be considered in landscaping to help reduce glare and to reflect light towards the sky.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/lights-keep-insomnia-burning-bright/articleshow/84327903.cms||Paul John
---||Ahmedabad||Chandlodia-B station to decongest Kalupur||AHMEDABAD: The Western Railway in a bid to decongest the Kalupur railway station has developed Chandlodia-B station to divert trains coming to Saurashtra from north India. These trains usually went to Sabarmati or Kalupur stations. The Chandlodia-B station has been developed at project cost of Rs 4.5 crore, and at present the station will have only one platform with all passenger amenities. Railway officials said that this new arrangement will be time-saving for those passengers travelling from Kutch-Saurashtra for north India. Officials said trains coming from Rajkot, Surendranagar, will reach Chandlodia-B station via Ambli. The distance will be 6km from Ambli, and from Chandlodia-B the trains will head to Khodiyar station and then head to Kalol via Gandhinagar or move directly to Kalol. This will save at least an hour of travel and 30 minutes of wait at Kalupur station for passengers, and also save fuel for the railways. Currently, the trains went to Kalupur as Sabarmati did not have the facility to change engines, which requires an additional line between platforms. The officials said that for passengers who want to board trains going to Delhi from Saurashtra can do so from Chandlodia-B station and a stoppage will also be given for deboarding. The station can be expanded further if the number of trains to north India from Saurashtra increase, said officials who added that the railways has also renovated the Ambli station for use as an alternative in the future. Once normalcy is restored after the pandemic, authorities plans to have more trains originating from Sabarmati station. At present, several special trains have Sabarmati station as their final destination. With authorities planning to start metro services by August next year, reaching Sabarmati station will become easier, said officials, as both Kalupur and Sabarmati stations will have easy access and links to the metro. Currently, the railways has 150 trains passing through or originating daily from Kalupur station, and some trains need to be diverted to ease the load. Trains for north India may originate from Sabarmati in the coming days, said railway officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/chandlodia-b-station-to-decongest-kalupur/articleshow/84327932.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
---||Nagpur||Gadkari family’s Manas Group gets licence to operate fuel outlets||NAGPUR: Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, inaugurated the country’s first commercial liquified natural gas (LNG) filling station at Nagpur on Sunday, saying he has already asked the government to privatize the sector. “Now, we have invited all private companies, including PSUs, in the field. Even you can import LNG,” he said. The LNG filling station at Dighori Outer Ring Road was also the brainchild of Gadkari, who convinced the management of Baidyanath Group, which has already diversified into solar energy, to start the new venture. The company has traditionally been into making ayurvedic medicines. Gadkari also mentioned that his son’s Manas Group has also got a licence for petrol, diesel, LNG and CNG pumps. Manas Group is headed by one his two sons, Sarang Gadkari. This has emerged from the erstwhile Purti Group floated by Gadkari. His other son Nikhil Gadkari heads CIAN Agro, which is a listed company. Manas Group is into blending of ethanol with petrol, apart from interests in other green energy businesses. Gadkari has earlier said in public forums that the turnover of his sons’ business has already touched Rs1,300 crore. A spokesperson for Manas Group later told TOI that they are in advanced stage of getting a clearance for starting fuel dispensation stations. After that they can begin allotting filling stations in the name of Manas, like pumps allotted by IOC, BPCL or HPCL. The objective behind the plan is to promote green fuel alternatives in the market, the official said. Gadkari said LNG is the future of the transport industry and his dream was to have bio-LNG manufacturers also. Batting for the economic advantage of LNG, the minister said data says that the average cost of conversion into an LNG engine is Rs10 lakh. Trucks run for around 98,000 km in a year, so after conversion into LNG there will be savings of Rs11 lakh per vehicle in 9-10 months. With this, the cost of conversion can be easily recovered. Again referring to his family’s business, he said, “In Vidarbha, we are making 2 lakh litres of bio-ethanol per day. In your scooter and cars, 10% of ethanol is added, which is made in our sugar factory.” Now, the government has increased the ethanol level to 22%, which will lead to a huge demand for ethanol. We are also making 18 tonnes of CNG and the ultimate dream is to convert it into LNG as the transport of CNG is difficult, he said. Gadkari said in a recent meeting with machinery manufacturers in construction sector, he asked them to convert their vehicles to any of the alternate fuels at the earliest to reduce imports and boost agriculture. The minister said he has also insisted Western Coal Fields Limited (WCL), a subsidiary of Coal India, to allot a mine for getting coal to make methanol, which is much cheaper than diesel. Pranav Sharma, director of Baidyanath Group, said it will have an early mover advantage in the business. At present there are only a handful vehicles running on LNG as the fuel is largely used for industrial applications. The pump began by filling 12 vehicles belonging to three local transporters which have been converted to LNG. Sharma said the stress will be on converting vehicles into LNG by projecting the economic advantage. Given the fuel cost, the investment in conversion can be recovered within a year, he said. Baidyanath Group plans to have five more LNG dispensation stations in the region, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gadkari-familys-manas-group-gets-licence-to-operate-fuel-outlets/articleshow/84327980.cms||Shishir Arya

Disturbed by continuous, sudden inspections at his garment factory in Kizhakkambalam, he has decided to abandon his Rs 3,500 crore project in Kerala and invest Rs 1,000 crore to set up an apparel park at Kakatiya Mega Textile Park (KMTP) in Warangal, Telangana. “Standing here, I’m telling you, my conscience doesn’t allow me to invest even a rupee (further) in Kerala.” When asked whether he is ready for discussions with the state government, Jacob replied that he was willing to discuss matters, even with a clerk. Jacob made fun of the CPM MLA of Kunnathunad and Congress MLAs of Perumbavoor, Muvattupuzha, Thrikkakara, Ernakulam, and Chalakudy MP Benny Behanan for making him explore opportunities outside Kerala. “For this (investing in Telangana), I’m most obliged to Kunnathunad MLA. Apart from him, there are four other MLAs and an MP from Ernakulam who were behind this. They made me understand what being business-friendly really means and also for teaching how an industrialist can earn crores of rupees,” he said. Jacob declined to comment on the criticism by CM Pinarayi Vijayan, and opposition leader V D Satheesan. “The chief minister commands a certain position in my mind and he has the authority to criticize or scold me. And I will never refute him or comment on his words,” he added. Kitex team received a warm, royal reception in Telangana, Jacob said. “We visited two places – a textile park at Warangal and a general one in Hyderabad. With the industries minister, we held two rounds of discussions and finally had a round of discussions with top-level bureaucrats before leaving. During the first phase, we are planning to invest Rs 1,000 crore - that is the word we have given [to the govt of Telangana]. Next, we have to evaluate the technical and other aspects there, which we are planning to complete within a period of two weeks. Then we will decide whether to have further investments,” he said. When asked about the call from Union MoS (electronics and IT) Rajeev Chandrasekhar, he said, “During our 15-minute talk, he gave me an invite for discussions with Karnataka CM for investments there. I have replied that I will ring him, once I am back in Kerala”.

Hundreds of people, including women, had gathered at the spot when the police arrived with Arjun, 22, the accused in the case at the child’s house in the estate lane. One of them slapped him on the face while another tried to attack him with a machete breaking the police security. However, the police brought the situation under control and went on to recreate the crime scene using a dummy of the victim. The accused explained to the police how he killed the child and hung the body inside the room using a rope. He also showed them how he escaped through the small window after committing the crime. The police said his custody would end on Monday and more evidence would have to be collected. The minor was found hanging at her home on June 30. Initially, it appeared that the girl might have accidentally got entangled in the rope while playing but the autopsy report indicated that she was subjected to severe sexual abuse for a prolonged period of time. Subsequently, the police arrested Arjun, a DYFI activist, who also lives in the same estate lane in connection with the incident. The police said the child’s parents used to go for work in the morning and Arjun frequented the house in their absence to abuse the child. As he was close to the family it was not initially suspected that he was involved in the crime. “He sexually abused the girl regularly after offering her chocolates. Even the day he murdered her he bought chocolates for her from a nearby shop,” said a probe officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/idukki-rape-and-murder-accused-faces-locals-ire/articleshow/84327988.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: Received letter threatening death, says Mayookha Johny||THRISSUR: Olympian Mayookha Johny, who has filed a complaint against the alleged rape of her friend, has said she has received a death threat through an anonymous letter. She said she suspected the associates of the rape accused could be behind the threat. She, however, said she would pursue the complaint despite such threats. Mayookha said the letter was received by post, and the sender had made it clear that she would be killed if she pursued the complaint of rape of her friend. Addressing Mayookha as “Chattaakkari” (long jumper), the writer has threatened that her leg would be hacked. It also contained sentences hurting the dignity of her as a woman, she alleged. She said she and her family were not at home for a couple of days, and the letter was received from the neighbours, when they returned on Friday. Mayookha said she had sent the copy of the letter to the senior police officers, including the DGP, ADGP (crime branch) and Thrissur range DIG. She said the past activities of the associates of the accused indicate that they were capable of executing the threats they had wielded. Mayookha had alleged earlier that the police were not taking effective action in her complaint that her friend was raped. She had also alleged that the accused, Chunkath Johnson, hailing from Chalakudy, Muringoor, was having immense financial, religious and political clout and had been blackmailing and threatening her (Mayookha) as well as the complainant. However, friends of Johnson have refuted the allegations levelled by the Olympian. They said the allegations were being fabricated as a sequel to the disputes in the ‘independent Catholic Church’ called ‘Emperor Emmanuel Church’, based out of Muriyad near Chalakudy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/received-letter-threatening-death-says-mayookha/articleshow/84328057.cms||---

However, schools, colleges, coaching institutes, etc will remain closed as no physical classes are allowed. Only distance learning is permitted. Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), in an order issued on Sunday, stated that prohibition on opening of cinema halls, swimming pools, amusement parks and any kind of public gathering, etc would remain. Delhi Metro and public transport buses would also have to keep operating with only 50% seating capacity and no standing passengers. Last Sunday, DDMA had allowed stadiums and sports complexes to reopen, but without spectators. A gradual unlock process was initiated on May 31. Two weeks ago, gyms and yoga institutes were allowed to reopen with 50% capacity and weddings were allowed to take place in banquet halls, marriage halls and hotels with a ceiling of 50 people. Delhi Gym Association, however, was unhappy regarding the Graded Response Action Plan for Covid-19, where gyms would be closed in the yellow zone if the positivity rate reached 0.5%. “Gyms will be the first entity to be closed whereas parks, restaurants, bars, etc will be allowed to function at 50% occupancy,” the association’s vice-president Chirag Sethi said. “Why are gyms always targeted when there is no evidence of the virus spreading from them? Our livelihood is the first one to be hit and the last one to open,” said Sethi, adding that the association had written to LG Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal regarding this issue. Requesting DDMA to reconsider and allow gyms to open at 50% occupancy in the yellow zone, Sethi said, “The decision has created panic in the fitness industry, which has already suffered a lot during the past few months. This decision will have an adverse impact and the industry might collapse since property owners are sceptical about renting space since a closure order can come anytime.” The stringent restrictions on the carrying capacity of Delhi Metro trains and public transport buses have resulted in hapless commuters being compelled to wait for nearly an hour on average to enter busy stations during peak hours and bus stops also remain crowded during rush hour. Around 6pm on Friday, the average waiting time to enter Rajiv Chowk Metro Station was 52 minutes. Even on Sunday, the average waiting time at 6pm was 38 minutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/schools-to-open-for-meets-not-classes/articleshow/84330294.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Kochi||Govt frames special rules for police band recruitment||Thiruvananthapuram: The government has finally woken up to the decade-long demand of the police force to frame special rules for recruitment towards police band, an integral part of all the state ceremonial functions including the Republic Day and the Independence Day. The government has framed special rules titled Kerala police subordinate service (band and mounted police units) special rules, 2021, for the recruitment towards various categories of posts in the band and the mounted police units. TOI had on April 12 published a story on how the police band would soon become extinct (“Police band may end on a sad note”) in this regard. As per the special rules, the government will recruit bugler and drummer in the ranks of sub-inspector, head constable and constables in the police band. “The special rules have fulfilled the decade-old demand of the police battalion. In the absence of special rules, we were unable to grant eligible promotions and also unable to recruit fresh talent into the band units. These rules will provide a fresh lease of life to the police band and open up job avenues for eligible musicians,” said ADGP (armed police battalion) K Padmakumar. The existing strength of the police band members against the sanctioned strength is only 33.8%, which will get reduced to zero in another two years as all of them are on the verge of retirement, as the recruitment to this category has been frozen. The recruitment was on a standstill since 2006, and the government in 2011, decided to hand over the recruitment to the public service commission (PSC). The PSC had then asked the government to frame the special rules for the recruitment, which has been stuck in the red tape since then. The police band is a separate category for which the recruitment is conducted on the basis of a different set of criteria unlike in the case of recruitment of regular policemen. The members recruited are not part of any other policing functions. After their recruitment, they are given training in basic policing for six months, after which they are trained in playing marching tunes for the force. At present, there are nine bands in the state -- one each in Malabar special police, special armed police, all the five battalions of Kerala armed police, rapid response and rescue force and the armed reserve, Thiruvananthapuram. The sanctioned strength of police bands in eight units (except district AR, Thiruvananthapuram) is 245, of which the existing strength is only 83. Though every band team is supposed to have 22 members, none of them has the required number, and two of them have only six members each, though the sanctioned strength in those units are 35 each.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-frames-special-rules-for-police-band-recruitment/articleshow/84325694.cms||KP Saikiran

A section of the media had reported that Sarith had given a statement in court that the prison superintendent and other officials had forced him to state that Ramesh Chennithala had links to gold smuggling. This is a revenge as the then opposition leader had raised several key issues of public interest against the LDF government and those behind this move are trying to drag his name into this matter, he said. The public has a clear knowledge that it is the chief minister’s office and his confidants who have ties with the gold smuggling accused. Civil society clearly knows where the probe would reach if the gold smuggling case is investigated impartially. He demanded that Sarith should immediately be shifted from central prison and action should be initiated against those who attempted such a move. Chennithala said that the reports that Sarith stated in the court that prison authorities forced him to depose against Congress leaders show that the government will go to any extent to topple the case. Chennithala claimed this would not happen without the knowledge or concurrence of CM Pinarayi Vijayan who is in charge of prisons and that he should clarify on the matter. Chennithala claimed that the accused have already named the chief minister in the scheme of events and if the name of the opposition leader is also dragged into it, those behind this would have thought that they can save the CM. The government itself is trying to fabricate false evidence to topple the case and there should be an independent probe in the matter, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/sariths-confession-on-cong-leaders-shocking/articleshow/84328167.cms||---

True to the huge pre-match build-up witnessed in the state where arch rivalry between Brazil and Argentina fans runs as deep as the state’s political schisms, the clash of the Latin American soccer giants turned out to more than a usual match. Jubilant fans came out to the streets and took out bike rallies waving Argentine flags at many places in Malabar soon after their living legend Lionel Messi lifted the Copa America trophy. The victory was celebrated by Argentina fans at many places by distributing sweets, biriyani and payasam. After the initial public celebratory burst, the revelries shifted to the virtual realm. Even before the kickoff, WhatsApp groups had got started flooding with live updates of the match progress along with a surfeit of trolls, comments and tit-for-tat responses by fans of rival teams. With the 22nd minute strike by Angel Di Maria bulging the Brazil net, ecstatic roars and chants of Vamos Argentina erupted from the coastal residential neighbourhood of Nainan Valappu in Kozhikode, which is the epicentre of football excitement in the state. Many Brazil fans went teary eyed when their heartthrob Neymar broke down in tears kneeling on the ground. Even the match defining gesture of Messi hugging a sobbing Neymar failed to take away the sting out of the long-standing rivalry as Argentine fans continued to troll the Brazilian supporters. Argentina fan and former minister and senior CPM leader, M M Mani were among those who posted a string of messages on Facebook taunting the vanquished Brazil team like ‘Nammade Brazil Padamayi’ (Our Brazil is finished). “If it were not for the Covid situation, it would have been a day-long celebration involving thousands. Messi laying hands on the Copa America cup that too in Maracana was poetic justice. To celebrate it, Argentina fans are distributing free biriyani for dinner in the village tonight,” N V Subair, president of Nainan Valappu Football Fans Association, said. Former Indian captain I M Vijayan watched the game in Kochi along with former Kerala team captain T Asif Sahir, both sporting Argentinian colours. “I am very happy that Messi was able to win the cup. After all that he had achieved in his career, it would have been sad if he could not have won it,” Vijayan said. There were also funny instances like Areakode native Sunil, an ardent Brazil fan, having had to shave off half his moustache in public after he lost his bet against the local Argentina fans. Sunil later opted for a clean shaven look. Meanwhile, two youths in Malappuram suffered burn injuries while bursting crackers at Tanalur. Kannarayil Ijaz and Poochengal Siraj have been admitted to Kozhikode medical college hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/field-day-for-argentina-fans-in-state/articleshow/84325731.cms||---

He said in a statement that a clause in the state government notification that prescribes DPharm as the minimum qualification to apply for pharmacist posts in government sector has been causing problems. “The state government should chalk out a scheme which should benefit both DPharm and BPharm holders to apply for the posts of pharmacists in government health centres,” he said adding that the rules allowing only DPharm holders to apply for the post came into existence during 1963-1965. Though BPharm was introduced in 1975, no change was made in the provision thus creating trouble for degree holders, he said. The statement comes in the wake of the recent notification for the recruitment of 4,624 paramedical staff including 1,235 pharmacists in government health institutions. Dismissing the state’s reason that BPharm holders have more job opportunities, Anbumani argued that BPharm graduates are more qualified than DPharm holders. He also pointed out that more than 5,000 posts of pharmacists were lying vacant in medical college hospitals, GHs and PHCs while BPharm holders can only apply for the available 140 drug inspector posts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/consider-bpharm-grads-also-for-posts-of-pharmacist/articleshow/84328170.cms||---

The prosecution case was that the four petitioners along with others belonging to Abdul Kalam Latchiya India Party carried out a protest without prior permission against the bogus institutions and blocked the road disrupting traffic in Dindigul on April 14, 2016. Based on a complaint from the sub inspector of police, Dindigul Town North police registered a case against the protesters under sections 188, 143 and 145 of IPC. The police also filed the final report which was taken cognizance of by the Dindigul judicial magistrate II court. The four petitioners had filed the petition seeking to quash this report. Justice G Ilangovan observed that for taking cognizance of offence under Section 143 of IPC, the ingredients under Section 141 of IPC must be brought on record. It appears that the petitioners and others staged a protest to initiate necessary action against bogus nursing and para medical colleges which spoiled the life of the students in question. The Madras High Court observed that there is no material on record or collected during the investigation to show that the agitation ended in violence. Hence, the ingredients of offence under Section 141 of IPC are not applicable to the present occurrence. The judge said that in Section 145 of IPC, the words “unlawful assembly” are mentioned. The petitioners and others held the agitation with an intention to safeguard the future of students and hence it should not be considered as unlawful assembly. “Registration of case and filing of final report may not be considered to be proper since the right of agitation has been recognized and that too conducting the agitation without any violence cannot be considered to be per se illegal,” observed the judge. Though only four people had approached the Madras High Court, the judge quashed the final report in its entirety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/protest-to-safeguard-students-not-unlawful-hc/articleshow/84328162.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Though he cleared the rope climbing, he ended up making a foul in all three attempts of long jump as he had sustained injuries in his right leg two days before that. As he was disqualified, he filed a petition before HC Madurai bench seeking to reconduct the physical efficiency test for him. However, the single judge dismissed the petition challenging which he filed the present appeal. A division bench of Justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that Thirumurugan participated in the selection process without disclosing the injury on his leg. The medical certificate produced by him was also seen to be genuine. However, it is unfortunate that the selection process was already completed when the appellant filed the petition before the single judge after five months in March. Since the provisional list was published, the judges observed that the petitioner cannot claim to re-conduct the physical efficiency for him. “It is for the appellant to keep him fit for the test at the time of selection. The appellant has no vested right to claim to re-conduct the test for him. The clock cannot be set back again,” observed the judges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/court-rejects-candidates-plea-to-reconduct-physical-efficiency-test/articleshow/84328214.cms||---

The woman was rushed to a private hospital in the area and was later shifted to the government hospital at Jayankondam. But the doctors at the hospital declared her dead on arrival. Acting on a complaint from a family member of the woman, police booked a case against Krishnaveni. Police are also interrogating whether the ‘lover’, who was said to be a married man, was also present during the illegal act. The nurse is yet to be arrested, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/woman-27-bleeds-to-death-after-illegal-abortion/articleshow/84328233.cms||---

The average test positivity rate in the state stood at 0.26% in the week between July 4 and 10. According to the data compiled by the Social Development for Communities Foundation, an organisation closely tracking the Covid-19 scenario in the Himalayan state, the state had previously recorded a test positivity rate of 0.35% between March 19 and 25. This assumes significance as the hill state tested more samples for Covid-19 this week as compared to the previous few weeks. Meanwhile, Uttarakhand recorded 42 fresh Covid-19 infections on Sunday. This was the second consecutive day when less than 50 cases surfaced in the state. The cumulative case tally stood at 3,41,179 on Sunday. However, the state recorded a Covid-related fatality after a gap of four days on Sunday. With this, the cumulative toll of the virus has shot up to 7,339 in Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-records-its-lowest-ever-weekly-positivity-rate-of-0-26/articleshow/84325773.cms||---

As the Covid-19 vaccine is still not available for children, the routine drive of Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) will be implemented effectively so that newborns get protection against pneumonia and similar bacterial diseases. District health administrations of all districts in Vidarbha will launch a Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) drive from July 12 to reduce fatalities among children due to pneumonia. In Nagpur district, the drive will start in next 3-4 days, said District health officer Dr Deepak Selokar. “We have completed the training of the health workers and ready with the doses of this vaccine which prevents newborns from pneumonia. However, the date from which the drive will start in Nagpur district is yet not declared,” said Dr Selokar. Districts like Akola, Yavatmal and Buldhana will start the vaccination drive on July 12 itself. Doctors said that this drive will also boost children’s immunity during the Covid-19 pandemic and also during the projected third wave. Children aged below 1 year will be covered. The state government will be supplying doses for these vaccines. Earlier, it was not involved in the government immunization table, but since 2017, the government has made this vaccine available for free of cost. The market cost of this vaccine is more than Rs5,000 per dose. Three doses are to be administered with first during sixth week of birth, second during 14th week and third (booster dose) in 9th month. The government is bearing the cost of at least Rs 15,000 for every child during this drive. Nagpur’s Civil Surgeon Dr Devendra Paturkar said that the immunization sites have been finalized and dates will be announced soon.“The PCV acts against pneumonia-causing bacteria. As there is no Covid vaccine for children and as a precautionary measure against a possible third wave, the PCV would act as the first line of defense,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/newborns-to-get-pneumococcal-vaccine-free-of-cost-this-week/articleshow/84328266.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

He said the minister was beating around the bush while responding to complaints of paddy getting spoiled and commissions being collected at DPCs. “Instead of clarifying on the interference of touts and delay in procurement at DPCs, the minister said they increased the number of DPCs and thus procured more paddy in the last two months,” said Krishnamurthy “Media and news outlets showed procurement of 500 sacks of paddy in Pudukottai and 10,000 sacks of paddy getting drenched in Ranipet. They exposed it with pictures of over 30,000 sacks of paddy getting drenched due to delay in procurement in several districts. So, I appeal to the minister to safeguard the farmers instead of giving excuses for the issue,” said Krishnamurthy. He added that it was natural that paddy procurement will be higher during the harvest season and mentioned that the measures taken by the former chief minister resulted in agriculture flourishing in Tamil Nadu. On the increase in number of DPCs as claimed by the food minister, Krishnamurthy said that opening and closing of DPCs according to requirements was nothing new.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/aiadmk-ticks-off-food-min-for-evading-eps-charge-on-dpcs/articleshow/84328207.cms||---
---||Kochi||‘Covid curbs deterring fight to save democracy’||Thrissur: Eminent lawyer and activist Prashant Bhushan has alleged that the government was imposing unnecessary and illegal restrictions on the people in the name of Covid-19 and this has become a major factor in dampening the intensity of protests against virtual emasculation of democracy going on in the country. Delivering the Chinta Ravi memorial lecture online on Saturday, Bhushan said, “Time has come for the people to come out to the streets to protest, defying the Covid lockdowns and 144 restrictions, against the ongoing systematic and continuous attack on the basic features of the Constitution and rule of law”. “In my view, Covid is of course a problem, but there are even more serious problems than Covid. If you see the collateral damage that is being done by these lockdowns and other restrictions, it is more serious than Covid. Therefore, time has come for the people to gear up, get up and fight to reclaim our Republic,” he said. Bhushan said all the basic principles of the Indian Constitution are under threat now. “Laws are being passed in Parliament within minutes, without any significant discussions. Even the farm laws are being passed within minutes. The practice of referring the bills to Parliamentary standing committees has been done away in many cases. This has reduced even the limited public participation in the making of the laws,” he said.  Bhushan alleged that the independence of the institutions like the Election Commission, CAG, NIA, Enforcement Directorate and CBI has been seriously compromised. Attempts are being made to influence even the judiciary and the media through overt and covert methods, he alleged. R Vaigai, advocate of Madras High Court, who also spoke at the event, said in the case of CAA, the state has gone completely against the Constitutional scheme of secularism. “CAA recognizes religion as a basis for discrimination. In my opinion, no law can be made by Parliament which can lay foundation on religion as a basis to divide or discriminate people. Therefore CAA is a complete negation of the constitutional values,” she said. Chairman of Chinta Ravindran Foundation and writer Shashi Kumar and advocate Kaleeswaram Raj were among those who spoke on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/covid-curbs-deterring-fight-to-save-democracy/articleshow/84325768.cms||---

Some organizers said their pujas this year might be low key, even compared to 2020 when the festival was celebrated with several restrictions though many pandals attracted huge crowds. From Chetla Agrani and Ekdalia Evergreen in south Kolkata to College Square and Kumartuli Park in north Kolkata, organizers have decided to make several changes in the way the festival is celebrated after the second wave. “We will follow the guidelines set by the state, keeping the safety of everybody in mind. It has already been decided that we are going to scale it down several notches this year. The size of the idol and the pandal will be considerably smaller compared to that of previous years,” said Arijit Roy, executive member of Chetla Agrani, a Durga Puja spearheaded by former mayor of Kolkata and transport minister Firhad Hakim. The puja at College Square will step into its 75th year and it is a big occasion for the organizers and locals. But organizers have decided to keep the proceedings low key. “The priority is safety and preventing the transmission of the virus. The idol is going to be less than 10 feet in height. We will also follow the other guidelines laid down by the government,” said club general secretary Bikash Mazumdar. Forum for Durgotsab, an umbrella body of Durga Puja organizers in Kolkata and the districts, has drawn up a list of safety measures which it plans to share with the state. “Durga Puja is intrinsic to our culture and an emotion of the people of the state. The puja must be organized, but all possible safety measures must be in place keeping in mind that the pandemic is not over. We have requested organizers to scale down celebrations and get their members and other staff vaccinated. There are other guidelines, too, which we wish to share with the government,” said Saswata Basu, general secretary of Forum for Durgotsab. While at big-ticket pujas, like those in Mohammad Ali Park, Ekdalia, Suruchi Sangha, Kumartuli Park and Tala, the organizers are busy incorporating changes to adhere to safety measures against Covid, several block committees in Salt Lake and New Town have decided to make changes to keep the celebrations very low key and avoid crowding at the pandals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/from-big-ticket-pujas-to-neighbourhood-clubs-organizers-plan-low-key-celebrations/articleshow/84328284.cms||Zeeshan Javed

These oxygen banks will be run by the state health department. The oxygen concentrators will be provided to the needy patients on the basis of doctor’s prescription. Not only Covid, patients but also those suffering from neurological problems or other lung diseases will be able to get oxygen concentrators from these banks. During the second Covid wave, a lot of NGOs and social workers put their efforts to provide oxygen concentrators to patients at homes, in case they did not find a bed in hospital. But it is for the first time that the state government has taken a decision on creating oxygen banks in all the districts. “We are preparing a detailed guideline on oxygen banks. It will help the patients undergoing treatment at home,” said Siddharth Mahajan, secretary (health). In the guidelines, the health department will define whether the service would be free of cost or the health department will give it on rent. Also, it will be defined how a patient at home can avail the benefit. Directions for preparing the guidelines were issued during a meeting held on June 29 chaired by principal secretary, health department. During second wave of Covid, the health department had to work hard for providing oxygen for patients facing difficulty in breathing. Taking lessons from the second wave, the health department is not only ensuring availability of oxygen facilities in rural areas, but also ensuring that patients at home should not face difficulty in getting oxygen concentrators. The state government is taking measures to become self-reliant in oxygen generation as it is planning to produce 1,000 metric tonnes in times to come with oxygen generation plants being set up by various institutions and through other equipment. Medical facilities are being expanded by selecting more than 350 Community Health Centres (CHCs) in the state looking at the apprehensions of a third wave of Covid. Availability of oxygen and other equipment is being ensured at these centres, the officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-run-oxygen-banks-coming-up-across-raj/articleshow/84328267.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

They have also petitioned district collector G S Sameeran in this regard. A Thirunavukarasu, one of the residents, said the road was laid more than five years ago and the stretch was now filled with potholes for about 4km. “A lot of people travelling to Sultanpet use this stretch, where a primary health centre and a few foundries are located. This is the only road for the villagers to take their farm produce to the markets. As the road is damaged, two-wheeler riders often fall down.” Pointing out that there weren’t sufficient street lamps on the stretch, he said it was very difficult to travel on the road during the night hours. “With the onset of monsoon, the potholes are filled with rainwater. As such, it is difficult to spot them. We had made several representations to the panchayat officials to relay the road, but to no avail. So, we have sought the intervention of the district collector on the newly-launched WhatsApp grievance number.” When contacted, a district administration official said the issue would be brought to the notice of the concerned officials to address the same soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/relay-pothole-filled-road-at-selakarichal-collector-told/articleshow/84328276.cms||---

The reptile was rescued from Dumad village and handed over to the forest officials. GSPCA volunteers said that the reptile may have ventured out of Vishwamitri River and crawled into a pool of water by the roadside in Dumad village. Locals spotted the reptile and alerted the GSPCA about its presence. During monsoons, crocodiles often venture out of Vishwamitri River, home to hundreds of reptiles. Dozens of reptiles also live in the ponds across the city and these too migrate from one water body to another during the rainy season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/eight-feet-croc-rescued-from-dumad/articleshow/84325106.cms||---

It has instructed the institutions to inform students and parents about the benefits of opting for skills courses and how this would earn them preference in admission for higher studies and also prepare them for later employment. For now, there are 351 Delhi government schools where courses under the National Skill Qualification Framework are provided. In 101 of them, the courses are funded under the Samagra Siksha scheme and in 250 by the state government. Another 251 schools earlier offered the vocational stream, which has now been upgraded to career-oriented programmes. The special features of the skills subjects have been listed to enable the school head and the career counsellors to provide correct information to the students and parents. The guidelines say: “There is no minimum criterion for opting for skill courses as any student can take up any skill subject(s) offered in Class IX and XI and subsequently, the same subject will also be taught in Class X and XII. Any student passing from Class X can opt for one or more skill subject(s) as the main and/or additional subject(s) in any stream of Class XI under NSQF. The students after completing school education with skill courses under NSQF will have opportunities to enter the world of work through job or self-employment and also have lateral and vertical mobility in higher education to fill the gap between educated and employable.” As an incentive, the guidelines say that any student completing a skilled course at secondary level under NSQF is “not only eligible but will also be given priority in admission under the same NSQF subject at senior secondary level”. Admission to Class XI would be given on priority to students who have passed the same skills subject(s) and the related subject, if available, in the school where the student is seeking the admission. The school heads have been directed to apprise the students of the dual advantage. “CBSE is providing additional skills certificates with the academic certificates to students of Class X and XII, i.e. students are benefited from dual certification after passing one examination as compared to other students,” the guidelines say. Some courses offered are beauty and wellness, healthcare, IT, electronics and hardware, travel and tourism, financial marketing management, security, front office operations, retail and web applications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-schools-bet-big-on-skill-based-courses/articleshow/84328366.cms||Shradha Chettri

The petition was placed before the Supreme Court on Friday in chamber, said advocate general Devidas Pangam. In November 2019, the state filed a review petition in the SC against its February 2018 order that cancelled 88 mining leases, holding their renewal as illegal. The main ground on which the petition was filed was Section 8 of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, pertaining to periods for which mining leases are granted or renewed. The petition states that Section 8A of the MMDR Act says that while all mining leases in the country should be valid for 50 years, for Goa, they should be valid till 2037. Pangam said that the mining case is likely to come up for hearing before the court on July 20. The mining companies had filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the apex court after the high court of Bombay at Goa dismissed their petitions challenging the Goa, Daman and Diu (Abolition and Declaration of Mining Leases) Act, 1987. During the Portuguese era, the mining companies were granted mining concessions, which were then converted into mining leases under the act. The SLP had stated that the Act should be made applicable from 1987, instead of 1961. The state government had also told the Supreme Court that the companies had made a representation to the mines department contending that under the amendment to Section 8A of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, they’re entitled to extend their leases to 2037, but that they would abide by the court’s order. The state had said that the mining concessions were converted into mining leases under the MMDR Act from 1987, and consequently the 50 mining leases would be extended to 2037.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-awaits-review-plea-verdict-on-operations-of-88-cancelled-leases/articleshow/84328272.cms||---

Similar to the CBSE pattern, the academic syllabus will be reduced (by up to 50%) for UBSE students as well.  Last year, too, the syllabus was reduced in view of the disruption due to the pandemic. Uttarakhand education minister Arvind Pandey has asked the department officials to look into the possibilities of holding the UBSE board exams in two phases. The first phase of the exam will be held in November-December and the second in March-April. Meanwhile, all state government-run Atal Utkrisht Schools have received affiliation from the Central Board of Secondary Education. In another significant development, the Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University (HNBGU) has allowed students, who haven't yet filled their examination forms, to do so on July 13 and 14.

---||Trichy||Trichy: Overseas travellers in a fix as vaccine helpline of no use||TRICHY: Travellers to foreign countries who are in need of the second dose of vaccine ahead of their journey are in a fix as calls to the helpline number to get information on vaccination are unanswered. As the NRI vaccination centre for the entire district is also collecting swabs for RT-PCR tests besides offering consultation to pregnant women, health workers sought the vaccination centre to be shifted to a neutral venue. With the easing of the lockdown restrictions across the globe, international passenger movement is picking up momentum with people starting to return to work locations abroad. As several countries have made two doses of vaccination mandatory for immigration, the state health department has identified Periyamilaguparai UPHC in Trichy city to vaccinate international travellers even though the due date was not reached. Travellers were supposed to produce their work or student visas and must have completed at least 28 days since the first dose. Though a helpline number was provided for people to clear their doubts, the mobile phone remains have been switched off for the past few days. People unable to find information about the documents and the timing of the vaccination centre were making frantic enquiries at the UPHCs. “Since the helpline is not working, we visited the UPHC only to be informed that vaccination will be done only on weekdays. Getting just the second jab alone is difficult abroad,” Santhosh Amalraj, an NRI who is trying to vaccinate his spouse, said. People who have booked flight tickets to reunite with their family after being stuck here in lockdown are facing difficulty in getting the second dose. Only students and professionals are allowed to vaccinate, while people making travel plans on dependent visas were denied vaccine shots. With more airlines resuming international flights directly from Trichy, the demand from NRIs is going to increase. Health workers said a well-known neutral venue can be used as a vaccination point for them to avoid confusion in finding the location. “The helpline number was provided by the health department, not from the urban local body,” a senior official with Trichy Corporation said. The civic body said that the grievances of the NRIs will be addressed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/overseas-travellers-in-a-fix-as-vaccine-helpline-of-no-use/articleshow/84328278.cms||Deepak Karthik

The uncertainty regarding the examination dates – mostly medical and engineering entrance tests — and the delay in the announcement of Class XII results lead to lesser enrolment of students at the centres. Besides the huge running costs, including building rent, the hesitation of parents to pay fee without due is another challenge that adds to their struggle. While, many of the small and medium-scale coaching centres have already shut and the remaining centres face closure, most of the leading centres are taking various measures to cut expenditure and survive the pandemic. Most of the centres, which have made additional investment amid the financial loss to ensure seamless online platforms to provide coaching, are now struggling to pay back the loans. Arun Vishwanath, branch head of Akash Institute, Edapally, said that many students have been disheartened and diverted from the studies due to the multiple postponements of the entrance test. But the centres have to provide them support till they write the exams, which gives additional workload to teachers. “They are many students who productively used the lockdown time for studies but now they are fed up with the uncertainty over exam dates and question patterns. Usually, the months of May to August are busy time for most centres as it is time for admissions to new batches. But now less number of students is enrolling. All expenses except electricity and water bills are still the same for centres and it is difficult to survive without steady income. The situation is very bad at many small coaching centres,” Vishwanath said. The uncertainty about when the centres can reopen and resume offline classes is apprehending management to initiate cost-cutting measures like stop leasing out buildings for classroom and reduce the number of staffs including teachers. Moreover, these centres have to spend thousands of rupees in marketing activities, including advertisements, to keep the brand reputation so that they could compete with those portals and applications exclusively dedicated to online education. “The building owners have given waiver last year during the lockdown but this time they are also struggling to survive. We are retaining the office by paying half the rent as it will difficult to lease out a new building in the post pandemic time. Cancellation of admissions and refund of the fees collected is another issue. Though we have given fee concessions and relaxation in deadlines, many parents are not ready to pay the dues. They said we should not collect high fees for online classes. It is very difficult to reduce fees again. If pandemic situation continues, we will have to shut down.” said an official of a centre in Palarivattom.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/entrance-coaching-industry-struggles-to-stay-afloat/articleshow/84328300.cms||Anantha Narayanan K
---||Pune||Bengaluru-based realtor’s pre-arrest bail plea rejected||PUNE: A sessions court here has rejected an anticipatory bail plea by Bengaluru-based realtor Sushil Pandurang Mantri and his wife Snehal in a criminal case registered on February 12. The case was filed by a 74-year-old homebuyer from Wadgaonsheri, who alleged failure to deliver a flat he had booked in 2015 in a project, ‘Vantage’, by Mantri Dwellings Pvt Ltd in Kharadi. He also alleged the firm was not returning the money he had paid as part consideration. The state told the court that the applicants (Mantri couple) have deceived 123 flat buyers of Rs70 crore in the same project by diverting funds for other purposes. “Also, we brought to the court’s notice that the applicants mortgaged the same project to two different private banks to raise over Rs160 crore,” public prosecutor Vishwas Satpute told TOI on Sunday. Sessions judge G G Bhalchandra observed on July 8 that the applicants’ “prima facie involvement is evident” from documents on record. The judge noted that a criminal court in Bengaluru declared Sushil Mantri an “absconding accused” and many criminal cases have been filed against him there. Snehal Mantri too did not cooperate with the investigating officer in violation of the interim protection granted earlier, the court said. The Mantris have establishments in Singapore and Dubai and the possibility of their absconding cannot be ruled out, the court added. The Mantris’ lawyer S K Jain said they were waiting for instructions from his clients’ legal team in Bengaluru about the future course of action. “The court did not consider our valid submissions relating to a RERA appellate tribunal’s directions in this matter, that the interest amount be adjusted at the time of handing over of the flats to the purchasers.” Jain said, “Once the matter had gone to RERA, there was no way the applicants could be prosecuted under the Maharashtra Ownership of Flats Act (MOFA). But the court here did not consider these points.” Mohammad Afzal Ansari, the complainant, had signed an agreement with the firm on August 25, 2015, and paid Rs42.41 lakh of the agreed consideration, for the flat to be delivered by December 2017. The project remains “incomplete”. Ansari’s FIR did not name the Mantri couple, but three of the company representatives. Senior inspector Sunil Jadhav said, “The initial complaint against Mantri and his wife was by 12 flat purchasers. Later, more people approached us, and we recorded their statements also. Many others have approached us, and we will record their statements in due course of time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/realtors-pre-arrest-bail-plea-rejected/articleshow/84328318.cms||Vishwas Kothari

A little more than six lakh people have been vaccinated so far in Madurai, which include a little over one lakh who took the second dose, which was overdue for many. Many people have been trying to get the information on vaccine availability for a few days. As the corporation shared the details on Saturday night, many people started queuing up outside the government hospitals early Sunday. Sundari from Tahsildar Nagar who took her first dose at a special camp in May, has started becoming anxious as her second dose was getting delayed. “My husband registered on the Cowin site, which we did not do for the first dose and managed to get a slot at the Corporation Elango Boy’s Higher Secondary School and took the jab at 3pm,” she said. Deputy director of health services Dr K V Arjun Kumar stated that as many as 6,23,820 people have been vaccinated in Madurai till July 10, which included 1,16,177 people who had received their second doses. As many as 5,07,643 have received the first dose of vaccines in the district. Till date, 51,393 healthcare workers, 28,194 frontline workers and 5,44,233 public including those in the 18-plus category had taken at least one dose of the vaccine.

---||Madurai||Don’t go ahead with vanniar sub quota: MBC/DNT forum||MADURAI: The state government should conduct castewise census soon without making changes to the 20% MBC reservation, and also hold consultations with 115 communities in this category, representatives of 115 MBC/ DNT Communities Joint Action Forum for Social Justice has said. They told reporters here on Sunday that the previous AIADMK government had passed the order for 10.5% sub-reservation for vanniars violating all democratic values for their political gain. The act they passed deprived 68 DNT and 47 MBC communities in the MBC/DNT category of their 20% reservation rights. This led to the defeat of the AIADMK and landslide victory for the DMK in the recent election, as people from these communities voted for the latter. But, now some people are trying to make the government enforce the unjust act. They said that they strongly oppose the 10.5% quota for the vannairs. The representatives included organisers Karthikgai Rajan, Thavamani Devi and advocate A Rajini representing communities such as andipandaram, isai vellalar, uraligowndar, kandarvakottai kallar, kulalar, kuravar, koothappa kallar, thottinaickar, narikuravar, pannaiyar, piramalai kallar and paravar. They said it is legally untenable and impractical to provide quota to all castes. No commission has made any recommendation regarding the population or internal reservation for MBC in Tamil Nadu. A majority of 14 of the 21 members of the Ambasankar Commission had suggested that the government should not accept the population figures projected based on results of the survey undertaken under the commission because its chairman inflated the population figures of his vanniyar caste. They said the Act has been rushed through knowing fully well that the government does not have the power for it under Articles 342A and 366 (26C) of the Constitution and that the legal impunity for the 69% Act had been compromised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/dont-go-ahead-with-vanniar-sub-quota-mbc/dnt-forum/articleshow/84328283.cms||---
---||Jaipur||For 30 lakh population, Jaipur has just 10,000 cops||JAIPUR: The city has witnessed an exponential increase in its population, but the number of policemen guarding people and their properties is woefully short. For an estimated population of over 30 lakh, there are only 10,419 cops in the police commissionerate. This means there is one policeman for nearly 300 people in the city As per the figures accessed by the TOI, there are 12,459 sanctioned posts of which only 10,419 are filled while 2,040 are vacant. As large patches of agricultural plots have turned into new urbanised localities, city police force is yet to be replenished with strength, proportional to its requirement. A total of 663 posts for sub-inspectors (SIs) is sanctioned for the commissionerate, but the city police has only 208 SIs available for the duty as 455 posts are vacant. The difference between sanctioned posts and vacancies is slightly better in the assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs) category where 527 ASIs are present against 706 sanctioned posts. There is still a vacancy for 179 ASIs. Both SIs and ASIs are crucial for the seamless operation of a police station in the city where many thanas have confounding jurisdictions spread over large areas. Similarly, there is a sanctioned vacancy for 2,322 head-constables (HCs) while their present strength is 1,815. In fact, barring posts reserved for IPS, there is a dearth of staff at all other levels. With recently set up police stations in Ramnagariya and Malpura Gate, and several others in the pipeline, the present strength is overstretched. A senior official of the commissionerate said Jaipur police has to patrol highways and alleys that criss-cross the city. The same force has to also guard VIPs, high-security areas, and present at crucial traffic points. “The city police’s mandate as force guarding the state capital includes multiple challenges. For that, the police have to make its presence felt in all areas,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/for-30l-population-city-has-just-10k-cops/articleshow/84328281.cms||---

Meanwhile, Coimbatore collector G S Sameeran, who inspected the Walayar check post, said the caseload came down as a result of the steps taken by the state government. “The total positivity rate has come down to 2.5% from 36.8%. As the caseload is high in some of the districts of Kerala including Palakkad and Trissur, the administration has intensified vigil at the 13 check posts on the border. E-pass is mandatory to enter Coimbatore from Kerala. The pass will be provided only for certain visitors who want to attend functions here and for business and emergency purposes. A team will constantly follow them. Officials from the revenue department along with police department and local bodies have formed teams and keeping vigil round-the-clock,” the collector said. “We urge the public to follow Covid appropriate behaviour, including wearing face masks and maintaining social distance,” he added.

Due to the falling of huge boulders and debris on the road, more than half-a-dozen villages and the Gangotri shrine got cut off from the district headquarters. Soon after the landslide, which occurred around 5 am, the teams of the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) reached the spot and restored the highway by around 1 pm.

The civic body has planned to use funds from the 15th central finance commission (CFC) and has mooted plans to develop infrastructure at all the 18 urban primary health centres (UPHCs) in the city. The civic body was intimated by the state health department and national health mission about the availability of an undisclosed sum through the 15th finance commission. Civic body officials were instructed to prepare proposals for strengthening the urban health infrastructure. The proposals have been made in two categories - movable and immovable. Movable includes medical equipment such as dialysis units and diagnostic equipment, immovables are about adding new buildings to the existing centres and proposing new facilities. The civic body has collected the proposals submitted by the medical officers from 18 UPHCs. A 10,000 square feet community health centre proposed in 2019 at Kodumal for better cardiac and renal health services, made under the smart cities mission, was abandoned mid-way citing fund constraints. “The sum available is yet to be shared but we are ready with the proposals to fulfil the infrastructure demands. Kodumal health centre proposal was also included,” Corporation commissioner S Sivasubramanian told TOI. The civic body added that they are preparing estimates for expanding UPHC campuses by adding new floorspace atop the centres where there is no scope for horizontal expansion. Ramalinga Nagar and Kalkandarkottai health centres have submitted proposals for new buildings since the existing facilities are insufficient. As the health centres here lack adequate infrastructure, the second wave of Covid-19 exposed lapses in the health system. The civic body had to convert a wedding hall as a step-down centre since there were space constraints at UPHCs. Authorities also moved the vaccination drives to spacious venues due to space crunch in UPHCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-plans-to-revive-health-centre-at-kodumal/articleshow/84328313.cms||Deepak Karthik

Officials said while these campiagns are done intensively in Jaipur, this time they are preparing to focus on other districts as well. Transport commissioner Mahendra Soni said, “We regularly try to create awareness about road safety regulations, and during these nine days we will work with police to intensify it. While in Jaipur, this is being done continuously, we will focus in other districts too.” Earlier this year too, the department had run a month-long road safety campaign with an aim to encourage them to be Good Samaritans in addition to promoting rules and regulations about traffic. Experts claimed that one of the primary reasons of traffic violations is lack of knowledge and negligence. The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways had updated the Motor Vehicle Driving Regulations in 2017. However, these regulations never reach the public neither a system has been set up by the government to educate them. The MV Regulations 2017 in the notification gives instructions for both light and heavy vehicles, giving minutest details about the driving rules to be followed including the way of parking, use of indicators, maintaining adequate distance from other vehicles, use of service lanes for heavy vehicles, parking indicators, ways of indicating that a vehicle has broken down, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/road-safety-campaign-to-start-from-july-15/articleshow/84328287.cms||---

Speaking at a Covid sensitization meet titled ‘Agamanir Shure Atanka Jabe Dure’, organized by the Mudiali Shibmandir Puja Committee, he reminded locals that it was during the last Puja that Covid numbers had peaked in Kolkata during the first wave. The club held the khuti puja on Sunday. “Make sure you wear a mask, use sanitizer and keep away from crowds during festivals. Masks are vital in preventing the entire spectrum of respiratory ailments from the humble common cold to severe ailments, like Covid-19, tuberculosis and swine flu,” said Jain. Maintaining Covid precautions will be the priority at all pujas this year, said Shibma-ndir committee secretary Partha Ghosh. “Last year, the High Court had barred entry into pandals and stipulated that idols could only be viewed from a distance of 30 feet. This year it could be the same and we are getting to ready to design our pandal like that. None will be allowed in without a mask and there will be extensive use of sanitizer,” said Ghosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/follow-norms-at-pandals-stay-away-from-crowd/articleshow/84328329.cms||---
---||Kochi||Teachers forced to do odd jobs||KOCHI: Hundreds of teachers who were solely depending on entrance coaching as livelihood have been severely affected by the dip in business in the industry. Many teachers have lost their jobs as the coaching centres had to either shut down operations or resort to job cuts as a cost-cutting measure. The shift to online classes has reduced the demand for teachers, and many centres have cut the staff strength by nearly half. The salary cut is another challenge faced by the teachers. Many of the teachers, who have lost jobs, are now doing odd jobs like selling garments, facemasks and homemade snacks to earn money. “The only source of income for me was my coaching job, and it was a stable one till the pandemic hit. I had been taking classes for many institutes and most of them stopped functioning during the first wave. The remaining ones are struggling to meet running costs due to less number of students. I tried taking online private tuition but, there too, the competition is very high. Now, I am selling facemasks made by my wife, who is a tailor. But the income is not enough to meet the family and children’s education fees,” said Nidhin Omanakuttan, a freelance teacher. Many teachers tried shifting to the online medium by buying projectors, projector screens, classroom writing boards and laptops by spending up to Rs 1 lakh after the pandemic hit. “But many centres now don’t need that many teachers as most of them are using recorded classes by a few teachers to share it with the students. Many brilliant teachers are now jobless,” said a staff of Radiant Centre, Ernakulam. Besides teachers, those running hostels and paying guest facilities exclusively for students are also badly affected by the dip in the industry. All those hostels which had been exclusively built or leased out for student's accommodation are lying vacant for one-and-a-half year, incurring heavy loss to owners. Many hostels have already shut operations, and the buildings have been transformed into lodges. “All the hostels which had tie-ups with us lying vacant. Many have taken loans to expand hostels expecting business as demand for offline classes was high till the lockdown started. Most of them have shut operations,” said Arun Viswanath, branch head of Akash Institute, Edapally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/teachers-forced-to-do-odd-jobs/articleshow/84328330.cms||---

Instead, the officer has reportedly asked the teachers to spend the money from their own salaries. The matter has angered the teachers who went to the chief education officer's office and complained that the officer has asked the teachers to spend Rs 400 each for printing of the worksheets. They further stated that if there is a lack of funds, then the officer should ask the department for it and not the teachers. The department has ordered an inquiry in this matter and has denied any such orders being passed from the state education department. They further stated that such advisory may have been issued in personal capacity by the officer, and no such approval was given by the department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/senior-edu-officer-wants-teachers-to-pay-for-worksheets-irate-association-lodges-complaint/articleshow/84325915.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Pune||Moderate rainfall till July 16 for Pune district, says IMD||PUNE: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Sunday forecast moderate rainfall in the city and across the district till July 16. The IMD also predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall in the ghat areas for next few days. Monsoon became active in the state on July 9. The state’s weather condition is mostly governed by the presence of a trough line from South Punjab to the Bay of Bengal and upper air cyclonic circulation over the Bay of Bengal. “Besides, the westerly winds coming from the Arabian Sea are strong and there is the chance of an off-shore trough formation from north Maharashtra coastal areas to Kerala. Because of these weather conditions, all four meteorological subdivisions of the state are expected to get widespread rainfall till July 16,” said IMD head Anupam Kashyapi. Rainfall activity over the state and Pune district had remained subdued for two days due to the absence of a weather system over the state, said met officials. “From July 12 onwards, all areas of the district are expected to get moderate rainfall. This would activate kharif sowing activity in rural areas,” said a met official. For ghat areas, the IMD officials have advised commuters to maintain vehicle speed, especially on the Pune-Mumbai expressway and the old highway in the ghat areas of the district. “There is a possibility of pothole formation and accumulation of rain water in low lying areas too. Commuters need to be extra careful during their commute,” added the met official. On Sunday, the Shivajinagar observatory recorded 2 mm rainfall while the Lohegaon observatory recorded nil rainfall, as per the IMD report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/moderate-rainfall-till-july-16-for-pune-district-says-imd/articleshow/84328355.cms||Sandip Dighe

Most of the taxi drivers are doing trips to hospitals. Their business is not even 25% of the normal business,” said C P Balaji, joint secretary of All India Tourist Drivers Association. “After the first lockdown, when the situation was turning in favour of us, the state government imposed the second lockdown. It will take a long time to emerge from the financial distress. We are not sure what would happen to us if the government imposes another lockdown.” D Mageshwaran, a tourist vehicle operator who has been in the business for 14 years, said the business usually peaks between April and July, and pilgrimage season between November and January. “We hardly received any booking after lockdown was imposed and the Kerala government limited the number of people visiting Sabarimala,” he said. Assistant secretary of Tourist Vehicle Drivers Welfare Association D Shobinath said that while people would hire vehicles for functions like marriages, not many are coming forward as the state government has limited the number of people attending functions. “We have been receiving only a handful of bookings and that too for cars.” But vehicle operators continue to pay road tax and insurance, apart from taking fitness certificate, said Mageshwaran. “With no source of revenue, most of us have borrowed from private finance companies to pay the tax and insurance, which cost us a few thousands of rupees. Due to lack of support, we have no option but to seek assistance from private financiers who levy a high interest.” The operators urged the government to take steps to waive the tax and to extend term of insurance policies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tourist-vehicle-operators-still-reeling-under-losses/articleshow/84328341.cms||Nivedha Selvam

Acharya Balkrishna, managing director of Patanjali Ayurved, said, “The initial Rs300 to Rs400 crore that may be needed for the project at Nagpur would be pumped in by the company. We can hope that the production may start by December end.” Patanjali Food and Herbal Park Nagpur Private Limited, a company under Patanjali Group, has taken up 232 acres land in the non-SEZ part of Mihan through an auction. The ground-breaking ceremony was held in 2017 but the project could not start within the announced time. Yoga guru Baba Ramdev had declared to start the production soon after the ceremony. However, the work was delayed due to fund crisis and other reasons. On Thursday, Deepak Kapoor, managing director of Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC) which is developing Mihan project, had visited the site. He had directed the company’s officials that production should start by December 2021. Balkrishna told TOI that even as the company is trying to start the plant by the deadline, even the MADC should do its part. Patanjali had already secured an extended deadline upto December 21 this year. Balkrishna said a road connecting Patanjali’s land in Mihan is yet to be constructed. According to him, the construction material can reach the site only after a long detour of 20km from Hingna side. He said a shorter road connecting the plant side from Sumthana village has not been built yet. “Though access to the land is from the SEZ side, the material cannot be moved from there as per rules. Even the power connection required for an indudstiral unit has not been provided,” he said. A senior MADC official in-charge of infrastructure work said there are two roads reaching the side. “Both come till the outer ring road from where Mihan can be reached. Work on the Sumthana road mentioned by Acharya Balkrishna is not directly related to the project,” said the official. The road is part of the infrastructure to be made available for the project affected persons (PAPs) given plots of developed land in ratio of 12.5% of their holdings taken over. According to the official, using the road will certainly reduce the distance by 8 to10 km for reaching the Patanjali site. “Till then the longer route can be used,” said the official. Work on the Sumthana road was delayed because four landowners whose portion of land was to be acquired refused to give it up. The problem has been resolved and their land will be now compulsorily acquired. The official said at present the company has been given power required for a construction site. Industrial connection can be given when the plant is ready. “The company will have to approach MSEDCL for it,” said the offical.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/patanjali-to-invest-rs300cr-for-food-park-from-own-sources/articleshow/84328378.cms||Shishir Arya

Speaking during a temple inspection at Nagapattinam on Saturday, he said a survey in this regard was being undertaken statewide. “District administrations and school managements will convey the basic amenities required in such institutes which will be provided,” Sekar Babu said. He inspected HR&CE’s Anjuvattathamman school near Kizhvelur accompanied by district collector A Arun Thamburaj. Although a few private schools are functioning nearby, the minister said that below-poverty-line families prefer to enrol their wards in HR&CE school. “Students’ enrolment has to be increased in HR&CE schools. We will consider providing smart classrooms and filling existing teaching and non-teaching vacancies in our institutes. The proposals and review report will be brought to the notice of the chief minister for swift execution,” the minister added. There are about five colleges, polytechnic institutes and 44 schools run by HR&CE in the state in which 13,000 college students and more than 35,000 school students are enrolled. While inspecting an arts and science college managed by HR&CE at Poompuhar near Mayiladuthurai, the minister said that steps will be taken to improve the infrastructure of the institutes in a manner that they have better facilities than private institutes. He inspected the antique bronze idols of Rama, Sita and Lakshmana stolen from Sri Rajagopalaswamy temple in Anandamangalam near Porayar. The idols were retrieved and brought back to the temple last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/will-upgrade-edu-institutes-under-hrce-says-min/articleshow/84328332.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Projects of Rs 150 crore planned for police this fiscal||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Incorporation of artificial intelligence for better policing, replacement of 185 various types of vehicles of the force, a separate headquarters building for state crime branch and expediting an integrated complex project for housing all wings of Kochi city police are part of the upcoming plans for the state police in the ongoing year. A government working group that met to discuss the proposals submitted by the state police cleared the proposals under the state police modernization scheme and has issued a detailed order in this regard. The state budget had earmarked Rs 149.5 crore under the scheme. The police will utilize artificial intelligence-based systems for crowd control and surveillance, facial identification, scanning video footage for anomalies, etc, along with expanding the role of Cyberdome which will be the major project for the force in the ongoing financial year. It would also revamp the internal security wing of the state special branch and would provide advanced software and accessories for the social media analysis unit in the wake of increasing cyber threats. The Kerala Anti-Terrorist Squad (KATS) will be equipped with imaging hardware, live forensics, analysis tools, equipment for investigation division, digital repository and analysis, CDR analysis tools, equipment for intelligence and analysis unit, etc. As part of switching over from analog communication system to digital, the state police are setting up the first phase of digital mobile communication system in Palakkad, which will be completed in the current financial year at a cost of Rs 12.88 crore. As many as 185 vehicles will be replaced, that includes 146 light motor vehicles for police stations, 20 for police stations in hilly terrains, buses, water cannons, water tankers, lorries and ambulances. The police department has a fleet of 6,721 vehicles, including motorcycles and boats. A majority of these are allotted to police stations, sub-divisional police officers, control rooms, pink patrol and highway police patrol. According to the police, of these, 2,760 old-model vehicles are ripe for condemnation and urgently need to be replaced. A state-of-the-art headquarters will be constructed for the state crime branch at Muttathara in the capital at a cost of Rs 11.60 crore. Presently, several field offices of the crime branch in the capital are functioning in rented buildings for which a huge amount is being spent. Also, the crime branch’s modernization is stuck due to lack of own facility for the division. The construction will be undertaken in three phases, which will be ready by 2024. Though clearance was given for construction of an integrated complex for Kochi city police last year itself, a proposal for expediting the construction to be completed by 2023 has been cleared. The total expenditure for the proposed complex is Rs 38 crore. The order has specifically instructed that the state police chief should ensure that all purchases should be done only in accordance with existing rules and regulations of store purchase, electronics and information technology department and the public works department. All constructions are to be done after preparing detailed estimates in PRICE software and accredited agencies shall be selected for the implementation of the projects. The award of work should be through a tender either directly by the police department or through an accredited agency, the order says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/projects-of-rs-150cr-planned-for-police-this-fiscal/articleshow/84328362.cms||KP Saikiran

Although the corporation provides temporary solution by clearing water whenever it is reported, they have been unable to find the root cause of it. Residents from Malligai Street and Kumaran Streets say that sewage water overflows from manholes and inundates a part of the road at least once in a week. It takes days for the water to completely dry. J Rajan, a resident of the area said whenever there is heavy overflow, a complaint would be raised and corporation workers would come and clear the water. At the most they will check for blockage in the UGD pipe in the interior street. “The actual problem is either in the main pipeline or the sewage water generated in the areas has exceeded the capacity of the UGD. Appropriate measures should be taken up to solve the issue permanently,” he said. P Vindhya, another resident said that residents often have to involve themselves in arguments among themselves to determine who has to take up the issue with the officials the next time. They have to remind the officials many times before they enter into action. An official from Madurai Corporation said that the root cause of the problem would be identified and required steps will be taken to solve it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sewage-overflow-a-perennial-problem-in-malligai-street/articleshow/84328347.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Mucormycosis claims 303 lives in Karnataka, 34% from Bengaluru||BENGALURU: Mucormycosis, seen as post-Covid infection, has claimed 303 lives in Karnataka so far and 104 of them are from Bengaluru. All the dead had survived Covid-19, but succumbed to the fungal infection. A total of 3,491 patients have been diagnosed with mucormycosis in the state as on July 9, and the fatality rate is 8.6%. Bengaluru Urban district has seen 1,109 cases, followed by Dharwad 279, Vijayapura 208 and Kalaburagi 196. While Bengaluru reported the highest number of deaths, Kalaburagi saw 23 deaths and Dakshina Kannada 20. While exposure to Covid was a common factor, there is no clarity on what led to the fungal infection. Many factors — high sugar levels, steroid usage and a possible effect of Delta variant — are suspected to have contributed to this infection. Mucormycosis as a post-Covid complication is not seen in other countries. Even in India, it is largely restricted to a few states, including Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat. Sources said most deaths occurred in May and early June when there was an acute shortage of anti-fungal medicine, Liposomal Amphotericin B drug, and many patients were given one dose of medicine once in 2-3 days as against the required 5-7 doses a day. “The drug was unavailable. On the presumption that the medicine is better available in government hospitals, many patients were shifted from private to government hospitals. The drug situation eased up only in mid-June,” said a doctor, adding mucormycosis is near-100% fatal if not treated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/mucor-claims-303-lives-in-ktaka-34-from-bluru/articleshow/84332436.cms||Sunitha Rao R

The Union government cannot interfere in the cooperative acts of state, which are passed by the state assembly. So even if a new ministry of cooperation at the Centre, it will not hamper the state’s powers or interests in the sector, NCP chief and former Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar said. “There are talks in the media that newly formed cooperation ministry will cause hindrance to Maharashtra’s cooperative sector. But these talks make no sense,” he said, while speaking to reporters at his residence in Baramati on Sunday. On the lines of the announcement in the Union Budget, the government has formed the new ministry. It aims at providing separate administrative, legal and policy framework to strengthen the cooperative movement across the nation. Pawar ruled out the possibility of the new ministry led by home minister Amit Shah impeding the decision making of the state cooperative sector. He said the key agenda behind formation of the new ministry appears to focus on the multi-state cooperative units. Such utilities are already being monitored by the Union government, hence the ministry is not novel idea, he added. He also said that the Congress party will retain the seat for speaker of the house in Maharashtra state assembly. “It is clear to us that position of speaker of the house was with Congress and it will remain with Congress. So, there is no point if others are talking anything different about it. We have accepted the Congress’s leader as a speaker,” he said. Pawar, on suspension of 12 BJP MLAs from the state assembly following a ruckus, said the action was taken based on what the elected members did in the house. On the Delhi high court’s directives to the Union government on the uniform civil code, Pawar said he will express his opinion once the government comes up with such code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-ministry-wont-affect-state-co-op-dept-says-pawar/articleshow/84328383.cms||---

The minister visited the archaeological site, where the second phase of excavation is underway in Tuticorin, by the Tamil Nadu state archaeology department, on Sunday along with Tuticorin MP Kanimozhi, minister for social welfare and women empowerment P Geetha Jeevan and minister for fisheries Anitha Radhakrishnan and Tuticorin district collector Dr K Senthilraj. He said like Keeladi, Sivagalai and its neighbouring villages were also part of an ancient civilization that had flourished on the banks of the Porunai river. Artefacts like black-red pottery, small iron daggers, tiles with Tamil letters, burnt pottery and Chinese coins have been found here, which are proof of this fact, he said. According to the initial reports of the ASI that conducted excavations in Adhichanallur, it is estimated that that civilization dates back to BCE 850 to BCE 650. There are chances that Sivagalai may be an older civilization and all steps would be taken to ascertain it, Thennarasu said. Many burial urns have been found in two quadrants in close quarters of each other and the skeletal remains from these urns have been sent to the Madurai Kamaraj University for DNA testing, he added. CM Stalin was committed to popularizing our culture and heritage and taking it to the next generation, and steps would be taken to make the Sivagalai site more accessible and also to declare it a protected site, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sivagalai-site-may-add-new-chapter-in-ancient-history-of-tamil-nadu-minister/articleshow/84328379.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 18% GST forces hotels to junk biodegradable packaging||Mumbai: For hotels and restaurants, a higher GST on environment-friendly and biodegradable material is the biggest stumbling block to using cutlery made of bagasse (pulpy fiber extracted from sugarcane juice) for serving and parcels. While bagasse attracts 18% GST, plastic despite being banned comes cheaper with only 5% GST. The taxation is in stark constrast to the government’s own policy to encourage biodegradable packaging. The hotel associations have now demanded that the government reduce the GST on cutlery made of bagasse to make it more affordable to the industry, which is the largest consumer of packaging material, and put an end to use of plastic and thermocol material as mandated by the government itself. Many hotels and restuarants have complained that the high taxation on eco-friendly bagasse, ongoing pandemic and rising fuel prices have reduced their profit margins. Moreoever, since a sizable profit share is given to food delivery aggregators, buying costly biodegradable cutlery is not a very feasible option for them. “As a responsible industry association, we understand the damage use of plastic can cause to the environment and support initiatives and the steps that can reduce dependency on plastics in our packaging and cutlery items. But to incentivize or encourage such switchovers, we request the government to reduce the GST on biodegradable items such as bagasse from the current 18% to at least 5%. This can also reduce the final cost the customers have to pay. So, in a way, it is a win-win situation for all stakeholders involved,” said AHAR president Shivanand Shetty. Rakesh Shetty, owner of Renault restaurant at Byculla said that only a handful of restaurants and hotels were using bagasse material because it is not as economical as recyclable plastic. “We request both the governments to bring the costs of biodegradable materials at par with plastic to encourage its use. Using eco-friendly biodegradable material is not just the national or state-level mandate but a global mission by all leading nations,” he said urging the government to take price-reduction initiatives by cutting the GST on bagasse and other green materials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-18-gst-forces-hotels-to-junk-biodegradable-packaging/articleshow/84330488.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

Police suspect the death to be a case of suicide. The deceased officer has been identified as Chandradevan M S, 47, of Pampakuda near Piravom. He was found dead by his family in his room. Police officers said that the man was quite upset over the past few days. He is survived by his wife and son. “He had some family issues. The recent death of his mother had also unsettled him. No suicide note has been found,” said an officer. Chottanikkara police have registered a case of unnatural death. Body was handed over to the kin after autopsy. His body was brought to the police station in the afternoon, where his colleagues paid their last respects. Later, the body was taken to his village for cremation. On Thursday night, a 52-year-old sub-inspector K Ayyappan of Iringole, Perumbavoor in Ernakulam attached with Kalamassery AR Camp was found dead, hanging at the police quarters at Kalamassery. He was undergoing Covid-19 quarantine. A senior officer said that both cases had more to do with their personal stress than work-related issues. “Chandradevan was not under a lot of work pressure. He was quite stressed over some personal issues. In the case of Ayyappan, he had a lot of financial difficulties. He also was building a house,” said the officer. Officers said that an internal departmental inquiry would also take place to find the exact reason behind the death. Suicides are preventable and help is just a phone call away.

Till last year, he was a student of an English-medium school in Pune. He had spent the year glued to the computer and cellphone to attend online classes.“This feels like a real school. Initially, online classes were interesting, but then I started missing my school,” he said. A teacher takes class at an old temple in Kashedi village. Community classes have been started in all ZP schools in remote villages of the Velhe taluka. Many of the villages don’t have cellphone network, which is why attending online classes was not possible for students. The community classes first started to tackle the network issue. After seeing the success of the classes, they were now implemented in villages that have connectivity. Students from 1st to 4th standards wearing face masks attends school in a temple at Koshimghar village. “As per the government resolution, it is allowed to take classes in open places maintaining Covid SOPs. So, we started taking classes at temples near schools, on grounds and under trees. We are happy that the classes are getting a good response from parents too. But, we never thought students from English-medium schools would take admission here,” Rajashree Gawade, one of the education cluster heads of Velhe, said. A teacher explaining Marathi poem to the class of 3rd standard under a Banyan tree.A total of 10 students from private and English-medium schools have got admission at the zilla parishad’s (ZP) Ranjane school ever since the community classes started. Most of their parents work in Pune, while they live with their grandparents or relatives in these villages. “Online education was nearly impossible in these remote villages. Very few parents have smartphones here. So, we came up with the idea of community classes, after taking the parents’ consent. Now, all the schools in Velhe taluka function like this. As many as 39 students from private schools got admission in various ZP schools in Velhe,” block education officer of Velhe Kamlakant Mhetre said. A Standard V student, Prathamesh Darwatkar, attends his class under another tree in the Ranjane village. This time last year, he was studying online in a private school in Pune. “I liked online classes at first because I got to use the cellphone. But, I couldn’t properly understand what was being taught virtually,” he said. Parents have been prefering to send their children to the nearby ZP schools for a ‘real’ school experience. Prathamesh’s father Chandrahans Darawatkar said, “I saw the difference in his mood after he started attending the ZP school. He has become more attentive and started completing his homework regularly.” Dr. Surabhi Barve, a consulting psychologist, said that many students had lost the connect with their teachers because of online education. “Many students require one-on-one motivation from the teachers. An educator’s role becomes limited while teaching virtually.” Deepak Khawale, a teacher at the Ranjane school, said, “We try our best to make the students feel like they are at a real school. Many students got detached from their studies and school environment because of online classes.” Classes under the trees and temples generally end after 2pm, but students have missed school so much during the lockdown that these three hours aren’t enough for them. “The children stay in their respective schools till the teachers leave. They study and play games,” another teacher said. In Kashedi village the school assembles at an old temple. A Standard II student, Ranjana Maragale, said she doesn’t know a cellphone could be used for studying. “I like to come to school, so I can meet other children from the village and play games with them. Last week, our teacher conducted a rangoli competition in the temple. Everyone enjoyed it,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/a-banyans-canopy-temples-hall-offer-space-for-learning-in-velhe/articleshow/84328465.cms||Aditya Waikul

Kamalnath Shenoy adopted Caramel for his daughter Aadya, who insisted on a pet. He is one among the several people in the city opting for pets in their houses. “The news about Covid-19 broke while I was working in South Korea. So I decided to send back my wife and Aadya to Kerala. Aadya’s only demand to return to Kerala was that she needs a pet. After discussing it with my friends and reading online, we adopted an Indian mongrel,” says Kamalanath, an IT professional. Veterinary doctors say that people's love for pets, including birds, is rising in the city over the years and it is reflected in the outpatient (OP) at hospitals as well. The love for pets also results in more private veterinary hospitals, with state of the art treatment facilities coming up in Kochi to cater to the rising demands. “These days, our OP witnesses more than 100 cases daily. Earlier, there were around 50-60 cases daily. The increase in cases in the OP might be because the Covid induced restrictions has led to further increase in demand for pets,” said Dr Eldose A, veterinary surgeon of government veterinary hospital. Another veterinary doctor in the private sector has said that Kochiites’ love for pets started a few years ago thanks to the change in the socio-economic situation. “The love for pets by Kochites is around four to five years old as children demand it. The Covid situation is a golden period for pets since the demand has increased and pet parents also have time to take care of it. Kochi is more pet friendly than Thiruvananthapuram or Kozhikode,” said Dr Kishore Kumar, who was part of Kochi corporation’s ABC programme. However, pets are still not allowed in flats as owners have placed a ban on them while signing agreements or bylaws. Animals rights activists said that they are noticing more stray animals presence now and have blamed authorities for not properly conducting the Animal Birth Control Programme by Kudumbashree.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kochiites-pet-love-leads-to-rising-demand/articleshow/84328457.cms||---

The study published in the ICES Journal of Marine Science says that it is necessary to reduce the total annual fishing hours of nine different categories of fishing fleets harvesting marine fishery resources. The study aimed to derive an understanding for management requirements of 223 commercially-important fish stocks in different maritime states of India. Two decades (1997-2016) of fishery-related data on the harvest of resources by different types of fishing fleets were used and a gear-standardization parameter was used for the analysis. In this category of overfished and overfishing, the main marine species caught include Indian oil sardine, mackerel, anchovies black pomfret, catfishes, crabs, frigate and bullet tunas, penaeid prawns, threadfin breams, wolf herring, etc, which are common across all maritime states. “Such models are used worldwide to study sustainability and management. However, unlike elsewhere, in our water, we have a vast diversity in species as in the fishing gear used. A need for such a study arose after the huge fall in catch of Indian oil sardines. Each maritime state had shown a drop in largely caught local species,” said Sunil Mohamed, fisheries scientist and one of the authors of the study. The team of researchers from Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) did the analysis using the time-series of landings of species, fishing gears and total landings. The results indicate that 34.1% of the assessed fish stocks in India are sustainable, 36.3% are overfished, 26.5% are recovering, and 3.1% are in the overfishing status. “One of the challenges was incorporating the multi-gear nature of fishing into the model. We solved it by introducing a gear standardization parameter,” said CMFRI ex-principal scientist Mohamed. The highest percentage of sustainable fish stocks were in Goa (63.6), West Bengal (52.6) and Kerala (52%), the highest percentage of overfished stocks were in Puducherry (71.4%), Gujarat and Daman Diu (65%) and Maharashtra (46.4%), and the highest percentage of recovering fish stocks were in Andhra Pradesh (50%), Odisha (40.7%) and Maharashtra (32.1%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cut-fishing-hours-as-stock-of-79-varieties-overfished/articleshow/84328433.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

With 6,883 tests conducted, the daily test positivity rate (TPR) was 0.09%. Yet, restrictions will continue in the city from Monday as the state government is yet to take any decision on the District Disaster Management Authority’s (DDMA) seeking relaxations up to 8 pm instead of 4 pm. This is for the second time that the cases are in single digit during the peak times of the first and second wave. On June 19, eight had tested positive. As per Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) data, the last time six tested positive was on on June 6, 2020. Then, only 84 were tested and the TPR was 7.14%. The district had 16 cases from 8,265 tests (0.19% TPR). Nine were from rural (1,382 tests, 0.65%). One was from another district. The district’s weekly TPR has continued to be below 1%. Citing 0.46% weekly TPR of the district in the week ending July 8, 0.68% occupancy of oxygen beds and 150 active cases on July 4, the president of DDMA and collector had wanted closure timings of essential and non-essentials to 8pm and restaurants to 10pm. Permission was also sought for resumption of offline meetings of various bodies with 50% capacity. TOI was the first to report about the proposal on July 10. The only change in restrictions from Monday is takeaways/parcels from restaurants allowed after 4pm and outdoor sports activities getting an additional slot from 6pm to 9pm. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde told TOI that it is not necessary that cases will increase once restrictions are lifted. “Waves have a pattern. A lot depends on the immune population, vaccination coverage and development of variant. All third waves in the world have typically arrived after four to five months of the second wave. The prevailing restrictions can be eased to some extent,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/6-cases-in-city-no-govt-nod-yet-for-timing-change/articleshow/84328474.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Goa||Goa: Mining cos lobby with government to stop formation of corporation||PANAJI: Mining companies in the state have begun lobbying with ministers, MLAs and government officials to stop the state government from forming a mining corporation. The government, however, is firm on going ahead with the plan to create a corporation to restart mining. This would help the government woo the electorate along the mining belt. Sources said that the mining companies’ apprehension is that if mining leases not held by companies are transferred to the corporation, there may be a demand from a section of society that the 88 mining leases (held by them) should also be transferred to the corporation The mining corporation bill was scheduled to get government approval on July 7 at the cabinet meeting, but due to pressure from mining companies, the bill did not come before the cabinet. “Most probably, during the next cabinet meeting, the bill to form the corporation will be passed,” a source said. A source said that if it so happens that the government transfers the 88 leases (after legal issues are resolved), the companies may not have the right to those leases. Since pre-Liberation days, mining leases have been controlled by the companies. The state government, through the Goa Mining Corporation, has decided to open new iron ore mines other than the 88 leases which are a subject of litigation before the Supreme Court. There are 254 valid mining leases in Goa, spread over Pernem, Sattari, Ponda, Sanguem, Bardez, Bicholim, Tiswadi and Quepem talukas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mining-cos-lobby-with-govt-to-stop-formation-of-corporation/articleshow/84328548.cms||Murari Shetye

---||Delhi||Four held for duping Gulf workers in name of Covid report at New Delhi railway station||NEW DELHI: Crime Branch has busted a gang of conmen and arrested four people for allegedly duping people coming to New Delhi station after returning from abroad for onward travel by promising them “fresh and railway-certified” Covid certificates. According to joint commissioner Alok Kumar, the accused used to target workers returning from Gulf countries who had to catch a train to reach their village after landing in Delhi. The accused have been identified as Deepak, Sanjeev, Vijay and Harish. Police have recovered stolen goods and cash, including foreign currencies. A pistol and two live cartridges were also seized. The gang used to tell the victims that they would need a new Covid-19 clearance to travel by train. Targets were then taken to the gang’s office in Paharganj, asked to fill a form and submit their passport, and return an hour before their departure to collect the report. When the victims returned, they were asked to pay a hefty fee. If they refused, they were threatened with legal consequences and institutional quarantine of four weeks. Crime Branch started following the case after a complaint was filed that the gang had extorted 3,500 riyals from four victims apart from taking their valuables like watches and mobile phones. In another operation, three conmen have been arrested for allegedly duping people by cloning their ATM cards. The accused have been identified as Satbir, Balbir and Rajendra and three pistols and cartridges were seized. “The gang either stole the cards by picking pockets or exchanged the original debit card of an ATM user with a dud card at kiosks, and stole the data using a skimmer,” the joint CP said. Most victims were elderly men and women and people from rural areas. The gang members even travelled to Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra in their i20 car to commit crimes. The south district police has also busted a gang of cheats that took people’s identity cards and other documents on the pretext of providing credit cards and misused them to secure loans. Two people, Akash and Vikas, have been arrested and nine ATM cards and three mobile handsets seized.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/four-held-for-duping-gulf-workers-in-name-of-covid-report-at-ndls/articleshow/84328513.cms||---

This will spread the sector in various parts of our state and help avoid overcrowding in a few clusters. This will also create new employment in small towns,” ITF said in a memorandum to textiles minister R Gandhi and industries minister Thangam Thennarasu. Giving a five-point suggestion for growth of the textile sector in the state, ITF convenor Prabhu Damodharan and board member Saravanan, who met the ministers, said the state could work out a roadmap to capitalize on the opportunity emerging with MITRA park scheme by creating an integrated plug and play apparel park to build scale, competitiveness and enable the medium sized companies to expand. Underlining the need to devise a special theme to brand the textile and apparel sector in the state as the most sustainable destination for fashion sourcing, ITF said such a branding would also help the sector capture the market share in value-added products. Pointing to the good trade relationship between the state and Japan, ITF said the state government could facilitate a working group with 50 apparel companies to work exclusively with the Japanese apparel market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/govt-help-sought-to-set-up-plug-and-play-garment-stitching-facilities-in-small-towns/articleshow/84328509.cms||---

Students would love to remember these memories for the rest of their lives. Instead, the image of the more than 100-year-old SMLP school, situated on TD Road, causes great pain in the minds of alumni as corridors and playgrounds have turned into a scrap godown and parking lots over the years. SMLP school, acronym for Subbaraya Pai Memorial School, was established in 1915 by advocate Guna Pai of the Gaud Saraswat Brahmin community, in memory of the Canara bank founder Subbarao Pai. The foundation stone was laid down by the then Dewan of Cochin, who was later posted as secretary to the Simon Commission. Alumni and community members plan to save the dying school. Currently, the school is under the custody of Subbarayya Pai Memorial Samrakshana Samiti. “I studied there till fourth standard. The school started to face a decline with the number of students coming down and later teachers. Once the functioning of the school stopped completely, Guna Pai tried handing over the school to the government. We plan to preserve the school,” said Rengadasa Prabhu, Samiti president. With overgrown weeds and grass on the compound, tiled roof, plaster peeled off, fallen tiles on the floors, two-wheelers parked in corridors, scrap piled up in the northern side and goods vehicles parked on the playground, the present condition of the school is far from its golden days. An engraving on the wall reads, ‘this stone was truly laid in position by J B Bhore Esquire ICS. Dewan of Cochin’. Currently, the school is under the custody of Samrakshana Samiti following an injunction order of the Ernakulam munsiff court.The deteriorating condition of the school's structure started five or six years ago, said a community member. The community and Samiti members visited the school one month ago to discuss the conservation strategy. An anganwadi used to function on the western side of the school till the pandemic struck last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/decades-old-school-now-a-scrap-godown-parking-lot/articleshow/84328506.cms||T C Sreemol

HRAEI president Sudesh Poddar told TOI that all members of the association, including star hotels, are closing before 8pm. “There is no incident reported like the on that has been doing the rounds for the last 24 hours. We do not know what has transpired at The Park, but I know that they are a very reputable group and they will not do anything contrary to the government orders,” he said. HRAEI has around 1,300 members in the region, including star hotels. A top executive of a star hotel in New Town told TOI that they received requests of late-night parties on weekends since bars were allowed to operate following relaxation by the state. “But we are declining them. I do not know what happened at The Park. A lot of youngsters are accustomed to such late-night parties,” he said. An executive of a star hotel on Bypass said last week, a group was insisting on continuing a party after hours, but the hotel declined the request. “They were asking for suits that can hold 15-20 people till 2am, but we said no because our policy is very clear about not breaking rules,” the executive said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/a-stray-case-of-breaking-rules-says-hotel-body/articleshow/84328516.cms||---

Police said the trio had run away from their houses as their parents used to scold them often. A police officer said S Rathish, 14, R Manikandan, 13, and R Simon Prakash, 13, all residents of Arivozhi Nagar at Palladam, had gone to a nearby ground for playing on Friday. “When they didn’t return home by late in the evening, their parents launched a search for them in the nearby areas and at their relatives’ houses. As they failed to locate them after the search, which lasted till Sunday morning, they lodged a complaint with us.” The Palladam police registered a missing person case and launched a probe. “During inquiry, we came to know the trio used to visit one of their friends’ house daily to refresh themselves and have food. They were sleeping on the terrace of a commercial complex that was located 2km away from Arivozhi Nagar. We picked them up from there and handed them over to their parents,” the officer said.

---||Nagpur||‘Pocket outbreaks’ of Delta as 11 more samples test positive in Nagpur||NAGPUR: Experts are calling them ‘pocket outbreaks’ after the Delta variant (B1.617.2) was found in samples of two Kolhapur returnees and nine more Covid positive patients through genome sequencing by CSIR-Neeri, in association with CCMB Hyderabad. Amid the Delta Plus (AY.1 variant) warnings, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had started tracing and placing suspected cases in institutional quarantine since last month. So far, it has quarantined around 18 persons who had tested Covid positive, along with their family members. Only saline gargle RT-PCR samples are being used for the study. CSIR-Neeri environmental virology lab, led by Krishna Khairnar, has developed the saline gargle RT-PCR method. The NMC’s move came following the district administration requesting CSIR-Neeri to conduct genome sequencing of eight samples of the Umred family whose members tested positive in quick succession last month. As Neeri-CCMB delivered results within a week, local authorities are now relying on the institutions for aggressive genomic surveillance. This is also helping them take immediate containment policies. Eight more samples are under study and results awaited. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI that it was a big relief that none of the suspected patients had tested positive for Delta Plus. “Since Covid cases are less, we are detailing the travel history of groups of people if all of them test positive. In case they have been to Delta Plus-affected areas, we treat them as suspected cases and place them in institutional quarantine even if they have isolation facility at home,” he said. Radhakrishnan added that genome sequencing is another precaution taken by NMC. “CSIR-Neeri is helping study the samples along with CCMB,” he said. “Wherever the need arises, we will go for institutional quarantine. We may not give the opportunity of home isolation. Only exceptional cases like pregnant women, children or elderly will be allowed home isolation,” the civic chief said. TOI asked experts about the significance of Delta variant still infecting groups of people in the district. Dr Shailesh Mundhada, a pathology and immunology expert, said it is the way a virus evolves. “We may say it is prevalent in a pocket like a family, a building or an area. It is because of local virulence of the strain,” he said. Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik said the original strain has now been replaced. “It is assumed that whatever infection happened in second wave was due to the Delta variant. Delta is still prevalent. These are local spurts which can get converted into third wave too, due to Delta strain itself,” he said. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Ashwini Tayde doubted if there can again be an outbreak due to Delta variant. “Those not immune will be at risk and need to take precautions keeping in mind its high infectivity factor. Some new variants (mutations) cropping up and causing trouble can’t be discounted,” she said. Zika alert: Admin keeps close watch The local administration is keeping a close watch on patients with fever and other symptoms akin to Zika virus. The district is witnessing a spike in dengue cases too. The administration has started sending some samples of these dengue cases for genome sequencing to NIV Pune to check for zika virus, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pocket-outbreaks-of-delta-as-11-more-samples-test-positive-in-ngp/articleshow/84330530.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The city received widespread light to moderate rains with some places also witnessing intense spells at times during the day. According to the Telangana State Development Planning Society figures, up to 8 pm, Sri Nagar colony recorded highest rainfall of 18 mm followed by 16.3 mm at Center for Economic and Social Studies in Begumpet and 14 mm at Ramanthapur Ward Office in Uppal circle and Maitrivanam in Ameerpet among others. Vehicular traffic was thrown out of gear in some parts of the city as roads were flooded with rainwater. “The traffic was moving at a snail’s pace from Erragadda to Moosapet junction. There is a traffic block on this road even if there are light rains. The situation was same near Saidabad. If this is the situation, I can’t imagine the kind of problems the commuters will have to face when there will be heavy rains in the coming days,” said K Surya, a cab driver. To avoid unforeseen incidents, the Hyderabad traffic police advised pedestrians not to stand under trees or near electric poles and cautioned motorists to drive carefully. The continuous rainfall which lasted for about five hours led to waterlogging in many areas such as Panjagutta, KPHB, Tarnaka, Lalapet, Nanal Nagar, Hafeezpet and Tolichowki among others. “When most of them in the city are enjoying the pleasant weather and rain, we are busy draining out the rainwater that entered our houses. If this is the situation after just one spell of rain, imagine our plight if the city records record rainfall like last year. There is also sewage overflow in our area. We request the officials to do something about this problem at the earliest,” said Aseema Begum, a resident of Hafeezpet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sudden-rain-floods-several-roads-water-enters-houses/articleshow/84330521.cms||---

The corporation council recently witnessed a spate of vehement debates from the opposition from ratifying agenda items pertaining to advance payment to corporation staff for various works; mostly running of Covid first-line treatment centres, purchase of food for workers and the like.Corporation secretary Binu Francis has issued a circular directing staff to avail advance amount only under emergency situations and has laid down a detailed framework for claiming the amount and getting it regularized. The circular directs officials to submit the completion report of the work, related documents within three months failing which the amount will have to be repaid with penal interest for three months.As per the circular, the approximate amount required for a need, proper reason for advance payment, time required to complete the work shall be submitted as report by the implementing official. Besides, the report shall be vetted by the secretary, and following the Mayor’s approval, the amount shall be allotted from the section concerned.Any official availing advance amount from the accounts section for a particular work shall submit the report of the work within the specified time period and other documents shall be attached.The new decision regarding advance payments is being implemented when there have been widespread complaints about the entire process of advancing money to corporation staff for various works. Either the staff will have to wait for an indefinitely long period to get the bills regularized or bills get cleared without proper documentation or records leading to loss of revenue for the city corporation.The row over transportation of Pongala waste had also forced the corporation officials to initiate an audit into how funds are spent for manpower management, waste transportation and collection, providing food and refreshments as part of Attukal Pongala waste management. Officials looked into advance payments and actual expenditure requirements of health officials in the previous years in the wake of recent development.The opposition recently mounted a collective attack on the city corporation for the expense related to Pongala. While the ruling council managed to wriggle out of the crisis by explaining the nature of expenditure, it opened a can of worms regarding past expenses; mostly advance payments.The health standing committee had put off the bills produced by the health wing regarding the purchase of food for the cleaning workers deployed for Attukal Pongala related waste management. BJP councillor Anil Kumar levelled allegations of forging hotel bills to buy food for the workers on Pongala day and said that the bills were fake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/city-corp-to-streamline-advance-payment-system/articleshow/84328525.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Chief minister M K Stalin had opened the sluice gates of the dam on the traditional date of June 12 to irrigate the ‘kuruvai’ crop in the delta districts. The Public Works Department (PWD) officials have been releasing water from the dam since then. The PWD officials said they were releasing 12,000cusecs water from the dam for the past two weeks. “Now, we have reduced it to 8,000cusecs as the delta districts have been receiving heavy rainfall for the past couple of days,” an official said. He said the rain had reduced the water requirement for the delta districts. The water level in the Mettur dam currently stands at 74.81ft. Inflow to the dam had reduced to 2,535cusecs from 4,594cusecs on Saturday. “The inflow to the dam has reduced as there is no rain in the catchment areas for the past few days. The dam now holds 36.97tmc water,” the official said. He said they had released about 22ft water to delta districts for irrigation purposes so far. “We have discharged nearly 24tmc water for 29 days since June 12.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/water-released-from-mettur-dam-reduced-to-8000-cusecs/articleshow/84328532.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The commission chairman Justice Antony Dominic has issued an order directing the state police chief to examine the issue and submit a report before August 7. The commission has issued the order based on a petition filed by advocate Vadakara Gireesh Kumar, who resides under Marayamuttom station limits. The petitioner stated that the police station functioned in a small rented building that has insufficient space to accommodate even the officers working there. The building has small rooms.

Niveditha, daughter of Rajesh and Kavitha of Thevarpazhinji near Poozhikunnu under Nemom police station limits is the deceased. Choking occurs when an object or food gets lodged in the throat or windpipe, blocking the airflow. Sources close to the family said that the girl displayed symptoms of choking around 3pm. She was lying on her back on the bed and having snacks when she started choking.Rajesh, who is an autorickshaw driver, rushed the girl to Government Taluk Hospital at Santhivila near Nemom in his vehicle. The doctors sent her to Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College Hospital in an ambulance after providing her with oxygen supply. But the doctors at the medical college hospital declared that the girl was already dead before she reached the hospital. It is suspected that her windpipe was blocked by the particles of the snacks she was munching on, leading to the choking. Niveditha is the only daughter of Rajesh and Kavitha. They had got married over a decade ago. She was born after several years of waiting and many rounds of treatment. The girl's body is kept in the mortuary of the medical college hospital. A Covid test and post mortem examination will be conducted on Monday. The girl's untimely death happened when the family were preparing to enroll her into a school. According to close relatives, it was only two days ago that Rajesh took her to a studio for taking her photographs. Niveditha's mother Kavitha is a homemaker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/six-year-old-girl-chokes-on-snacks-dies/articleshow/84328569.cms||---

"I admit that I had never imagined she would reach space," retired chemistry lecturer R Venkat Narasaiah said of Sirisha, only the third woman of Indian origin to become a space adventurer. "But I was sure of one thing — she was the bravest girl and out to achieve something big in life." Narasaiah and his wife Rama Devi, who live in a small house inside a bylane in Tenali, had raised Sirisha for the first four years of her life before she left for the US in 1992 to live with her parents. "She wanted to become a pilot. But due to her eyesight issues, she could not make it. But I always believed that everything happens for a reason. Now, we can see that she managed to achieve something even more unimaginable than that," Narasaiah told TOI. Sirisha is part of a six-member team that includes Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson, chief astronaut instructor Beth Moses, lead operations engineer Colin Bennett and pilots Dave Mackay and Michael Masucci. The scheduled 8pm launch of VSS Unity was delayed by unfavourable weather, but all the tension in Sirisha's maternal home dissipated as the take-off was announced. Narasaiah and Rama Devi erupted in joy, clapping their hands as astronaut 004 Sirisha, who works as the vice president of government affairs at Virgin Galactic, became the first Telugu-origin woman to travel to space. Careful not to jinx the trip, Narasaiah reminded everyone that there were still seven more stages for the spacecraft to complete. Rama Devi laughed at the thought of how she was under the impression that her granddaughter was "travelling someplace" rather than space. "It was only after my husband explained that I understood what is at stake and what this means to her. I remember back in 1997, when she visited India, Sirisha told us her dream was to fly. I am so happy and proud of her." If the mission is successful, Virgin Galactic aims to become the pioneer of space tourism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/in-tenali-home-sirishas-grandad-on-cloud-nine/articleshow/84331890.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Police suspect the body belongs to Rajan (52), who has been missing since March 1 this year. The body found from the well also appeared to be three to four months old based on the level of decay. Anchuthengu station house officer inspector S Chandradas said that samples were collected from Rajan’s children for DNA matching. The samples will be forwarded to the forensic science lab here along with the findings of a diatom test, the result of which is expected to be received on Monday. “Since the body was in a decaying stage, it was not possible to know whether the deceased had any external injuries, which might have happened in an attack or an accident. Hence the importance of the diatom test," the inspector said, adding that if the diatom test result is negative, it would mean that someone else might have harmed the deceased. The body was found in the 140 feet deep well in the compound of an uninhabited house that is approximately around a kilometre away from Rajan’s house last Tuesday. The owners of the house lived abroad and were planning to return soon. The labourers they employed to clean the house and well ahead of their return, found the dead body. When they tried to pull out the motor pump fitted inside the well for cleaning, they found the body tangled onto the pump. Rajan was working at a restaurant at Anchuthengu and police have recovered surveillance camera footage in which he can be seen leaving the restaurant after work on the night of March 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/dna-test-to-identify-abandoned-body/articleshow/84328634.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Woman sexually abused, one arrested in Kerala||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Vizhinjam police on Sunday arrested a 32-year-old man on charges of sexually abusing a woman. The police identified the accused as Shaiju of Pullanimukku near Venganoor, under Vizhinjam police station limits. The police said that the complainant in the case was the wife of a non-resident Indian living with her 13-year-old son at Amarivila near Venganoor. They said that Shaiju was accompanied by another man, Ranju, a history-sheeter accused in several criminal cases. According to the police sources, the incident related to the case took place on Saturday around 3pm. The two men barged into the complainant’s residence. While Ranju tried to overpower the woman and rape her, Shaiju stood guard. When a relative of the complainant, Sabu, rushed to the woman’s rescue on hearing her screams, Shaiju attacked him using a machete. After neighbours gathered around hearing the commotion, the two accused fled from the house. The police said that the main accused Ranju had tried to sexually abuse the woman several times in the past also. The complainant and her son had moved into the rented house they live now three months ago. Ever since, she has been facing harassment at the hands of Ranju. She informed her husband who is working abroad about the threat from Ranju following which he sought the help of the local ward member. It is suspected that when Ranju came to know that the woman’s husband has spoken about him to the ward member, he was furious. He was adamant on taking revenge on the woman and hence tried to sexually abuse her with the help of his friend. A police team is hunting for Ranju, who is on the run. Shaiju's arrest was recorded by Vizhinjam station house officer inspector Prajeesh Sasi. The police have registered a case invoking relevant Sections of criminal trespass, causing hurt using arms and outraging the modesty of a woman. Shaiju was produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody. Sabu, the woman’s relative who sustained injuries on neck and arms, is under treatment in a hospital.

Details accessed by TOI from the Centre show that the state earned SGST of Rs 1,460 crore in April, whereas the SGST collections in May and June remained the same at Rs 850 crore each. Despite a sharp fall in SGST collections, experts pointed out that the state economy has witnessed a V-shaped recovery. “A V-shaped recovery means an immediate recovery, where the unmet demand in every area will bounce back, taking the finances to normal level as soon as possible. GST collection has been good in Telangana, it is a matter of time the state will bounce back to normalcy,” said K Narsimha Murthy, director, national stock exchange, and finance expert. Due to non-uniformity in the tax collection, the state was receiving less GST compensation since 2017, but now that gap has widened further. Even as the SGST is on decline, there has been a drop in CGST collection also. The collections were around Rs 1,100 crore in the month of April, but was down to around Rs 650 crore in the months of May and June. Among the four components, SGST and IGST compensation falls into the state's kitty. The state was also supposed to receive around Rs 925 crore IGST compensation in the month of June.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/steep-decline-in-telanganas-may-june-state-gst-earnings/articleshow/84331896.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: FIRs to be filed against those pruning, cutting trees without municipal corporation nod||LUDHIANA: If the residents cut or prune trees without permission from the civic body, they will have to bear the brunt of the authorities who have decided to recommend FIRs against such defaulters. Also, the civic officials are told to identify those trees that are almost dead. Since these trees can pose threat to people or public properties during the rainy season, these are recommended to be removed. The civic authorities are planning to plant new trees at the place of previous ones during plantation season. In the orders issued by the municipal corporation (MC) commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal, it is stated that sometimes it has come to the notice of civic officials that shopkeepers prune or cut the trees brutally because they were covering the boards of their shops or clear vision of the shops or houses was getting disturbed. In the rainy season, the civic body carries out plantation drive in the city and the officials are told to identify dried out trees that can be replaced with new ones. Not only officials, but also the active residents are told to do the same by July 11 so that a plan could be made for plantation. There is planning to involve the forest officials as well because some trees come under their jurisdiction. A resident of Sarabha Nagar and a businessman Rahul Verma said, The dry or dead trees can invite accidents due to heavy winds or rainfall so it is good if these will be removed. We can plant new trees in its place. Also, there is a need to keep check on those who axe the trees selfishly.” Kripal Singh, junior engineer of MC, said, “The staff has been instructed to pay attention towards axeing of trees illegally and get FIR registered immediately. Also, teams are sent to find out dry/dead trees locations those should be removed for avoiding any untoward incident.” Political interference a major concern One of the officials requesting anonymity said, “It is not the first time we are told to register FIRs against those who chop trees. In the past too, we got many registered, but it did not bring results because area councillors or other elected representatives interfere and we had to roll back the compliant.” He said they had to come to a compromise by asking the offenders to plant 20 or 30 trees. He hoped that now written orders are issued, they could fight out political pressure. 35,000 saplings this year As far as plantation is concerned this year civic body is planning to get 35,000 saplings planted in city. The officials have arranged around 15,000 saplings as of now and rest will be purchased from the forest department. The maximum plantation will take place in Focal Point or those areas where water is available nearby so that plants would not have to die.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/firs-to-be-filed-against-those-pruning-cutting-trees-without-mc-nod/articleshow/84326282.cms||---

---||Delhi||Not even silence zones spared as traffic gives Delhi an earful||NEW DELHI: A dynamic mapping of noise pollution at 10 locations by Delhi Technological University (DTU) has revealed that traffic noise levels were much higher than the standards set by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) during evenings compared with morning hours. The selected locations consisted of different land-use patterns, including industrial, commercial, residential and silence zones. Not only residential and commercial zones, but even silence zones also violated the permissible limits. The study, published in Arabian Journal of Geosciences, made an attempt to analyse the spatial distribution of traffic noise levels in the city by creating noise maps with the help of Geographic Information System (GIS). During the morning peak hours (8am to 10am), the traffic noise level was maximum at Badli crossing (78.8 dBA), whereas the minimum was observed at Patel Nagar Chowk (71.4 dBA). During the evening peak hours (5pm to 7pm), the traffic noise level was minimum (74.1 dBA) at Shastri Park, KG Marg and Tolstoy Marg, while the maximum (81.1 dBA) was seen at Peeragarhi Chowk and Badli crossing. In the case of off-peak hours (from 12pm to 2pm), Paharganj Chowk showed the highest traffic noise level at 73.3 dBA, while the lowest (64.3 dBA) was found at Shastri Park, KG Marg and Tolstoy Marg. The traffic noise level was observed at a distance of 1m from the edge of the road, while the height of the sound-level meter was 1.5m as it is considered the average height for the human ear. The researchers then used GIS software to map noise at the 10 locations. The study mentioned that the noise level was directly proportional to the volume of traffic. “The average road traffic noise level in the morning peak hours varied from 68.5 to 80.4 dBA. In the evening, it was between 71.9 and 83.7 dBA. During off-peak hours, it varied between 64.2 and 73.3 dBA. When traffic increased during off-peak hours, the average noise level also rose,” it added. Rajeev Kumar Mishra, assistant professor in department of environmental engineering at DTU, said that Delhi was one of the worst-affected cities. “The noise levels are very high compared with CPCB’s limits. The vehicular population in Delhi jumped by 135.6% from 1999–2000 to 2015–2016. There were 10.6 million vehicles in May 2017. Prolonged exposure to noise can cause hearing loss. This induced hearing impairment occurs at a frequency range of 3,000–6,000 Hz,” he added. Mishra said other issues included psychological effects, such as fatigue, lack of concentration, sleeping disorders, etc. He added that there was an urgent need for mitigating measures, like noise barriers to curb such pollution and its associated adverse health impacts. “People don’t realise the impact it can have on them,” said the assistant professor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/not-even-silence-zones-spared-as-traffic-gives-delhi-an-earful/articleshow/84328771.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

On Sunday, the monsoon action teams and personnel from Disaster Response Force (DRF) of the civic body swung into action to address rain related issues following the downpour in Hyderabad. However, there were no instances of inundation in low-lying areas. “The number of grievances pertaining to monsoon were 29 on Sunday out of which 23 were resolved. A few issues pertaining to drainage overflow and desilting were also attended by the teams,” a GHMC official said. On the other hand, intensifying its efforts to address the issues of urban flooding in the city, a committee comprising senior officials and engineers has been formed by the GHMC. The committee met this week and prioritised desilting of stormwater drain activities among other monsoon related issues to avoid a rerun of the nightmarish floods that affected the city last year. Officials also decided to study the best practices adopted by other municipal corporations and visit other cities too if required. Director of GHMC’s Enforcement Vigilance and Disaster Management, Vishwajit Kampati, Chief Engineer (maintenance wing), Devanand and Hyderabad Road Development Corporation Ltd (HRDCL) Chief Engineer Mohd Ziauddin are members of the committee. GHMC Zonal Commissioner for Serilingampally Ravi Kiran is also part of the committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-orders-evacuation-of-occupants-from-dilapidated-bldgs/articleshow/84330702.cms||---

---||Ludhiana||Road works in full swing in Ludhiana, residents say quality is not up to scratch||LUDHIANA: Ahead of assembly elections, the civic body has started construction of a number of roads in the city and in the coming days more developmental works will start. However, the residents are worried about the quality of these roads in the “absence of proper checks, which may lead to damage after a single rainfall, causing loss to the public exchequer”. However, the civic officials claimed they were monitoring the road work and strict action would be taken against the erring contractors for using substandard material. A resident of Haibowal, Karan Sharma, said, “It has been 15 days and half the road is constructed and the other portion is left untouched. The reason for it must be known only to the contractor or officials. Besides, the road that has been constructed is not up to the mark, as no specifications are followed. At one place, the layer is thick and at the other very thin. The earlier roads also did not survive even a single rainfall.” A resident from Civil City, Gurpreet Singh, said the roads constructed in this manner would not survive long and develop potholes after the first rainfall. He said, “The authorities are not paying attention towards the quality of material and specifications, so the public will suffer again. In the past three years, not even a single road was constructed in the area, but now as the elections are round the corner, the authorities have swung into action.” Arvind Sharma, a shopkeeper and resident of Model Town, said, “Recently, roads were constructed in Model Town Extension Block D and these have already been damaged. If a speeding vehicle turns, bitumen comes off. Constructing roads with poor material is of no use and I have also raised the matter with the higher authorities.” Another resident from Chander Nagar, Jyoti Bhatia, rued the roads were being constructed everywhere in the city, but in their area a long stretch was still pending. “Rainy season is about to start and then authorities will stop road work,” Jyoti added. Superintending engineer of bridges and road department Tirath Bansal said, “We are visiting the sites where developmental works are going on and daily progress reports are being prepared. Apart from this, a consultant company collects samples of material.” Mayor Balkar Sandhu said road works were done in all constituencies and officials have been told to hold checks daily and action would be taken against erring officers and the contractor. He said in the coming months Rs 250 crore to Rs 300 crore worth development works would be undertaken. Sandhu added as soon as the monsoon sets in, roads’ construction would stop. A major part of MC funds is spent on the construction and maintenance of roads. A recent RTI application filed by activist Rohit Sabharwal had revealed that Rs 212 crore were spent on the maintenance of roads by the civic body in the past five years, but the condition of roads narrates an entirely different story. Last year, additional commissioner Rishipal Singh had started sampling of roads from various areas and action was also recommended against the officials. No drainage system for rainwater One major reason behind early breakage of roads is that the city does not have a proper system for drainage of rainwater and when there is waterlogging during monsoon, many stretches get damaged. There is a need to check waterlogging as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/road-works-in-full-swing-residents-say-quality-is-not-up-to-scratch/articleshow/84326317.cms||Nidhi Bhardwaj
---||Chandigarh||Getting 40% less electricity than needed: Industry body||CHANDIGARH: Hit hard by the Covid lockdowns, the Dera Bassi Industries Association has warned the Punjab government that its decision to impose power cuts would bring the industry to a standstill. “We fail to understand this situation, when Punjab, as claimed by your department, is a power surplus state and overnight the situation went so alarming that the industry has been brought under a cut of almost 30-40% of its normal demand. More so, this situation of sudden huge shortage is there only in Punjab and all other neighbouring states are maintaining regular power supply to the industry,” reads the representation given by the association to the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) chairman-cum-managing director. Rakesh Ratan Agarwal, secretary of the association having over 100 industrial units as members, said that the industry is under pressure for its mere existence due to Covid pandemic, long lockdowns of the past months, labour migration issues and skyrocketing prices of raw material and commodities. The industry was struggling hard to come out of these hardships when a sudden notice for a long power cut was received from the PSPCL. The industry was not ready to bear such long power cuts, he added. Induction furnace owner Praveen Goyal said PSPCL should give full power load to the industries at least for eight hours every day during the time of power crises so that they can run their industry. The association has told the PSPCL that the large industrial power consumers cannot simply be punished because they are bulk power buyers when the government enjoys bulk of revenue and employment generation from the industry. “As you have allowed 30% power to continuous industry, the remaining large industrial power supply consumers should also be allowed to either use 30% of their load or run single shift during the two days of imposed power cut days in a week. For the remaining two shifts, the large industrial power supply consumers should be allowed to use a minimum of 100 KW or 125 KVA demands as this is at par with the permissible limit of use by the medium industrial power supply consumers. Agarwal said there was no equitable distribution of power to all the consumers and there had been no response from PSPCL to various representations given by the industries association on the issue. “As the utility agencies have power to purchase electricity to meet their special or emergency needs, there is no transparency on this,” he added. The association has also requested the PSPCL that since its circular regarding the power cut timing on July 8 was received late at night hours, various industrial units in Dera Bassi did not have the information on and thus they should be considered as “unintentional defaulters” and should not be punished.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/getting-up-to-40-less-power-than-needed-dera-bassi-industry-body/articleshow/84328754.cms||---

The state has asked the Union ministry of forest and environment for diversion of 10 hectares in Atmakur, the core tiger reserve area. Irrigation projects of the Pula Subbaiah Veligonda Project head regulators have been proposed in Srisailam range in Kurnool district’s Atmakur division. The project is being taken up at an estimated cost of Rs 95 crore. Interestingly, as the project is stated to be over 9.7 hectares of forest land, no environment impact assessment is to be done.Veligonda project is among the prioritised projects taken up by the AP government. It entails the storage of 43.5 tmc water at Nallamalasagar reservoir by means of two tunnels. Construction of head regulators at the foreshore of Srisailam reservoir in Kollam Vagu is being taken up to create a potential irrigation ayacut of 4.47 lakh acres and provide drinking water facility to 15.25 lakh people in drought-prone fluoride-affected areas in 30 mandals of Prakasam, Nellore and Kadapa districts. Part of construction of the head regulators for the tunnels — including construction of approach channels, stablisiation of slopes, flank walls and working space for the project — fall sunder compartment number 908 of Nandikotkuru RF of Srisailam Beat in Nagarjunasagar-Srisailam Tiger Reserve Forest of Srisailam range. Veligonda Project division engineering department officials said that was unavoidable. “All efforts were put to avoid the forest lands but we could not avoid it completely. The proposed forest land diversion is unavoidable and bear minimum and also there is no other alternative for the same,” said an official. As the project is stated to be over 9.7 hectares of forest land, no environment impact assessment is to be done. The project is among the prioritised projects taken up by the AP government. It is being taken up at an estimated cost of Rs 95 crore||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/veligonda-project-land-sought-in-tiger-reserve/articleshow/84331158.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

It is 18 acres of prime land of LIT. The residents said with the arrival of monsoon, it will create problems for them as along with debris, garbage, too, is being dumped at the site. Arvind Sharma, an activist and resident of the area, said, “Some land is lying vacant in Block D of SBS Nagar where residential flats are to be constructed. There, hills of garbage and debris are being made by contractors who bring trolleys loaded with dump. We have raised the matter with officials several times, but to no avail. On Saturday evening, too, a trolley unloaded the debris at the vacant land. We recorded the activity and decided to approach the human rights commission.” Another resident Balraj Chopra said, “Already there are chances of spreading of diseases during rainy season. The dumping of waste here will make those chances brighter. In the past years, the area suffered dengue, malaria and water-borne diseases. If this continues, the diseases might visit the area again.” Denying the allegations, LIT executive engineer Boota Ram said, “We take action against those caught red-handed dumping garbage or debris at any property. I will again check the area. I have asked the officials concerned to get an FIR registered against erring people as it is the prime land of the department.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/sbs-nagar-residents-approach-rights-panel-against-illegal-dumping-of-debris/articleshow/84326351.cms||---

They said that with parents leaving for work, students are not having access to send their attendance to their respective class teachers. “Many are attending digital classes but they are unable to send their photograph while watching classes as they don’t have a smartphone. The same was conveyed to their teachers when they enquired why a student is not attending classes,” said M Ravinder, a mathematics teacher at a city government school and president of the Telangana Progressive Teachers Federation. Teachers said it would be better if an alternate procedure like asking students to complete an assignment or worksheet, is considered for attendance every day. They said that with many not sending attendance, data sent to the education department is not accurate as teachers are forced to put some figures and share them by the end of the day. As per the figures released by education department, 75.6% students attended classes on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/teachers-seek-an-alternative-way-to-mark-attendance/articleshow/84331081.cms||---

The process of allocation will be based on financial position and assessment of the posts’ requirement. “Many of the posts were created during 1960s, and may not be required now. There will be an assessment on this,” an official said. It is estimated that the gap between the number of vacant posts and actual number of people in jobs will not be more than 10 per cent. Another consideration for reconciliation will be over the number of outsourcing posts to be continued after regular posts are filled. Several duties to be delivered by regular employees are being undertaken by outsourced ones. After filling regular posts, a decision will be taken on continuation of outsourced posts. “There cannot be two posts for the same duty,” the official said. The finance department has held meetings with all government departments on Sunday to know more about the vacancies in each. Similar meetings were also conducted in April to fill vacancies via direct recruitment. The meeting on Sunday saw the collection of details on vacant posts across districts. Details given by the departments will be sent to chief secretary Somesh Kumar on Monday following which a detailed report will be tabled before a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-to-reconcile-number-of-posts-across-depts/articleshow/84331304.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The yatra, according to the party, will seek to expose KCR’s tacit understanding with Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy over allowing diversion of Krishna river water to Rayalaseema region. “Our yatra will demand TRS government expedite pending works of various irrigation projects on Krishna river and ensure every drop of river water allocated to Telangana is safe guarded,” said Kodandaram. The TJS founder-president said they have decided to take out yatras on other crucial issues too, including unemployment, fuel prices, and problems being faced by podu agricultural land farmers. Claiming that suicides by unemployed youth are continuing and that they should be considered as state murders, Kodandaram demanded that the CM and industries minister K T Rama Rao come out with white paper on actual vacancies in government and private sectors as on date, those filled up in last seven years. “There is no question of trusting the CM on filling up of vacancies unless he comes out with a recruitment calendar. In fact, the state government should issue orders to reserve jobs even in private sector for locals,” Kondadaram said and announced TJS will contest the Huzurabad bypoll.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tjs-to-launch-yatra-to-expose-kcr-on-water-sharing-with-ap/articleshow/84331350.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Aurangabad||Two open-source apps help detect vehicle thefts in Aurangabad||AURANGABAD: Amid the high number of vehicular thefts being committed in the city limits, two open-source mobile-based applications have come in handy to the police for cross verifying the credentials of every vehicle stopped at the checkpoints. With the help of the two apps — Mparivahan and Carinfo — the city police have detected 57 stolen bikes and seized them in the past few months. The decision was taken after Aurangabad commissioner of police Nikhil Gupta found that the data stored in the hand-held chalan devices used by the traffic police were not completely updated with the required data. “In several cases, we have found suspects putting up false number plates to evade screening by the police at the checkpoints. As a solution, we have made it mandatory for the police teams to immediately check the vehicle’s credentials by punching the vehicle number,” Gupta said. In most of the 57 detected cases, police have found that the suspects had memorised the forged number plates installed on the vehicles to give an impression of being genuine owners. However, punching the registration numbers of the vehicle would reveal the name and address of the actual owner. Cross verifying these credentials with the person stopped at checkpoints helped police in detecting stolen vehicles. In 2020, a total of 188 vehicle thefts were reported between January and May, while this year, 364 vehicle theft were reported during the same period. Of the 364 cases, 317 remain undetected. The authorities have also found in at least six dozen cases that some people, who are unable to pay bank instalments, in fear that their vehicles will be seized, they forge the number plates. In each of these cases, police have booked the vehicle owners on charges of cheating and criminal breach of trust. Registration of such cases have also exposed those defaulting on bank loans, said a senior police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/2-open-source-apps-help-detect-vehicle-thefts-in-aurangabad/articleshow/84324084.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Though many good Samaritans are coming forward to help, the inputs provided by them are leading the police nowhere. Sweety, wife of police inspector Ajay Desai, has been missing for the last 37 days. Her mysterious disappearance has baffled the cops as the investigations haven’t revealed any foul play. Few days back police distributed look out notices with Sweety’s photograph and other details at public places. The cops are getting calls from citizens who believe they have information about Sweety but the leads are resulting in cops being sent on wild goose chase. “We keep getting tip-offs from people across the state. Some even claimed to have seen her. But when we investigate their claims, it turns out to be false,” said Kalpesh Solanki, deputy superintendent of police (DySP) rural. One of the first calls that the cops got was from Anand where the caller said that he had seen Sweety.  “Then a person from Ahmedabad made the same claims. We got a call even from Mt Abu in Rajasthan as well as Modhera. On cross verification the claims turned out to be false,” Solanki, who is heading the investigations, said. Three days ago, a man from Patan claimed to have given lift to Sweety. He also informed the cops that an older man was accompanying her. “We sent our team to Patan to verify his claims. He had mistaken some other woman for Sweety,” Solanki added. Sweety had gone missing from her home in Karjan on June 5. Though Sweety’s brother had approached the cops a day after she went missing, the police began serious investigations in the case only six days ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cops-on-wild-goose-chase-for-pis-missing-wife-no-leads-yet/articleshow/84325159.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Rain deficiency in 5 districts of Marathwada in July so far||AURANGABAD: After a promising start to the rainy season in early June, a dry spell of the monsoon is being observed in different parts of Marathwada now, leading to average rainfall deficiency in five out of the region’s eight districts in July. The dry spell, if it continues, could put the kharif crops in the region under stress in many areas. As per the official data, in July so far, Parbhani district has recorded the maximum rainfall deficiency (40%), followed by Jalna (22%), Hingoli (21%), Nanded (13%) and Aurangabad (2%). On the other hand, Osmanabad has received 180% of its normal rainfall in July and similar surplus showers have been reported in Latur (109%) and Beed (108%). The region has received an average of 61 mm rainfall in July so far — around 93% of the normal showers. Considering the good run of monsoon earlier in June, the progressive count of rainfall since June 1 has reached to 262 mm which is 131% of the normal rainfall. Aurangabad district’s superintending agricultural officer Tukaram Mote on Sunday said regular rainfall activity is missing during the current kharif season. “The absence of desired consistency in the pattern of rain was observed during the first month of the rainy season before necessary revival towards the end of June. The sowing of kharif crops has increased to 80% as per latest report and could go up further by the next week,” he said, adding that crops during the early stage do not require much water but can be under stress in the later stages if the monsoon plays truant. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has a forecast of heavy rain over Aurangabad and parts of Marathwada during the next 24 hours, followed by the possibility of moderate rain during the subsequent 48-hour period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/rain-deficiency-in-5-districts-of-marathwada-in-july-so-far/articleshow/84324083.cms||---

The SAD also asked the Punjab AAP unit to explain why it was maintaining a silence on such a sensitive issue linked to the progress and prosperity of the state. The SAD spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said Punjab AAP leaders, including its state convener Bhagwant Mann and legislature party leader Harpal Singh Cheema, were in the habit of doing press conferences every day but had failed to react to the anti-Punjab step of AAP supremo Kejriwal. Cheema alleged that it was now increasingly clear that Kejriwal had deliberately filed a petition in the apex court with the sole purpose of worsening the power crisis in Punjab by forcing the closure of its thermal plants. Claiming that this was not the first time that AAP had pursued an anti-Punjab agenda, Cheema said earlier also on the issue of Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal, Kejriwal had pretended to side with the farmers of Punjab but had simultaneously filed an affidavit in court saying Delhi and Haryana also had right to SYL water and that the canal should be built. The Akali functionary said on the issue of the three agricultural laws too, the Delhi chief minister adopted double standards by publicly supporting farmers but deviously approved and implemented them in Delhi. “Kejriwal was also part of a conspiracy, along with the Congress, to defame SAD in the cases of sacrilege through former SIT member Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-questions-kejriwal-decision-to-approach-sc-seeking-thermal-plants-closure/articleshow/84328833.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Eatala Rajender’s security curtailed, now has 1+1 gunman detail||HYDERABAD: With the upcoming by-elections to Huzurabad dominating conversation in political circles in Telangana since former minister Eatala Rajender quit his MLA post and joined Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Rajender’s personal security has been slowly curtailed from 4+4 gunmen to 1+1 gunman. Though his personal security has been downsized by Telangana Intelligence sleuths, there has been high surveillance on Rajender and his close political aides by intelligence sleuths to know their political moves. Top brass of Telangana Intelligence have put in special focus to take the latest political updates related to Rajender and BJP activities, since this is going to be a prestigious contest for TRS. When Rajender was minister, he was given four gunmen by Intelligence Security Wing (ISW) besides giving him government vehicles as per protocol. After he was removed from the state cabinet on the recommendation of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, his security was down sized to two gunmen. When Rajender resigned as MLA, which he won on a TRS ticket, his security was further curtailed from 2 gunmen to just 1 gunman. When senior officials of Telangana police were contacted, they claim that this was done taking into considering his status and existing security threat. “For MLAs we generally give 2+2 gunmen. But now that he is no more an MLA, it has been reduced to 1+1 after taking into consideration the Threat Perception Report (TPR),” an official said. Though police deny that their decision is not based on political reasons, Rajender is now a staunch political adversary to TRS leadership. There was speculation that Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy’s security might be reviewed following his appointment as Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president, however, nothing of that sort was done, and officials said that the chance of making any change is negligible. In his case too, surveillance has increased and as of now Revanth is being given 2+2 gunmen. A few days ago, associates of Rajender caught policemen moving in civil dress, when they were gathering information on ground. When Rajender resigned as MLA his security was further curtailed from two gunmen to just one.

We request the JNTUH to frame a comprehensive framework to get these provisions implemented,” read the representation. They also demanded the varsity ensure it receives information on salary payments from colleges, disbursement details in an employee bank account, and copies of attendance registers signed by staff. “These initiatives and verifying them will establish some good changes and revamp the present corrupt system,” the letter read. The faculty said that taking advantage of lockdown conditions, most managements of private-affiliated colleges removed employees indiscriminately. “There is a need to identify such illegitimately removed employees at every college and bring back them on the rolls. To stop such practices of private colleges, there is an immediate need to recommence biometric attendance of the staff at every college,” said TSTCEA president, A Santosh Kumar, adding that biometric attendance has been resumed in polytechnic and degree colleges in the state.

Amid the Delta Plus (AY.1 variant) warnings, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had started tracing and placing suspected cases in institutional quarantine since last month. So far, it has quarantined around 18 persons who had tested Covid positive, along with their family members. Only saline gargle RT-PCR samples are being used for the study. CSIR-Neeri environmental virology lab, led by Krishna Khairnar, has developed the saline gargle RT-PCR method. The NMC’s move came following the district administration requesting CSIR-Neeri to conduct genome sequencing of eight samples of the Umred family whose members tested positive in quick succession last month. As Neeri-CCMB delivered results within a week, local authorities are now relying on the institutions for aggressive genomic surveillance. This is also helping them take immediate containment policies. Eight more samples are under study and results awaited. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI that it was a big relief that none of the suspected patients had tested positive for Delta Plus. “Since Covid cases are less, we are detailing the travel history of groups of people if all of them test positive. In case they have been to Delta Plus-affected areas, we treat them as suspected cases and place them in institutional quarantine even if they have isolation facility at home,” he said. Radhakrishnan added that genome sequencing is another precaution taken by NMC. “CSIR-Neeri is helping study the samples along with CCMB,” he said. “Wherever the need arises, we will go for institutional quarantine. We may not give the opportunity of home isolation. Only exceptional cases like pregnant women, children or elderly will be allowed home isolation,” the civic chief said. TOI asked experts about the significance of Delta variant still infecting groups of people in the district. Dr Shailesh Mundhada, a pathology and immunology expert, said it is the way a virus evolves. “We may say it is prevalent in a pocket like a family, a building or an area. It is because of local virulence of the strain,” he said. Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik said the original strain has now been replaced. “It is assumed that whatever infection happened in second wave was due to the Delta variant. Delta is still prevalent. These are local spurts which can get converted into third wave too, due to Delta strain itself,” he said. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Ashwini Tayde doubted if there can again be an outbreak due to Delta variant. “Those not immune will be at risk and need to take precautions keeping in mind its high infectivity factor. Some new variants (mutations) cropping up and causing trouble can’t be discounted,” she said.  Zika alert: Admin keeps close watch The local administration is keeping a close watch on patients with fever and other symptoms akin to Zika virus.

The jubilant supporters played loud music on their phones, burst crackers and celebrated in front of the house of their friends-turned-foes for the day, who were supporting Brazilian striker Neymar Junior. Sunny Sangar, who plays professional football in Kolhapur city, “I was awake the whole night so that I didn’t have to wake up at 5.30am for the match. I am a die-hard Messi fan. I got emotional when Messi picked up the cup. Our generation of footballers owes him a lot. The Argentinians showed great teamwork.” After the match, many Brazilian supporters thought that the Argentina team was more physical than tactical. Some even believed that the winning goal scored by Angel Di Maria was offside. Pratik Kumar Badame, another football player and a fan of Neymar Jr said, “No one can match Neymar’s skills. He was, however, alone roaring on the field. The Brazilian defence has let us down. The Argentinians made sure at least three to four players blocked Neymar and they were rough with him.” The Kolhapur city was divided over the Copa America final. It was not just about Argentina vs Brazil, but it was also about Messi against Neymar. Both the players used to play for FC Barcelona together until Neymar moved to Paris Saint-Germain FC. For the last two years, no such football tournament had taken place due to the Covid outbreak. But Copa America along with the Euro Cup has given a reason to the football fans in Kolhapur city to be ecstatic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/lionel-messi-fans-in-kolhapur-city-celebrate-argentinas-copa-victory/articleshow/84324129.cms||---

Meanwhile, the health department authorities don’t have stock to vaccinate people on Monday. The administration on June 21 had said it wants to inoculate 33,000 people daily and the deputy commissioner had asked the local body of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) to give at least 100 more health teams to meet the next one-million target in one month before the expected third wave of Covid-19. The data of the health department shows that on most days after the district administration’s announcement, the vaccination was below the desired number, except July 3, the mega vaccination camp day, when 82,677 persons were jabbed—the highest in the state. The second highest number was recorded on July 7, when 24,977 persons were vaccinated, though lower than the target of 33,000. On two days—June 30 and July 8—no vaccination session was organized in the district because of lack of vaccine stock. Just 1,229 persons were jabbed on June 29 and 1,494 on July 6. “We have proven the capacity by vaccinating more than 82,000 persons in a day at 308 vaccination sites. We can maintain the number but it depends on the supply. We wished to vaccinate eligible persons this month, but with vaccine not coming, it is something beyond our control,” said deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma. He added that they had got vaccine stock on June 26 and July 2 and since then they haven’t got the stock till July 10. The health department authorities said they have no vaccine for Monday. “We don’t have Covaxin doses for morning and don’t know when we will get Covishield stock,” said district immunisation officer Dr Puneet Juneja. He added that the district administration had planned to get eligible persons vaccinated by August 15, but it was hit by supply shortage. The health department officials said even as around 24 lakh people above the age of 18 are to be immunized in the district, the number of those jabbed with the first dose is slightly less than half the target.  “It is important to vaccinate maximum number of eligible persons ahead of the third wave. The Central government should provide adequate supply of vaccines to the health department,” said former IMA president Dr Suneel Katyal. Residents are waiting for the stock. “When I inquired about the vaccine availability, I was told that the health department does not have Covishield doses. I will get inoculated when the stock arrives,” said Mandeep Singh, a trader from the city. A calculation by the Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) indicated that the third wave is likely by the last week of September. However, the finding suggested that it might get delayed in Ludhiana if 70% of eligible persons get immunized and people follow Covid appropriate behavior.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/covid-vax-supply-shortage-hamstrings-admns-efforts/articleshow/84326386.cms||Shariq Majeed

---||India||Wheelchair-bound CA goes places 15 years since 11/7 blasts||MUMBAI: As he peeks into his new office space on the eve of its inauguration, Chirag Chauhan cannot stop beaming. His dream of expanding his business has come true on a day that has had a profound impact on his life. Chauhan, 36, remembers July 11, 2006 differently-- not as a day that left him wheelchair-bound but as a day that propelled him to work harder and prove it to the world that no challenge was big enough if you have faith in yourself. Chauhan was all of 21 and was returning home from work, while pursuing his Chartered Accountancy (CA) articleship, when a series of explosions ripped through local trains on Western Railway. He remembers opening his eyes in a derailed coach, lying amid hordes of injured commuters at Santacruz and not being able to feel any sensation below his waist. The next three months were spent in various hospitals as he tried to come to terms with his new reality. Chauhan had suffered a spinal chord injury, leaving both his legs and lower body paralysed. "I often wondered, during those initial months, why did I have to suffer so much," he said. The physiotherapy was gruelling as Chauhan learnt to sit up straight and manage his body. His meals and exercise regime had to be done by the clock. "My mother was a constant pillar of support throughout. I also found solace in spiritual texts," he said. Between 2006 and 2009, Chauhan's daily routine comprised eight hours of physiotherapy and six hours of studying. "My father, who passed away a couple of years before the train blasts, had taught us to always look for a silver lining even in the darkest of times. I would always remind myself that there were people whose struggles were greater than mine and I was a lot more fortunate than they were. That helped me surge ahead," he said. After clearing his CA, Chauhan landed a job with an MNC. But the challenge was far from over. The MNC's office was in Chembur and Chauhan had to commute 25 kms one way to reach his workplace from his Kandivali home. He constantly aspired to start his own firm. After working for sometime with the MNC, Chauhan moved to a bank. Eventually in 2012, he opened a small office with a bunch of staff. "I had zero clients as I had moved from a corporate job," Chauhan said. But he worked very hard and started adding more and more clients. Not wanting to set any limitations on himself, Chauhan got a customised vehicle and travelled all over the country. During lockdown, he founded a platform which offers virtual taxation services. "The portal get 10000 hits daily and also has an app," he says excitedly. On Monday, Chauhan will begin a new journey in a much larger office space, against all odds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/wheelchair-bound-ca-goes-places-15-years-since-11/7-blasts/articleshow/84332586.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Nagpur||Aadhaar helps reunite Jabalpur family with lost son at Nagpur||NAGPUR: The Damle family had been bringing up 18-year-old Aman as their son, the youngest of three siblings, since he had been found alone and crying at Nagpur railway station 10 years ago. When they tried to get an Aadhaar card for Std X exam, the system refused to accept biometric details of Aman, who is slightly impaired in speech and mental abilities. An investigation revealed he was already registered as Mohd Amir, with his family residing at Jabalpur. The boy growing up in the Damle family of Naya Nakasha in Pachpaoli was the youngest son of Mohd Ayyub of Jabalpur. Aman alias Amir had gone missing from home around a decade ago. After much emotional turmoil, the Damle family, with Aman’s consent, handed him over to his biological parents at Hanumantaal police station in Jabalpur on June 30. Aman’s biological parents, who had thought their son had died, sobbed as they hugged the lost child reunited due to Aadhaar card’s unique biometric system, which did not allow a fresh ID to be prepared. Aman had been rescued by a NGO in 2012 from Nagpur railway station. He had gone to school with his sister but did not return home. No one knows how he ended up at Nagpur. The Nagpur railway police had shifted the boy to a government shelter home, from where the Damles had brought him to their hostel run through the International Mission of Dr Ambedkar Education Society, Panchasheel Nagar. “As he was unable to adjust at the shelter home and used to cry incessantly, we brought him to our hostel,” said Samarth Damle. “The boy was partially challenged in speech and mentally too. All we could gather from him was a name sounding like ‘Aman’. So, we started calling him Aman,” said Damle. “My wife Laxmi’s brother took care of him, and we had become his informal guardians. When the school wanted his father’s name, we had give a fictional name, ‘Suresh Dhangare’,” he said. “We raised Aman as our son. Our two biological children too had accepted him well. My sons planned to help him set up a small business as he struggled with studies,” he said. Samarth had been trying to get an Aadhaar card made for Aman for the last four years, but the system kept rejecting all attempts. The credit of the reunion goes to Nagpur Aadhaar Seva Kendra centre manager Anil Marathe, who decided to probe why Aman’s Aadhaar kept getting rejected. Marathe, an ex-serviceman, even contacted the Unique Identification Authority of India’s (UIDAI) technical team at Bengaluru, and the regional office at Mumbai, to resolve the ‘biometric issue’. “I had a doubt his Aadhaar must have been made somewhere, which was causing the biometric problem,” said Marathe. “Finally, the Mumbai office gave us access to the Aadhaar registered with the boy’s biometrics, where his name turned out to be ‘Mohd Amir’, with the address of Jabalpur in MP,” he said. “The emotional Damles were in denial mode initially, but later accepted the fact,” he said. “I personally got the address verified, and later even the police traced Aman’s missing person complaint,” he said. The Damles also visited Aman’s home at Jabalpur. His father owns a biryani outlet and a grocery shop. Aman too was keen to join his family, about whom he had faint memories. Laxmi fondly recalls how Aman would call her ‘mummy’. “He still calls me everyday to ask our well-being. We feel happy he is safe,” she said with teary eyes. “He is coming to meet me on my birthday (July 12),” says Laxmi in a voice choked with emotions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/aadhaar-helps-reunite-jabalpur-family-with-lost-son-at-nagpur/articleshow/84330826.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur Zilla Parishad president and vice-president polls to be held today||KOLHAPUR: Elections for the posts of president and vice-president of the Kolhapur Zilla Parishad is going to take place on Monday. Rahul Patil, son of Congress MLA P N Patil, is expected to get the official nomination from the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). The MVA alliance of Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP have 34 elected representatives on its side and few independents. The halfway mark to win the posts is 33. On the other hand, the BJP-led alliance has 24 elected members. BJP functionaries, such as Dhananjay Mahadik, are trying to get those on the fence on their side. So far, the BJP has received the support of Jan Surajya Shakti’s six members, the Prakash Awade-led front with one member, and the Chandgad Aghadi’s one member. Currently, the BJP has 32 on its side and is trying to woo the Raju Shetti’s Swabhimani Paksha that has two members. The MVA, meanwhile, has claimed that it has the support of independent members, which should help it get through comfortably. The MVA leaders are facing a tough task in selecting the right candidate for the president’s post. NCP leader and minister Hasan Mushrif is trying to get NCP’s elected member as the official nominee. However, his efforts have met resistance from Congress MLA P N Patil, who wants his son Rahul Patil to be the president. All members of the MVA front have been accommodated in a resort at Panhala, a famous hill station in the Kolhapur district. MVA leaders — ministers Satej Patil and Hasan Mushrif and MP Sanjay Mandlik — have held a couple of rounds of talks with the elected members. According to the sources, due to P N Patil’s pressure tactics of meeting Shetti and dialing opposition leaders, the MVA leaders are learned to have given up their demand and have shown readiness to make Rahul Patil the official nominee and thereby the president of the Zilla Parishad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-zp-president-vp-polls-to-be-held-today/articleshow/84324155.cms||---

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Wood turns hot as timber prices shoot up globally||RAJKOT: Think of buying wooden furniture? Keep a substantial budget as price rise in timber has made your furniture costlier too. Timber prices in the international market has shot up owing to increased demand in China and the USA as well as hike in freight charges. Domestic timber producers have now now decided to pass on the price rise to the end consumers which will push furniture and packaging material price up by almost 20% to 25%. According to the industry players, cost of raw material including teakwood, hardwood and pinewood shot up in the international market and together with hiked freight charges in five months, timber products will become dearer now. Gandhidham and Kandla are the largest clusters of timber producers in the country. Nearly 70% timber imported by India comes through Deendayal Port in Kandla and Mundra. Industry employs one lakh people and 70% of them are migrant labourers. Hike in prices will also affect real estate industry where process wood is used as building material. “We have no option but to pass the cost on to our customers,” said Navneet Gujjar, president of Kandla timber association. He further added that while the industry was still recovering from Covid effect, the new high prices will definitely dent demand in the market. Hardwood is used in making furniture, while teak is used in making doors and windows, and pine in packaging material. The plywood and timber processed in this industry is used in real estate industry, furniture, veneer, particle board, toys and other various sectors. Timber is imported from New Zealand, Australia, Uruguay, Malaysia, African countries, Latin America and European countries. The industry annually imports 40 lakh CBM (cubic metres) timber worth nearly Rs 7,000 crore. According to industrial sources, revival of economic activity pushed up demand for timber in China, USA and Europe pushing up prices of raw material. Freight charges all over the world increased by 20 to 25 percent which got accentuated by shortage of containers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/wood-turns-hot-as-timber-prices-shoot-up-globally/articleshow/84326454.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The victim Shubham Dudhal, his brother and six friends had gone to the Pavana dam area for a picnic on Sunday. “Around noon, Dudhal and some friends entered the water to swim. When Dudhal started drowning, his friends raised an alarm. Some locals attempted to save him, but couldn’t,” the officer said. Dudhal’s body was brought out after a two-hour-long search, the officer added. A senior officer from the Pune rural police said over 500 people were fined at different tourist spots. “We had deployed extra manpower at the tourist spots and prevented people for going there,” the officer said. He said in Lonavla, over 100 people had been fined. “These revellers were fined for not wearing masks and for not following social distancing norms,” the officer said. The deputy CM and the district guardian minister Ajit Pawar on Friday had said many people had been visiting the tourist spots in the district, which was not permitted because of the Covid-19 pandemic. He had also directed the police to take action against such people.

Senior police officials of the city traffic branch said around 100 illegally parked vehicles were towed and brought to the office of traffic department since Wednesday, when the towing system became operational. Assistant commissioner of police Seetaram Gaikwad said, “Currently, the action is focused on certain congested areas like Panchavati, MG Road, City Centre Mall area, Shalimar and CBS. Over a period of time, the contractor will be asked to deploy more cranes and vehicles in other parts of the city.” Gaikwad said the results of the towing cranes have started reflecting on the city streets as motorists have become aware that their vehicles will be towed if they park their vehicles in illegal parking areas. Traffic department personnel said when a vehicle is towed, the vehicle owner is not just worried about the fine but also the hassle of coming to the traffic office to take back the vehicle after paying the fine. Illegal parking has become a menace as the haphazard parking ends up hampering the smooth flow of traffic. This is typically observed in the Shalimar and CBS areas. Meanwhile, the traffic police personnel on the towing vehicles make proper announcement through the public address (PA) system on their vehicles about the illegally parked vehicles. If the motorists concerned do not turn up in time, only then the vehicles are picked up, said police officials. The action against illegal parking would be intensified in the coming weeks after there is sufficient awareness among people, said ACP Gaikwad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/vehicular-traffic-eases-with-use-of-towing-vans-in-nashik/articleshow/84324197.cms||Santosh Sonawane

While the traffic police were turning away people arriving in groups to go to the dam, some people started arguing with the police saying they were local residents and cannot be stopped from going towards their homes. Police inspector Samadhan Nagare of Igatpuri police station said traffic personnel were taking action against the tourists moving towards the dam area. However, when the argument started, he and his team were around the corner and immediately reached the spot to resolve the issue. “Such cases keep happening as tourists come up with explanation that have some relatives in the area or they have come to see a plot of land or they reside in the area. However, since the local police are deployed at the spot they can well make out who is a tourist and who is a local,” he said. Another police officer said the local residents do not travel towards the dam area with their family in cars as they are well aware of the check points in place by police. “People should refrain from moving towards such tourist spots as overcrowding at such places would lead to the spread of the infection,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/people-argue-with-cops-at-bhavali-dam-checkpoint/articleshow/84324258.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Solar plants, electric lines sounding death knell of GIB||JAISALMER/JAIPUR: In what could be termed an apparent contradiction, the promotion of green energy in the state's desert areas is coming at a huge environmental cost and sounding the death knell of the Great Indian Bustard (GIB). The habitat of the endangered species is being threatened by overhead transmission lines and massive arrays of solar panels mindlessly erected across government and private lands. On Sunday, villagers started a protest again to save the habitat of GIBs. Sumer Singh, a green activist, said, "The administration has turned a blind eye and solar companies are installing panels and overhead lines in Bhimsar, Bhopa, Sawata, Rasala villages. The forest department has given up efforts to save the bird, accorded the highest protection under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. More than five memorandums have been presented to the district collector, but work on these solar plants is going on at full swing," Experts and locals also alleged that projects are being cleared on a massive scale without plans to address the threat posed by them for the GIB habitat. They have also sounded the alarm that this could pave the way for the iconic bird from being functionally extinct at its natural habitat. Moreover, they say that the species may migrate to Pakistan if their habitat continues to be destroyed. Radheysham Bishnoi, who is working for GIB conservation, said, "The grassland habitat in the Cholistan desert is similar to the bird's habitat in Rajasthan. There have been reports in the past that the GIB had migrated to Pakistan crossing the international border. If its habitat is destroyed in Rajasthan, more will fly over to Pakistan. The possibilities of the bird returning are minimal as it can fall prey to poachers there." The state government is, meanwhile, making plans to produce 30,000MW of solar energy by creating solar farms and wean the state away from carbon-based energy. The residents of the desert region have criticised the government and the department for not devising a strategy to tackle long-term consequences of such a move and enable harmonious co-existence with nature and wildlife. Green activist Parth Jagani said, "Trees are being recklessly cut to install solar plants. In the absence of policy or monitoring, the desert ecology and GIB habitat are being destroyed beyond repair." After the population of GIB, a tall bird with a wingspan of over two metres, declined from an estimated 1,260 in 1969 to around 150 in 2018, the Supreme Court had directed to take overhead power transmission lines in Jaisalmer district and surrounding areas underground. But, lack of cooperation between departments and lackadaisical attitude of officials have hit the effort. The state forest and environment minister Sukhram Vishnoi had assured that the habitat will not be disturbed. "New electricity lines will not be laid near the GIB habitat area. The areas will be identified soon," he had said. As per a study conducted by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), an average of 15 GIBs die every year after colliding with power lines. Wildlife biologist and deputy professor at Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University Sumit Dookia said, "The state has initiated a GIB breeding programme. But, simultaneously, renewable energy projects are also being cleared in large numbers and commissioned in the world's last surviving GIB area. These projects come with a huge network of high-power electricity lines. This has been pointed out as the biggest threat for the survival of GIBs in recent years." The state government, however, said they have identified areas where power lines are causing a problem. Energy minister BD Kalla said, "Orders have been issued to put diverters on power lines being laid for industrial development in nearby pasture lands and the work will start soon." International Union for Conservation of Nature member Dau Lal said, "The state government should constitute a district environment committee, headed by the collector, to save the desert ecology. Corporate funds should be collected from solar companies and utilised for habitat improvement. There should also be a dedicated fund to develop grasslands and plant trees."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/solar-plants-electric-lines-sounding-death-knell-of-gib/articleshow/84330834.cms||---

The directive from Bhujbal came after a delegation of grape farmers met him. One of the grape exporters has allegedly cheated several grape farmers from Niphad, Dindori, Chandvad and Trimbakeshwar talukas of the district to the tune of Rs 2.5 crore during the last grape season. The exporter concerned along with many others have not paid the money to the farmers after procurement of grapes. The delegation of grape farmers included Santosh Aher, Sharad Malsane, Raghunath Patil, Sunil Shinde, Trimbak Kadlag, Madhukar Malsane, Hiraman Kadam, among others met Bhujbal and handed over a memorandum, seeking action against the trades.

Officials of Palitana wildlife range suspect that the leopard may have been attracted by the goats tethered near the house or the family may have consumed non-vegetarian food at night and dumped the lefover nearby. The victim was identified as Daya Madhasukhiya, whose father Arvind works as a farm labourer. “The leopard attacked around 4am and dragged the girl before the family could come to her rescue. It ate around 70-80% of the body. The victim could be identified only by her clothes. Four cages have been set up in the area to capture the wild cat,” said Arpit Bhariya, range forest officer of Palitana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/leopard-devours-a-sleeping-toddler/articleshow/84326576.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Man gets 10-year jail for raping 28-year-old with mental age of 5||MUMBAI: Observing that a 28-year-old woman with the mental age of a 5-year-old cannot give consent, a sessions court on Saturday convicted and sentenced her distant relative to 10 years rigorous imprisonment for raping and impregnating her in 2016. The DNA recovered from the aborted foetus confirmed the 30-year-old accused as the father. The woman, who is already married with two children despite her mental deficiency, was living with her parents as her husband’s family had been harassing her. While the accused claimed that the relationship was consensual, the survivor deposed in court and iterated that the accused attacked her in a public toilet in their vicinity. Citing the relevant IPC section, the court said, “Whoever commits rape on a woman suffering from mental or physical disability is guilty irrespective of her age. From the evidence adduced on record, the victim was suffering from mental disability and though she was a major her mental age was that of a 64-month-old. Therefore, her consent is no consent in the eyes of law...” the court said. Public prosecutor Kalpana Hire cited the evidence of nine witnesses, including the survivor, her stepfather, medical officers and cops, to seek the conviction of the accused. The court also fined the accused Rs 40,000. If recovered, Rs 30,000 will have to be paid to the woman as compensation. The woman had been living with her parents since December 2015. She was suffering from epilepsy and was seeking treatment under their care. The survivor’s stepfather, the complainant in the case, told cops that in August 2016, he noticed changes in the woman’s appearance and the manner in which she was walking. He said when he took the survivor into confidence, she told him about the rape and identified the accused as the perpetrator. She also alleged that the accused threatened to kill her and her daughter if she revealed about the incident to anyone. The prosecution submitted that on August 16, 2016, when the survivor was unwell and taken to the hospital, the doctor disclosed that she was five months pregnant. It was then that an FIR was lodged and the accused arrested. When the survivor deposed in court, she said she had tried to raise an alarm when attacked but the accused had gagged her. The survivor denied she was having an affair with him or that she had filed a false case against the accused to avoid being defamed. Convicting the accused, the court said, “In view of the DNA report produced on record, the accused is concluded to be the biological father and the victim is concluded his biological mother. Therefore, there is oral, documentary and scientific evidence available on record to prove the charge levelled against the accused.”  (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/kin-jailed-for-rape-court-says-mentally-ill-cant-give-consent/articleshow/84331976.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Nashik||Nashik division: Panel to resolve school fee issues||NASHIK: Nitin Upasani, the deputy director of education, Nashik division, has formed a five-member committee to resolve the issues about the fees, payment mode and online education between the schools and the students’ parents. The committee will conduct a joint meeting of the schools and authorized parents’ representatives of the schools where there are issues about payment of fees to discuss modalities about going ahead with the education in these troubled times. “I am flooded with complaints about schools allegedly charging exorbitant fees, the parents not paying their dues in time and other things. Schools have even threatened to stop the online education for the students, whose parents fail to clear the dues,” Upasani said. As a government authority, the office does not have any jurisdiction to decide about the fees, he said. While the schools claim that they have to carry out maintenance of the school, buses, pay the teachers for which they need funds, at the same time, theparents said the schools' fees should not include various charges like a library, mess, playground development, school gathering but only tuition fees and examination fees. “I have issued an order in which a team of five officers has been formed. They will decide in some time about conducting a meeting with one representative of each of the schools and one from the parents’ teachers’ association. They will hold a webinar or meet in person with following Covid guidelines and come to a common conclusion,” he said. The schools and parents will then have to stick to this resolution that will ensure smooth functioning of the schools and the failure to stick to the resolution will invite action, Uapasni said. Himgauri Adke of the Nashik Schools Association said the move by the education department was limited only to the schools, where there are issues about payments. “Since it is limited to few schools, each of the schools will make their own decisions though we expect things to be normalised for the students at the earliest,” Adke said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-divn-panel-to-resolve-school-fee-issues/articleshow/84324264.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Mumbai||Two BMC engineers to be sacked for Kamla fire are still on duty||MUMBAI: Two BMC engineers who were to be sacked after being found guilty in an inquiry into the Kamla Mills fire will be suspended a second time. The two — assistant engineer MG Shelar and junior engineer Dharmaraj Shinde — who had been suspended earlier, were reinstated last year, citing ‘shortage of staff amid the pandemic’. Now municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal has ordered that both of them be suspended. Also, a third one, sub-engineer Dinesh Mahale, will be suspended. While the two were ordered to be removed from municipal service, Mahale who was found guilty and punished with severe reduction in pay. All three were suspended the day after a major fire broke out at in December 2017 killing 14 people. The inquiry report by then additional commissioner Vijay Singhal had stated that there was serious negligence and connivance on the part of the officials. TOI had reported in April this year that the two who were to be sacked had been reinstated into service. “Now, the municipal commissioner has sent a proposal to suspend them again,” says a communication from city engineer Parag Raut, in reply to Samajwadi Party corporatorRais Shaikh, also an MLA. Suspension of an employee would mean that the person concerned is not allowed to report to work till an enquirty is completed. However, the employee continues to receive at least 70% of the regular salary and other benefits. “The two engineers [Shelar and Shinde] had been ordered to be removed from municipal service by then BMC chief Ajoy Mehta. Those charged with negligence and dereliction of duty that led to death of 14 people should not be reinstated at any cost. The two must be dismissed from service, not just suspended a second time,” said Shaikh. “I will file a complaint with the Lokayukta against the city engineer for failing to act on the BMC chief’s orders for such a long time,” According to BMC records, then municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi had in April last year, issued orders to reinstate all engineers who were under suspension. Pardeshi had asked the BMC to reinstate all engineers under suspension since BMC was “facing a shortage of manpower” during the pandemic. These engineers were to be assigned Covid duty and their suspension was taken back only temporarily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-bmc-engineers-to-be-sacked-for-kamla-fire-are-still-on-duty/articleshow/84330861.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Pune||Maharashtra: 19 lakh due for second dose to be given shots on priority||PUNE: The state government has told all district and civic officials to give priority jabs to the nearly 19 lakh people who are now up for a second dose of the Covid vaccines. As on July 8, about 19.19 lakh citizens from all groups — healthcare staff, frontline workers and 18-plus — are due for a second dose (of either Covishield or Covaxin), across the state's 35 districts. Pune, Mumbai, Nagpur and Kolhapur have the highest number of beneficiaries. The move to give these people priority jabs comes in the wake of a central directive that asked states to have a “regular review of beneficiaries due for the second dose and focus on timely completion of their vaccination schedule”. “As per the Government of India’s directives (dated July 9), you are instructed to implement an appropriate communication strategy for the dissemination about the importance of the need to take the second due dose for full protection from Covid-19," Archana Patil, director of health services, Maharashtra, wrote in a letter to district/civic administrations on Friday (July 9). The state has administered more than 3.5 crore doses so far. “We have asked officials to keep special focus on the administration of the second dose to all eligible beneficiaries,” Patil said. Among the four districts with the highest number of people due for a second shot of Covishield, Mumbai has the most. The number includes 32,052 healthcare workers (HCWs), 31,665 frontline workers (FLWs) and 1,12,350 citizens over 18. The total stands at 1,76,067. As for Covaxin, Mumbai has 26,358 beneficiaries due for its second shot from all beneficiary groups.

Community members said Dhangars in Goa have not yet received justice despite the fact that Goa is celebrating 60 years of liberation. President of Sattari taluka Dhangar community B D Mote said, Gawda, Kunbi and Velip communities were given the status of scheduled tribe in 2003 but the Dhangar community was not. “It is a matter of great sadness that the Dhangar community, though originally from Goa, has not been given the status of scheduled tribes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/recognise-dhangars-as-scheduled-tribe/articleshow/84329071.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Civic bodies keep up spl drives, despite low stock||PUNE: Both PMC and PCMC — currently running very low on vaccine reserves — are carefully balancing stock to keep up coverage of special groups, alongside the general population. Officials said Covishield stock in PMR is expected to run dry by Tuesday morning. A fresh batch is also likely to arrive that day. The civic bodies have been holding drives for the so-called super-spreaders, the transgender community, pregnant women and residents of slum pockets. In PMC areas, more than 5,000 people from the “super-spreader” category have been inoculated so far. “Super-spreaders” refers to those who, due to their professions, come in contact with a large number of people every day. The list includes shopkeepers, delivery personnel and others. “We have also planned drives across more than 300 slum pockets this week,” a PMC official said, adding that limited vaccine supply remains the “only problem” that’s standing in the way of swift coverage. A PCMC official said drives began last week for the transgender community.. “We are also holding drives for pregnant women and bedridden citizens,” the official said. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said apart from drives for marginalised groups, officials have been instructed to immediately clear the second-dose backlog. “The number of beneficiaries due for a second dose is increasing with each passing day,” he said. On Sunday, just over 13,000 people got their jabs in the district. A vaccination holiday at some private and civic sites caused coverage to dip, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/civic-bodies-keep-up-spl-drives-despite-low-stock/articleshow/84329051.cms||---

It’s learnt, complainant Sushil Dewulwar was befriended by one Suchita Das on a matrimonial site. Das claimed to be a resident of New Jersey in USA. After exchanging their details, Das showed interest in marrying Sushil. Police said Sushil is a priest while his elder brother Sunil is a government employee posted in Chandrapur. Das and his accomplices lured Sushil by offering to send him an expensive mobile phone, laptop and $1 lakh as a pre-marriage gift, said police. Sushil started getting calls and mails from tricksters posing as officials of custom and excise from airports and other places. They asked Sushil to deposit cash in different bank accounts for clearing the gift from custom departments. Sushil and his elder brother coughed up different amounts before the tricksters stopped contacting them. An offence was registered at Beltarodi police station against 17 persons, including Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/man-duped-of-rs40-64l-in-name-of-pre-marriage-gift/articleshow/84330862.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Survey shows 83% students, parents & teachers want offline schools||PUNE: Over 80% of the students, parents and teachers in Maharashtra have shown their willingness to resume offline schooling in a study conducted by the Maharashtra State Council of Education Research and Training (SCERT). The survey was taken voluntarily by 2.6 lakh participants and 83% said schools should reopen. The survey was launched on Friday and shared with various stakeholders for the state government to take an appropriate decision about reopening of schools. The survey had basic questions on name and address details and if schools should be reopened for offline teaching. Director of SCERT, Dinkar Temkar, said, “On the first three days of the survey, nearly three lakh respondents participated and a huge number of these participants, which was over 80%, were of the opinion that schools should reopen.” Since March 2020, when the Covid-19 infection spread across the country, schools have been shut and education is being conducted online. In November, schools were reopened for standards IX and X for a brief period before they were shut down in January with a rise in Covid-19 cases. During this period, schools in rural areas reopened till Std VIII but in the urban areas remained online to educate. Once again, the state government has started the survey to reopen the schools soon. The state government has also issued a notification announcing the guidelines to reopen them in the coming days. Former director of education, Vasant Kalpande, said students are suffering as a result of schools being closed and it is difficult to say how much learning has been lost. “Due to pandemic fear, how many more sectors are going to be shut down? It will not be wise to undertake the risk of loss of education and the pandemic. In fact, there should be stress on starting schools from Std I. Like last year, a declaration from parents can be taken,” he said. Last year, classes from standards I to IV did not start at all. It should restart where the infection rate is low, he added. There was risk even when students are sitting at home. “Considering all this, schools must reopen. International organisations have recommended reopening of schools,” he said. The reopening will be decided by seven-member committees set up in villages that have been Covid-free for a month. Along with keeping Covid protocols in place, parental consent is a must to start physical schools. Classes each day cannot exceed four hours and only main subjects will have to be taught.  Each class should not have more than 20 students and attendance is not compulsory. The permissions will be for Classes VIII- XII. While few schools may reopen from July 15 in rural areas, a decision regarding starting degree colleges offline is still to be taken by the state. Higher education minister Uday Samant said last week that degree colleges were unlikely to start for at least a month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/survey-shows-83-students-parents-teachers-want-offline-schools/articleshow/84329068.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The speakers described Stan Swamy as a human rights champion who resolved to fight the forces that allegedly linked him to Naxalites and jailed him under the provisions of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. A condolence meet was organized at Kavivarya Tilak Vachnalaya, Holy Cross Church in the evening. Remembering Stan Swamy and his fight for the common man Raosaheb Kasbe, writer, professor and scholar on Dalit movements, said the laws by the government were aimed at suppressing the voice of common man. “Stan Swamy fought for the common man, but we are unable to fight for our own rights. In order to change the situation let us resolve to contribute to the fight by raising awareness among the people,” he said. Uttam Kamble, a journalist and a strong supporter of the fight for the oppressed and deprived, said Stan Swamy’s death was not limited to any government, but the system that does not want such people. “Any political party that gains power enters the system and starts suppressing the movement and voice of people because they know that such movements start questioning them. Stan Swamy’s death is the result of such system,” Kamble said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashikites-pay-tribute-to-father-stan-swamy/articleshow/84324317.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Mumbai||Now, priority jabs for 19 lakh up for their 2nd shot in Maharashtra||PUNE: The state government has directed all district and civic officials to give priority jabs to the nearly 19 lakh people who are now up for their second dose of the Covid vaccine. As on July 8, about 19.19 lakh citizens from all groups — healthcare staff, frontline workers and 18-plus — are due for a second dose (either Covishield or Covaxin), across the state’s 35 districts. Pune, Mumbai, Nagpur and Kolhapur have the highest number of beneficiaries. The move to give these people priority jabs comes in the wake of a central directive that asked states to have a “regular review of beneficiaries due for the second dose and focus on timely completion of their vaccination schedule”. “As per the Government of India's directives (dated July 9), you are instructed to implement an appropriate communication strategy for the dissemination about the importance of the need to take the second due dose for full protection from Covid-19,” Archana Patil, director of health services, Maharashtra, wrote in a letter to district/civic administrations issued on Friday (July 9). The state has administered more than 3.5 crore vaccine doses so far. "We have asked officials to keep special focus on the administration of the second dose of the vaccine to all eligible beneficiaries," Patil said. Among the four districts with the highest number of people due for a second shot of Covishield, Mumbai has the most — 32,052 healthcare workers (HCWs), 31,665 frontline workers (FLWs) and 1,12,350 citizens over 18. The total stands at 1,76,067. As for Covaxin, Mumbai has 26,358 beneficiaries due for its second shot from all groups. In Pune district, a total of 22,244 HCWs are eligible for a second dose of Covishield, followed by 25,135 FLWs and 1,24,995 citizens. The total number stands at 1,72,374. For Covaxin second dose, Pune has 34,429 beneficiaries (from all groups) who are due. In Nagpur district, a total of 1,36,918 beneficiaries are due for a Covishield second dose — 10,755 HCWs, 14,674 FLWs and 1,11, 489 citizens over 18. The district also has 12,106 beneficiaries due for a Covaxin second dose. Kolhapur district has a total of 1,20,655 beneficiaries who now need a second shot of Covishield. The number includes 4,985 HCWs, 6,542 FLWs and 10,9138 citizens who're over 18. As for Covaxin, Kolhapur has 6,139 people eligible for a second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/now-2nd-jab-on-priority-for-19-lakh-in-maharashtra-state/articleshow/84329151.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Patna||Bihar colleges to resume classes today with 50% attendance||PATNA: All institutions of higher education, including technical and professional colleges, are set to resume offline classes with 50% student attendance from Monday. Offline classes were suspended in all schools and colleges of the state nearly four months ago following the onset of the second wave of the Covid-19. Patna University (PU) vice-chancellor Girish Kumar Chaudhary said the syllabi of almost all the undergraduate and postgraduate courses have been completed through online classes and the students are in examination mode. All the postgraduate departments and colleges have been instructed to run classes either in online or offline mode to complete the courses, if not done already. They have been further instructed to run practical classes in offline mode from Monday by calling students in small batches, he said. However, PU has not yet decided to reopen its hostels from Monday. Students coming from outside for attending their theory or practical classes would certainly need hostel accommodation. Students’ welfare dean Anil Kumar said if students return from their homes, they would be accommodated in their respective hostels. Patna Women’s College principal Sister M Rashmi said college students would continue to attend online classes as usual. Those coming from outside for attending practical classes (being arranged from Monday onward) would get accommodation in the college hostel, she said. However, BIT Patna director Arbind Kumar said unless necessary instructions are received from the government for reopening the hostels, it would not resume offline classes. Classes would continue to be held in online mode as usual. Only MTech and PhD scholars would visit the college for theory or practical training. Patna-based institutions under Patliputra University are also prepared to resume their offline classes. A N College principal S P Shahi said the entire campus has been properly sanitized. No student would be allowed to enter the campus without face masks. Handwash and sanitisers would be available at all important places in the college. There will be no problem in maintaining social distance as only students of Degree Part II class are supposed to come right now, he said. J D Women’s College principal Shyama Roy said it is really very difficult to maintain Covid protocols even with 50%attendance. There are 7,000 students on roll and even if 3,500 girls are allowed to come to the college on a single day, it would be a herculean task to make them follow social distancing both inside or outside the classrooms, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-colleges-to-resume-classes-today-with-50-attendance/articleshow/84329148.cms||B K Mishra
---||Pune||Insurance finds flavour among young people||PUNE: Ashwin Golwarkar (24) landed himself a job as a call centre executive with a company in Pune last month. He did not wait to contact an insurance agent after consulting his elder brother. “My salary is not huge but I got a life insurance and a medical insurance for myself and my family. In another year, when there would have been no pandemic, I would have ended up spending on buying clothes, electronics or food. However, looking at the second wave, which saw so many deaths, I have got these policies,” he told TOI. “Many are skipping paying premiums and their policies are becoming inactive. There are insurance companies who have come with easy options for paying premiums. Even so, a large number of young people are inquiring about different policies, the returns and easy premium options. Of these, at least 20% want a life insurance with benefits, a mediclaim policy or a term insurance. We try to explain in simple terms. During our interactions, nearly all say the second wave has scared them and they wanted insurances rather than spending without thought,” insurance agent Priya Nalawade said. Health insurance was in high demand, she said and she has sold close to 15 to 16 policies each month for two months now which was not the case earlier. “The percentage of youngsters buying them was close to 10% to 15%. For life insurance policies, I have around 20 to 30 customers each month now and many are youngsters who have got jobs. Even those with modest incomes want insurance,” she added. Prashant Kale, another agent who has his office in Fatimanagar, said many people who comes to him had no clue about the policies, their use and how to plan for them. “They have seen many people passing away during the second wave and are scared. Some come to me with their children who have just got a job, and want insurances in their names. Last month, I got calls from more than 50 of my clients who were desperate to increase their mediclaim policies. Youngsters with salaries with Rs 15,000 or even less are looking for a health insurance or a life insurance. It was not the case earlier,” Kale told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/insurance-finds-flavour-among-young-people/articleshow/84329106.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Goa||Goa: Abandoned for 12 years, Valpoi’s park cries for help||VALPOI: When Hafeeza Sayed’s two-year-old daughter wants to go to a park, the Valpoi-resident has to make the 44km-long journey to Panaji. And she’s not the only. Once upon a time, the Sattari town boasted a beautiful children’s park, where toddlers would gather in the evenings, as well as senior citizens for some fresh air. But as development projects took over the town, it was left to rot. Over the past 12 years, there has been no maintenance of the park, leading to its deterioration. Another parent said that the garden in Valpoi has been overrun by grass and creepers. The playing equipment is now concealed behind this grass, broken and rusted, to such an extent that it now has to be replaced entirely. Sources said that Valpoi Municipal Council (VMC) had shortlisted two locations in its jurisdiction where a garden was proposed, as part of a beautification project, but so far, the plan has remained on paper only. Recently, during civic poll campaigning, many prominent citizens had demanded that this park be refurbished, so that senior citizens and children can use it for recreational purposes. VMC councillors, too, conducted a meeting on this issue. Councillor Ramdas Shirodkar told TOI that the council will be taking up the project of ‘children’s park-cum-entrepreneur centre’, which was once sent to the directorate of municipal administration, and a nod was received. “Due to civic polls, the follow-up of the file was not done, and now the same proposal will be taken up as there is a public demand for it,” Shirodkar said. Another councillor, Idris Shaikh, said that it is the need of the hour to have an operational children’s park in a town like Valpoi, since it is the headquarters of Sattari taluka, which comprises several villages. “This project will benefit children and senior citizens of the entire taluka, and provide a proper place to spend their leisure time,” he said. VMC councillors further said they would soon meet health minister and Valpoi MLA Vishwajit Rane and discuss the issue with him, requesting him to do the work. “We have hope in our MLA and he will definitely take up this work on a priority basis,” councillors said. Sources also told TOI that the proposal regarding a ‘self-sustainable children’s park’ was sent through VMC in 2016. The proposed project comprised a children’s play area, sand pit, jogger’s track, cafeteria, an exhibition hall for self-helf groups, lawn area, decking, sitting area for senior citizens, and parking. The project was designed as a recreational area, and also as a source of income.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/abandoned-for-12-years-valpois-park-cries-for-help/articleshow/84329186.cms||Afaq Khan

---||Mumbai||Patients grapple with weakness, cough, hair loss for weeks post-Covid: Survey||MUMBAI: An exercise to understand how mild and moderate Covid patients cope after being discharged from hospital revealed that some grappled with weakness, fatigue, loss of smell, cough and breathlessness for days to weeks. While patients with critical Covid are known to take months to recover, with many even grappling with post-Covid sequelae, the Dahisar jumbo centre has tried to find out how those with less severe symptoms cope. Dahisar jumbo centre is a Dedicated Covid Health Centre that has treated around 10,000 cases in the two waves of coronavirus before it was shut for renovations in mid-May. It recently reached out to 396 patients who were admitted in April and May this year to learn about their post-Covid quality of life. Weakness emerged as the commonest complaint in up to 15% of the respondents. Prolonged cough and breathlessness were reported by 2.3% and 1.3% of patients, respectively. A few patients complained of unusually high hair loss, while one patient had developed mucormycosis. Only 3% of patients said their quality of life was affected since they were infected. Overall, 87% said they were healthy and have resumed their routine lives. Around 15.4% of patients required ICU admission after their disease progressed. Three patients (0.8%), who started out as moderate Covid cases, died of the viral infection after being moved to higher centres. Dean of the facility, Dr Deepa Shriyan, said that the follow-up calls were made to patients after a month of discharge. “It gave us good insights about the quality of care we provided. It will also help us prepare our patients in the future about what to expect once they are discharged,” she said. As many as 60% of patients didn’t have any comorbidities. Among those with comorbidities, 28% had hypertension and 25% had diabetes. Interestingly, Dr Shriyan said as many as 85% had travel history. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said all hospitals that have treated Covid patients have been asked to carry out follow-ups on their patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/patients-grapple-with-weakness-cough-hair-loss-for-weeks-post-covid-in-mumbai-survey/articleshow/84329248.cms||Sumitra Debroy

It houses almost 76 different species of cryptogams, a primitive plant species found since the Jurassic era. Cryptogams are considered among the best bioindicators, as they grow only at places without pollution and with ample soil moisture. The garden has been developed in Deoban as it has a majestic pristine forest of Deodar and Oak trees, besides being pollution-free, said Sanjiv Chaturvedi, chief conservator of forests (research). Speaking to TOI, Chaturvedi said, “This is India’s first cryptogamic garden. The species of plants in the garden only grow in a pollution-free environment and at places with adequate moisture. These species will just vanish even if there is the slightest deviation in the environmental indicators.” He added, “The species of fungi, algae and lichens found here have a big role to play in ecology and environment as they are imperative to sustain life on earth.” Notably, Uttarakhand is home to 539 species of lichens, 346 species of algae, 478 species of bryophytes and 365 species of pteridophytes. Elaborating on the benefits of these cryptogams, Chaturvedi said, “Algae is a healthy source of Vitamin A, B, C and E and has bountiful of several other minerals too. Similarly, bryophytes are known for air monitoring, binding soil particles and preventing soil erosion. Meanwhile, fungi are used for decomposing things and are also essential in the making of bread, wine, beer and cheese. Lichens, on the other hand, are complex life forms formed out of a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and algae.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-forest-dept-sets-up-indias-first-cryptogamic-garden/articleshow/84324539.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Goa||Goa philatelic bureau facing closure from today||PANAJI: The philatelic bureau in Goa, that operates from the head post office at Panaji, is facing closure from July 12, following an order from the philately division of the department of posts, New Delhi, in which a total of 31 bureaus across the country are being shut down. There are a total of four bureaus that fall under the Maharashtra circle, one of which is the Goa philatelic bureau. The others are Nashik, Aurangabad and Nagpur, which are also facing closure. For now onwards, the Mumbai philatelic bureau will cater to the needs of philatelists in these areas, and there will be only a limited stock of stamps with Goa. Philatelist depository accounts (PDA) of philatelists in Goa will also be serviced in Mumbai. “There will be major challenges once the bureau is shut down,” senior superintendent of post offices Sudhir Jakhere said. “The special cancellation that comes with each release (of a philatelic cover) cannot be done in Goa. With only a limited stock of stamps coming from the Mumbai bureau, a philatelic counter will be established in Goa for people to source stamps. The PDA account holders will have to be transferred to Mumbai,” he said. The Goa Philately and Numismatics Society (GPNS) is planning to meet union minister for tourism and ports Shripad Naik to get the closure decision revoked. “Goa will be deprived of its only philatelic bureau which functions in Panaji, which a lot of tourists, both domestic and foreign, visit for getting new stamps and philatelic material. The public, and philatelists in particular, will be put to a lot of hardship to get their philatelic material such as stamps, special covers and first day covers from the philatelic bureau in Mumbai or Bengaluru,” GPNS president, MR Ramesh Kumar said. The philatelic bureau was planning to celebrate the 150th year of the first stamp of Portuguese India, which was released in 1871, by bringing out a special cover on the stamp. Special covers on Mario Miranda, ferry boats, motorcycle pilots of Goa and the 60th year of Goa’s liberation were also in the pipeline for this year. “This is an insult to philatelists and the people of Goa to close down the bureau in such a commemorative year,” Kumar said. The move has evoked strong reactions from the Goa Civic and Consumer Action Network, which has called for a review of the decision by the Delhi-based department. It has also demanded that the Goa postmaster general take steps to revoke the decision, of shutting down the philatelic bureau thus protecting the interests of the state’s postal consumers and philately enthusiasts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-philatelic-bureau-facing-closure-from-today/articleshow/84329289.cms||Nida Sayed

This is the start of such “week long drives” in mishap-prone zones. On Pune E-way, over 100 were caught for overspeeding which is the leading cause of crashes as heavy vehicles ram into smaller vehicles. Besides, lane-cutting is an issue and the RTO enforcement squad has caught 533 heavy vehicles driving on the right lane reserved for cars/SUVs or for lane-cutting. “I plan to organise such drives once a week on every stretch which is accident-prone and where fatalities are reported every year. I have asked my officials to cover every district of Maharashtra in the next two months,” , transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne said on Sunday. Deputy commissioner (enforcement) Abhay Deshpande, who conducted the drive on the E-way, said that speed of trucks in the ghat section needs to be 40 kmph, but many truckers were found driving at 80 kmph and above. “As they speed down the ghats, they ram into cars, resulting in dangerous collisions and fatalities. This needs to be stopped,” he said. The officials conducting the drive said they also nabbed a few truckers for speaking on phone while driving.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-over-700-get-penalised-on-e-way-100-for-speeding/articleshow/84331004.cms||Somit Sen
---||Delhi||Delhi: Debris dumped on Yamuna floodplain, FIR filed||NEW DELHI: Construction debris was found to be dumped on the Yamuna floodplain near CWG village on Sunday in violation of the order of National Green Tribunal (NGT). Delhi Development Authority (DDA) said that the debris is being removed and an FIR has been lodged in the matter. According to an NGT order of 2015, dumping of any kind of waste or construction and demolition debris on Yamuna floodplain is banned. Anyone found violating the order is liable to pay an environmental compensation up to Rs 50,000. Bhim Singh Rawat, a Yamuna activist and part of South Asia Network on Dams, River and People (SANDRP), who raised the matter on social media said, “Construction debris has been dumped on Yamuna floodplains in violation of NGT order. Those who are involved in the illegal dumping of debris should be booked.” Rawat also shared the images of debris lying on the floodplain. DDA, which is tasked by NGT to remove encroachment from Yamuna floodplain, alleged that some miscreants dumped the debris. “An agency has been working at the project side,” said an official. A spokesperson of DDA said, “The malba is dumped by some illegal miscreants and the action is being taken to remove it on Sunday. Meanwhile, an FIR has been lodged in this regard against the miscreants.” In February 2020, the images of construction debris on the Yamuna floodplains under Nizamuddin Bridge appeared on social media. Both the Central Pollution Control Board and Yamuna Monitoring Committee (now dissolved) had sought an action taken report in the matter from DDA. “Floodplains play an important role in maintaining the flow of the river, help recharge groundwater and provide a habitat for aquatic biodiversity-the most significant sign of a river’s health,” Yamuna Monitoring Committee had observed in its final report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/debris-dumped-on-floodplain-fir-filed/articleshow/84329249.cms||---

The district police arrested three shooters, Rahul alias Charlie (23), Himanshu (21) and Mehtab (52), and Firoz who had hired them, while Special Cell caught Mohammad Danish (37), a builder and the key conspirator, and four others, Soaib Sidduqui (35), Sarafat Ali (35), Sonu (32) and Satender kumar alias Rocky (30) following a late-night shootout on Sunday. Injured criminals have been shifted to hospital. According to police, the shooters had started a quarrel with Mohammad Naeem and his nephew Munib after stopping their car near DCM Roundabout in Bara Hindu Rao. “They were, however, overpowered by the victims with the help of passersby and fled. But the attackers soon returned and fired a few bullets, killing two persons who were not the target,” deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse. A case of murder and attempt to murder has been registered. Investigations revealed the complainant, Naeem, and Munib were having rivalry with other builders of Sadar Bazar and Bara Hindu Rao, including Danish who was constructing a building on his own plot. “Munib had managed to get a stay on the construction at Ahata Kidara and got it demolished. Danish, along with his partner Mehtab and a relative of the latter, then conspired to kill both Munib and Naeem,” the DCP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-arrest-nine-for-shooting-that-left-two-passersby-dead/articleshow/84329278.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra doubles builder bonanza in redevelopment schemes||MUMBAI: A new state urban development department notification offers builders virtually double the existing construction inducements for redeveloping old and dilapidated buildings, mainly in the island city. In what property market sources called a major bonanza, builders will now be entitled to receive 75% to 100% more incentive area to sell in the open market compared to the existing 50% to 70%. Tenants living in such buildings will get a meagre 8% extra space in the new, redeveloped tower instead of the 5% at present. An industry source, who claimed the new rules will make many stuck projects viable and lead to their completion, said: “This has essentially been done at the behest of a few builders.” The new rules also allow clubbing of schemes 10km apart, which sources said would “lead to high-value areas getting developed and low-value areas being neglected”. “While builders get a bonanza in the form of virtually doubling their profits, tenants are only entitled to 5% to 8% extra area, subject to the specified upper limit. Those having flats larger than 750, which is the upper limit, will not be entitled to more area free,” a source said. South Mumbai property redeveloper Harresh Mehta justified the new incentives, stating that in south Mumbai redevelopment projects had become unviable for builders due to the high premiums levied by the BMC. “In the city, incentive to builders was only 50%. As a result, such schemes were not viable. With the change in the incentive structure, they will be more viable now,” he said. Architect Vilas Nagalkar said: “Earlier, due to exorbitant statutory charges, most such schemes were not economically feasible. These modified regulations will accelerate those stalled works.” Housing activist Chandrashekhar Prabhu said the amendment to the development control rules will give “unjust windfall of double increase in FSI to builders while allowing just 3% extra area for tenants”. “Those with larger flats have everything to lose and some unscrupulous redevelopers could use the extra money to dishouse the tenants,” he said. Prabhu, who has been championing the cause of tenants for three decades, said the redevelopment scheme for cessed properties has failed “not because of inadequate FSI and incentives but because tenants do not trust builders. “Most tenants have been evicted during or after redevelopment by builders,” he said. Under the new notification, the incentive for builders has been increased to 75%, 78% and 80% on a single plot, 85% ,88% and 99% on two to six plots, and 90% to 100% on over six plots taken up for redevelopment. Industry experts said the virtual doubling of floor space index (FSI), the ratio which defines how much can be built on a plot, will greatly enhance the profits of the redeveloper. “Infrastructure like roads, gardens, playgrounds, schools, colleges have remained the same, but the density will increase substantially,” they warned. Two years ago, data compiled by the state housing authority Mhada showed 2,152 redevelopment projects involving cessed properties in the island city were issued no-objection certificates (NOCs) over the years but only 778 of them were completed. Mhada cancelled the NOCs in 46 cases, comprising 111 buildings and 2,064 tenants. Another 51,321 families living in cessed properties are stuck as their redevelopment projects have failed to take off. Popularly known as 33 (7), the scheme has been plagued by allegations of building violations and bogus and inflated tenants’ lists shown by builders so that they get more FSI to build.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-doubles-bldr-bonanza-in-redevelopment-schemes/articleshow/84331107.cms||Nauzer Bharucha

Reports in media and videos were surfacing over rampant illegal sand mining along with extortion by police personnel from sand-laden trucks or tractors. Bihta SHO Awadesh Kumar Jha has been sent to East range in Bhagalpur, Paliganj SHO Sunil Kumar to Kosi range in Saharsa and Rani Talab SHO Satish Kumar to Bettiah in Champaran range. The three are inspector-rank officers. Saran’s Mufassil police station SHO Dayanand Singh has been transferred to Bhagalpur and Aurangabad’s Daudnagar SHO Arvind Kumar Gautam to Begusarai. Raj Kumar, a sub-inspector posted as Barun police station SHO in Aurangabad has been sent to Darbhanga range. In Saran, four more sub-inspectors have been thrown out of the range. One of them was posted as SHO and two had already been attached to the police lines by SP Santosh Kumar while one was suspended. Sources said those transferred are the SHO of Dariyapur in Saran, Ashok Kumar, and Ram Pukar Ram, Dinesh Kumar and Sanjay Prasad. “Ram and Dinesh were attached to the police lines. Ram was earlier posted as a regular officer at Sonepur police station. Dinesh was removed Dighwara SHO’s post while Sanjay was posted as Doriganj SHO before his suspension,” a source said. A senior IPS officer said Sone river and sand-laden vehicles pass through the areas falling under the above police stations. “The transfers are probably in an attempt to send a message to field officers that they are being watched,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/10-shos-shifted-for-not-curbing-sand-mining/articleshow/84324617.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||India||Directive to shift MP debt tribunal to UP challenged||NEW DELHI: Can the Centre combine jurisdiction of two or more states and hand it over to a single tribunal? The Delhi high court has agreed to examine the legal position and sought a response from the Centre. The HC acted on a plea by a Madhya Pradesh lawyers' body challenging the transfer of the presiding officer of the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT), Jabalpur to DRT Lucknow. A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh asked the Centre to respond next month on the plea filed by the Bar Council of Madhya Pradesh, which also seeks the appointment of a regular full-time incumbent presiding officer for DRT Jabalpur. The council stated in the petition that shifting the DRT to a place 600km away “ruptures and disturbs the convenience, affording capacity, reach of the litigants”. The plea challenged the notification on the ground it is contrary to law as the parent act prohibits the Centre from vesting powers of the DRT of one state with the DRT situated in another state. Appearing for the MP bar council, advocate Siddharth Gupta submitted that for the last one year, the DRT of MP is headless and now the charge has been vested with a DRT outside the state. He also emphasized that due to lack of a regular presiding officer, pendency has gone up but the government appeared to be unmindful of it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/directive-to-shift-mp-debt-tribunal-to-up-challenged/articleshow/84332826.cms||---

In most of the places, the pulling of chariots has been suspended for the second year in a row. The Kolkata Ratha Yatra of Iskcon is in its 50th year and the preparations made for the celebrations have been cancelled. The three mammoth chariots that used to travel around the city to reach the Maidan — where they stayed for seven days — were repaired and readied but finally, they have been grounded due to the current situation. File photo of the chariot at Mahesh This year, a 40-feet long and eight-feet wide trailer has been readied to carry the idols from the Albert Road temple to the Gurusaday Road Temple, which is Mashir Bari this year. The trailer will have three pilot cars of the Kolkata Police in the front and 11 other cars with sevaks carrying clothes, jewellery, bhog etc. behind. “We will cover the trailer so that none gathers to watch and we will not announce the route to avoid crowding. CM Mamata Banerjee will send bhog that will be offered and then the yatra will start,” said Radharaman Das, vice president of Iskcon Kolkata. The 625-year-old Mahesh and the several centuries old Guptipara Ratha of Hooghly will not move this time too. At both Mahesh and Guptipara, temporary Mashir Bari has been created inside the temple as the idols will not leave the premises. Only the Narayan ‘shila’ will be carried by priests to the original Mashir Bari at Mahesh. The 250-year-old wooden chariot of Midnapur has been repaired and painted but it will not carry the idols this time. The pujas will be live streamed on Midnapur Municipality’s social media pages. The 246-year-old chariot at Mahisadal Palace, which has 13 towers, will not move either and a covered palanquin will carry the idols. The 400-year-old chariot of the Chowdhury family at Amadpur near Memari in East Burdwan while at Searsole in Raniganj, there will be no pulling of Rajbari Rath this year. “Following a meeting with cops, we decided to carry the idols physically for a seven-round ‘parikrama’ and then put them on the chariot,” said Nirmal Chatterjee, a member of the family.

Amid the Delta Plus (AY.1 variant) warnings, Nagpur Municipal Corporation had started tracing and placing suspected cases in institutional quarantine since last month. So far, it has quarantined 18 persons and their family members. Asked about the significance of Delta variant still infecting groups in the district, Dr Shailesh Mundhada, a pathology and immunology expert, said it is the way a virus evolves. “We may say it is prevalent in a pocket like a family, a building or an area. It is because of local virulence of the strain.” Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik said the original strain has now been replaced. “It is assumed the infection in second wave was due to Delta variant. It is still prevalent. These are local spurts which can get converted into third wave too, due to Delta strain itself” The local administration was also keeping a close watch on patients with fever and other symptoms akin to the Zika virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-delta-pocket-outbreaks-in-nagpur-as-11-test-positive/articleshow/84329357.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Mumbai||11/7: Wheelchair-bound CA from Mumbai goes places 15 years on||MUMBAI: As he peeks into his new office on the eve of its inauguration, Chirag Chauhan (36) cannot stop beaming. His dream of expanding his business has come true on a day that had a profound impact on his life. Chauhan, a Kandivli resident, remembers July 11, 2006 differently— not as a day that left him wheelchair-bound, but as one that pushed him to work harder and prove to the world that no challenge is big enough if you have faith in yourself. Chauhan, then 21, was returning home from his workplace while he was pursuing his chartered accountancy course, when a series of explosions ripped through local trains on WR. He remembers opening his eyes in a derailed coach, amid hordes of injured commuters at Santacruz and not being able to feel any sensation below the waist. The next three months were spent at various hospitals as he tried to come to terms with his new reality. Chauhan had suffered a spinal cord injury that left both his legs and lower body paralysed. “I often wondered, during those initial months, why I had to suffer so much,” he said. The physiotherapy was gruelling as Chauhan learnt to sit up straight and manage his body. His meals and exercise regime had to be done by the clock. “My mother was a constant pillar of support throughout. I also found solace in spiritual texts,” he said. Between 2006 and 2009, Chauhan’s daily routine comprised eight hours of physiotherapy and six hours of study. “My father, who passed away a couple of years before the train blasts, had taught us to always look for a silver lining even in the darkest of times. I would always remind myself that there were people whose struggles were greater than mine and I was a lot more fortunate than them. That helped me surge ahead,” he said. After clearing his CA, Chauhan landed a job with an MNC. But the challenge was far from over. The MNC’s office was in Chembur and Chauhan had to commute 25km one way to reach his workplace from his home. After one year with the MNC, Chauhan moved to a bank. In 2012, he opened a small office with a few employees. “I had zero clients as I had moved from a corporate job,” Chauhan said. But he worked very hard and started adding to his clients. Not wanting to set any limitation, Chauhan got a customised vehicle and travelled all over the country. During lockdown, he founded a platform which offers virtual taxation services. “The portal gets 10,000 hits daily and also has an app,” he says. On Monday, Chauhan will begin a new journey in a much larger office space, against all odds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/11/7-wheelchair-bound-ca-from-mumbai-goes-places-15-yrs-on/articleshow/84331131.cms||Nitasha Natu

Offices have been asked to nominate nodal officers to ensure compliance of norms to avoid punitive action and fines. A minimum of Rs 500 along with administration charges going up to Rs 50,000 can be be slapped on the defaulters by the civic body. “An advisory has been issued to all offices of central government, state government, CPWD, PWD, DDA, Delhi Police, Delhi Jal Board and DMRC to appoint nodal officers besides taking all precautions,” said a SDMC official. Registrars of all universities and deemed universities have been asked to nominate nodal officers too. SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti said, “This year, there is a need to concentrate more on educational institutes, colleges and schools which were closed due to corona crises and have higher chances of mosquito breeding. “The nodal officers have been asked to ensure there is no artificial water collection in open grounds, roofs of buildings, flower pots, etc. Also, overhead tanks should be emptied, covered and locked. Similarly, unused vehicles should be covered and parked in covered spaces to prevent water collection inside,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-readies-to-fight-threat-of-mosquitoes/articleshow/84329438.cms||---

The trio’s actions ended up alerting the bank’s Hyderabad office and eventually the cops. One of the three burglars has been held, while other two fled. The incident was reported on July 2 at a State Bank of India (SBI) ATM near Santosh Nagar. Three men barged in around 2.45 am. They tried to break open the machine and had managed to dent the portion beneath the screen. The machine contained about Rs 14 lakh in cash, police said. The burglars wanted to get to the safe. But they unknowingly triggered an alarm at the bank’s Hyderabad office. The Hyderabad staffers immediately alerted the SBI Mumbai office. The Dindoshi police was informed. “We caught one of them, identified as Hitesh Gupta we also have their images on CCTVs,” said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-trio-attempts-atm-burglary-in-malad-alarm-goes-off-in-hyd/articleshow/84331175.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Third organ donation in nine days; new lease of life to three||KOLKATA: A 57-year-old woman, who was declared brain dead at a city hospital, has given a new life to three men in her death. The city saw the third deceased organ donation in a record nine days on Sunday when the woman’s family agreed to donate her organs. The donor’s liver and two kidneys will be retrieved and transplanted into three men. The procedures are expected to go on till the wee hours of Monday. This is the seventh donation in this year so far. Netaji Nagar resident Shyamali Das, who had suffered an intracranial brain haemorrhage at home, was admitted at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) three days ago. When the doctors treating her found that she was brain stem dead, the hospital authorities counselled her family for donating her organs. Once the family agreed, the woman was declared brain dead on Saturday night. The hospital then informed ROTTO that is responsible for allocating the organs. The woman’s heart, however, was not found fit for transplantation. Doctors assessed her liver, kidneys and lung that were found to be healthy enough for donation. While RTIICS was allowed to retain one kidney and the liver, another kidney was allocated to Command Hospital. Since there is no lung transplant facility in Kolkata, ROTTO shared the organ with NOTTO. Even as a hospital in Chennai was ready to fly in to take the lung, the retrieval was aborted due to flight timings. “Delaying the retrieval process would have made it difficult to maintain the other organs. The maximum threshold was 8pm but it was not possible for the Chennai team to reach Kolkata within that period. Waiting longer could have affected the liver and kidneys,” said a source. The liver and kidney recipients at RTIICS is a 47-year-old male and 33-year-old male. The kidney recipient at Command Hospital is a 32-year-old man. The woman’s cornea was donated to Shankar Nethralaya while her skin has been banked at SSKM Hospital. This is the third donation in July and incidentally, all the deceased donors are women. On July 9, a Hooghly resident’s two kidneys were transplanted into two patients after she was declared brain dead at Ruby General Hospital. On July 2, another Hooghly resident was declared brain dead at SSKM Hospital. Her two kidneys and liver were transplanted. “Despite the pandemic, the families of the deceased are agreeing to donate organs and doctors are ready to take up transplant surgeries. And the fact that three donations happened in such a short span of time is absolutely a shot in the arm for organ donation movement. There is a good coordination between private and public hospitals too,” said ROTTO joint director nephrologist Arpita Raychaudhury.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/third-organ-donation-in-9-days-new-lease-of-life-to-3/articleshow/84326898.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Pune||Panshet dam wall burst changed the city’s landscape||Pune: When the Panshet dam wall burst, reaching Parvati was like a walk in the jungle and houses located in the path were made of mud. After the wall burst causing flooding in the peth areas, Kothrud, Maharshinagar and surrounding regions became a preferred residential zone and stronger cement buildings came up. This and many other interesting anecdotes from 1961 have been studied and will be published by city-based researcher and writer Ashlesha Mahajan. It will be 60 years to the fateful day on Monday. Mahajan’s book, titled 12 July, 1961, will be released on Monday. The book is based on the Panshet dam disaster. The author has interviewed nearly 100 residents of Pune, who experienced the floods. She has also studied 10-12 books and a research paper by Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics to put together the book. “Going towards Parvati was a long walk at the time and there were lots of trees and medicinal plants en route. The only mode of transport then was the bicycle. After the floods struck, people even climbed to the top of Parvati hill to save themselves from the increasing water level. People narrated their stories about how they lost important documents, including the proof of their ownership of houses and lands,” said Mahajan. She shared that a person with first-hand experience of the incident also stated that during the floods there were very few multi-storied buildings. The only five-floor structure was on Bajirao Road. Most of the settlements were in chawls and wadas so the water came gushing into the houses in Peth areas and took away several lives. Mahajan said, “At the time, there was a lot of difference in the way people lived as a family. Families did not have separate rooms for children and elderly. Everyone lived in single rooms. Also, this was the time when the suburbs were established and Kothrud, Sahakarnagar, Maharshinagar and adjoining areas flourished as a fallout of the floods.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/panshet-dam-wall-burst-changed-the-citys-landscape/articleshow/84329363.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

---||Kolkata||East Midnapore artists use masks as canvas for Patachitra painting in Covid times||KOLKATA: The pandemic has not only affected their lifestyle but also changed the canvas for art and craft. Around 75 families at Hobichak and Nankarchak villages in East Midnapore are using masks, instead of cloth, flower vase, Durga pot to paint Patachitra, the subjects of which revolve around folklore, mythological and religious stories and social messages. For generations, the Patachitra artists, known as ‘Patuas’, have been painting vivid imageries on long scrolls to narrate a tale with a catchy song called ‘Pater Gan’ The pandemic has robbed them of their primary source of income as all fairs and exhibitions have been cancelled due to the pandemic-induced curbs. “Most of the artists started to paint on masks as it helped us remain relevant in times of adversity and generate income. It also provided us with an opportunity to uphold our creativity,” said Sayera Chitrakar, an artist. Echoing her, another artist, Jharna Chitrakar, said that they decided to paint different themes like nature, tribal life, episodes of folklore, mythological stories and images creating awareness on Covid on masks, which have become indispensable during the pandemic. They sold these masks for Rs 60 each. Abed Chitrakar, secretary of Hobichak Nankarchak Lok Shikha Shilpa Patua Samiti, said that the masks made by the artists were popularised through social media. “The pictures of the mask were put up on Facebook and within a short period it got a good response. During the lockdown in 2020 there was a huge demand for these masks. People from different parts of the country ordered these masks. Now, the demand has slightly reduced but we have made a turnover of nearly Rs 12 lakh.” Bikram Mitra of Earth Craft, a social enterprise, has come forwarded to help these painters as he is planning to develop a sustainable tourism in this area to save the art form.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/midnapore-artists-use-masks-as-canvas-for-patachitra-painting-in-covid-times/articleshow/84326958.cms||Dipawali Mitra

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand government misled high court on kanwar yatra, says petitioner in Supreme Court||NAINITAL: One of the petitioners who had filed the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Uttarakhand high court (HC) on the Covid situation in the state has now approached the Supreme Court (SC) alleging that the state misled the HC on kanwar yatra. The petitioner, Anu Pant, has filed the application in the special leave petition (SLP) moved by the Uttarakhand government, challenging the HC’s order that stayed the phased opening of the Char Dham shrines. Speaking to TOI, Abhijay Negi, counsel appearing for Pant, said that the state government had informed the HC that it has decided to cancel the kanwar yatra this season but media reports indicate that the government is reviewing its decision. “The HC was informed about the cabinet’s decision of June 25 wherein it was decided to cancel the kanwar yatra in light of the Covid pandemic. However, now the government is holding meetings with other state governments and media reports suggest that they will start the kanwar yatra. This is against what they told the HC and we will inform the apex court how the HC has been misled by the government,” Negi said. The application, a copy of which is with TOI, further said that opening of Char Dhams along with the kanwar yatra would make it difficult for the administration to implement the SOPs which were anyway flouted during the Kumbh. “It is submitted that permitting the kanwar yatra as well as simultaneously permitting the Char Dham yatra, shall increase the propensity of large gatherings/crowds where enforcing and maintaining Covid-19 protocols/safeguards shall be onerous,” read the application. It further pointed out that as restrictions have been relaxed by the state government, massive crowds are being seen at the popular hill stations of Nainital and Mussoorie. The application said that the HC has been dealing with the petitions for over a year and has passed several directions and orders on the issue and therefore the SLP should be dismissed. According to the SC registry, the case is likely to be heard on Friday. Meanwhile other petitioners have also said that they will raise the issue of kanwar yatra before the HC as well. Shiv Bhatt, counsel appearing for one of the petitioners in the bunch of PILs that the HC is dealing with, told TOI that he is waiting for the government order to come out. “If the government allows the kanwar yatra, it will further endanger the lives of people of Uttarakhand and would be like repeating the mistakes of Kumbh. We will surely take the issue before the HC,” Bhatt said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-govt-misled-hc-on-kanwar-yatra-says-petitioner-in-sc/articleshow/84324779.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: A Malad slum school battles Covid for survival||MUMBAI: Rose Mary English High School at the sprawling Malvani slum in Malad (West) was an oasis of hope till the pandemic struck in March 2020. Situated amidst rows of dull, tiny tenements, the school stood out because of its bright red paint. As laughter and lectures filled the day, the impoverishment of its students did not seem like an insurmountable hurdle. But today, the school is gasping for breath. The downturn in the economy induced by Covid and the hardship it has caused has reached the school’s doorstep. Its savings have dried up and most parents can no longer submit fees, leaving the 20-year-old school on the verge of closure. “Since the first lockdown was announced in March 2020, we have run the school even as only 20% of parents have paid fees. Unless we get urgent help from the government, we will not be able to sustain the school,” said Mohammed Anees Siddiqui, managing trustee, Siddiqui Education and Welfare Trust (SEWT), which runs the school. When he began the school in 2000, said Siddiqui, the purpose was to bring a quality English medium school to the neighbourhood, which is mainly inhabited by daily wagers, security guards, rickshaw drivers, and poverty-stricken widows, divorcees and single mothers. “Most of our 800-odd students are first-generation learners and we have made a difference in the last two decades. But now the closure seems imminent as we are out of cash,” regretted Siddiqui. Since it comes under the “permanently self-financed” category, the SSC Board-affiliated school doesn’t get any aid from the government. Neither can it claim any amount in aid, depending entirely on fees from students. Zahida Iqbal Shaikh’s grandson was in senior KG last year when he stopped going to school. “I am a widow while my daughter is a divorcee and works as a maid in the colony nearby. She is our sole breadwinner and whatever she earns goes into paying rent, electricity bill and rations. There is no money left to pay for school. We had to withdraw our child,” said Shaikh. Ashok Baburao Suryavanshi has been jobless since he lost his security guard’s position seven months ago. His son, Suvarna, 6, attends classes online intermittently as there is only one smartphone in the family. But for eight months, Suryavanshi has not paid his fees. “I don’t have money. My wife Sunita alone runs the house as she works as a maid. I am jobless,” said Suryavanshi with a furrowed brow. The school has somehow run online classes despite the constraints, with limited effect. “Many parents say they have just one smartphone in the family. The gadget is thus inadequate to meet the needs of two or three children whose classes are held simultaneously,” said the school’s principal, Nigar Kausar. Siddiqui said almost all private schools in slums are in crisis. The government wants schools to teach online and not to act tough with parents if they don’t pay fees on time. “There is a case for the government to step in and bail out these private slum schools, which are facing closure if immediate help is not given,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-a-malad-slum-school-battles-covid-for-survival/articleshow/84331586.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

While a 29-year-old man from Delhi was shot dead in Sahibabad a little after midnight on Sunday, the body of a 27-year-old youth was found a kilometre away from his home in Muradnagar on Sunday morning.In the first case, Delhi resident Amit, who had been to jail in 2018 in a case of gambling, was on his way home when two men on a white scooter intercepted him around 12.30am on Sunday. Gyanendra Singh, SP (city 2), said police received a call about the murder from a passerby. “He was riding a bike and singing a song when two masked men on a scooter signalled him to stop. No sooner did he slam the brakes, the two men opened fire at him. He received two bullets in the chest,” he added.A police team took a bleeding Amit to a nearby hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. On the basis of a complaint by Amit’s family members, an FIR has been registered against unknown persons under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC.In the second case, a 27-year-old youth who had left home with three men on Saturday evening was found dead on a plot 1km from his house in Muradnagar. When Sameer did not return home by Saturday night, his family started a frantic search but could not find him. Around 7am on Sunday, police received a call about a body on a plot in Muradnagar area.“A police team matched the details with those of Sameer’s. His family members later identified the body. We have found some injury marks on his head. It seems Sameer had been hit with an iron rod,” said Iraj Raza, SP (rural).In 2019, Sameer was arrested in connection with a murder and was out on bail. An FIR against a neighbour, who, too, was an accused in the 2019 murder, and two others was registered on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/2-with-cases-against-them-found-murdered-in-gzb/articleshow/84329407.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey
---||Pune||Soon, no need to visit RTO for licence renewal||PUNE: Soon, those intending to renew their driving licence or in need of a duplicate driving licence, will be able to do so without stepping into the regional transport office (RTO). The state transport department is working on an online system to facilitate uploading of documents on the Parivahan portal and eliminating the need to visit offices to submit hard copies. “The plan is being worked out. Of what we know, the entire system will be integrated with the Aadhar number to make the verification process simpler. The plan should be implemented in a couple of months, or even earlier,” said an official from the Pune RTO. Presently, an applicant must access the ‘Sarathi’ tab on the Parivahan portal and upload various documents before paying the fee. Then people must visit the concerned RTO office to submit the hard copies of the documents. “The same procedure is followed in case one wants a duplicate licence. With the new process, they will only apply for the same online and, upon the satisfaction of the RTO office, the new licence will be sent by post. The medical certificate, to be produced in case of licence renewal, will also be submitted online. We are a bit concerned about this aspect as a physical verification on whether the person is fit is essential. However, we are sure that the transport department must have considered some way to deal with this,” another official pointed out. Last month, the transport department introduced two systems — the facility to appear for learners’ licence test from home and fully online vehicle registration process for dealers. However, with cases of learners’ licence applicants seeking the help of middlemen, who were appearing for tests on the behalf of examinees, the department officials have said that they were developing an artificial intelligence-based system to stop the use of unfair means. “The process is under development and it will be launched soon. It will help eradicate the use of any unfair means while giving learner’s licence tests from home. It should be launched later this month. We will ensure that all loopholes regarding online licensing is resolved and the system is transparent,” said a transport department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/soon-no-need-to-visit-rto-for-licence-renewal/articleshow/84329441.cms||Joy Sengupta

The meeting ended with the appointment of five election officers.“Today, during the annual general body meeting (AGM) of FONRWA, there was tremendous opposition from 30 attending members (RWA presidents and general secretaries) who had demanded that the petition for election during the AGM should include the sub agenda, as prescribed in the bylaws, of restricting those candidates from contesting elections to the FONRWA executive committee who have served as president or secretary-general for two consecutive terms and that a cooling period for one term be implemented on such office-bearers. But, it did not suit the current governing body as they deliberately concluded the meeting without any decisions,” said Sanjeev Kumar RWA, general secretary, Sector 51.KK Jain, secretary-general (FONRWA) told TOI that Sunday’s meeting was to seek agreement for the upcoming election-related agenda whereas the demand to restrict RWAs and secretary generals of two consecutive terms from contesting election is a policy matter and can be taken up by the new elected executive committee of FONRWA post elections on August 1.Jain also said that a letter seeking permission to hold the meeting was already sent earlier to the district administration along with the announcement of the date of the AGM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/ahead-of-polls-no-consensus-on-policy-decision-at-fonrwa-meet/articleshow/84329415.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

The police have recovered 121gm of gold ornaments and a scooter from his possession. “The suspect — Saurabh Yadav of Nigdi — had recently got married. The money he earned as a food delivery person wasn’t enough to make merry with his wife. Thus, he started snatching gold chains,” inspector Abhijit Jadhav of the Wakad police said. Since February this year, he had snatched seven gold chains. A Wakad police team led by senior inspector Vivek Mugalikar along with assistant inspectors Abhijit Jadhav and Santosh Patil took Yadav into custody. Jadhav said, “Our team was patrolling in the Wakad area when police constables Nitin Gengje and Vijay Gambhire noticed a man on a scooter roaming suspiciously. So we took him into custody.” During the questioning, the suspect admitted to snatching gold chains from seven spots in Wakad, Chinchwad and Nigdi areas. “Yadav revealed that he watched several videos of chain snatching on a video sharing website and then started snatching gold chains,” Jadhav added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/food-delivery-person-held-on-charge-of-chain-snatching/articleshow/84329536.cms||---

Suvadip Banerjee would move about in a car with a blue beacon and would brag about being an assistant director of the CBI. He would promise to give jobs in different government departments to people. The complaint was lodged by Banerjee’s former wife who divorced him in March after she had discovered his fake identity. The marriage had lasted only for five months, according to the complainant. Cops said that Banerjee was in Delhi and an investigation would start on the basis of the complaint by his former wife. She alleged that the accused would conduct interviews as part of a gang in Bihar that would dupe people into paying money for jobs. A part of the money would regularly come to Banerjee. Banerjee’s mother told the police that she too wanted her son to be punished because he was on the wrong track and had sold her ornaments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/btech-youth-held-for-posing-as-cbi-officer/articleshow/84327020.cms||---

She received obnoxious calls, messages and video call requests from several unknown numbers in the last two months. Arkadeep Kundu (21), son of Uttarpara-Kotrang Municipality’s Ward 10 coordinator, was picked up from a hideout in Barasat where he had been staying after his name got associated with the case and various political parties had started rallying campaigns around the same. He was charged with sections under IT act and IPC sections dealing with forgery, defamation and criminal intimidation. He was produced before a Salt Lake court on Sunday and remanded in two days’ police custody. On June 12, the 20-year-old woman in Salt Lake — daughter of a senior police officer in Bengal — had lodged a complaint with Bidhannagar cyber crime PS. Cops had started a probe and found Kundu’s involvement and sent notice to him. “My son may have made a mistake. Cops had come to us and we cooperated with them.

No vaccination drive was conducted in Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad on Sunday but officials said all government centres will operate on Monday. Vaccination drives for pregnant women have started in Gautam Budh Nagar and over 50,000 such women are likely to get the jabs in the next few days, officials said.“We have enough doses for now and we are getting a fresh batch daily. There is no shortage as such but people will have to remain patient and wait for their turns. We can assure residents that the vaccine supply will improve in a few days,” said Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district immunisation officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.Ghaziabad’s nodal officer for vaccination Dr GP Mathuria said: “We have got 11,500 doses and for Monday, we have set a target of 15,800 jabs.”The district had planned to kick start a mega vaccination drive from July 1 with a daily target of administering 40,000 doses. According to the plan, about 3.6 lakh people would have been vaccinated. But since July 1, about 1.2 lakh people have been inoculated. In Ghaziabad, 23 lakh people have to be vaccinated and so far, 12 lakh people have received the first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/gzb-gets-11-5k-doses-noida-8k-govt-vax-sites-to-stay-open-today/articleshow/84329442.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Weekend rush continues at Mussoorie and Nainital, tourists without valid documents sent back||NAINITAL/MUSSOORIE: Weekend rush of tourists continued at prominent hill towns of Uttarakhand on Sunday. Despite the recently-imposed restrictions to enter Nainital and Mussoorie — a mandatory RT-PCR negative report, registration on the Smart City portal and hotel reservation — heavy traffic jams were reported from both Nainital and Mussoorie. A total of 33,000 people visited Nainital from Friday to Sunday, according to data available with the police department. Also, around 2,500 people found without the necessary documents were sent back from checkposts. “Checkpoints have been set up at all entry points to the town and almost every vehicle was screened to make sure no one entered without the proper documents,” said a police official. Meanwhile, hotels remained full over the weekend in Nainital and tourist spots brimmed with people. The rush caused several traffic snarls. There was heavy police presence in front of restaurants, at Pant Park and the town bus stand, with patrolling cops frequently disbursing crowds. Similar scenes played out in Mussoorie on Sunday. A serpentine queue of vehicles stretched from Kincraig to Library Chowk. Verification of RT-PCR reports and other documents at the Kuthal Gate check post stalled traffic flow. “We were stuck for nearly 45 minutes at Kuthal Gate. The traffic movement the rest of the way to Mussoorie was also sluggish. From Dehradun to Mussoorie, it took us nearly two and a half hours whereas on normal days, it just takes about an hour,” said Ashutosh Arora, who was visiting the town from New Delhi. The move to stringently check documents was welcomed by people in Mussoorie. “Tourist movement has been curbed since Saturday and there has been a significant reduction in the number of two-wheelers here in Mussoorie. Residents are also feeling safe now that only those with negative Covid-19 reports are being allowed entry,” said Rajat Aggarwal, president of Mussoorie Traders’ Association.

---||Ghaziabad||Why this Ghaziabad village overcame its reluctance to get shots||GHAZIABAD: People from some of the rural pockets in the district where the health department and the administration found it difficult to carry out vaccination drives because of low footfall, are now coming forward to take the jabs. Before the second wave hit, inoculation camps had to be discontinued in villages like Tyori and Kalcheena in Bhojpur block, officials said, because most residents feared that the vaccines will have serious side-effects and did not take the jabs. But like many rural areas, these villages also saw several deaths and for most residents, this fear has made them think about getting the vaccines. “There was not a single day when four-five deaths were not reported. Now, everyone wants to get vaccinated. Several myths associated with vaccines have been busted and awareness drives are being carried out by many people, including religious leaders,” said Abrar Chaudhary, a retired Army havildar from Tyori. Tyori is divided into two parts – Tyori 13 Biswa that has a population of about 8,000 and Tyori 7 Biswa that has about 4,000 residents. According to officials, 98-99% of the population is still to get a single dose of the vaccine. “Deaths, not only in our village, but also in several parts of the city and across the state have made people think about getting vaccinated. Many of our acquaintances and relatives who were initially reluctant are now saying they want the vaccine,” said Abdul Khaliq from Tyori. Although people want to take the jabs now, the vaccine stock is not enough. “Inoculation camps are not being organised in these areas. Getting a slot through Co-WIN is almost impossible for the local people. Recently, some residents travelled to Bhojpur primary health centre, about 10 km away, to get themselves vaccinated. A fortnight ago, when I informed the local primary health centre in-charge about people’s eagerness to get the vaccines, I was told that camps would be held here after July 1. But, nothing has happened so far,” Abrar’s nephew Afroz said. Afroz, who is the block coordinator for the central government’s Swachh Bharat Mission, and his family members are among few people in the village who have taken both doses of the vaccine. Riyasat Ali, the block programme officer at Bhojpur primary health centre, said most people also try to stay away from Covid tests fearing the result would be positive. Many in Tyori had Covid-like symptoms, but no one was willing to get tested, he added. “I think lack of information is one of the main reasons. People are easily influenced by WhatsApp messages and social media posts most of which are not based on facts. Fear that vaccines cause infertility is another major reason behind reluctance among people to get the shots,” he said. Unicef and the local health department have been conducting awareness programmes across Ghaziabad in an attempt to allay such fears. “It is not that vaccine hesitancy can be seen among members of a particular community. There are many villages and urban pockets where this problem can be seen. We are taking help from local public representatives and religious leaders to spread awareness,” said Mohammad Shadab, Unicef district coordinator, Ghaziabad. “Some people think that they can get other diseases after taking jabs, others believe different vaccines are being administered in the city and in the countryside,” Shadab added. Ghaziabad chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said a micro plan has been prepared for each area in the district and all places would be covered under it soon. “The vaccination drive will be held in Tyori and other villages very soon. In the past few months, we have worked intensively towards making people aware about the vaccination process and reducing hesitancy,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/why-this-village-overcame-its-reluctance-to-get-shots/articleshow/84329436.cms||Aditya Dev
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Sanjay Raut sees Hitler in Modi govt, murder in Stan Swamy death||MUMBAI: A week after the death of tribal rights activist and Jesuit priest Stan Swamy, Shiv Sena politician Sanjay Raut on Sunday alleged that the octogenarian was killed in jail. Raut said the Centre was afraid of Swamy. He said Swamy’s death in custody could not be justified. He compared the Modi government with Hitler and Mussolini. Raut, chief spokesperson of the Shiv Sena and executive editor of the party mouthpiece Saamna, targeted the Modi government in his weekly column ‘RokhThok’ but did not clarify in the column who killed Swamy. “The Elgar Parishad was definitely a poisonous event. No one can support venomous speeches and slogans. But whatever happened after that should be called a conspiracy of curbing freedom of expression,” Raut said. He asked whether making tribal communities aware of their rights and freedom is an attempt and conspiracy to topple the government. The 84-year-old Swamy died in a hospital in the city last week. According to the NIA, Swamy was actively involved with the CPI (Maoist). The NIA said propaganda material of the CPI (Maoist) and documents related to communications for furthering the group’s programmes were seized from his possession. Swamy had said that the material had been planted on his computer and he was being falsely accused. Raut said the Shiv Sena had differences with various streams of communism. “Maoism, Naxalism are terrible, but they have their political parties, organisations in power and in systems everywhere in the world. Although we accept that these people are worse than the Kashmiri separatists, the murder or death of Swamy in prison cannot be justified,” Raut said. The Elgar case was filed by Pune police in 2018 and handed over by the Centre to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in January 2020 during the MVA government’s tenure. CM Uddhav Thackeray had criticised the decision while the then ACS (home) had said the state has no objection to the probe being transferred to NIA. The Elgar Parishad was organised on December 31, 2017 at Shaniwarwada in Pune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-raut-sees-hitler-in-modi-govt-murder-in-stan-swamy-death/articleshow/84331993.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

The state held a meeting on Friday where they instructed districts to complete training of all centres concerned, including private, by Wednesday. The state is estimated to have 20 lakh pregnant women eligible to get the shots, including 1.5lakh in Mumbai. A civic official said the drive is likely to be rolled out from 31 centres. “It is a tentative plan, but we want to start with medical colleges, maternity homes which are already working as vaccination centres, peripheral hospitals that offer maternity services and state-run vaccination centres,” the official said.  “Pregnant women may have many questions” a senior ward official said. Vaccination of other categories will be as per plan, said Kakani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-covid-vax-drive-for-pregnant-women-could-start-on-thurs/articleshow/84329468.cms||---

Police suspect property dispute was the reason behind the murder.The deceased has been identified as Sandeep Nagar, a resident of Chachora village in Dankaur area. Arvind Pathak, SHO, Dankaur, said Nagar had recently bought a 200m plot in Kherli Hafizpur village and on Sunday, he had gone there to oversee construction work of a boundary wall. “Around 10 am, three armed men, one on a motorcycle and two in a car, reached the area. They started firing shots at him and one bullet hit Nagar in the neck. Local people and labourers who were working at the site informed the police. A team reached the spot and took Nagar to a nearby hospital but doctors declared him dead,” he said. Later, Nagar’s father Uday Singh lodged a complaint at Dankaur police station against local resident Vinod Khari, his brother Bobby and one Amit Mavi. Police said Nagar’s land was a disputed property and Khari had claimed ownership. “An FIR has been lodged against three people under IPC Section 302 (murder). We are scanning CCTV footage from nearby areas,” SHO Pathak said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/25-year-old-shot-dead-in-dankaur-over-land-dispute/articleshow/84329463.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey

The student's father is a sanitation worker for a gram panchayat. The father said that he was shocked to see an "objectionable" word written in the caste column, instead of ‘Valmiki’. Rampur DM Ravindra Kumar has now ordered an inquiry. The boy’s father said, “It is surprising that the teacher did not know that my work profile is sanitation worker and our community is ‘Valmiki’. When we raised objections and asked the teacher to make changes, she told us whatever she wrote was correct. Her comments were insulting. She must publicly apologise.” The DM said, “The comments in the transfer certificate were not appropriate and it would be corrected soon. The teacher will need to give a clarification. The boy took admission in the school in 2015 and we need to find out who filled the form at that time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/sanitation-workers-protest-after-school-principal-uses-objectionable-word-in-tc/articleshow/84324849.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Lucknow||Overcoming tragedies, UP’s go-getters set eyes on Tokyo Paralympics triumph||Lucknow: A freak accident on a cold December night in 2017 changed the course of his life in a few minutes. Ajeet Singh Yadav was on his way to Satna (Madhya Pradesh) to attend a friend’s wedding when he fell off a moving train while trying to save a friend, Anshuman Shukla, from getting crushed under the wheels. Though Anshuman escaped unhurt, Ajeet lost his left arm and sustained grievous injuries. Ajeet, a farmer’s son from Etawah, wanted to become a sports teacher but his dreams had hit a dead end. “Dr Virendra Kumar Dabas, who works for the rehabilitation of people with disabilities and is also the chairman of Paralympic Committee of India brought a ray of hope in my life. He asked me to forget what I had lost and remember what I was left with,” Ajeet recalled. Dr Dabas mentored Ajeet and motivated him so much that he developed javelin throw as his passion and went on to win medals for India in various international events. Now, he has set his eyes on the gold medal in the Tokyo Paralympics next month. He gave his best performance of 63.96m in the selection trials for Tokyo Paralympics and stood second in the world. “When I got selected for the Tokyo Paralympics, I felt as if I got back whatever I had lost in life. There is a bright morning after every night,” Ajeet said. Ajeet bagged a gold in his first world championship, World Para Athletics Grand Prix at Beijing, China, in 2019. His other medals include a bronze in World Para Athletic Championship in Dubai (2019) and a gold in FAZZA Grand Prix in Dubai this year. Like Ajeet, there are several sportspersons from UP who battled odds and are now preparing for Tokyo Paralympics. Akash, a parashooter from Khedki village in Baghpat, was hit by polio during childhood. It is tough for him to stand at a place for long but this failed to deter him from his goal. Son of a farmer, Akash used to travel to Baghpat, 12km from his village, daily by bus to practice at a shooting range. He won his first international gold in the 2017 World Shooting Para Sports World Cup in Bangkok and has bagged several medals since then. Vivek Chikara from Mahapa village in Meerut, who also comes from a farmer’s family, did MBA in 2015 and started working with a reputed company but an accident in 2017 turned his life upside down. He lost his left leg below the knee after which he slipped into depression. One day, he came to know about an archery academy through the newspaper and his aim was clear before his eyes. “Every time I wear the Indian jersey and play for my country, I forget all the pain that I have gone through in life,” he says. Another sportsperson, Varun Singh Bhati, a national para high jumper from Greater Noida, has been selected for Tokyo Paralympics. Varun received Laxman Award at the age of 22 in 2017. “Getting a chance to show my strength in the Tokyo Paralympics is a great feeling,” said Varun, who was afflicted by poliomyelitis at a young age. Another sportsperson from Uttar Pradesh, Deepender Singh, 26, a national para 10m air pistol shooter from Sambhal, is also gunning for a medal in Paralympics. Polio could not stop him from chasing his dreams. “I was fond of weapons since childhood which later became a passion. I am practicing hard and looking forward to making my country proud,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/overcoming-tragedies-ups-go-getters-set-eyes-on-tokyo-paralympics-triumph/articleshow/84331283.cms||Fazal Khan

The incident took place near Jasmai village under Patiyali police station when Vishnod was returning from Etah where he had gone with his pregnant wife to see a doctor. The 24-year-old victim was referred to Aligarh in a critical condition. According to Kasganj police, on the basis of a complaint submitted by the victim’s husband, an FIR has been registered against man’s uncle Dalveer who was recently elected gram pradhan and two other family members. The incident took place following the panchayat election rivalry among the family members. The Kasganj superintendent of police has constituted a special team to arrest the three accused. According to the FIR, Vishnod, a resident of Nagla Kesari village had taken his pregnant wife to a private doctor in Etah. While returning home on a motorcycle, three men opened fire at the couple near Jasmai village. A bullet hit the woman in her stomach. Following the sudden attack, Vishnod lost control of the bike and fell on the roadside along with his wife. On hearing the sound of firing and screaming of the couple, villagers rushed to the spot. The assailants ran away leaving the pregnant woman in a pool of blood. Deputy superintendent of police Deep Kumar Pant said, “The woman was hit by a bullet in the stomach. She was rushed to the district hospital and later referred to the Aligarh medical college in a critical condition. The entire incident is linked to election rivalry among the family members. On the basis of the complaint received from the husband of the victim, an FIR has been registered against three of his relatives including his uncle Dalveer who was recently elected gram pradhan. The other two are Anshu and Sukhdev.” The FIR registered against three men at Patiyali police station include IPC’s sections 307 (attempt to murder), 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 507 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and 120B (criminal conspiracy to commit an offence). Additional superintendent of police Aditya Prakash Verma said, “A team has been constituted to arrest the accused. The complainant and the accused belong to the same family and are having a rivalry following the panchayat elections. On May 29, an FIR was registered on a complaint of the accused against the complainant under similar sections of IPC. Both the matters are correlated and will be investigated in detail by the crime branch.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/pregnant-woman-shot-due-to-election-rivalry-three-booked/articleshow/84324930.cms||Deepak Lavania

According to the city police’s figures, as cops trained their focus on the yatra, mask offences declined to about 70% of the July 5 numbers in the six days leading up to Saturday. Devotees will not be allowed to participate in the yatra owing to the Covid pandemic. Sources in police said that the mask cases plunged during the festivals in October and November last year and in February this year in the run-up to the civic body polls. When Covid cases dip, police generally tend to become lenient with the offenders and do not conduct aggressive drives to catch maskless people. “Last week, Covid cases ranged between 11 and 15 in the city. We have not held any major drive to book people who roam without masks,” said a city police officer. “Besides, the vaccination initiative has been intensified, so the risk of spreading infections will decrease. Thus, we decided to be a bit soft on the mask offenders.” The cops did not consider the fact that the number of Covid cases has increased just a few weeks after a period when the mask offences showed a downward trend. According to the figures of the city police, Ahmedabad reported nearly 6.70 lakh cases of mask violations from June 24, 2020, to June 2021 and Amdavadis paid Rs 54 crore for breaching the rule. Cops said that they will start cracking down on mask offences and register FIRs for not following social distancing norms after the Rath Yatra concludes. The nod to hold the 144th Rath Yatra in the city was given by the state government on July 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/masks-police-action-slip-violations-plunge-70/articleshow/84329618.cms||Ashish Chauhan

The accused, identified as Naziur Rahaman (22), Mikail Khan (30) and Rabiul Islam (22), have been staying in the southwest suburbs for the last 45 days after renting a house close to a hospital. They had claimed that they were in the city for the treatment of a relative. Rabiul Islam (22)Police said they seized many Jihadi literature were found in their hideout. “An analysis of their social media profiles also showed that they were inspired by groups like the JMB and the Islamic State. We have found a mobile phone that has several important documents in it. We are sending it for forensic examination. We have also found a diary where there are several entries made by hand. It contains names and contact numbers of top JMB leaders,” said joint CP (STF) Solomon V Nesakumar. Naziur RahamanThe cops said the accused had come to Kolkata with two objectives: raising funds and expanding the organization. “Several of its leaders were jailed in Bangladesh and the group needed fresh investment to expand their operations. However, with the outfit splitting in last September over the choice of a new chief, each module — like the one nabbed in Haridevpur — have been asked to contribute to the faction they belong to,” an officer said. Mekail KhanThe Covid situation upset their plans as they could not move around freely. Hence, they posed as a patient’s relatives,” said an officer. The police are likely to contact Rapid Action Battalion for leads on the organization’s new plans in Bengal, said sources. Cops said the three men were led by Rahaman who used several fake names like Pavel and Joseph. “Rahaman here introduced himself as Joyram Byapari. He rarely stepped out of the house. He had joined the Border Guards Bangladesh but got involved with Harakat ul-Jihadi-Islami and Harakat ul-Mujahidin . We have found that Rahaman had been jailed for close to three years in two different stints,” said an STF official. The second accused Khan alias Sk Sabbir was a tech expert, and used to manage the social media accounts. “He was the one who would be making the initial contacts and convince the new recruits or those ready to fund them. He was in touch contact with many banned organizations the world over,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/three-jmb-men-arrested-from-haridevpur-house/articleshow/84327105.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Police said the man, identified as Ekbalpore resident Abdul Moinuddin alias Danish, was found unconscious in Ramnagar area of Garden Reach under the Port division. He was rushed to SSKM Hospital where he was declared dead. “The man might have fallen from the fourth floor of the adjacent 5-storey building, probably while attempting a theft.

Mobile phones and purses were found in his possession, some of which appear to be stolen from nearby houses,” said DC (Port) Zafar Ajmal Kidwai. Police said they were also ascertaining if there were others with him. “Danish must have been an expert climber since the houses from where he stole the phones are not easily accessible.

In the first 10 days of the month, the state has added as many as 2,224 reconciled deaths to the cumulative tally. In comparison, the count of ‘recent’ deaths added was 1,709 in the same period. The state had begun the reconciliation exercise on May 17. Barring the last two days of June and first two days of July, the state has added old, unrecorded deaths almost every day in the last two months. While May saw 6,207 ‘old’ deaths being added to the toll, it rose to 19,059 in June. Overall, the state has added nearly 27,500 deaths through reconciliation since May besides the deaths reported in the 48-hour window. Pune contributed to the highest in reconciled deaths. Of the 194 added on Sunday, as many as 154 were from Pune district and 18 from Sangli, among others. On Sunday, Maharashtra added 8,535 new cases, a marginal rise from the detections seen on Saturday to take the state’s overall caseload to 61,57,799. The state also added 156 deaths recorded over a period of 48 hours and some last week, in addition to 194 reconciled deaths. The state's overall tally has reached 1,25,878. For the fourth day in a row, Mumbai reported below 600 (558) cases on Sunday and 15 deaths. The city’s total cases touched 7.3 lakh and deaths over 15,600. Active cases dipped to 11,423 from 11,558 on Saturday. Active cases in the state continued to rise—from 1.14 lakh on Saturday, the figure crossed 1.16 lakh on Sunday. Akola circle did not record a single death on Sunday, while Nagpur and Latur circles recorded one death each and Nashik saw three fatalities. State officials said western Maharashtra and Konkan are still a cause for concern since Kolhapur circle alone reported 74 deaths, while Pune circle came next with 32 deaths. Speaking at his hometown Jalna, public health minister Rajesh Tope said he has proposed to CM Uddhav Thackeray that some restrictions should be introduced to enter the state limits since the fear of a third wave is looming. “Entry into the state without Covid negative report should be restricted. Entry should also be made conditional to taking both vaccine jabs,” said Tope.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/10-days-into-july-maharashtra-has-added-2k-old-deaths/articleshow/84329526.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Compared to 12-odd hours it takes for the chariots to return to the temple, the procession will be completed in 4-5 hours due to curfew, said organizers. This is going to be for the first time in several decades that the procession will not have bhajan groups, akhadas, or tableaux accompanying the chariots. Several of the leaders of these groups visited the temple on Sunday and sought blessings of the deities. “Result of RT-PCR tests of 139 sailors and sadhus who will be participating in the procession arrived on Sunday, and all have tested negative for Covid-19,” said a temple official. “The procession will only have five vehicles including three chariots pulled by the sailors and a car with Mahant Dilipdasji and trustee Mahendra Jha.” On Sunday, hundreds of devotees thronged the temple to have a glimpse of ‘Sona Vesh’ (golden attire) of the deities that takes place only once a year. The chariots were brought inside the temple premises by the sailors as the decking up started by the devotees. The decked-up elephants were also brought inside the temple premises after they were painted by the mahouts and volunteer artists. With fresh spell of rains on Sunday night, the authorities are expected to review the waterlogging on the route as the chariots will roll after Pahind ritual by CM Vijay Rupani and deputy CM Nitin Patel at 7am on Monday. The temple authorities have already announced that the prasad of sprouted green gram will be given to devotees after the procession from the temple for next fortnight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/curfew-to-cut-procession-time-by-7-hrs/articleshow/84329545.cms||---

Both were charged under the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act and sent to jail . The tiger was poached by the ‘Lambu’ gang in 2007 in Dudhwa forests and its skin and body parts were smuggled to Nepal. It was while probing a tiger poaching that took place two months ago that the forest department authorities learnt about Shivkumar and Satish. They were arrested on Sunday and the tiger canines were seized from them. They confessed that these belonged to a tiger they had killed in 2007, forest officials said. Giving details, divisional forest officer Anil Patel said, “We had arrested a poacher, Ramkumar alias Lalla, along with tiger canines on July 7. He told us that they belonged to a tiger he had killed near Sharda river in neighbouring Pilibhit district’s Hazara area with the help of other gang members. During questioning, Ramkumar revealed the names of two other poachers, Shivkumar and Satish, who were a part of the team that killed the tiger using a trap. After collecting sufficient evidence, Shivkumar was taken into custody and a pair of tiger canines were recovered from his house. Satish, who sold animal parts to Nepalese smugglers, was subsequently arrested. We expect to arrest some more people who have a direct link with this poacher gang.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/dudhwa-officials-recover-canines-of-tiger-poached-in-2007-2-arrested/articleshow/84324910.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Delhi||‘Exposure to biomass burning at early age can affect height’||New Delhi: A new study conducted by experts from IIT-Delhi and Ashoka University says that exposure to extremely high levels of biomass burning early in life can affect the height of adolescents in the country. The study, which has been published in ‘Resource and Energy Economics’, stated that that high-intensity biomass burning is associated with lower adolescent height for teenage girls in India. “We find that girls who were exposed to extremely high levels of biomass burning during their early life have lower height by −1.07 cm or a decrease of 0.7 percent,” said the study. “The underlying non-pollution mechanisms at play suggest reduced labor supply, reduced consumption of food items like milk and cereals and increased sickness in the households as revealed by higher medical expenditures in response to an increase in fire-activity.” The early life in the study has been defined as the period from prenatal (9 months in-utero period) to postnatal period (6 months after birth). The research also stated that girls from North India are found to be especially vulnerable to the harmful effects of exposure to biomass burning. “Chronic exposure to pollution affects human health and height among adolescents is one of the outcomes. The study establishes a statistically significant association between exposure to extremely high level of biomass burning and effect on height of adolescents. However, a cohort study needs to be done,” said Sagnik Dey, institute chair and associate professor, Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi, and one of the researchers. The other researcher of the study is Prachi Singh from Ashoka University. For the study titled ‘Crop burning and forest fires: Long-term effect on adolescent height in India’, the researchers combined remote sensing data on biomass burning events with a pan-India survey on teenage girls (TAG survey). They used geo-codes of sampled PSUs (village name or census enumeration block name) in TAG dataset and calculated the total number of fire-events occurring in the 75 km radius around the PSU location. However, the study said one of the limitations of the research was that they were not able to capture the genetic factors associated with height of an offspring as TAG dataset does not collect anthropometric information for parents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/exposure-to-biomass-burning-at-early-age-can-affect-height/articleshow/84329529.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The HC’s order was on a plea by a grandfather, a 60-year-old Hooghly resident, who had claimed the custody of the newborn male child saying the child was born to his mentally challenged daughter at his home, but the Child Welfare Committee had intervened and handed the child’s custody to a social worker attached with a specialised adoption agency. Justice Rajasekhar Mantha in his order said, “The child shall remain under the care of the persons authorised by the Child Welfare Committee. The writ petitioner shall, however, have access to the child only to visit and see the baby. The petitioner shall not be allowed to touch the child.” “The HC asked the Child Welfare Commission to hear out the grandfather’s petition seeking the child’s custody within a fortnight and barred the committee from putting up the newborn for adoption for a month and a half even if it decides not to grant the child’s custody to his grandfather,” said lawyer Srijib Chakraborty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/childs-welfare-priority-in-custody-case-hc/articleshow/84327156.cms||---

According to a circular issued by the eight police stations falling on the yatra route, people have been told not to invite guests to witness the annual chariot festival. “Do not gather or move on your balconies or terraces, on streets or lanes, or in pols,” the circular reads. “Do not gather crowds by inviting guests or relatives to your homes to get a glimpse of the Rath Yatra.” The circular says that if the instructions are not followed, legal action will be taken. “Gathering in large numbers on terraces or balconies may be considered a violation of Covid norms,” the circular says. Usually, legions of people try to get a glimpse of the deities from their homes, waiting for hours on balconies or terraces. In many places, people normally shower petals on the chariots and on the stars of the procession such as bodybuilders. But this time, people can’t follow their yatra rituals. If a person violates the norms, he or she will be charged under IPC Section 188 for disobeying a public servant’s order. The Epidemic Diseases Act and the Disaster Management Act can also be invoked. The circular also says, “No one is allowed to set up stalls offering water, cold drinks, or any kind of food on the route of the Rath Yatra.” The circular adds: “No makeshift structures will be erected anywhere on the route of the Rath Yatra.” These rules will be implemented in the areas coming under the police stations of Kalupur, Madhavpura, Shaherkotda, Karanj, Dariapur, Gaekwad Haveli, Khadia, and Kagdapith.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/divine-distancing-no-darshan-from-balconies-terraces-this-year/articleshow/84329582.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||Agra||Inter-state racket which fraudulently collected taxes from vehicles at border points busted in Uttar Pradesh||AGRA: A well-organised gang, which allegedly dented the government exchequer by hundreds of crore in the last three years by floating a fake website of transport department and issuing counterfeit tax receipts to commercial vehicles at border check posts, has been busted by UP Police’s cyber cell in Agra. All such tax money collected from the vehicles was pocketed by the gang. So far, four of its members, including a software engineer who was hosting the server of the fake website, have been arrested. The racket was spread in at least six states -- Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, UP, MP and Maharashtra. According to police, members of the racket used to issue the fake receipts from the fake website of the transport department to the commercial vehicles. The counterfeit receipts were replicas of the original ones and the commercial vehicle owners could not tell the difference. Sub-inspector of Cyber Crime police station, Chetan Bhardwaj, said, “The fake website, http://tcchandra.com, was operational since 2018. On it, they generated fake tax receipts that looked similar to that of transport department receipts.” “The gang had also issued fake receipts at Akshardham and Ashram in Delhi too as its entries were found on the server data,” he said, adding that these people used to set up fake check posts at tax collection points at inter-state borders. The “super admin” of the fake website and mastermind of the entire racket, Balveer, a resident of Palwal in Haryana, is absconding, he said. Inspector general of police (Agra range) Naveen Arora told TOI, “Acting on a complaint of an Agra resident, it was found that the gang had set up check posts at the state borders. They were collecting taxes from commercial vehicles and nothing was being deposited in the government treasury. The server they were using to host the fake website has been seized and it will be sent to a forensic lab for analysis.” Four persons, software engineer Harsha Mittal, 32, a resident of Palwal, Rajendra, 37, Prem Singh, 21, and Monu, 26, have been arrested from Kosi border in Mathura. And their five associates are absconding, said SI Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/inter-state-racket-which-fraudulently-collected-taxes-from-vehicles-at-border-points-busted/articleshow/84324950.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Lucknow||BJP government resorting to vulgar display of authority, says Akhilesh||Lucknow: In a pointed attack on the ruling BJP, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday accused it of blatant misuse of government machinery in panchayat polls and described it as “nanga naach” (vulgar display of authority). Without explaining much he went on to say “Ye Yogi nahi ho sakte (He cannot be a sage)”. Training his guns at the government, the former UP CM said the BJP lost badly in the elections for panchayat members and village Pradhans where SP-backed candidates won the polls in a big way. “As a result, the government decided that it will not go by the mandate of the people and instead formulated a well thought out strategy where administrative and police officials got together with their political masters to intimidate, force, kidnap and attacks SP-backed winning candidates in the zila panchayat chairman and block chairman polls,” Akhilesh said. “Loktantra mein aisa nanga nach kisi sarkar ne nahi kiya hoga jitna Bharatiya Janata Party ne kiya hai (No other democratically elected government has ever resorted to such vulgar display of authority like the BJP government did),” he said. "The extent of lawlessness that prevailed was unimaginable,” he said, adding that administrative and police officials snatched away nomination papers of candidates and handed them over to BJP workers who destroyed them. He then talked about the Lakhimpur Kheri incident in which “goons tried to publicly humiliate a woman panchayat member when they tried to pull her by her saree in order to stop her from supporting an SP-backed candidate to file her nomination papers. “Both the sisters came to meet me here and I assured them that Samajwadi Party will stand by them to protect their honour,” he said. Akhilesh went on to talk about how viral videos have exposed the “gundagardi” (lawlessness) that prevailed during elections. He cited instances of a journalist being chased and beaten by an administrative officer in Unnao and SP Etawah talking to his senior on phone about him being slapped by BJP leaders, BJP MLA and his supporters who were carrying grenades. “After making a mockery of democracy, celebrations were held and sweets were served,” he said. The former UP CM went on to say, “Ye Yogi nahi ho sakte … maine kai mauquon par kaha hai aur phir dohrata hoon baat ko …. Ye yogi nahi hain …. Agar koi yogi hota to shayad Janata ko dukh nahi deta (He cannot be a Yogi … I have said it before and am saying it again …. had he been a Yogi, he couldn’t have caused so much pain to the people).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-government-resorting-to-vulgar-display-of-authority-says-akhilesh/articleshow/84331345.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Goa||Soon, a full-fledged deaddiction centre at North Goa district hospital||Panaji: Henceforth, opioid dependents will not have to scout for de-addiction centres outside Goa and shell out money if they wish to seek help to kick the habit. North Goa district hospital is set to have a full-fledged, 12-bedded de-addiction centre wherein addicts will be able to avail of medical treatment free of cost. The centre will be the first such facility in the state. It will be set up with funding from the Union ministry of social justice and with assistance from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). “We plan to have the unit ready in a month. Although one or two private centres for drug addicts exist in the state, they do not provide medical treatment. Several get admitted into a drug de-addiction centre outside Goa, but it comes with a cost,” Dr Ravindra Patil, a medical officer at the drug treatment centre told TOI. While the North Goa district hospital did have a 10-bedded ward for addicts, it catered mostly to alcoholics and just two beds were reserved for opioid dependents. A new ward is presently coming up in the existing one, but with added facilities and more beds. Vacancies for full-time nurses and other staff will be advertised shortly. Patil said patients often end up going to the wrong places outside the state for de-addiction and rarely come back clean, even after staying for a month or more. He said there are very few such centres that have proper facilities and where addicts are treated by doctors. The existing drug treatment centre at the North Goa district hospital provides OPD services, wherein opioid dependents are administered methadone orally after assessment by a doctor. A patient needs to visit the clinic everyday to take his oral dose, under the supervision of a nurse. The centre was reopened around three days ago after remaining closed for more than a month as the hospital had been treating only Covid-positive patients. It currently has 80 patients on its roll of which many have relapsed as they were unable to seek treatment when the centre was closed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/soon-a-full-fledged-deaddiction-centre-at-n-goa-district-hospital/articleshow/84329527.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Mumbai||BMC’s 3rd Covid wave plan: Use jumbo units, don’t disrupt non-Covid ops||MUMBAI: The third wave of coronavirus, if it arrives, will see some key changes in the way patients are hospitalised in the city. Primarily, jumbo hospitals will act as the first line of response, while the medical colleges will be mobilised once the field hospitals have saturated. Using takeaways from the two waves, civic authorities have drawn up the plan with the realisation that non-Covid services cannot be disrupted every time there is a spurt in Covid cases. The idea is to ensure that medical colleges like LTMG, KEM, Nair and RN Cooper, carry on treating other ailments. Jumbo centres, including NESCO in Goregaon and Richardson and Cruddas in Byculla, and dedicated Covid Hospital SevenHills in Marol will be among the facilities to handle the initial load as and when cases soar. Once these centres have crossed 50% of their capacity, the jumbos at Mulund and BKC will be activated. In terms of ICUs, Dahisar jumbo with 100 beds is likely to get operationalised at the very end.   Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that the second wave showed that the city could tide over by depending heavily on jumbos. BMC may opt for more PPP models like jumbo at NSCIAdditional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “Some of the shift in patient load from medical colleges to jumbos has already happened in the second wave. Knowing that it works, we want to focus more on jumbos and keep the medical colleges relatively free for other ailments.” In addition, the corporation may look at more public-private partnership models such as the one at NSCI Worli jumbo centre that is being managed by HN Reliance Hospital. Numbers from at least two leading medical colleges indicate the shift in Covid admissions. KEM Hospital, for instance, has admitted 1,561 patients till June in the second wave compared to 5,425 in the first wave, a nearly 70% drop. Dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh said due to better triaging only moderate and severe patients were treated in the second wave. The only age bracket where KEM saw a notable rise in admissions was in the paediatric age group. Children, who accounted for 2% admissions in KEM in the first wave, contributed to 13% admissions in the second wave. Only in children, some mild cases were also admitted for observation, the dean added. At the BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central too, over 6,600 patients were hospitalised in the first wave as opposed to about 2,000 till May in the second wave. Kakani said an important reason to designate Covid care to fewer hospitals was not to spread the manpower thin. The jumbo centres at Dahisar, Mulund and BKC were shut down for repairs and upgrade in mid-May. Besides structural strengthening, these centres are also being upgraded with laboratories and diagnostic facilities. NESCO in Goregaon recently inaugurated a CT scan facility along with 24/7 pathology services. Dahisar jumbo has started work on a 40-bed high-dependency unit. The BMC has nearly 12,000 beds in the existing jumbo hospitals and medical colleges together. These numbers could increase to 19,900 with the addition of 8,300 beds in the upcoming jumbo centres at Malad, Kanjurmarg and Somaiya grounds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmcs-3rd-wave-plan-use-jumbo-units-dont-disrupt-non-covid-ops/articleshow/84331391.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Jacob, who said he was kicked out of Kerala but was being wooed by nine states, told TOI that he was so impressed with the commitment and proactive approach of the Telangana government, particularly industries minister KT Rama Rao (KTR), that he felt confident enough to take a call, within hours, on bringing his investment to Telangana. “I expected a politician… but it felt like a business meeting with the CEO of a state. Whatever technical or practical issues we discussed, he understood. Because of that my confidence level went up. Otherwise we never take a risk of committing 1000 crore within eight hours of our visit. I’m sure I’m not taking a risk because I am not dealing with a politician,” he said. What also floored him was that KTR understood they had offers from various states and assured them whatever offers they had, Telangana would “meet” and “beat” them. This, Jacob said, was in stark contrast to his experience in his home state, where he alleged harassment that forced him to withdraw his 3,500 crore investment plan. “I had a lot of discussions in Kerala with the industries minister and other ministers but the problem is they are big zeroes. They don’t understand anything about business or investor problems,” said Jacob shaking his head in exasperation. So impressed was the top boss of the world’s second largest children’s garments manufacturer that he is also looking at Chandanvelly, where Welspun has its facilities, for a facility. “We are looking at both Kakatiya Mega Textile Park and Chandanvelly. Out of our $360 million project we have only confirmed the phase-1 investment of 1000 crore at KMTP. Once we finalise everything, we will decide whether we will set up only in one location or two. It will take another couple of weeks to finalise and we hope to sign the MoU by month end,” he said. Jacob said his only concern was availability of adequate manpower for which he is working closely with the Telangana government. Kitex, which employs around 15,000 people in Kerala, makes apparel for kids aged 0-24 months for exports to US. Apart from states like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha, over the weekend Jacob also saw newly appointed Union minister of state for the ministry of electronics & IT (MeitY), Rajeev Chandrasekhar invite him to set up shop in his adopted state of Karnataka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/committed-rs-1000-crore-in-8-hours-due-to-confidence-given-by-t-govt-kitex-cmd/articleshow/84329549.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

On Sunday, he needed them. With seven members of his family lying at his door in coffins, some of them small ones, Goyal needed at least 28 pallbearers. The sight of it was heart-rending and the wait was excruciating, as people sat on the ground and fastened thick wooden sticks together to make the biers. And as they lifted them, one after another, the air was rent with cries and screams. The tragedy struck two days ago and about 470km away at a ghat of Saryu River in Ayodhya. Goyal, a wholesaler of vegetables in Agra’s Shastripuram, had gone to the holy city on Thursday evening with his wife, four daughters, one of his sons-in-law, two sons and six grandchildren. They were 15, including Goyal. In an unfortunate moment, some of them slipped into the deep water and others started rescuing them at Guptaar ghat. In no time, nine members of the family were swallowed by the river. They included Goyal’s wife Raj Kumari (61), his two sons, Lalit (40) and Pankaj (25), two daughters Julie (42) and Sita (35) and three granddaughters Shruti (20), Priyanshi (16) and Drashti (4). And there is still no trace of a 16-year-old Sarthak, Goyal’s grandson. Since the condition of Julie’s body -- which was found after a prolonged search on Saturday-- was not in good condition, it was cremated in Ayodhya on Sunday. Back in Agra, six bodies were cremated. Four-year-old Drashti was buried at the cremation ground due to the tradition that children are not consigned to flames. Later, Goyal returned to an almost empty house, which was once used to be alive with children’s chuckle and elders’ innocent bickering. An inconsolable relative of the family said that the religious pilgrimage turned into tragedy for them. “They had gone to pray for the wellbeing of their family before the pooja ceremony of the new house of Goyal’s son Pankaj. But this tragedy struck,” he said.

Government data shows that while 315 (30%) of 1,034 total active patients required ventilator and oxygen support till mid-June, the same has now shrunk by 8% to 225 (22%) of 1,011 active patients as on July 11. Besides, while 255 people needed oxygen support till mid-June last month, it has now dipped to 174 this month. On the other hand, those on ventilator support also saw a notable decline from 60 to 51, which is encouraging, said civic officials adding that sustained efforts will show better results. “Several residents are now more aware and are proactively getting themselves screened. We are screening roughly around 3,500 people daily. Also, early detection makes it much easier to tackle the infection before it gets severe,” said Dr Vaijayanti Deogekar, medical officer of health at the Thane corporation. Civic officials said they have not let their guards down and will intensify contact tracing and tracking of patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-early-detection-helps-reduce-critical-cases-in-thane-by-8/articleshow/84329579.cms||Manoj Badgeri

TRS social media state wing head Krishank Manne told TOI that as a Union minister, Chandrasekhar should work for investment and development of all states. “It looks like an attempt being made to grab Telangana’s opportunity and divert it to Karnataka. It is against the spirit of federalism for a Union minister to intervene and try to take away investment from a state to another state of his choice...,” he said and sought the intervention of Union tourism minister of G Kishan Reddy. -Roushan Ali||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-objects-to-union-mins-wooing-kitex/articleshow/84329552.cms||---

These notes can now be used to make payments of property tax, sky sign department tax, road digging charges and water charges. The civic body had allowed credit notes only for building permissions when they were first approved in January. These notes are given to contractors for construction of the roads on public-private partnership basis. Roads are built without giving cash to the developers as the Pune Municipal Corporation has lost much revenue in the pandemic. “Income sources are limited now for the civic body. We have to find options like credit notes. They are the need of the hour for development projects,” Hemant Rasane, chairman of the standing committee, said. The PMC had planned to allow redemption of these credit notes only for the building permissions charges. “If we want more developers to come forward, we must allow different types of payment via credit notes. It helps in gaining a good response to the policy,” BJP corporator Mahesh Wable, who gave the supplementary note, said. The PMC has planned to develop roads and bridges on the lines of public-private partnership. Under this initiative, credit certificates will be given for development of facilities. These certificates can be used by developers for paying a number of charges pertaining to building permissions such as development charges, building permission fees and premium charges. If land is not available with the PMC already, developers will have to take it from the private landowners using TDR or FSI. At least 80% land should be in the possession of the developers for allocation of these notes. Roads and bridges proposed to be built through this initiative are in Hadapsar, Kharadi and Mundhwa areas. The PMC has proposed that credit notes be given in phases based on the progress of the road works. The developers will be able to put to use credit notes up to Rs 200 crore per year through these credit notes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/developers-can-use-credit-notes-for-wider-payments/articleshow/84329571.cms||---

A resident doctor with Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical (RMLIMS), she was battling for life for over two months before the UP government swiftly sanctioned Rs 1.5crore for the life-saving surgery. She reached Hyderabad after a 2-hour flight from Lucknow, straddling green corridors in both cities for quick, seamless movement. Late Saturday, a four-member team from KIMS, Hyderabad, arrived in Lucknow and examined the patient around midnight for pre-transplant assessment. Since a brief withdrawal of the advanced life support system (ECMO) could prove fatal, her condition was reviewed again in the morning. The KIMS medical team then moved her to their own ECMO facility and after monitoring her stability for several hours, the journey to Hyderabad began.  "Dr Suman reached safely and is in KIMS ICU," said Prof PK Das, head anesthesia department, RMLIMS, who had been taking care of the resident doctor since May 1. It was an emotional send-off for Dr Suman with sobbing colleagues and RMLIMS faculty members praying for her safe journey. Green corridors were opened from RMLIMS to Amausi airport and from Hyderabad airport to KIMS to skirt traffic bottlenecks. She was on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) all through the journey. An ECMO is used for pumping and oxygenating a patient's blood out of the body, allowing heart and lungs to rest. Starting at 11am from RMLIMS, it took 30 minutes to reach Amausi airport before a two-hour journey by air ambulance to Hyderabad. Her husband, Dr Ajay Kumar, and Dr PK Das accompanied her to Lucknow airport. “The lung transplant procedure at KIMS will take time as she needs to be stabilized and treated for any condition that may have developed during the flight,” Dr Das said. Dr Suman, a postgraduate resident in RMLIMS’ gynaecology department, was eight-months pregnant when she contracted Covid-19 on April 14, while on duty at a non-Covid emergency ward. She was hospitalised in a Covid ward and when her condition deteriorated, she was put on a ventilator and a C-section surgery was done to save her child. The baby girl is doing fine, doctors told TOI. But Dr Suman kept sinking and was subsequently put on ECMO and a team of experts recommended a lung transplant on July 1. Head, pulmonary and critical care medicine department, King George's Medical University, professor Ved Prakash, said, even after the transplant, Dr Suman may need to stay in a bio bubble to avoid infection."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lucknow-doc-airlifted-to-hyd-for-lung-transplant/articleshow/84329577.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

Documents in the possession of TOI show that the land parcels were bought in the name of Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd, in which Salil Deshmukh has a controlling stake. Collectively, the 8.3 acres of land valued at about Rs 300 crore are located a stone’s throw away from NH 348 Palaspe Phata to JNPT. One of the land parcels was purchased from a freedom fighter’s family. ED sources have found out that Salil Deshmukh has a controlling interest in the company, and an investigation is on into the land deals. Email and text messages sent to Anil Deshmukh did not elicit any response till the time of going to press. ‘Many farmers got paid in cash for land deals’As per records available with this newspaper, the land parcels transactions were made between 2006 and 2015. TOI visited the spot and found that different plots adjoining each other were purchased, and they now form a large, single plot without any boundary. These lands are in Dhutum village under Jasai talathi limit, Uran tehsil. “The plots were sold to Anil Deshmukh and his family members. It was registered in the name of a company (Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd). A number of farmers had sold their land and got cash payments mostly,” said Chandrabhaga Patil, relative of late freedom fighter Ramdassheth Thakur of Dhutum who had sold a plot to the Deshmukhs. “The land details as per our records are in the name of Premier Port Links Pvt Ltd, a company,” said Bhagwan Waghilkar, talathi, Jasai, Uran tehsil. “Many farmers have sold out their small land parcels to the Deshmukhs. The land is lying unused since it has been sold out. Recently, there were talks that ONGC would acquire the land to set up a plant, but there is no clarity,” said KM Thakur, a Dhutum villager.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ed-probes-rs-300cr-land-bought-by-deshmukhs-son/articleshow/84361724.cms||Umesh K Parida

Speaking after inaugurating the ward, Owaisi said “If you want to save heritage, save it, but if you want to save lives, and save money, we need a new building for Osmania Hospital.” He said that the shortage of beds and ventilators cost many lives during the second wave. “Covid-19 treatment is expensive and hospitals like Indo US Hospital can help patients save their hard-earned money during times of crises. We must be prepared for the third wave, but I hope that it does not come to that,” he said. Referring to the Osmania Hospital controversy, he said, “The condition of Osmania Hospital has been deteriorating with every passing day. Osmania Hospital needs a built up area of 20 lakh square feet.” He said one must support the movement for building the new Osmania Hospital building while adding “when the CM can demolish the Warangal jail and build two towers in its place, [why not] Osmania Hospital Medical College [which] is the oldest medical college in the country, which has given us countless doctors in different disciplines.” He also vowed to extend cooperation to the Sahayata Trust-run Indo US Hospital to further improve healthcare infrastructure and Covid-19 preparedness facilities there with the help of MP funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/saving-lives-more-crucial-than-saving-heritage-says-owaisi/articleshow/84329593.cms||---
---||Meerut||Murder accused in Uttar Pradesh swaps identity with petty offender and flees leaving jail authorities red-faced||MUZAFFARNAGAR: Two criminals - Ajit, a murder accused, and Vikas, a petty offender - shifted to a makeshift prison due to Covid scare, outsmarted jail authorities in Uttar Pradesh's Muzaffarnagar by swapping identity and documents, leaving them hugely embarrassed. The murder accused escaped as "Vikas" while the petty offender took his place. The latter, booked under CrPC 151, had already got bail and was about to be released any moment. The local administration came to know about the "swapping" 19 days later. Ajit may have offered Vikas a hefty sum for the act, police said. The murder accused met the other man at the makeshift prison and planned the escape, police added. Vikas, a resident of Civil Lines, was picked up by Khatauli police on June 9 for "disturbing peace" and sent to jail in Kawal. A day later, cops in Jansath arrested Ajit, a resident of Muradnagar in Ghaziabad, and sent him to the same prison. After spending days together in the makeshift prison they were sent to Muzaffarnagar jail on June 16. Here, they exchanged their identification papers. Vikas was granted bail by the sub divisional magistrate's court in Khatauli on June 21. But, it was Ajit who was actually released - all under the nose of the jail authorities. The case of "swapping" was kept a secret from the public all this while, and it came to light only on Saturday evening. New Mandi station house officer, Anil Kaparwan, said, "The jail administration had filed a complaint. A case has been registered under IPC section 420 against Ajit and Vikas. Police teams are conducting raids in multiple locations, but the murder accused is no where to be found."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/murder-accused-in-up-swaps-identity-with-petty-offender-flees-leaving-jail-authorities-red-faced/articleshow/84325003.cms||Mohd Dilshad

They are now planning to approach the SSP for a CB-CID inquiry. Yashpal Singh was allegedly gunned down by bike-borne assailants outside a 'dharam kanta' [weighing station] in Meerut on June 30, and the cops on Saturday picked up Narendra Kumar Singh, his son, in connection with the killing. According to the police, the deceased's own son had hired shooters to kill his father over a property dispute. However, Amit Singh, the elder son, told TOI the family was not convinced and wanted a "fair probe". "Police think my innocent younger brother can kill my father? How can they even think that? The cops are trying to shield criminals. We demand a CB-CID inquiry," he said, adding the family is planning to meet the SSP with their "demand". “The cops, in this case, have given a clean chit to the suspects,” he said. Meanwhile, the cops from city’s TP Nagar police station held a press conference on Saturday to claim a "closure in the murder case". The police stated that Yashpal, 82, was "sleeping inside a room on Jai Shiv Dharam Kanta situated near Baghpat Road when he was brutally murdered by unidentified assailants who had fired several rounds of bullets on him". “We secured CCTV footage from various localities and also the crime spot. Based on the footage, we found that there was some dispute between Yashpal and his sons over the distribution of ancestral property. The deceased man himself used to look after and operate the hospital. He had reportedly given more share of his property to his son Narendra. But, in the last few days, the deceased man wanted to distribute the property equally among all his sons to which Narendra raised strong objections,” SP (City) Vineet Bhatnagar said. This caused a major friction between the father and son and Narendra joined hands with one Munawwar to eliminate Yashpal, the police added. "Munawwar was already interested in Yashpal's land. While the deceased wanted to keep him out of the property, Narendra desired the opposite. So, the two got into the act of removing the father,” the police said. The two had allegedly hired a sharpshooter named Noor Alam for the task. The cops claimed to have found the murder weapon, the bike used in the crime and clothes worn by the assailants. Narendra, Munawwar and Noor Alam have all been arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/meerut-hosp-owner-murder-case-police-claim-closure-after-sons-arrest-family-cries-foul/articleshow/84325027.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Meerut||Hindu artisans work to restore Meerut’s Shahi Jama Masjid||MEERUT: Vinod, Pappu and Dharamveer are working tirelessly day and night to finish the task they were assigned in 2019. These stone carvers from the stone city of Hindaun in Rajasthan, are trying to complete the task of craving detailed inscriptions and verses of the holy Quran on one of the main gates of the Shahi Jama Masjid, the oldest mosque in the city. With little understanding of what they are carving on the stone, the trio risks its health inhaling the dust and enduring the noise emitted by the stones to finish the task delayed by a year due to the outbreak of Covid. So far, these carvers have worked in over 40 mosques across India, including the Jama Masjid in Delhi. The three have also worked in Delhi’s Swaminarayan Akshardham temple and several Jain temples across the country. But 60% of their work is concentrated on Islamic structures. “We get more work in mosques as they still use the art of stone carving,” said Dharamveer, a fifth generation stone carver and probably the last as his children are not interested in pursuing the family profession. Pappu said he did not want his children to follow in his footsteps. “This dust is making us ill. Over 50 people in our village have died over the past 10 years due to silicosis caused by inhaling silica dust.” Once the task here is done, the trio proposes to move to Delhi to join others from Hindaun working there. The men from Hindaun are engaged in carving mosques in Nainital and Delhi currently. Bablu Chaurasia, the contractor at the site, lamented that the stone artists of Hindaun may be the last to work with their hands as machines are being used as substitutes everywhere. Meanwhile, the artisans are attracting students and visitors at the mosque who come to watch them handcraft inscriptions on stone at the Jama Masjid here. According to Ata-Ur-Rehman, a teacher at the mosque, the building is around 700 years old and was built in 1306 by Sultan Nasiruddin Shah. Hence the need for repairs. “The mosque management wants to preserve its history for which we were looking for people who could carve stones exactly the way it was done originally. The giant gates and domes have verses of the Quran and history of the mosque in Urdu inscribed on them. These artisans are doing the job with such dedication that it looks like they do it from the heart,” Rehman said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/hindu-artisans-work-to-restore-meeruts-shahi-jama-masjid/articleshow/84325035.cms||---

NMMC sources said the dip in infectivity rate is attributed to aggressive testing in hotspot areas. With daily average testing at 6,400, average daily positive cases stand at 124, bringing the positivity rate down to 1.93% from 2% to 3% last month. “Infectivity rate has shrunk, and recording under 2% despite rising cases is a positive sign.

I myself had plans but I have cancelled my ticket to Goa on second thoughts,” said 26-year-old Sirisha,from Hafeezpet. Numerous parties at resorts and farmhouses are also being reported on city outskirts. Experts said the overdrive of social activity might invite trouble sooner than expected and can cause more harm. It is the behaviour of the people during the mid-wave period which will determine if there will be a third wave. Going by the current trend, experts fear it is only a matter of time when another peak might be seen. “Now that the second wave has subsided, people are going on a rampage to travel and socialize. The way people are consuming this time is a little alarming and with the newer variants like Delta, Delta plus, etc it looks like there is a possibility of a third wave. It is only a matter of time when cases will peak,” said Dr Ranga Reddy Burri, president, Infection Control Academy of India, adding that we definitely need to be prepared. Moreover, since the percentage of citizens completely vaccinated in the state still hovers around 10%, responsible behaviour is essential to delay the next wave. “Since we know that there is a possibility of a third wave, we need to be more responsible in preventing it. With this kind of behaviour, we might invite trouble earlier than expected and if the third wave begins in advance it would mean that more number of people will remain unvaccinated and will be prone to life-threatening infection,” said Dr P Raghu Ram, director, KIMS-Ushalakshmi Centre for Breast Diseases, adding that people need to be extremely responsible for atleast one more year till a majority of the country’s population is vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/experts-raise-alarm-as-many-throw-caution-to-the-wind/articleshow/84329634.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Delhi||What it takes to keep Delhi’s largest green patch alive||NEW DELHI: While most know about the role the forest and wildlife department plays in protecting forest land in Delhi, the southern Ridge — Delhi’s largest green patch — is almost fully guarded by a lesser-known group called the Ecological Task Force (ETF). Comprising retired personnel and ex-servicemen, ETF is tasked with protecting the southern Ridge and planting native species, not only ensuring that the land turns into a lush green landscape, but also preventing encroachments and erection of illegal structures in the area. Formed in 2000 by the Sheila Dikshit-led Congress government, ETF has since then revived 48 water bodies and also planted over 32 lakh saplings in Asola, Bhatti, Dera Mandi, Ghitorni, Rajokri, Jaunapur, Devli, Tughlaqabad and Rangpuri. An ETF official, who requested anonymity, told TOI that the job may seem simple on paper, but its personnel, divided into groups and tasked with afforestation of patches of the rocky Aravalli terrain over a period of several years, often slept on the spot to ensure the newly planted saplings were not trampled over or to prevent new structures coming up on forest land. “Teams take up patrolling barren patches 24x7, protecting the planted saplings, watering the area, building structures for water conservation and alerting others of any illegal encroachment,” revealed the official. Under the 132 ETF Battalion, 261 individuals are currently deployed in Bhatti, Asola, Ghitorni, Rajokri, Jaunapur and Tughlakabad. The redeveloped areas are handed over to the forest department, such as Ujwa in southern Delhi. Officials said that each individual on the ground is given different assignments, such as watering the newly planted saplings, creating check dams and bunds or patrolling forested land. Another ETF official, who is tasked with patrolling Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary, explained why water collection efforts were important. “Over time, the creation of check dams helps improve the groundwater table in the area. There is also more moisture in the soil when it rains, and this allows saplings to grow faster, in turn attracting wildlife.” Since 2000, over 48 waterbodies have either been revived or created in the southern Ridge, leading to an increase in bird presence. ETF officials act as the first eyes in the forest, often informing the forest department of rare fauna sightings, including of leopards and striped hyenas. “The southern Ridge and Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary, in particular, has seen an increase in the number of leopard sightings, nilgai numbers, and snake and bird population,” said an official. Under National Green Tribunal orders, the forest and wildlife department has been clearing the forest land of houses and buildings built illegally. Once the structures are removed and a boundary wall erected, ETF takes over and begins planting native saplings. However, they also meet with resistance on occasion. Only last month, an ETF team faced an attack by over 20 men at Dera Mandi. They were trying to reclaim a piece of forest land that had been cleared and ETF had to call police for assistance. The official said, “If an encroachment is spotted or our personnel are attacked, we inform both the local cops and the forest department. In that particular case, the assailants were arrested and taken to the nearest police station. Plantation work remained unaffected by the incident and within 2-3 years, the saplings will have grown to a height at which they can sustain themselves.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/what-it-takes-to-keep-citys-largest-green-patch-alive/articleshow/84329652.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

This indicates that cases have reached a plateau. However, experts say that it will take another six months for the majority of the population to get vaccinated and that people still need to restrain themselves from travelling, partying and other social activities for atleast one more year. The positivity rate was 1.08% a month ago and has now come down to 0.78%. “The second wave has probably reached a plateau phase in Telangana. It is the lowest in the last one year. While it is a good sign, we need to maintain Covid-19 appropriate behaviour to ensure that the level continues to remain low,” said Dr Kiran Madala, in-charge, head of department of critical care at Nizamabad Medical College, adding that until 70% of the population is vaccinated, the threat of a devastating next wave will remain upon us. Meanwhile, Telangana has so far vaccinated 1.23 crore people and as per official figures 1.74 crore population is yet to get the first dose. Only 45% of the eligible people have taken the first dose so far and only 10% have been completely vaccinated. “Unvaccinated individuals have 1.57 times higher risk of contracting the infection compared to those who are partially vaccinated and 2.49 times than the fully vaccinated population,” found a latest study among healthcare workers by the Liver and Biliary Institute, Delhi. The findings of this study titled ‘Clinicogenomic analysis of breakthrough infections by SARS CoV2 variants after ChAdOx1 nCoV- 19 vaccination in healthcare workers’, were also confirmed in independent studies of vaccinated population by two corporate hospitals in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/positivity-rate-lowest-since-1st-wave/articleshow/84329612.cms||Amrita Didyala

Allegedly, she had been constantly harassed by her husband and in-laws over petty issues and they were also demanding Rs 15 lakh as dowry from her. The victim Pooja Vyas’ father Kaushik Patel, a resident of Ghatlodia, filed a complaint of abetment to suicide against her husband Krunal Vyas, her brother-in-law Yash Vyas, her mother-in-law Mayuri Vyas, Mayuri’s boyfriend Nilesh Pancholi and Mayuri’s brother Ajit Raval, who were all arrested by Sola police on Sunday. The suicide note written purportedly by the victimPolice also found a suicide note written by Pooja in which she blamed her husband and in-laws for her suicide and urged her family members to take custody of her kid. She mentioned in the suicide note, “Only Krunal can meet my kid but at my parents’ place only.” Kaushik said in his FIR with Sola police that her daughter married Krunal on December 12, 2015 and they began staying together in Gota. After around six months, her husband and in-laws began harassing her and Pooja also came to know that her mother-in-law had an illicit relationship with Pancholi who used to intervene in Vyas family’s issue. She said that her husband and in-laws did not want her to give birth to a child and tried to make her abort when she was pregnant in July 2016. She had to return to her father’s home where she delivered her son as her husband and in-laws were against the kid. The FIR mentioned that Pooja and her family had to strike a compromise with her husband and in-laws many a time as the accused persons ensured that they would not harass her any further. But later on, they began beating and abusing her if she did not agree with them over various issues. Kaushik said in the FIR that Pooja once told her that Pancholi used to smoke and drink in front of her and her kid and when she objected, she was not only beaten by Mayuri but Krunal also. He alleged that Krunal’s maternal uncle also used to drink in front of Pooja and made obscene gestures looking at her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/harassed-by-husband-in-laws-woman-hangs-self-in-gota/articleshow/84329663.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||4,544 cyber fraud cases logged in 2020 across Telangana||HYDERABAD: Most victims of cyber crime were duped through fake customer care, e-classified frauds, one time password (OTP) fraud, investment and matrimony and sextortion crimes apart from data breach at institutions. In 2020, 4,544 cyber crime cases were registered across Telangana. When V Sandeep (name changed) opened an unsolicited mail in his email box, to his shock he found his email ID and password in it. The sender informed that he had hacked Sandeep’s computer and, through webcam, found out that he was watching porn and his voyeuristic behaviour would be put on the web if he did not pay up. Police, during the investigation, found that user data was accessed from unknown institutions and put up for sale on the darknet. It is from the darknet, fraudsters buy the data and send extortion mails. Fearing their reputation, some persons paid money, while many ignored such threats and lodged police complaints. “In most cases, some rouge employees will clandestinely sell data. This is the only possibility for breach of data from any company. Once the data is put up on the darknet for sale, it is difficult to trace the origin,’’ Hyderabad assistant commissioner of police (Cyber Crime) KVM Prasad. Officials said that due to data breach, sensitive documents of persons submitted to various organisations might appear in public domain. Most cyber crime cases registered in the last few years have been with regard to cheating, abuse of social media by accused with an intention to target specific users. However, a new trend was witnessed during Covid-19 second wave when there was scarcity of oxygen cylinders, hospital beds and medicines. Cyber fraudsters had duped many people by issuing fake advertisements on social media. Since the families were in a desperate situation to arrange oxygen and medicines for their kin, they relied on unverified messages and fell in the trap of the fraudsters. In many cases, Telangana police arrested fraudsters from Bengaluru, Delhi, North-East and other areas of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/4544-cyber-fraud-cases-logged-in-2020-across-t/articleshow/84329661.cms||---

According to UP government data, when the first wave of the pandemic hit the district in 2020, a decline in home as well as institutional deliveries, including C-section deliveries, was recorded as compared to data from pre-pandemic year (2019-2020). Experts said, people’s hesitancy in visiting hospitals, fear of contracting infection and personal tragedies acted as deterrents for people to approach their partner or plan pregnancies. People voluntary pushed plans to have babies for the fear of the unknown which contributed to dip in birth rate. From April 2019 to March 2020, total 52,706 deliveries were recorded in the district. This data includes all deliveries, institutional as well as those at home. Out of this, 14,287 were C-section deliveries. However, total deliveries dipped to 40,292, including 9,990 C-sections, between April 2020 and March 2021. The data between April 2021 and June 2021 shows only 5,843 deliveries, which is lower than the monthly average of previous years. The data represents births at home and at government institutions. Experts believe that against general misconception of rise in birth rate, the number of deliveries came down. Former head of gynaecology department at Queen Mary’s Hospital (QMH), Dr Vineeta Das, said: “Although normal deliveries at home were documented, I still believe that the data could be under-reported in the pandemic year when the priority for statistics and everything else had shifted to Covid care. People were scared of going to hospitals, and when they did, majority of hospitals were not admitting pregnant women, so the influx of such patients to QMH was delayed.” “This delay, and the fact that antenatal checkups were not frequent during the pandemic year, resulted in high number of complications which mostly ended up in stillbirths. Even QMH had expected that there would be an influx of patients since other hospitals were not taking in patients, but the real numbers on ground were mostly the same as our regular days, which was unexpected,” added Dr Das. Experts feel that educated people might have realised the problems they could face while planning a baby in times of pandemic anddeffered plans. “If this data is true, we will have to agree that services were affected and people postponed pregnancy plans and preferred not to get caught in the resource crunch triggered by the pandemic,” said joint director at the Population Foundation of India, Alok Vajpeyi. “It is quite possible that data was not fully uploaded, as for a long time, the national data by health ministry on births was not made public. It is possible that many deliveries at home, which were expected to see an increase, might not have been reported,” he added. Psychologist and former head of KGMU’s geriatric mental health department Dr SC Tiwari said, “There is no doubt people had pandemic-induced fears because of which they avoided interacting with their partners in a normal way. Social distancing, masking and need to sanitize also acted as a hindrance in people’s fertilization plans as safety was priority.” “Imagine if there is a death in a family due to Covid or if somebody is critically ill in the family, it affects all the aspects of life,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pandemic-induced-trauma-anxiety-hit-birth-rate-in-city/articleshow/84331442.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Hyderabad||Third Covid wave set in on July 4, says top Hyderabad physicist||HYDERABAD: Has India ushered in the third wave of Covid-19? According to a top city researcher, who has analysed the metrics of infection and death rate for over 15 months based on TOI data uploaded daily, the third wave appears to have set in on July 4 to be precise.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); Dr Vipin Srivastava, an eminent physicist and former pro-vice-chancellor, University of Hyderabad (UoH), told TOI that the pattern of new Covid-19 infections and deaths in the country since July 4 appeared similar to that of the first week of February 2021, when the second wave of Covid-19 hit the country peaking by April end. He cautioned that the third wave could pick up momentum if people failed to follow the Covid-19 protocol like social distancing, sanitisation, wearing of masks, and vaccination. Dr Srivastava prepared graphs taking daily updates on Covid-19 by TOI for the last 461 days to unravel the wave pattern. The physicist has developed three metrics on the progression of the pandemic after analysing the Covid-19 data on deaths for 461 days now. One of the metrics or measures analysed, shows the signs of onset of a new (third) wave of Covid-19 since July 4. He has named this metric as “Daily Death Load” (DDL) of Covid-19. He calculated the DDL metric every 24 hours from TOI data.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); To calculate the metric on the progression/degression of Covid-19, Dr Srivastava took the ratio of the number of Covid-19 deaths in a period of 24 hours, i.e. while going from day D to day D+1), and the number of new active cases added in the same period of 24 hours. This number can be positive as well as negative and can take a range of values, small as well as large. It is negative when the number of recovered patients in 24 hours exceeds the number of new cases added in the same 24 hours. A favourable situation would arise when the daily death load is small and negative. “When I plot this ratio as a function of time I find that it exhibits wild fluctuations whenever there is a crossover from one scenario to another in the plot for the number of daily covid deaths,” Dr Srivastava said. Explaining further, the former Pro-VC said even when the number of deaths was very high in May 2021, the DDL fluctuated wildly in a 10-day period from May 6 to 17, signalling that a crossover was in the offing. While the number of daily deaths was still very high and was fluctuating rapidly, the DDL had calmed down and attained favourable negative and small values. This marked the decrease in the daily death numbers. The important point is that the DDL had signalled the onset of the second wave as early as the middle of February. Since July 4, the DDL has been fluctuating -- so far it has been in the range 0.51 to minus 0.855.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/third-covid-wave-set-in-on-july-4-says-top-physicist/articleshow/84329655.cms||Syed Akbar

In one complaint filed with Naroda police, Dinesh Dalwani and his wife Nayna, residents of the third floor of Amardeep Residency, said they wanted to use the lift on Sunday afternoon. When Dinesh pushed the button, the lift did not arrive at his floor. He found that someone had left the door open on the fourth floor. He told another resident of the building, Gopal Singh Rajput, that his son Devi Singh Rajput had kept the door open. Dinesh alleged that Rajput became angry and he along with his son thrashed him. When Dinesh’s wife intervened, they thrashed her too, he alleged in the FIR. On the other hand, Rajput filed an FIR against Dinesh and his wife alleging that they thrashed him and his son. He alleged that Nayna tore off his shirt and threatened to implicate him in a false case. Naroda police registered FIRs and began an investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/tiff-over-open-door-of-lift-escalates-to-firs/articleshow/84329722.cms||---
---||Pune||Over 19,000 unassessed properties in PCMC limits||PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Over 19,000 unassessed properties have been identified by a private firm appointed by the property tax department of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), in a survey that was conducted from November 2020 to April 2021. Smita Zagade, the PCMC’s deputy commissioner, said that out of the 19,438 unassessed properties, some of them were new, while others were the ones that had been extended or had some other change of use on the existing premises, which were liable for the property tax. Zagade said that in the survey they had found out over 350 mobile towers, which had not been authorized by the civic body to operate. There were also few malls that had flouted the construction norms by raising one or more floors without permission. The corporation was likely to earn a tax of over Rs300 crore from them, she said. “There are a few big players as well, whose unassessed property may fetch the corporation huge taxes. These companies failed to report the new structural changes. The survey showed that they were now liable for the property tax. We have served such properties notices. We have served over 5,000 notices overall,” she said. She said these properties were unassessed and should have been regularized by the property owners. “There is a possibility that some of the properties could be legal too. We will verify these surveyed properties accordingly. The unauthorized properties would have to be regularized in the coming weeks,” she said. Zagade said the number of such unassessed properties rose during the lockdown period. The necessary permissions were not taken by the respective owners and now they would have to regularize the properties and pay the respective property tax as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-19k-unassessed-properties-in-pcmc-limits/articleshow/84329682.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Pandemic illuminates need to bridge digital divide, give access to disabled||Before the virus came along, Ninad Pawar (25)—living with severe visual impairment since birth—would spend three days a week at his favourite haunt, the National Association for the Blind at Worli Seaface where he would browse braille and talking books, check job resources and practise Excel and Powerpoint at the computer lab. The overnight shift to an all-virtual mode during the pandemic tossed out Pawar’s routine and along with that a safe space for a young person with a disability. Most people with vision or hearing loss are digitally savvy, using screen-reader or speech-to-text tools on their phones and laptops to read, write or communicate. So, the lockdown was no bother at first for Pawar, until he realised he was sitting on the wrong side of the digital divide — be it at a webinar, ordering groceries on a delivery app or watching a webshow on an Indian OTT platform. “I was attending an online college meet for a history project on natural heritage spaces where a majority of the presentation was made using videos and slideshows. Earlier we’d be taken to these places where I’d touch and feel the space to experience it. There’s no way for me to understand what is being shown or discussed online now. Also, no one really explains the visuals,” said Pawar, who urged his brother to guide him through video conferences. “While webinars and live streams boomed, persons with hearing and vision impairments were impeded from fully accessing web conferences. The visually impaired could listen to a conversation but not follow the presentations due to lack of adequate screen reader access (software that speaks aloud the text on screen) or audio descriptions. For the deaf — who need sign language interpretation — closed captioning or subtitles were missing,” explained heritage architect and accessibility consultant Siddhant Shah. The 30-year-old had been working on making cultural heritage accessible for the disabled through his initiative ‘Access for All’ until the pandemic heightened the stakes of what more needed to be done to make the new normal inclusive. “Our primary project in the pandemic has been to provide sign language and closed caption guides on Covid-related information across India,” said Shah, who has also been working on the “access audit” (accessibility appraisal of an environment, facility or service for persons with disability) for 10 educational, cultural and corporate institutions across the country keen on easing their digital access. “MNCs that wanted us to devise a digital inclusion toolkit, rely heavily on user interface and such digital exclusion they’d never witnessed before.”  Shah helped facilitate sign language interpreters for various online lit fests and webinars that arts organisations like the India Culture Lab and Art X Company in Mumbai or Khoj in Delhi hosted in the lockdown. He also integrated an AI-powered accessibility widget on their web pages that allow users to adjust the font; have the text read aloud; and change the display to dyslexia-friendly alternatives. “Even in non-pandemic times, the disabled experienced social isolation but the new digital environment makes participation limited or impossible,” said Shah. Online food delivery is one such example. “The delivery apps are not compatible with assistive technologies and increased dependency on caregivers. Also, their focus on graphics makes it challenging for the visually impaired to comprehend or navigate the multiple tabs that open up in the absence of alt-text or sound guides.” Accessible entertainment — art and heritage spaces opening their exhibits to tactile or virtual experiences or web shows that are audio-described and captioned — is an idea that the disabled have clamoured for, for years. “Although international web streaming services now come with accessible features, the Indian ones lack those settings especially at a time when it’s a primary source of at-home entertainment,” said Shah, who recently petitioned Clubhouse, the new voice-based social networking app, to alert them to deaf users. “With audio emerging as the next wave of social media, we need to advocate for alternative sources.” Despite the obstacles, Shah remains hopeful of what the pandemic has illuminated. “Organisations stepping forth to democratize digital access is a promising start since the ask for accessibility here isn’t as high as it’s in the West. I have faith that the disabled community, too, will no longer settle for the way things were.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pandemic-illuminates-need-to-bridge-digital-divide-give-access-to-disabled/articleshow/84329741.cms||Mohua Das
---||Hyderabad||Eatala Rajender set to undertake ‘yatra’ for Huzurabad||HYDERABAD: With Huzurabad bypoll heading to be another high-stakes battle, former health minister Eatala Rajender may undertake a ‘yatra’ in the assembly constituency. The door-to-door contact programme, which will cover 350 km criss-crossing 107 villages across five mandals of the assembly segment, is most likely to be launched in the next three to four days. The walkathon is likely to begin from Battinavari Palle. Currently, the road map for the programme is being finalised. It is learnt that the yatra would be planned in such way that he would cover at least three villages a day. He would also undertake a Palle Nidra programme (sleepover at a village). BJP state chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar had undertaken a similar initiative during GHMC election last, where he would stop his campaign at a party activist’s house and call it a day and begin the next day’s programme from the same place Eatala Rajender is likely to touch upon issues like double-bed room houses, farm loan waiver and employment creation as promised in the state. During the local meetings, Eatala has been demanding that Huzurabad be made Karimnagar district headquarters. BJP sources said that after allotting the responsibilities of the bypoll to state-level leaders, in the next few days, the focus would be on strengthening cadre till booth level. The campaign and regular election in charges would be appointed to contact every voter in the assembly segment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-set-to-undertake-yatra-for-huzurabad/articleshow/84331468.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Lucknow||‘Won’t be complacent after rural poll win, will work hard for UP elections under Yogi’||He may be a satisfied man after the party-supported candidates won majority of seats in zila panchayat and block chairman elections, but UP BJP president Swatantra Dev Singh says that party workers would not be complacent and work even harder in future. In an interview to Pankaj Shah, Singh said that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will be the face of the party in the campaign for assembly elections due next year. Excerpts: Do you think that BJP’s victory in rural local bodies elections reflects the party’s prospects in 2022 UP assembly elections? There is no doubt that our victory in panchayat elections will have an impact on assembly elections but that does not mean that the party workers will stop making efforts. Theharna nahi hai...parishram ki parakashtha karni hai hum sab ko... (We will not stop and keep working hard). The basic structure of the organisation needs to be made stronger. Has panchayat poll results brought the curtains down on speculations on the change of guard in UP? (Laughs) Those speculations no longer hold any ground. Un sab baaton ka patakshep ho chuka hai...charchayein band ho chuki hain..Yogi ji ke netritva mein hi chunav hoga (All such talks have ended...rumours have died. The forthcoming assembly elections will be fought under the leadership of CM Yogi). Earlier, the BJP did not have much presence at the cooperative and panchayat levels, but it is now focusing on urban local bodies elections. Has there been a change in strategy? The party started taking interest in cooperative and panchayats in the last few years. This has resulted in consolidating party functionaries at the grassroots. Panchayat plays a key role in rural development with the implementation of central and state government schemes. We were able to woo all sections of society and their support helped us win. The morale of party workers and leaders is high. In 2015 panchayat elections, Samajwadi Party won maximum seats but got decimated in 2017 assembly polls. How will you counter this? Samajwadi Party completely failed in taking its panchayat poll victory forward. This was despite the fact that SP, then led by Mulayam Singh Yadav, controlled a major part of the cooperative as well panchayat sector, besides having massive influence in rural areas. We will not commit any such mistake. We will try to make the most out of this victory as it would help us constitute a robust organisational set up at panchayat levels. I reiterate that we will have to work very hard for UP elections. During ward level elections in April, the BJP faced a tough challenge from the opposition. Still, your party managed to sweep the zila panchayat and block chairman level elections. Your comment. Since these elections are not contested on party symbols, the opposition pedalled false narrative of winning the most number of seats. SP tried to create a narrative that the atmosphere was against the BJP. Had it been true, we would not have won in SP’s strongholds like Badaun, Firozabad, Kannauj and Sambhal. How do you counter the accusation that BJP orchestrates rebellion and defection in the opposition camps to win elections? This is totally untrue and baseless. Opposition parties use this as an excuse to hide their failure. We take the collective decision of party workers into account. Our MPs and MLAs are engaged in implementing that strategy. When decisions are taken collectively, it bears positive results. Opposition parties do not take collective decisions and that is why they fail. What do you have to say on the opposition’s allegations that BJP misused government machinery during panchayat elections? This is incorrect. We work for a political mission and politics is not a business for us. We are driven by nationalist ideology and work for the service of the poor and downtrodden. What about violence which were reported from various parts of the state during the nomination process and polling? Your party leaders are being accused of attacking a senior police officer in Etawah. Law will take its own course in punishing those involved in violence. Since the chairpersons at zila panchayat and block level are BJP functionaries, don’t you think any irregularity may lead to dissatisfaction among people and affect BJP’s prospects in assembly elections? The organisation at district-level keeps a close watch on government institutions and gives inputs to the party. All complaints are addressed immediately. There will be no misuse of any institution. We have a strong law and order machinery and corrupt practices are under check. The development agenda of the Modi and Yogi governments is being scaled up. Our functionaries will ensure that government schemes reach every person. What would you say on the opposition’s claims that the BJP government failed to handle the pandemic? Our party and the state government have been serving the people since the first wave of Covid pandemic. People have appreciated it. The second wave was indeed lethal. We lost many of our near and dear ones. Bahut dukh hai us par... Even CM Yogi Adityanath tested positive. But soon after his recovery, he started working round the clock and controlled the situation. The CM largely stayed away from panchayat elections which were fought under the party's organisational leadership. But after the victory, Yogi was brought to the forefront and given credit. Was it part of a strategy? Yogiji is a prominent party leader. Just like PM Narendra Modi, whose government’s policies lead to rise in stature of BJP. PM Modi and CM Yogi always rise above casteism, regionalism and nepotism to work for the welfare of the poor. They are and will remain the face of the party in the coming polls. Can anyone doubt Yogi’s honesty? Neta ki chhavi se hi netratva aage badhta hai (the leadership is driven by the image of the leader. We are winning elections due to the leadership of Modi and Yogi and the hard work of party workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/wont-be-complacent-after-rural-poll-win-will-work-hard-for-up-elections-under-yogi/articleshow/84331510.cms||---

Amdavadis returning from their Sunday excursions were lashed by the moderate to heavy rainfall that started after 7.30pm. Major traffic jams were witnessed in several areas as some abandoned their vehicles on side of the roads to walk a few meters to get a cab or auto to get home. The rainfall continued till 10 pm. According to Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) control room, till 10pm the city had received 84.3mm rainfall, or about 3.3 inches.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Do-or-die contest for K Chandrasekhar Rao & Eatala Rajender in Huzurabad||HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is personally monitoring the election strategy for Huzurabad Assembly constituency which is likely to go to by-poll in the next few months. While internal surveys are being conducted to identify a candidate with good image and winning prospects to be fielded against former minister Eatala Rajender of BJP, the ruling TRS has planned to appoint one in-charge leader for every 50 voters in the constituency. Sources did not rule out the possibility of a Dalit candidate being finalised by the TRS boss as voters from schedule caste community, particularly Madigas, are likely to play a crucial role. There are over 45,000 voters from the Scheduled Caste Community. Of those, over 38,000 are Madigas and the remaining are Malas. Given the CM’s thrust for successful implementation of the Dalit empowerment scheme—which offers a financial assistance of Rs 10 lakh per family with an initial budget of Rs 1,200 crore being earmarked—a senior leader in TRS said the names of Dalit leaders are also under serious consideration. However, CM KCR will take the final decision based on survey and intelligence reports. Political analysts said it is a do-or-die battle for TRS president and CM KCR as he cannot afford to lose the by-poll after dropping Eatala from the cabinet on charges of land grabbing. Likewise, it is a do-or-die contest for even Eatala as winning the by-poll is crucial for him to prove that he has his own following and locus standi in political arena of Telangana, and that his previous victories in elections were not because of TRS and KCR factors alone. While Eatala’s campaigning has been going in full swing and he will soon launch his pada yatra in the Assembly segment, Telangana Congress’ new president A Revanth Reddy has been given the task of coming out with a bypoll strategy, finalising the list of contenders with winning prospects and other details of the Huzurabad constituency to the newly-appointed election management committee led by former deputy chief minister Damodar Rajanarasimha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/do-or-die-contest-for-kcr-eatala-in-huzurabad/articleshow/84331485.cms||Roushan Ali

Endowments minister Indrakaran Reddy and minister for animal husbandry Talasani Srinivas Yadav offered the first ‘Bangaru Bonam’ (golden bonam) and silk robes to Goddess Jagadambika on behalf of the state government. The ministers also took part in the ‘Thottelu’ procession, an important procession in Bonalu Jathara, starting from Langer Houz. Police made fool-proof arrangements at the fort and imposed traffic curbs on routes leading to the fort. However, devotees stood in long queues for darshan of Goddess Jagadambika, while ignoring the Covid-19 norms. Officials said that over 30,000 devotees offered bonams at the temple on Sunday. It was observed that most devotees were wearing the mask improperly despite public announcements by the temple authorities on Covid norms. Over 30,000 devotees visited the temple on Sunday and offered bonam. “Implementing Covid-19 norms was a tough task as we could not manage the huge crowd. However, most people were wearing masks,” a temple official told TOI. The Bonalu Jathara at Golconda will continue till August 8.

More than Rs 23 lakh was collected in fines from 760 offenders during the drive, held from July 5 to 10. The drive was organized in the wake of the July 1 accident in the Borghat area near Khopoli, in which three of a family, including a three-and-a-half-year-old child, were killed. Officials said such drives will be held regularly to keep traffic offences under check and to spread awareness among motorists about safe driving. “The accident prompted the transport department to launch this six-day drive on the expressway. This drive was a first of its kind and is an attempt to identify major offences and sensitize drivers,” a senior official with the transport department told TOI. “Four squads from the three RTOs were involved in the drive, conducted under the guidance of state transport commissioner Avinash Dhakane,” Atul Aade, deputy RTO and in charge of the PCMC RTO, said. Of the 760 challans issued, 533 were issued to those caught illegally cutting lanes, while 114 were issued to speeding drivers. “Lane-cutting, especially on the highways, remains a major cause for concern, and is also behind major and minor road accidents. The highest number of cases in these seven days related to lane cutting. Cases of speeding were second — this is another major worry. Speeding often leads to lane-cutting and, both combined form the perfect recipe for a major — and often fatal — road accident,” an RTO official said. On July 1, the boy and his parents were driving in a car, which collided with a loaded container truck. According to the police, the container had collided with the car on a slope, forcing the smaller vehicle to crash into a truck, killing the occupants. In the last week of May, another accident resulted in the deaths of two persons, including GST deputy commissioner Abhijeet Ghawle, near the Kamshet tunnel on the expressway. “Vehicles not equipped with reflectors is another issue — many vehicle owners were fined in this regard. Vehicles without reflectors pose a danger to themselves and other vehicles, especially in the evenings and nights. Another major issue we noticed was that many were caught driving without carrying a driving licence. Such drives will continue regularly from now and people should follow all the regulations. Some campaigns are also being planned to encourage safe driving on the highways,” a transport department official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lane-cutting-speeding-cases-high-during-weeklong-rto-check-on-eway/articleshow/84329761.cms||Joy Sengupta

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Deficient rains in Marathwada likely to hit kharif crop output||Aurangabad: After a promising start to the rainy season in early June, a dry spell of the monsoon is being observed in different parts of Marathwada now, leading to average rainfall deficiency in five out of the region’s eight districts in July. The dry spell, if it continues, could put the kharif crops in the region under stress in many areas. As per the official data, in July so far, Parbhani district has recorded the maximum rainfall deficiency (40%), followed by Jalna (22%), Hingoli (21%), Nanded (13%) and Aurangabad (2%). On the other hand, Osmanabad has received 180% of its normal rainfall in July and similar surplus showers have been reported in Latur (109%) and Beed (108%). The region has received an average of 61 mm rainfall in July so far — around 93% of the normal showers. Considering the good run of monsoon earlier in June, the progressive count of rainfall since June 1 has reached to 262 mm which is 131% of the normal rainfall. Aurangabad district’s superintending agricultural officer Tukaram Mote on Sunday said regular rainfall activity is missing during the current kharif season. “The absence of desired consistency in the pattern of rain was observed during the first month of the rainy season before necessary revival towards the end of June. The sowing of kharif crops has increased to 80% as per latest report and could go up further by the next week,” he said, adding that crops during the early stage do not require much water but can be under stress in the later stages if the monsoon plays truant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-deficient-rains-in-marathwada-likely-to-hit-kharif-crop-output/articleshow/84331667.cms||---
---||Delhi||DJB goes to SC over Delhi’s water share||NEW DELHI: Delhi Jal Board (DJB) has approached Supreme Court alleging that Haryana government has stopped water supply to the city, which has resulted in the Yamuna levels dropping to an all-time low. Delhi government, in a statement, said it had urged SC to hear the matter at the earliest. Raghav Chadha, DJB vice-chairman, on Sunday claimed that the capital’s share of water was being withheld by the neighbouring state. Later in the evening, he took to social media saying DJB had approached the apex court. “Update: DJB has just now filed the petition in Hon’ble SC seeking discharge of Delhi’s legitimate share of water by Haryana which was decided by SC itself in 1995-96. Tough times in Delhi because Haryana has withheld Delhi’s water in an outright contempt of SC’s existing order,” he tweeted. Chadha said, “I’m deeply saddened to inform you that the water level of the Yamuna has come down from 674.5 feet to 667 feet, that is, the river has completely dried up. Haryana is not releasing water and has stalled the rightful portion of water of Delhi.” Due to shortage of water, the capacity of Chandrawal water treatment plant (WTP) has come down from 90 million gallons per day (MGD) to 55, at Wazirabad WTP from 135 MGD to 80 and at Okhla plant from 20 MGD to 12. “Delhi is a landlocked state and does not have any waterbody. It has always been dependent on neighbouring states to fulfill its water needs. Supreme Court has issued directions regarding this to Uttar Pradesh and Haryana and these have been signed and agreed upon by the state governments. There is zero cusecs release of raw water in the Yamuna by Haryana,” added Chadha. In 1995, Supreme Court had decided that Haryana had to give a certain amount of water to Delhi every day. “Today, Haryana government is flouting the SC’s orders. Haryana is not giving 120 MGD to Delhi. Many big areas in the capital, including Supreme Court, the high court, Prime Minister’s residence, Rashtrapati Bhavan, embassies and central, south and east Delhi have been affected,” Chadha said. “In a way, water supply in the entire Delhi has been affected. The maximum water comes in the Yamuna from Haryana. Due to non-availability of water, the capacity of our WTPs has decreased by 40%-50%. We are not asking for any donation or begging. According to the standards set by Supreme Court, we should get this water,” Chadha added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/djb-goes-to-sc-over-delhis-water-share/articleshow/84327787.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Sadar Bazar stretch closed till Tuesday for violations||NEW DELHI: Another prominent market in the city is facing action for violation of Covid norms after the district administration decided to close down a part of main Sadar Bazar market — Bara Tooti Chowk to Qutub Road — from 10pm on July 10 till July 13, 10pm. However, traders’ associations are unhappy with the decision, saying that in spite of repeated requests, the administration is not calling a joint meeting with all departments concerned and market associations to understand the reasons behind violations and find concrete solutions. “We spoke to the SDM on Saunday too and said that unless a joint meeting is called, it will be difficult to find a genuine solution,” said Rakesh Yadav, president of Federation of Sadar Bazar Traders. “Shutting the shops causes huge losses to general traders who are anyway not responsible for managing crowds on roads.” The order by SDM Kotwali stated the market was being closed due to heavy footfall and lack of social distancing in the area. “It is necessary to take an immediate and stringent action to curtail the spreading of the virus and not to develop any public place as a super spreader. The market from Bar Tooti Chowk to Qutub Road is hereby restricted to open till July 13,” stated the order. Traders of Sadar Bazar claimed that they have formed a team of 21 members to check that Covid norms are adhered to by the shopkeepers thoroughly. “They are communicating with shopkeepers individually or through public address systems,” said Rajendra Sharma, general secretary of federation. Earlier, Gaffar Market, Laxmi Nagar, 12 shops at Gandhi Nagar, Nangloi, Rui Market and Lajpat Nagar market faced closure for Covid violations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sadar-bazar-stretch-closed-till-tuesday-for-violations/articleshow/84329812.cms||Vibha Sharma

The decision comes after the company, which is providing technical support to Cv200 series ventilators, wrote to the MD of NHM Jharkhand (Umashankar Singh) to direct all the complaints to them so that they could address them at the earliest. The Cv200 series ventilators have been manufactured by the PSU, Bharat Electricals Limited, and has been distributed by the Centre to various states. According to state health department records, a total of 225 ventilators have been made available to Jharkhand from the Centre, of which 200 are functional and 25 are defunct. These ventilators have been provided to various districts as well as medical colleges across the state. Singh has directed all civil surgeons, chief medical officers and the medical superintendent at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, Ranchi to register the complaint of faulty ventilators with the right tech support so that it could be made functional at the earliest. On being contacted, Singh said: “We have received more than 250 ventilators from the Government of India and we are trying to ensure that all such ventilators are in ready-to-use condition. I have directed all the civil surgeons to provide the service providers with the make of the ventilators, along with place and contact person, so that it could be attended to at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/health-dept-seeks-report-on-ventilators/articleshow/84328027.cms||---
---||Ranchi||As cases rise, East Singhbhum frets over porous Jharkhand borders||JAMSHEDPUR: The rise in Covid-19 cases in the eight rural blocks in the district close to the Bengal and Odisha borders have forced officials to draw up a fresh blueprint to contain the virus. Along with increasing checking at the 14 inter-state check points, porous areas near the borders are being identified to keep an eye on the movement of villagers from adjoining states. “Active cases are being reported regularly from the rural blocks. Hence we are trying to detect suspected Covid-19 carriers coming to the district from outside,” additional chief medical officer (ACMO) Sahir Pall said. The official said tracking and testing followed by treatment would be increased in the villages near the interstate border spanning the eight rural blocks of Baharagora, Chakulia, Patamda, Potka, Dhalbhumgarh, Dumaria, Ghatshila and Musaboni. Since the start of the pandemic last year, Ghatshila has reported 1,563 cases while Musaboni registered 1,507 cases and Potka 994 cases. Whereas Chakulia reported 929 cases, Patamda (854), Baharagora (811), Dhalbhumgarh (724) and Dumaria (677). Notably, 43% of the cases in the East Singhbhum district were reported from the rural blocks in the first 10 days of July. Official data suggest that out of the 119 Covid cases reported in the district between 1-10 July, the share of the rural blocks is 52. “There’s no report of outstation visitors testing positive in the past 20 days. Hence we are focusing on tracking and testing in the villages to identify local cases,” the ACMO added. He informed that the urban circle of the district, comprising the three municipal bodies of Jamshedpur, Mango and Jugsalai, has seen a rapid decline in active cases. Of the total 51,681 Covid-19 cases reported in the district till Saturday, the urban circle contributed 43,622 cases while rural areas reported 8,059 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/as-cases-rise-east-singhbhum-frets-over-porous-state-borders/articleshow/84328198.cms||B Sridhar

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand to experience scattered rains: IMD||RANCHI: Jharkhand will receive scattered rains in the next four days, the Ranchi office of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Sunday. “A low pressure system has developed over west-central and north-east Bay of Bengal. This has changed the wind pattern of Jharkhand to south-easterlies, which is in turn bringing moisture into the state’s atmosphere from the Bay of Bengal,” Satish Chandra Mandal, a weather scientist at IMD Ranchi, said. “Due to this, the state will receive scattered rainfall in the next four days,” he added. The IMD Ranchi said the intensity of rains over Jharkhand is likely to increase from July 16 onwards owing to the shifting of the trough of monsoon over the state. As on Sunday, the trough ran from west Rajasthan to south Chhattisgarh and onwards to north coastal Andhra Pradesh. The state had received 344mm rain since June 1. As many as 12 out of 24 districts have received surplus rains. Lohardaga received 91mm excess rain, the highest in the state. As many as four districts — Chatra, Gumla, Seraikela-Kharsawan and West Singhbhum — are rainfall deficient, of which Gumla with 28% negative departure is the poorest in terms of rainfall reception. Meanwhile, Ranchi remained overcast since Sunday morning. As per the rainfall data of IMD, the state capital received 5.2mm till Sunday evening. Jamshedpur received 52mm rain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-to-experience-scattered-rains-imd/articleshow/84328247.cms||---

However, all the customary rituals will be held behind closed doors on Monday, they added. “The temple management committee has been informed by the officials of Ranchi administration that the government has denied permission for taking out the processions. Hence, there will be no procession this year,” Pandit Rameshwar Padi, a senior priest at the Jagannathpur temple in Ranchi’s Dhurwa, told TOI on Sunday. Likewise, the Rath Yatra processions, which are taken out every year from Ratu Palace, will also remain suspended. “Priests and family members will attend the special Puja that will be held behind closed doors in the Ratu Palace,” Damodar Mishra, the palace priest, said. The Rath Yatra processions patronized by Ratu Palace is over 300 years old. Founded in 1691 by local Nagvanshi ruler Raja Thakur Ani Nath Shahdeo, the Jagannathpur temple atop a hillock was built as a splitting image of the Jagannath temple in Puri. Rath Yatra processions were an annual affair since then until last year, when the Covid-19 induced restrictions prevented the chariots of the temple’s resident deities — Lord Jagannath, Lord Balram and Goddess Subhadra — from rolling for the first time in the temple’s 329-year-old history. The procession is taken to Ma Mausi Bari temple two kilometers away. The deities return to the temple after nine days. The temple committee had moved Jharkhand high court and pleaded that the processions be allowed last week. The court, however, said it was the decision of the state government whether to allow the processions. The procession attracts lakhs of devotees from Ranchi and its neighboring districts each year. “Keeping the Covid-19 situation in mind, permission has been denied to the organizers of Rath Yatra processions,” Vinay Kumar Choubey, the principal secretary to chief minister Hemant Soren, said. Ranchi deputy commissioner Chhavi Ranjan did not respond when contacted to know the preparations being made to avert a gathering. The priests of Baidyanath Dham temple in Deoghar had met Soren last week and urged him to allow the organizing of Shravani Mela, which is due to commence later this month. “We are yet to decide on it,” Choubey added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rath-yatra-processions-suspended-in-capital-city-for-second-successive-year/articleshow/84327827.cms||Dhritiman Ray

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Asurs hesitant to take jabs in Gumla, administration plans special camps||GUMLA: A Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) at Bishunpur block in Gumla district – the Asur tribe – is hesitant to take the jab despite the authorities taking great pains to encourage them to get vaccinated. “So far, 31,829 persons in the 18 + group have been vaccinated against the target of 72,522 in the Asur tribe,” Bishunpur BDO Chanda Bhattacharya said. Polpat Pat, Kujjam, Sakhuwapani and Amtipani, located in Gurdari and Amptipani panchayats of Bishunpur block which form a major part of Netarhat plateau, are the four main habitations of the Asur tribe. The president of Yuva Jagriti Abhiyan, Polpolpat Vimal Chandra Asur, said that the Asur tribe has a population of 22,000 which is spread across Bishunpur, Chainpur, Ghaghra and Dumri blocks in the district and none of the members have tested positive for Covid-19 so far. He, however, said that fellow tribesmen have started taking the shot as they are motivating them for the same. A local source said, “Only those tribes who work in Hindalco have taken vaccine shots as the company has made it mandatory for its workers to take the shot. Those working in government jobs have also taken the vaccine.” Bhattacharya said, “We had organised a vaccination camp at Hindalco office campus in the last week of May and only 65 persons took the jab.” Besides the Asur tribe, Birjiya is another PVTG in Gumla which has shown hesitancy in taking the vaccine. In Ambakona and Ramjharia villages of Gurdari panchayat, the Munda and Oraon tribes are also unwilling to take the vaccine. Bishunpur CHC’s head Dr Ashutosh Singh said, “Health staff members and local social activists have been engaged to motivate people in remote areas to take the jab.” Bhattacharya said that they have a special plan to hold mega vaccination camps in that area as soon as they receive the fresh stock of vaccines. Meanwhile, the residents of Hisir village under Serka panchayat in the same block have shown great enthusiasm in taking the jab. “Over 90 % of the eligible residents have been inoculated,” Singh said, adding that the unavailability of vaccines has slowed down the pace at the moment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/asurs-hesitant-to-take-jabs-admin-plans-special-camps/articleshow/84327899.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Black fungus patient dies of ‘medical negligence’ at Rims||RANCHI: The 45-year-old mucormycosis patient, Usha Devi, who was operated at Rims on July 8 after the intervention of the Jharkhand high court, passed away on Sunday morning. After the news of Devi’s death broke, her relatives alleged negligence on the part of the hospital authorities, complaining that she had to wait for more than 50 days for her surgery. Devi’s son, Gaurav Gupta, has demanded an enquiry alleging that his mother would have been alive had the surgery been conducted earlier. Gaurav has filed a police complaint at Bariatu police station demanding action against 11 doctors, including Rims director Dr Kameshwar Prasad and medical superintendent Dr Vivek Kashyap, for ‘medical negligence’. Gaurav said: “I submitted applications to hospital superintendent Dr Vivek Kashyap twice, requesting him to arrange for my mother’s surgery but he didn’t take any action. The doctors had also cancelled the surgery of my mother twice in the last one month on one pretext or the other. I demand a thorough enquiry into my mother’s treatment at Rims,” Gupta said. ENT specialist and surgeon Dr Abhishek Kumar Ramadhin, who has been treating patients of mucormycosis, said: “Black fungus cannot be cured with just medicines and surgery has to be conducted for the removal of fungal load from the infected parts. I have treated 29 mucormycosis patients so far and I have operated all of them because medicines cannot help in eliminating the infection load and if it continues to grow it could prove fatal for the patient.” Speaking on Usha Devi’s case, Dr Ramadhin said that not conducting surgery on a confirmed mucormycosis patient was equivalent to not treating the patient. Soon after Devi’s death on Sunday morning, Rims authorities deployed security forces on the fifth floor ICU of the super-speciality block. An anti-riot vehicle was also spotted outside the building. When contacted, Rims PRO Dr D K Sinha said: “Police have been deployed based on inputs received by the hospital administration.” On being asked why Usha Devi’s scheduled surgeries were postponed on two occasions, Dr Sinha said: “I do not know the exact reasons behind the postponements, but the director had given a piece of his mind to the team that was tasked to look after the black fungus patient. Dr Prasad had also taken the nodal officer to task for failure in conducting the surgeries of black fungus patients.” Meanwhile, doctors treating Devi said she developed septicaemia post-surgery and that led to her death. “There was excessive bleeding from the portions near her left eye, which was removed during surgery. Her blood pressure level also reduced drastically. The patient had developed infection and she died due to septicaemia,” Dr Chandrakanti Birua, the nodal officer for mucormycosis at Rims, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/black-fungus-patient-dies-of-medical-negligence-at-rims/articleshow/84327675.cms||Gaurav Pandey

JMM central general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said that the state government had to move the Jharkhand high court seeking a direction for the start of OPD operations as the Centre was delaying the inauguration. Bhattacharya said: “Marandi contested and won election against the BJP and later joined the party. At least, now he should do justice to his electors by speaking in favour of them, instead of the party that he has joined.” He added, “The first date for the inauguration was set on June 11 and later it was rescheduled to June 26, but the Union health minister refused to inaugurate it. Maybe, the former Union health minister was removed for negligence, but even the new health minister has done nothing to ensure that the hospital was available to people during the pandemic.” “Under relevant sections of the Constitution and AIIMS Act, 1956 (amended in 2012), we have filed a case against the secretary of the Union health department, mission director of Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana, director of AIIMS, executive director of AIIMS, Deoghar and the registrar of AIIMS, Deoghar seeking a direction to them for operationalizing the OPD,” he said. Bhattacharya also sought a reply from the BJP for allegedly delaying the inauguration of the Deoghar airport. “We know the approach road is yet to be completed, which can be done within two days and we have been demanding operationalization of the airport ahead of the holy month of Shravan, when devotees come to offer prayers at the Babadham temple in Deoghar,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jmm-attacks-bjp-over-delay-in-aiims-deoghar-inauguration/articleshow/84327959.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The subsidy will be capped at Rs 25 crore annually. As per the draft scheme for promotion of electric vehicles in the state, every year for the next five years, subsidy will be given to 10,000 two wheelers not exceeding Rs 10 crore per year, 500 three wheelers not exceeding Rs 1crore and around 500 four wheelers not exceeding Rs 14 crore. The subsidy will be given on a first come first serve basis, a senior official said. The subsidy will be disbursed in a single instalment that is 100% on purchase of the vehicle and production of documents of purchase — RC book and insurance. Goa has a vehicle density of 625 vehicles for every 100 people and is ranked fifteenth in the world in terms of vehicle density. “Adopting the use of electric vehicles for daily commute is required to achieve various goals, including improvement in air quality, reduction in noise levels and reduction in generation of greenhouse gas emissions,” the official said. The scheme is also aimed at achieving the targets set by the Center, under the National Electric Mobility Plan (NEMPP), to have six to seven million electric and hybrid vehicles on Indian roads by 2020, the official said. With prices of electric vehicles about 50% higher than that of the conventional internal combustion vehicles, targets have not been achieved. “For this purpose, the department of new and renewable energy has entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Convergence Energy Services Ltd, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy Efficiency Services Ltd, under the administration of the Union ministry of power,” the official said. The Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles scheme was launched by the Centre to save 120 million barrels of oil and four million tonnes of carbon dioxide as well as lowering vehicular emissions by 1.3% in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-to-subsidise-11k-electric-vehicles-annually-for-5-years/articleshow/84327895.cms||---

In his weekly column ‘Rokhthok’ in the party mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, Raut wondered whether India’s foundation was so weak that an 84-year-old man could wage a war against it, and said being critical of an incumbent government doesn’t mean being against the country. Swamy, 84, possibly the oldest person to be accused of terrorism in India, died in a Mumbai hospital recently in the middle of his fight for bail on health grounds. “A government that is scared of an 84-year-old physically challenged man is dictatorial in character, but weak in the mind,” said Raut. The activities of the Elgar Parishad can’t be supported, but what happened later should be called a “conspiracy of cracking down on freedom”, Raut said, referring to the arrest of activists like Varavara Rao, Sudha Bharadwaj, Gaurav Navlakha and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/stan-swamys-death-in-custody-cant-be-justified-sanjay-raut/articleshow/84332926.cms||---
---||Goa||South Goa’s primary health centres to cater to Covid kids||Panaji: South Goa plans to use health centres as Covid care centres for children during the expected third wave. Covid positive children who are asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic but cannot isolate at home due to various reasons, including not meeting the criteria, will be accommodated at primary and community health centres, a health official said. Training for staff at these health centres has been completed. Children up to the age of 18 with up to mild symptoms, who have no place to isolate, will be admitted at along with a parent as caretaker. These centres will essentially serve as Covid care centres for children. Paediatricians will provide teleconsultation and visit the children once a week. Several private paediatricians have also volunteered to assist the government by offering their services. The South Goa district hospital’s second floor lobby has been converted into a paediatric casualty where children won’t have to queue up along with other people. Doctors in casualty will assess children and decide whether they can be managed at the periphery (mild cases), admitted at the South Goa district hospital (moderate cases) or will be sent for onward referral to GMC (serious cases). Doctors however are expecting that most children to be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and have asked parents not to panic. “We know children generally don’t suffer severe disease, most are mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic but parents need to be aware of the danger signs because children can’t express their symptoms. But at the same time they neither have vaccine-induced immunity or natural immunity as they have been kept indoors,” the official added. During the 4th expert committee meeting for the anticipated third wave of Covid, member secretary and professor of preventive and social medicine, Dr Jagadish Kakodkar suggested that the committee develop and issue simple health education messages to parents regarding prevention of Covid and management of mild Covid in children in home isolation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/south-goas-primary-health-centres-to-cater-to-covid-kids/articleshow/84328072.cms||---

This is contrary to the trend seen over the past weeks where case positivity rate was higher in South Goa. In North Goa, 60% of cases were detected via the Rapid Antigen Testing (RAT) while in South Goa 76% were detected via RAT and the rest by RT-PCR. Sunday’s mortality bulletin reported two deaths—two men aged 66 and 76. Both passed away after 12 days of hospitalisation. The 66-year-old with diabetes from Canacona died at South Goa district hospital of bilateral Covid-19 pneumonia and had symptoms four days prior to admission. The 76-year-old from Candolim who died at GMC had heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Another 131 new infections were reported over the past 24 hours where 32 patients required hospitalisation and 99 were put on home isolation. Active cases dropped to 1,848 were 19 patients were discharged and 241 recovered. The recovery rate stands at 97.07%. Cortalim has the most detected active cases at 128 while Margao and Ponda also have over 100 cases with 107 and 102, respectively.

Goa Board chairman Bhagirath Shetye said that students will be able to enter their seat numbers on a link given on the board’s website and get their marksheets. Due to the pandemic, the state government had cancelled the Class X public examination. The results this year have been prepared by the results committee formed by individual schools, which have then been submitted to the Board for declaration of results. Shetye said that the results are being declared for 23,967 students in the regular category and 517 repeaters. “For the first time, there are more boys than girls for whom Class X results will be declared. Results are being declared for 13,011 boys as against 10,956 girls,” Shetye said. With the public exam cancelled, the Board had announced a scheme for tabulation of results based on internal marks. The assessment will be carried out giving weightage to students’ performance at the first and second formative exams conducted by schools during the academic year 2020-21. Some weightage will also go to preliminary or any other term-end test conducted by the school, besides weightage to Class IX performance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-board-to-declare-class-x-results-today/articleshow/84328150.cms||---

Police intervened to separate AAP volunteers and D’Sa’s supporters, who clashed once again, and restored order. Anticipating a face-off between the two groups once again on Sunday, a large posse of policemen was deployed near D’Sa’s house. When AAP protestors, led by the party’s state convenor Rahul Mhambre and Pratima Coutinho, were stopped at a distance from D’Sa’s house by police who declined their request to allow their delegation to meet D’Sa, they began shouting slogans against the Nuvem MLA and attempted to burn his effigy. This enraged D’Sa’s supporters, who also came out in large numbers and confronted AAP volunteers. Police prevented AAP volunteers from burning the effigy and forced them to retreat. AAP slammed the state government with Mhambre accusing police of turning a blind eye to provocations by D’Sa’s supporters. “The MLA’s goons flung things at AAP volunteers under complete police protection,” Mhambre said even as Coutinho termed it as “nothing but state-sponsored dadagiri.” D’Sa dismissed the incident as a “political stunt” by Coutinho. “I joined BJP for development of my constituency. People of Nuvem are with me,” he said. Joint mamlatdar Rosario Carvalho later lodged a complaint with Maina Curtorim police against Coutinho and other AAP volunteers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-volunteers-and-dsas-supporters-clash-once-again/articleshow/84328258.cms||---

Fire officials said that the fire broke out after a blast due to some chemical reactions in the unit. Post the blast, flames engulfed the entire unit within a short time. “The thick cloud of smoke billowing from the fire was visible from several kilometres away. Besides the fire tenders of Panoli and neighbouring companies, fire teams from Ankleshwar and Disaster Prevention and Management Centre were also pressed into action,” a fire official said. “There was a stock of isopropyl alcohol in the unit due to which the entire unit caught fire. It took several hours to douse the fire. Later, we undertook salvaging activities to cool down the structure,” he added. No casualties or injuries were reported in the incident as the employees had rushed out in time. Earlier too, several big fires have broken out in the industrial estates of Bharuch district, raising questions of fire safety measures by units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/massive-fire-in-pharma-unit-in-bharuch/articleshow/84325835.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Bad infrastructure along Guirim-Karaswada road causes confusion, puts motorists at risk||GUIRIM: The ongoing expansion of the NH 66 in Goa continues to contribute to commuters’ woes as they are forced to navigate constricted roads and dodge gaping potholes amid inadequate illumination and traffic signage. The risk, they say, increases at the Guirim (Green Park) and Karaswada junctions in Bardez, where the absence of road dividers and clear signage confuses many motorists, even those who use the route regularly. Local bus driver Namdev Pednekar says the mid-day traffic rush is particularly hassling. “At some places, the service roads or exits are not clearly indicated, so many vehicles mistakenly go into the path of oncoming traffic. The narrow Karaswada stretch is extremely inconvenient to travel on as it is used as a two-way road by trucks and cars. The road can hardly accommodate one-way traffic as it is,” he said. On July 2, 2021, TOI had frontpaged a report about how widening and digging work by government agencies had caused similar navigation issues and damage to roads at the busy Chimbel junction along the Kadamba Plateau bypass road and at the Merces junction. Problems at the Guirim and Karaswada junctions escalate post-sundown as the lack of illumination makes it difficult to spot stray cattle on the roads. Motorists, especially two-wheeler riders, also complain of being unable to spot deep potholes when they get filled with rainwater. Then there is also the issue of a lack of barricades along some elevated surfaces. “Those travelling from the Guirim cross towards Karaswada run the risk of veering to the extreme left of the elevated road that has no railings to protect vehicles from falling off,” says regular commuter, Dionne Desouza. The junction connecting to Bastora features similar issues, including an extremely narrow bridge that often floods when it rains. Both sides of the junction have been a cause for traffic congestion issues due to its narrow roads. The service road from Acoi to Bastora, near the traffic lights, is also in bad shape. It is narrow and vehicles sometimes tend to come onto a one-way stretch due to lack of clear signage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bad-infrastructure-along-guirim-karaswada-road-causes-confusion-puts-motorists-at-risk/articleshow/84328306.cms||---

A large number of Congress workers, at a meeting of the Calangute Congress block committee on Saturday, said that they would work for the party candidate provided the candidate is a long-standing party member from Calangute constituency. “We will work our hearts out if any loyal party worker is given Congress ticket in Calangute, but if the party tries to import a candidate from another party, then we will have to think about it,” party general secretary and former MLA Agnelo Fernandes said. State Congress president Girish Chodankar, who was also at the meeting, said the party will take a decision on the candidate once Calangute Congress block committee gives its recommendation and the screening committee will take the final call.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/calangute-cong-says-no-ticket-to-imports/articleshow/84328343.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||India||Yogi Adityanath inaugurates ‘inclusive’ policy to cut population growth||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said high population can be a deterrent to the development goals of any state or country. Speaking at the launch of Draft Population Policy 2021-30 on the occasion of World Population Day, Yogi maintained that the new policy, which entails various aspects of a person from birth to old age, takes every community into account. “High population is connected with poverty, therefore, the issue requires awareness among targeted people,” he said, adding that the issue was also related to sustainable development goals set by the United Nations till 2030. “Steps will have to be taken by UP which is India’s most populous state,” he said. The policy aims to bring down the reproductive rate to 2.1% by 2026 and to 1.9% by 2030. The CM, who initiated a population stability fortnight programme beginning Sunday, said there should be adequate gap between two children to control population. He said the aim of the policy is not restricted to stabilising the population but also to bring prosperity in the lives of the people. “The state also needs to take steps to bring down Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR). We will ensure that population control measures do not have an adverse impact on any community. We need to take every community along. The health of mother and child should also be taken into account,” he said. Yogi underscored the need for steps to bring people closer to schemes initiated by the Centre which aim to benefit various communities. Maintaining that the issue of population control was not just associated with the health and family welfare department, the CM stressed on inter-departmental coordination for better results. “Departments like women and child welfare and education will have to step in and make concerted efforts to control the population. It was this inter-departmental coordination which helped the state government in controlling not only the deadly Japanese encephalitis but also the coronavirus pandemic,” he said. Meanwhile, the CM also inaugurated 11 laboratories for RT-PCR testing. He said the state government had taken a giant leap in coronavirus testing capacity from zero to four lakh per day, within the last 16 months. Now, the state has RT-PCR test labs in 40 districts. In other districts, tests are being conducted at medical colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/yogi-adityanath-inaugurates-inclusive-policy-to-cut-population-growth/articleshow/84332981.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Missing in first wave, NMC adopts tech in second and vaccination drive||In the concluding part of the series on Smart City, TOI checks whether Nagpur Municipal Corporation came up with innovative solutions for Covid-19 management and what are its plans for the projected third waveNAGPUR: Despite being chosen to be developed as a Smart City and availability of technology that could have greatly helped during the pandemic, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and special purpose vehicle — Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) — have largely failed in disease management and vaccination through smart ways. The NMC miserably failed to launch even a single smart system during the first wave. Making amends, it came up with a few smart solutions in the second wave while some are in the pipeline. After citizens struggled to find beds, especially during the peak of first wave in August and September last year and initial days of peak of second wave in March this year, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B and CEO of NSSCDCL Bhuvaneshwari S and their team developed a portal https://nsscdcl.org/covidbeds to provide real-time information on bed availability. The portal came as a major relief in April. Admitting that NMC didn’t use smart interventions in Covid management in the first wave, Radhakrishnan told TOI that the portal proved beneficial for not only patients of the district but also other parts of Vidarbha. “It is going to benefit a lot in the projected third wave,” he said. The NMC fell short in ensuring admissions in Covid hospitals only through this portal and NMC Control Room. As per NMC officials, a large number of patients got beds through the system. “But it couldn’t be made mandatory as it was causing inconvenience in emergency cases while some citizens gt direct admissions through good contacts with hospitals or doctors etc,” they said. In March, the civic chief proposed an initiative to identify positive patients roaming in public through facial recognition from images taken by 3,700 CCTVs installed in different parts of the city. The private agency concerned couldn’t launch the project, said Radhakrishnan adding that facial recognition would have helped a lot in monitoring home isolation. “Still, we are working on this project,” he said. On the paediatric Covid hospital, the civic chief said it will start soon. “Plan is to allow parents to see paediatric patients live from an arena at the hospital or online from their home or workplace once or twice in a day,” he said. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi, in association with disaster risk governance specialist, Amit Tandon, and public health expert, Dr Shailaja Gaikwad from Unicef and RedR, have made available online link through which any organization or housing society can apply for Covid-19 tests at their locality. The same system was introduced for vaccination of students going abroad for studies. According to civic chief, similar systems are in the pipeline for 100% vaccination of 45-plus citizens and those in vulnerable groups. Managing director of Vidarbha Infotech Private Ltd Prashant Ugemuge suggested proper data of infection sources be maintained. “Then, it will be easy to monitor and keep cases low by tracking and isolating patients and contacts. Similarly, we can keep track on localities with high cases,” he said. Shortage of oxygen was a big issue during peak of second wave. “A portal can be launched in which those having oxygen concentrators or jumbo cylinders or related systems can display real-time availability. The same can be done in management of medicines and injections,” said Ugemuge. Activist Narayan Ahuja pointed to NMC failure in giving test results on mail or message or portal. “People are forced to visit the centre for report which is not only inconvenient but also creates risk of spread. Technology can help track contacts and ensure their testing but nothing was done. It can be also used in ambulances management,” he said and added that system should be introduced to display real-time availability of vaccine at all centres.

Research on treatment protocol, clinical as well as diagnostic aspects, is going on in full swing across the world and papers, surveys and documentary evidences are available about what is a better treatment for Covid-19 and what is to be avoided. Doctors are now more confident about handling the third wave, in case it hits anytime in the next three months. According to Dr Nirmal Jaiswal, who heads Wockhardt Covid Hospital, they are better prepared clinically now. "We have learned a lot during second wave. Now, we now know it better whether a drug is to be given or not to a particular patient. Now, judicial use of steroids, cocktail antibodies and other drugs is well-known. New therapies are already here. I am sure doctors are now more confident of handling the disease," said Dr Jaiswal. In government hospitals, experience plays the most important role. "We have trained manpower at this point of time. Doctors as well as health workers in government Covid hospitals are trained to handle any tough situation. The clinical protocol is clear and everyone understands the job well," said Dr Avinash Gawande, medical superintendent of Government Medical College and Hospital. A large number of health workers are now vaccinated. This will ensure their protection for severe disease in case they get infected. Doctors who keep eye on international developments said the extensive research and evidence-based studies have given clear understanding of the pandemic. Dr Nitin Shinde, infectious disease specialist from Alexis hospital, said they are clinically ready to handle another wave. "Our human resources are ready and protocol clear. Results of recovery trials have evidence-based information about steroids, monoclonal antibodies, oxygen and prone positioning etc. It will help us a lot during the third wave, in case it comes," he said. Many doctors said that they are more worried about the supply of medicines and drugs. "Better clinical preparedness is our plus point during probable third wave. But, we must insure proper supply chain of medicines. During second wave, the situation worsened because we were not getting medicines and injections at the right time," said Dr Darshan Vinkare, physician. Pulmonologist Dr Rajesh Swarnakar said that doctors now have better undertsanding of the oxygen requirement. "We have strengthened our strategy to fight the pandemic. Most importantly, we have the vaccine, which is absolutely important. Many who have been vaccinated may not require hospitalization or oxygen in the third wave," said Dr Swarnakar. Intensive care specialists have been accused of uncontrolled use of steroids during the second wave. The doctors say now they know the side-effects well. "Be it mucormycosis or AVN, we are aware about the side-effects of Covid-19 medication and how to avoid them. In case of third wave, judicial use of steroids will avoid complications after recovery," said a senior intensive care specialist.

Linde Engineering India Private Limited has given a letter of intent to MSU to participate in the building construction. The university is proposing to construct the ground plus 10 floors-high building at the current location of chief warden’s office, which is close to the existing halls of residence (girls campus). This building will be probably the tallest that will come up on the university campus. “Linde has given us the letter of intent to contribute in the project as part of its CSR activities. The contribution will be Rs 3.75 crore for construction of three floors,” MSU vice-chancellor professor Parimal Vyas said. The university has formed a committee to draw out and recommend a firm plan for the project. “This is the highest ever contribution that we will be receiving from a firm from its CSR funds,” he said. The committee will also look into feasibility of constructing additional floors at the existing boys hostel campus of the Halls of Residence. The allocation of CSR fund for the project will be contributed in one or two years after requisite approval of the Linde’s Board. Based on a firm plan that the university will submit and approval from its board, Linde will enter into an MoU with the varsity for the proposed project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/linde-to-support-msu-with-over-rs-3-crore-for-girls-hostel/articleshow/84325199.cms||---

At Dhanaula village in Punjab’s Barnala district, they accused BJP’s Harjit Singh Grewal of abusing some of them and then accused legislator Pyarelal and his BJP workers of trying to disrupt a protest at Ganganagar against Suratgarh MLA Rampratap Kasniyan, whom as well they accuse of using foul words for the farmers.  The rear windshield of Haryana legislative assembly deputy speaker Ranbir Gangwa's car was broken in stone pelting by protesters in Sirsa on SundayThe morcha accused BJP MLA Vinita Ahuja of provoking farmers and threatened to take the protest to her constituency next. At Fatehabad in Haryana, they waved black flags at Sirsa BJP MP Sunita Duggal when she came over for a meeting. The Progressive Farmers’ Front pitched its flag in Kargil and Ladakh. A contingent from Sonipat reached Delhi’s Ghazipur border protest site that the BJP is accused of attacking a few days ago. BJP’s Bhupesh Aggarwal being chased away by farm activists in RajpuraFarmer Sohan Singh, 46, of BKU (Lakhowal) and Kaunke Kalan in Ludhiana was electrocuted on Delhi’s Singhu border protest site on Saturday night, leaving behind a mother, wife, three daughters, and a son. In Haryana’s Panipat, BKU (Charuni) targeted BJP state in-charge Vinod Tawde, education minister Kanwar Pal Gujjar, and Karnal MP Sanjay Bhatia, who had come to their executive workers’ meeting at a college. Police presence gave them away. Farmer union district president Sudhir Jakhar was among those detained for a while. Education minister Gujjar said these protesters were not farmers. In Sirsa, three cops and three protesters were injured when the farmers stormed the BJP’s district executive meeting and pelted the deputy speaker’s car with stones. The auditorium of Sirsa’s Chaudhary Devi Lal University was barricaded heavily but the farmers broke through. Caught and let off after the programme, they protested against deputy speaker Ranbir Gangwa and MP Sunita Duggal. They broke more police barricades to barge into a similar BJP meeting of cooperation minister Banwari Lal in Fatehabad. The cops acted with restraint. Haryana Kisan Manch state president Prahlad Singh Bharukhera said: "Unless the Centre repeals its agri-marketing laws and guarantees minimum support price (MSP), we will not end our agitation." Haryana Kisan Sabha district general secretary Roshan Suchan said the BJP was using the closed schools and colleges as its district offices. On January 9, at the Aryanagar village of the in-laws of deputy speaker Ranbir Gangwa, the rear glass of his car was smashed and his gunman, Sandeep, was injured. In Hisar, the farmers forced BJP’s Hansi MLA, Vinod Bhayana, to apologise for the alleged obscene gestures of one of his staffers at a woman protester from inside the car. The farmers had jammed the Hisar road and Ramayan toll plaza and cordoned the MLA’s house in Hansi. Police had to save him. The MLA said there had been no obscene gesture and that he never lied. Kisan Sabha district president Shamsher Singh Numberdar said the farmers will target former minister Manish Grover next, for it was his car. At Ambala’s Tepla village on the Jagadhri road, farmers of the BKU (Charuni) were booked for storming into a BJP meeting. They blocked the Saha national highway 444-A for some time. They had gathered for Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar but instead found BJP’s Yamunanagar MLA, Ghanshyam Dass Arora, state general secretary Vedpal, and Ambala district president Rajesh Batoura. Ambala Cantonment DSP Ram Kumar said: "We booked 15 protesters for damaging public property and blocking the highway." BKU Haryana (Charuni) district president Malkiat Singh Sahipura said: "Every BJP leader will be opposed. Doesn’t matter if it isn’t the CM. How long can they use police, will they also take the cops along during elections?" In Jagadhri, 13 farmers were booked for protesting against Haryana transport minister Mool Chand Sharma, attacking the cops, trying to run them over with tractors, and damaging public property. Education minister Kanwar Pal and Yamunanagar MLA Ghanshyam Dass Arora were also targeted by the Charuni and Rakesh Tikait groups, and the CPM (Communist Party of India, Marxist).

As soon as any OPD patient comes for check-up, RTPCR test is done. “We do not wait for the report to see the patient. Results are sent as text messages on the registered mobile. If someone is tested positive, the laboratory report is shared, else the person is informed about the negative result without the report,” said a doctor at Government Multi-specialty Hospital, Sector 16. The PGI, however, does not conduct RT-PCR tests on all visitors. “We ask them symptoms and travel history and where the need is felt, the rapid antigen test (RAT) is conducted. There are many patients coming to the hospital and it will add to the queue if we test all,” said a faculty member in PGI. The health department had observed that infection surge in the city was accompanied by a proportionate rise in infection rate among pregnant women. “We have to monitor positivity rate with such testing to prevent a third wave,” said the DHS. Positivity rate in the city since a week is 0.65% while the tests conducted in a day are around 1,600. Recovery rate is 98.5% in Chandigarh. The national positivity rate is 2.3%, while the recovery is 97%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hospitals-testing-opd-visitors-to-watch-out-for-another-surge-in-chandigarh/articleshow/84333107.cms||Shimona Kanwar

---||Lucknow||High population hinders development, steps must to bring IMR down: Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said high population can be a deterrent to the development goals of any state and country. Speaking at the launch of Draft Population Policy 2021-30 on the occasion of World Population Day, Yogi maintained that the new policy, which entails various aspects of a person from birth to old age, takes every community into account. “High population is connected with poverty, therefore, the issue requires awareness among targeted people,” he said, adding that the issue was also related to sustainable development goals set by the United Nations till 2030. “Steps will have to be taken by Uttar Pradesh which is the most populous state of India,” he said. The policy aims to bring down the reproductive rate to 2.1 by 2026 and to 1.9 by 2030. The CM, who initiated a population stability fortnight programme beginning Sunday, said there should be adequate gap between two children to control population. He said the aim of the policy is not restricted to stabilising the population but also to bring prosperity in the lives of the people. “The state also needs to take steps to bring down Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR). We will ensure that population control measures do not have an adverse impact on any community. We need to take every community along. The health of mother and child should also be taken into account,” he said. Yogi underscored the need for steps to bring people closer to schemes initiated by the Centre which aim to benefit various communities. Maintaining that the issue of population control was not just associated with the health and family welfare department, the CM stressed on inter-departmental coordination for better results. “Departments like women and child welfare and education will have to step in and make concerted efforts to control the population. It was this inter-departmental coordination which helped the state government in controlling not only the deadly Japanese encephalitis but also the coronavirus pandemic,” he said. Meanwhile, the CM also inaugurated 11 laboratories for RT-PCR testing. He said the state government had taken a giant leap in coronavirus testing capacity from zero to four lakh per day, within the last 16 months. Now, the state has RT-PCR test labs in 40 districts. In other districts, tests are being conducted at medical colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/high-popn-hinders-devpt-steps-must-to-bring-imr-down-cm/articleshow/84331186.cms||---

---||India||IAS officer forges Madhya Pradesh court orders for promotion; held||INDORE: An IAS officer was arrested in Indore on Saturday night, on the complaint of a judge, for allegedly forging two court orders related to a case against him for alleged ‘criminal intimidation’ of a woman. Santosh Verma, 51, is accused of using the forged documents to get promoted from state cadre to IAS. It’s the first time that an IAS officer has been arrested in Madhya Pradesh on such a charge. The complaint against the bureaucrat was filed by judicial magistrate (first class) Bijendra Singh Rawat, who was hearing the criminal intimidation case against him, SP Ashutosh Bagri told TOI. Verma, an additional commissioner with urban administration department, was arrested by police after 12 hours of sustained interrogation. “He had produced forged orders for his promotion to IAS cadre. But on the date mentioned in the orders, the judge was on leave,” SP Bagri said. The IAS officer was produced before a local court on Sunday and judge Dilip Parmar remanded him in police custody till July 14. The earlier case against Verma dates back four years when police booked him for ‘voluntarily causing hurt, criminal intimidation and circulation of obscene material’ on the complaint of a woman. In 2020, the departmental promotion committee was considering awarding IAS cadre to Verma, who was then zilla panchayat CEO, but queries came up on the pending criminal case. Verma allegedly produced a ‘settlement order’ on the dispute with the woman, and an ‘attested copy of an acquittal order’, dated October 6, which he presented on October 8. The department sent the orders to the office of inspector general police to check if an appeal could be filed against the acquittal. The district prosecution office (DPO) checked court records and found that it was a single order for settlement and acquittal while Verma had allegedly produced two orders. The DPO sent a report that appeal can’t be filed in the case. When the woman got to know of it, she wrote to the chief secretary, saying there had been no court ruling regarding settlement or acquittal. The probe was till on when judge Rawat filed a formal complaint with police on June 27. Investigators say Verma tried to pass the blame to the woman, alleging that she had given him the forged orders, but his claim fell flat when it was revealed that it was she who had moved court, leading to discovery of the forgery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ias-officer-forges-mp-court-orders-for-promotion-held/articleshow/84333174.cms||---

These vendors have not paid their monthly fee to the MC since 2017, the year street vending registration started in the city. Vendors registered themselves on payment of Rs 200 registration fee and one-month payment in 2017. After that, they did not pay anything in the past over three years, due to which the MC included them in the list of permanent defaulters. There are around 3,000 more defaulters but they have not been included in the list of permanent defaulters because they did not make payment for the last few months due to the pandemic. They will be given time to make their payments without notice, but since the aforementioned 2,443 vendors did not pay after registration in 2017, they will not be given any further chance after July 26 and their license will be cancelled permanently. “The decision about permanent defaulters has been taken after going through the entire record, data and their sincerity toward payment to the MC. It is surprising that they did not make payments to the MC for the past over three years, which shows their attitude to become registered street vendors and thus we have given them the last opportunity. If these many vendors fail to deposit their payments, their IDs and payment lockers will be closed permanently,” a senior official said. According to records, currently there are around 10,912 registered street vendors, out of which around 3,513 are from essential service providers (ESP) category, while around 6,259 are from non-essential service providers (Non-ESP) category and remaining 1,140 are registered mobile vendors. Earlier, the number was over 9,000, but since the MC recently registered more vendors who don’t have Chandigarh Adhaar cards, the number of registered street vendors has reached around 10,912.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-2443-vendors-tagged-permanent-defaulters-may-lose-licence-too/articleshow/84333162.cms||Deepak Yadav

Standing at 4 feet 11 inches, Sia Parikh used to feel intimidated and the frequent teasing shook her confidence. But her mother’s words changed her world and now the 16-year-old girl born to Gujarati parents will walk on the famed red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival amid the glitterati on July 12. “Initially, I never felt uneasy about my height but when my schoolmates started growing tall, the teasing started. My confidence was somewhat shaken as I felt that being tall is necessary for a good appearance,” Sia said. But Sia’s mother Sheetal Patel Parikh came to her rescue. “I told her that to succeed in life, one needs to have confidence and talent. Having short height isn’t a disadvantage and she can achieve anything she aims for. Sia is a talented child and has been acting in theatre plays since she was a five-year-old,” Sheetal said over phone from the US. And the pep talk helped as Sia hasn’t looked back then. “She took to professional modelling and we were trying to get her into the Cannes Film Festival. Some months ago a designer liked her photographs and she was signed by two luxury brands to represent them in the Global Short Films Awards Gala in Cannes. It is a proud moment for us as a Gujarati girl will walk on the red carpet in Cannes Film Festival,” Sheetal said. “This opportunity has given me a lot of confidence and I no longer feel intimidated about my height. Walking on the red carpet would be a dream come true for me and my family,” Sia said and added that she isn’t nervous. Sia had shifted to Vadodara with her mother Sheetal in 2016 and she studied in Navrachana School for two years before shifting back to the US. The family lives in Columbus Ohio. Sheetal, a Barodian, had shifted to the US in 1998 and her husband Ashish Parikh migrated there on a student visa many years ago. Sia, who is learning kathak, said that she wants to start an awareness campaign among the youngsters to discourage body shaming.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/short-sia-set-to-take-a-giant-leap-will-walk-on-red-carpet-at-cannes/articleshow/84325272.cms||Tushar Tere

MLAs Biswajit Das, Ashok Kirtania and Subrata Thakur had already fuelled speculation over more defections within BJP after they failed to attend state president Dilip Ghosh’s district organizational meeting last month. While Bengal BJP leaders tried to downplay their repeated absence, speculations were rife over their political future. Thakur, BJP MLA from Gaighata, said he was busy attending an important meeting of All India Matua Mahasangha on Sunday. Bongaon North MLA Kirtania cited health reasons for his absence while Bagda MLA Das said he was caught in personal work. Their absence was marked at the district unit’s organizational meeting last month when Ghosh convened it the day after Mukul Roy quit BJP. “We have WhatsAp groups for each organizational district where invitations and itineraries are posted. Moreover, all the invitees are called up well in advance to give reminders. Today’s meeting was to discuss the political programmes we are going to take up in coming months,” said Abhijit Das, co-observer of Nabadwip zone, who presided over Sunday’s meeting. “There is no reason why one should read too much into their absence,” said Raju Banerjee, Bengal BJP vice-president. “As MLAs, they have important programmes to attend in their constituencies.

Karimpuri, who headed the Punjab unit for several years and is now in charge of party affairs in Himachal Pradesh, has warned Garhi against “low level” mechanisations so that party could be saved from further damage. “I have been swallowing insult without any reason, even as I have been working selflessly under leadership of party supremo Mayawati and have remained a true soldier of Kanshi Ram’s mission,” Karimpuri said, adding that if those indulging in false propaganda would not stop, legal action would be initiated. “False propaganda is being spread against me under a planned conspiracy. It is being claimed that I am damaging the party in connection with the alliance (with Shiromani Akali Dal). It is being done at the behest of other parties to damage BSP and get some action initiated against me from Mayawati,” he said. Karimpuri said some colleagues from the party came to his place and asked him to talk to Mayawati about seat sharing. He said they claimed that seat distribution was not correct and seats which could have been won by BSP had been given to SAD. “I told those colleagues that I could not interfere in Punjab affairs as I have been assigned Himachal Pradesh and advised them to see Punjab affairs in-charge Randhir Singh Beniwal. The same colleagues met Beniwal, where Garhi and other two leaders, Gurlal Saila and Nachhatar Pal, were also present. When the same colleagues met me and Garhi, then why propaganda against me?” he said. Karimpuri hit out at Garhi over his statement against him to a TV news channel and saying that he would speak to Mayawati against him. “This actually reflects Garhi’s attitude of not keeping party together and disintegrating it. I can explain my position before party supremo as well as before people as I have not done any wrong,” said Karimpuri. “My personal advice to those who are indulging in false propaganda against me on channels and social media is that in place of spreading canards, they should rather work for the party, so it could be kept united and strong,” Karimpuri said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/now-bitterness-between-former-serving-punjab-chiefs-of-bsp/articleshow/84329863.cms||IP Singh

SI, Cyber Crime police station, Chetan Bhardwaj, told TOI, “The fake website, http://tcchandra.com, was operational since 2018. They generated fake tax receipts that looked similar to that of transport department receipts.” “The gang had also issued fake receipts at Akshardham and Ashram in Delhi too as its entries were found on server data,” he said. The “super admin” of the website and mastermind of the racket, Balveer, a resident of Palwal in Haryana, is absconding, he said. IGP (Agra range) Naveen Arora told TOI, “Acting on a complaint of an Agra resident, it was found that the gang had set up check posts at the state borders. They were collecting taxes from vehicles and nothing was being deposited in government treasury.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/with-fake-receipts-portal-gang-looted-drivers-in-6-states/articleshow/84333285.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Nearly 37% of stakeholder survey respondents (frontline practitioners) reported that recruitment of survivors has moved online since the start of the pandemic. “Cognisant of the increased amount of time that people, especially children, spent on the internet, traffickers have advertised false jobs on social media,” says the report by UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Ilias Chatzis, chief of UNODC’s human trafficking and migrant smuggling section, says the study found that children are being increasingly targeted by traffickers who are using social media and other online platforms to recruit new people and profiting from the increased demand for child sexual exploitation material. “Traffickers have responded to the closure of bars, clubs and massage parlours (due to lockdowns, curfews and other measures) by moving sexual exploitation of adults and children to private homes and apartments,” states the study that outlines the impact of the pandemic on human trafficking and recommends measures to deal with emerging challenges. The study draws upon existing research, available data, reports, UNODC field office surveys and a stakeholder survey of those working to combat trafficking on ground from across regions. Released recently in Vienna, the report shows that 39% of stakeholder survey respondents reported that it has been tougher during the pandemic for first responders to detect survivors of trafficking. One of the stakeholders interviewed for the report, Ravi Kant, president of voluntary organisation Shakti Vahini, told TOI that traffickers are changing their methods and with red light areas closing down during lockdowns, these activities are shifting to residential areas in the garb of massage parlours and spas. “We’ve tracked 200 cases where traffickers were operating in the garb of spas and massage parlours in 2020 and 2021,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/trafficking-goes-online-during-pandemic/articleshow/84333327.cms||Ambika Pandit

Led by a Major from Agra, the men were ordered to capture Point 4700. On July 7 afternoon, the team was asked to prepare for the battle. The commander of the para company was initially instructed to create a base camp near Bakarwal (grazing area) of Mushkoh valley until his remaining men joined him. However, his mission soon changed to capturing Point 4700, which was nearly 5km away. Unaware of the towering height, the Major made a bold decision to take only 30 men, who were of non-combat ground such as cook, laundrymen, clerk and even unfit men to conduct a recce and understand the terrain and help the assault team to preserve their energy for quick and decisive assault. “Since the Point 4700 and the terrain towards it were unknown to them, the officer was ready to sacrifice himself and non-combat men in order to gather vital information of ground zero situation and enemy setup, which could have given advantage to the assault team,” said an officer. “It was July 8 evening, when the team left for the mission. It was pitch dark night with bone-chilling cold, shivering and challenging steep climbing. They walked for the entire night and covered the majority of distance. In the day time, the team hid to avoid getting spotted by enemy troops and rested behind huge stones and ice walls. However, seeing his men exhausted, the team leader decided to continue the recce mission along with his shadow ‘buddy’ and asked the remaining team to stay put and guide the assault team towards Point 4700. The second night was unforgiving for the duo. To keep themselves warm and avoid becoming a victim of hypothermia, the leader and his buddy slept in one sleeping-bag after reaching as close as up to 800 metres away from Point 4700,” he says. Hailing from an Agra village, the officer is the second generation of his family to join the Indian Army. His father retired as a subedar. “Extremely exhausted, the para assault team reached the duo. Taking them further to capture the height at night could have turned fatal. Each man was carrying 30-40 kg of load with himself, that too on steep climbing. Such physical challenge is unbearable at times. Therefore, they rested in the night with a resolve to launch assault in the early hours of morning. With energy gained, they started to advance towards the height. The Major was leading from front with a radio operator behind him and a paratrooper, Gopal Singh (23), but terrain was such that their hands were not on their weapons and suddenly the enemy started firing at them. The bullets passed left and right of them. In the encounter, the Major along with the radio operator lost their balance and skied into a gorge but were saved by a boulder. However, Gopal engaged himself in retaliating fire, but he was later found with a bullet in his chest with a gun nozzle towards the enemy. In the meanwhile the company senior JCO (junior commissioning officer) presumed the team leader and radio operator dead and informed the same to HQ over the radio. However, the Major who heard the message on his radio, called HQ and informed about his status,” said a paratrooper officer. “The situation turned more complicated for the radio man and Major, while they were attempting to climb back, as scree kept forcing them down. Moments later, they both lost each other in pitch darkness of the terrain and confusion caused by physical exhaustion. Their men were shouting to guide them, but due to echo in the valley Major was not able to locate them. Unknowingly, he started walking towards the enemy side, but uncertain about to whom he was approaching, he decided to stand where he was. Meanwhile, the radio man somehow managed to join the team back, where he was given immediate medical aid, while three men led by second in command (2IC), also a Major rank officer — armed with only grenades and three ropes of 300 feet length each came down, and hours later located him.” Narrating further, the officer said, “Team leader was taken back to HQ. After debriefing by his seniors, he was given another team to lead and was asked to capture the height with assault from two sides, as the first team was already near point 4700. On July 11, at around 10 pm, the two teams led by the Major advanced towards the peak 4700. After heavy fire exchange, at around 2:30am on July 12 morning, the guns of enemy troops suddenly stopped. By 4am, the para team informed the HQ of capturing the peak. On reaching the site, they saw a large number of war like stores, gas masks, blood-stained clothes, and a huge cache of ammunition." "The 2IC was given a chief of Army staff commendation letter for his voluntary act of saving his leader and recovering the body of Gopal.” Gopal was given sena medal posthumously.

While 88% of parents in villages are in favour of schools resuming proper classes, the corresponding proportion in cities is 78%. The results are part of an online survey conducted by the State Council of Educational Research and Training on parents’ willingness for schools to resume physically. Last year, students in rural areas were reported to have suffered loss of learning because of poor internet connectivity. Online-only classes have also resulted in higher dropout rates, especially of girls, a corresponding increase in child labour and depression, particularly in villages. Not surprisingly, parents in rural and semi-urban areas, with poor power and internet infrastructure, are keener than their city counterparts for schools to reopen. Of the 2,69,116 parents across the state who participated in the survey, 1,40,424 were from rural Maharashtra, 1,00,727 from cities and the rest from semi-urban areas. The reopening of schools will be decided by a committees set up in villages that have been Covid-free for a month. Along with keeping Covid protocols in place, parental consent is a must to start physical schools. Classes each day cannot exceed four hours and only main subjects will have to be taught. Each class should not have more than 20 students and attendance is not compulsory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/88-in-villages-want-schools-to-reopen-10-more-than-in-cities/articleshow/84333366.cms||Sandhya Nair

In an interview to Shanmughasundaram J , he details the measures being taken for the welfare of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees including a new housing project and better living conditions in the camps until the DMK government’s plea for granting them citizenship is accepted. Tamils who go to foreign countries in search of a livelihood are exploited by their employers and cheated by agencies, particularly during the pandemic. What are the efforts being taken to address these issues? We have been looking into the problems of Tamils going to foreign countries for jobs. We have held meetings with Non-Resident Tamils (NRT) associations in 13 different countries including the US, Saudi Arabia, Singapore. Based on that, we are planning to come up with various measures to protect the rights of the people and ensure their well-being. One of the key measures is registration. It will be compulsory for every Tamil going to foreign countries for a job to register with the ministry. We will collect details of their employers/agencies, nature of job and location of their worksite. This will help us keep track of them and also reach out to them quickly when they need assistance. In your meetings with NRTs, what were the major problems raised by them?Many NRT associations and representatives said families of those who may have been killed in an accident at the workplace or those who died of other causes find it difficult to get back their mortal remains. They lamented that many of them were being cheated by the employers when it comes to the nature of the job and wages. We will take corrective measures to address these issues. What kind of corrective measures would they be?We are planning to introduce an insurance scheme exclusively for Tamils going to foreign countries for jobs to create a safety net for them and their families. If they meet with an accident or something goes wrong in a foreign land, the victim or their families would get financial support. We are in talks with insurance companies to launch insurance covers specially designed for them. Besides, we are working on establishing exclusive units (help desk) for Gulf countries and countries that have a high population of Tamils. The officials attached to the units will be in touch with the embassy of the respective country. Similarly, we are devising a scheme to extend financial support to those returning home to start small businesses. Training in the respective trade/vocation before workers leave for foreign shores is also on the cards. NRTs in Gulf countries are worried that their children are being denied an opportunity to learn their mother tongue as Indian schools do not offer Tamil. Will the TN government intervene?Definitely, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the children of Tamils living in foreign countries are able to learn Tamil language in the schools. It is their right and our government will ensure it. One of the pre-poll promises of the DMK is to get Indian citizenship for Sri Lankan Tamils. What is the government doing about that?Our chief minister has taken up the issue with the Union government to obtain citizenship for them. Until it comes through, we will ensure their safety and take efforts to implement all welfare schemes effectively. The Sri Lankan refugee camps are in a poor condition and lack basic amenities. Any steps to correct the situation?We have inspected several Sri Lankan refugee camps. They live in houses built 30 years ago, many of these are in a dilapidated condition. The government is going to launch a new housing scheme for them. In the first phase, nearly 1,000 houses will come up in Dindigul district at a cost of ₹20 crore. We have inspected the proposed site for the project. At present, district collectors and district rural development agencies have been asked to ensure basic amenities - particularly drinking water and proper roads. For instance, the Sri Lankan Tamils in one of the camps in Trichy requested for a water tank during the inspection. It was sanctioned immediately, and the collector assured that the work would be completed within a month. In another camp, they asked for an anganwadi, and the work for it has been taken up. Former CM M Karunanidhi waived tuition fees for the children of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees and allowed them to pursue medicine and other courses. But the children were not allowed to pursue medicine and agriculture courses after 1991. Will the government look into this?At present, the NEET issue is going on. So, we have to look at possible options. We will take the issue to our CM and do the needful. There is a demand from the minorities to retrieve the land of Wakf Board from encroachers. Has any action been taken in this regard?Unlike the Hindu religious and charitable endowments department, the land allocated to Wakf Board is caught in various legal issues. In some cases, the person donating the land to a particular mosque would write a will that allows only his/her family member to maintain the property. Only they can be authorised to take decisions related to the property. So, we have to look into such legal issues when it comes to land related to the Wakf board. What is the priority of the ministry?Several schemes for the minorities have remained on paper. We will implement the schemes in letter and spirit. We will identify talent among minorities and honour them. Our CM has also welcomed our proposals. We will put everything into practice in a phased manner.

Sources in the fisheries department said nearly 80 boats returned to the shore on Sunday after a few days at sea, bringing in more than 60 tonnes of fish. In contrast, more than 50 tonnes of fish belonging to more than half a dozen species, besides squid, prawn and crabs had landed at the harbour last weekend, just after the 60-day east coast fishing ban ended. Balaraman, a vendor at Kasimedu, said Sankara, Navarai, Vanjiram, Seela, Paarai and Koduva were among the varieties in the catch on offer on Sunday. A small quantity of crabs, squids and prawns also arrived, he said. South Indian Fishermen Welfare Association President K Bharathi said large numbers of buyers had begun thronging the place since Saturday night and more came on Sunday morning. However, despite the slight increase in the arrival of fish, the prices at both wholesale and retail markets in the city remained high, he said. At the Chintadripet wholesale market, one of the largest in the city, Sankara sold for ₹400 a kg, while Navarai cost ₹800, Vanjiram ₹900 a kg, Seela ₹550, Paarai ₹500 a kg and Koduva came for ₹450 a kg. A kg of squid cost ₹350. A vendor at the market said all the half-a-dozen fish species that had come to the Kasimedu harbour were on sale. Among them, seer fish (Vanjiram) was in great demand and was priced the highest as most hotels have it on their regular menu. Black pomfret (Karuppu Vaaval), next in popularity, is also in great demand among the fish eating population of Chennai. Seer and black pomfret retailed at ₹1,100 a kg and ₹650 a kg, he added. For more than two months, as the annual fishing ban was in force along the entire east coast to help the various fish species to spawn, the catch arriving in the city was very little and the prices scandalously high.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-fish-arrival-picks-up-at-kasimedu-but-prices-still-high/articleshow/84333392.cms||P Oppili

Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma has written to his Mizoram counterpart Zoramthanga about the incidents that occurred a few days after a high-level meeting between top officials of the two states was held in New Delhi. Tension is running high in Khulicherra area of the district, where people from Mizoram have reportedly entered up to 6.5 kilometres inside Assam land a few days ago, following which Assam police along with civil administration carried out an eviction drive. “Two blast sounds were heard coming from the Mizoram side at 2.40 am and 2.43 am. The CRPF, which is a neutral force deployed at Khulicherra Point-II, has been asked to enquire into the suspected blasts on the Mizoram side,” an Assam police source said. The situation is normal at present, although tension still prevails and Assam police personnel are on alert in the entire border area, he added. Additional director general of police (border) of Assam, Harmeet Singh, is camping at the spot. On Saturday, an explosion took place targeting a delegation of Assam government officials, including senior police officials who were on a visit to oversee the construction of a road along the border. No casualty was reported in the incident. Initially it was believed to be a grenade attack but the police later suspected that the miscreants used an IED, the source said. The Mizoram CM, however, retweeted a report which said that no grenade was hurled in the area on Saturday and the sound was of the bursting of a tyre of an excavator. Meanwhile, Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said that he has written to Zoramthanga to settle the border dispute by using satellite mapping of the actual border locations. “For complete peace, we should hand over the interstate border to central police forces after we fix the border issue. We are building roads within the Constitutional boundary of Assam. We will not take an inch of land from Mizoram,” he added. There has been a border dispute between Assam and Mizoram in that area along with other locations in Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj districts of the Barak valley.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/assam-mizoram-border-spat-hots-up-with-3-blasts-in-2-days/articleshow/84333428.cms||---

He also urged the rights body to take cognisance and institute an inquiry into these incidents. Arif Jwadder in his complaint to the rights body on Saturday said ‘small-time’ criminals were being shot at by police and the reason cited for such “fake encounters” was that they tried to “flee from police custody after snatching weapons”. Pointing out that over 20 such encounters had taken place recently, Jwadder said in his complaint that most of the people at the receiving end were alleged drug dealers and cattle smugglers. He added that a few of them have died on the spot which is a “violation of human rights”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/assam-cops-on-encounter-spree-plaint-filed-with-nhrc/articleshow/84333438.cms||Rokibuz Zaman

Congress along with the rest of the opposition parties, including the left, allege that the new ministry, which pertains to cooperatives, which is a state subject under the Constitution, represents an attempt by the BJP government to hijack the cooperative movement across the country. They allege that BJP is particularly eyeing Maharashtra, Gujarat and Kerala that represent the bulk of the cooperatives in the country. Congress strategist and former Union minister Jairam Ramesh said, “It is a well planned assault on the constitutional rights and responsibilities of states and we will raise this issue most forcefully in Parliament.” Senior Congress leader from Kerala Ramesh Chennithala said, “There is an ulterior design in BJP‘s decision to create this new ministry with home minister Amit Shah in charge.” Many in the opposition argue that just like the agricultural laws, which are now the reason for the protracted farmers’ protest, the issue of cooperation ministry can be used to pressure the government on the issue of federalism by showing that the Centre is stepping on the states’ turf.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cooperation-ministry-attack-on-states-rights-congress/articleshow/84333448.cms||---

Less than three days after taking charge, Scindia announced eight more flights for the state, six of them to and from the historic city of Gwalior, his bastion. SpiceJet will provide the services from July 16 under UDAN scheme. More good news is in store for Bhopal, Indore, and even some tourist hotspots, say sources. Good news for Madhya Pradesh! Starting 8 new flights from July 16 onwards via @flyspicejet - Gwalior-Mumbai-Gwalio… https://t.co/qxq6SmrBbE— Jyotiraditya M. Scindia (@JM_Scindia) 1625986454000“Good news for Madhya Pradesh! Starting 8 new flights from July 16 onwards via @flyspicejet: Gwalior-Mumbai-Gwalior, Gwalior-Pune-Gwalior, Jabalpur-Surat-Jabalpur, Ahmedabad-Gwalior-Ahmedabad. @Mo-CA_GoI & the aviation industry are committed to take #UDAN to greater heights!” Scindia tweeted on Sunday. In response to this announcement, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan tweeted, “Mr Scindia, these flights will give a new impetus to the development of Gwalior and Jabalpur as well as Madhya Pradesh. Hearty congratulations to you for this phenomenal effort!” Under the regional connectivity scheme UDAN, financial incentives from the Centre, state governments and airport operators are extended to select airlines to encourage operations from unserved and underserved airports. A key aspect is that airfares are kept affordable. The Gwalior-Khajuraho-Orchha tourist circuit is a hit with foreign visitors, but connectivity has always played spoilsport. Sources said that even before becoming aviation minister, Scindia has been trying to connect Gwalior, his home turf, with important cities. “He has been trying this for a long time. Gwalior is a tourist place and it will improve the tourism industry in the region,” said highly placed sources in the aviation ministry. UDAN or ‘Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik’, launched four years ago, has played a major role in adding new airports and routes to the aviation landscape of the country, said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/jyotiraditya-scindias-big-gift-to-madhya-pradesh-8-new-flights-at-one-go/articleshow/84333437.cms||Ramendra Singh

Santosh Verma, 51, is accused of using the forged documents to get promoted from state cadre to IAS. It’s the first time that an IAS officer has been arrested in Madhya Pradesh on such a charge. The complaint against the bureaucrat was filed by judicial magistrate (first class) Bijendra Singh Rawat, who was hearing the criminal intimidation case against him, SP Ashutosh Bagri told TOI. Verma, an additional commissioner with urban administration department, was arrested by MG Road police after 12 hours of sustained interrogation. “He had produced forged orders for his promotion to IAS cadre. But on the date mentioned in the orders, the judge was on leave,” SP Bagri said. The IAS officer was produced before a local court on Sunday and judge Dilip Parmar remanded him in police custody till July 14. IAS OFFICER HELDCops wonder how ‘fake’ order ended up in court recordsThe earlier case against Verma dates back four years when police in Indore’s Lasudia booked him for ‘voluntarily causing hurt, criminal intimidation and circulation of obscene material’ on the complaint of a woman. In 2020, the departmental promotion committee (DPC) was considering awarding IAS cadre to Verma, who was then zilla panchayat CEO in Dhar district, but queries inevitably came up on the pending criminal case. Verma allegedly produced a ‘settlement order’ on the dispute with the woman, and then the ‘attested copy of an acquittal order’, dated October 6, which he presented on October 8. In routine follow-up, the department sent the orders to the office of inspector general police to check if an appeal could be filed against the acquittal. The district prosecution office (DPO) checked court records and found that there was indeed an order – but it was a single order for settlement and acquittal while Verma had allegedly produced two orders. Going by the order in the records, the DPO sent a report that appeal can’t be filed in the case. Word spread and the woman got to know of it. She wrote to the chief secretary, saying there had been no court ruling regarding settlement or acquittal. The chief secretary asked the IG to probe it. The investigation was still on when judge Rawat filed a formal complaint with police on June 27. On Saturday, Verma deposed before police in the presence of his lawyer. Investigators say he tried to pass the blame to the woman, alleging that she had given him the forged orders, but his claim fell flat when it was revealed that it was she who had moved court, leading to discovery of the forgery. He was arrested under IPC sections 420, 467,468, 471 and 120-B for fraud, forgery, criminal conspiracy, and fraudulently using a document as genuine. Police have also seized documents Verma had carried to the interrogation to prove the ‘authenticity of the orders’. His phone gave clues to how the forgery was perpetrated, said officers, adding that they will question those who helped him in the crime. Police are investigating how a fake order got into the court records. Originally a resident of Barwani district, Verma has served as ADM-Barwani and deputy collector in Ujjain. He has held administrative posts in Harda, Shajapur, Rajgarh districts as well.

Kumar, who was recently elevated in the rank after being national media head for a few years, replaced another joint general secretary Krishna Gopal who held the charge since 2015. The change was announced in an ongoing meeting of RSS full-timers at Chitarkoot in Madhya Pradesh. When contacted, RSS Prachar Pramukh Sunil Ambekar confirmed the development and said Arun Kumar will be the Sangh’s coordinator for political issues including with BJP. He further said this is a routine exercise and the Sangh keeps shifting its workers from one responsibility to another. Earlier this year, the RSS had made a generational shift in its organisational structure by elevating Dattatreya Hosabale as general secretary and Arun Kumar along with Ramdatt Chakarddhar as joint general secretary. Appointment of Kumar is seen as another major move towards making the RSS more proactive on its agenda, including on the political front. The RSS representative is invited to key BJP organisational meets and plays an important role in organisational appointments also.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rss-appoints-arun-kumar-as-interface-for-political-issues/articleshow/84333526.cms||---

The share of NH stretches that are less than two-lane has fallen, indicating that sharper focus on building wider highways is yielding results. As per official data, the total length of single-lane highway as on May 31 was 29,693 km, which was 21% of the entire 1.39 lakh km NH network compared to 29% in 2018. It also shows that there has been a significant increase in the length of twolane or two-and-a-half lane NHs in recent years. But the most significant increase has been in the segment of four-lanes and above. Data also show that while the annual average increase in the four or more lanes NH stretches was barely 800 km between 2011 and 2015, this went up to 2,233 km during the 2015-18 period. But in the last three years, the average annual increase was 3,000 km. “Now there is a greater focus on wider highways, Greenfield expressways and economic corridors. We will see a quantum jump of completed stretches under this category by 2024,” said a highway ministry official. Meanwhile, on the recent trend of increased competition among firms to bag highway projects quoting low prices, Union highways minister Nitin Gadkari said this is because the era when a few big players in the sector created cartels is over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/length-of-four-lane-highways-or-above-doubled-in-10-years/articleshow/84333566.cms||Dipak K Dash

The metropolitan was under treatment at St Gregorios Medical Mission Hospital in Parumala, which is owned and controlled by the Orthodox Church. He was on ventilator for the past several days after developing breathing difficulties. The Catholicos was under treatment for lung cancer since December, 2019. Though he had recovered from Covid in February this year, he was troubled by post covid health issues. His health deteriorated recently due to infection in lungs. He was enthroned as the Catholicos of the East and Malankara Metropolitan on November 1, 2010. He was the eighth Catholicos of the East in Malankara. Born on August, 30, 1946 in a village called Mangad near Kunnamkulam, Trissur district, as the son of the late Kollannur Iype and the late Pulikkottil Kunjeetty, KI Paul, had his early education in local schools. After graduating from St Thomas College, Trissur, Paul joined the Orthodox Theological Seminary, Kottayam from where he obtained degrees of the Serampore University. He did his MA in Sociology from CMS College, Kottayam. At the young age of 36, the church parliament elected Fr KI Paul as Bishop. On May 15, 1985, he was consecrated as Bishop with the new name Paulose Mar Milithios. Subsequently, he was elevated as the first Metropolitan of the newly formed Kunnamkulam diocese on August 1, 1985. The Malankara Syrian Christian Association held at Parumala on October 12, 2006 unanimously elected him as the Catholicos Designate and the successor to the Malankara Metropolitan. On November 1, 2010, following the abdication of his predecessor, Baselios Marthoma Didymus I, Milithios Metropolitan was enthroned as the Catholicos of the East and Malankara Metropolitan with the new name Baselios Marthoma Paulose II. Incidentally, Kunnamkulam which is a stronghold of the Orthodox Community in Kerala has given birth to three Malankara Metropolitans including Paulose II. He has authored a few devotional and contemplative books in Malayalam. Meanwhile, the PRO of the church informed that the metropolitan after falling sick had issued orders on July 3 giving charges to senior metropolitan Kuriakose Mar Clemis to oversee and preside over the Malankara Syrian Christian Association meeting slated to be held in Parumala on October 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/kerala-orthodox-church-head-baselios-marthoma-paulose-ii-passes-away/articleshow/84333570.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

Zika virus cases were last reported in the state in year 2018, from around a dozen districts of the state. More than 100 infections of the virus were reported then. It is a vector borne infection and is spread by mosquitoes, said sources. Officials in the state capital Bhopal are also on alert regarding the virus. “As per the instructions the testing centres are to be prepared, in Bhopal testing for the virus is done at AIIMs, apart from it, creating awareness about the disease will also be done”, district malaria officer, Dr Akhilesh Dubey said. “Our field teams routinely collect samples for malaria, if there are symptoms of zika virus in the patient then samples are tested for the virus”, Dubey said. Sources said that this time chances of spread are less as due to the restrictions and then hesitation owing to the safety concerns, people are travelling less in the country, thus chances of spread of the virus are less, but officials are on alert to ensure timely identification and monitoring.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/zika-fear-returns-to-haunt-madhya-pradesh-officials-on-alert/articleshow/84333596.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 37 held for late-night party at luxury hotel on Park Street||KOLKATA: Thirty-seven men — all in their twenties and thirties and most of them working professionals — were arrested from The Park, the luxury hotel on Park Street, in the early hours of Sunday for allegedly partying well past midnight in violation of Covid restrictions. Cops alleged four of them jostled with them and five others misbehaved and kept smoking “something with a pungent odour” even after they were asked to throw them away. These nine were remanded in police custody for five days while the remaining 28 were granted bail by the chief metropolitan magistrate’s court later in the afternoon. <p>A DJ console seized from the parties<br></p>The hotel authorities were also tagged in the same FIR and have been summoned with a list of all weekend bookings in the past one month. “The men were arrested from the second and third floors for partying with loud music defying the Covid restrictions imposed by the government. Some of those arrested even pushed and manhandled police officials discharging their duties,” joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma said. The Park authorities later released a statement that said, “We are in the business of hospitality for over five decades and have been part of employment creation and economic progress of the State. Guest and Staff safety being our utmost priority, the bars and restaurants at our hotel are shut basis the Covid-19 protocols. Many of our patrons and their friends or families book stays in the hotel as a weekend getaway on a regular basis. We are complying with all rules and regulations and would continue to do so and there has been no violation. We are fully cooperating with the authorities.” According to state government guidelines, eateries and bars can operate till 8pm whil e all movement and outdoor activities except those related to essential services are prohibited between 9pm and 5am. Acting on a tip-off, a team of four dozen officers from the anti-rowdy section of the detective department along with three IPS officers raided the hotel around 1.15am and allegedly found a large group of men and women drinking and dancing to loud music in the hotel lobbies. Cops arrested 37 men but allowed the women and those chatting in the rooms to go. Two luxury cars, including a Mercedes Benz, 38 mobile phones, two DJ consoles, hookahs, liquor bottles, a pouch of ganja and two sets of guests lists were seized. Those arrested were booked under IPC sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) read with 51 (b) of the Disaster Management Act. Barring 353, all the other sections are bailable. “The men were partying in a large group well beyond 8pm in gross violation of the Covid protocols. Irresponsible men like them are liable for the renewed Covid cases in the city,” public prosecutor Sazzad Ali Khan said in court. The defence counsels blamed the hotel authorities for allowing the party to take place on their premises and added that most of those arrested were invitees to a birthday party and the cops were framing them for a trivial offence. “There is no electronic evidence of them attacking the cops and there is also no proof of them consuming any objectionable substance. They were also not partying on the road but within the hotel premises. Where lies the violation then?” asked Imtiaz Ahmed, one of the dozen odd lawyers representing the accused men. According to police sources, it came to their notice that over the past one month the accused were allegedly converging at the hotel. “They were booking three-four adjacent rooms over weekends and then launching parties in the corridors. It is evident from the seizures that hookah, liquor and even ganja were widely available,” an officer said. Another officer of the detective department said they were probing the role of call centres in an unrelated crime when they came to know of the lavish lifestyles of some of the employees. “That is when we got tipped off on how some of them, along with IT professionals, were regulars at these parties,” he said.

A stand-alone house in AJ block was included taking the number up to seven in proper Salt Lake. Except a stand-alone apartment in EE Block that has been removed from the list, the previous localities in the township in which stand-alone houses had been demarcated as micro containment zones last week, remains. With this, there are now 16 micro containment zones in entire BMC area as per the revised list. BMC officials said that they were worried over the slight increase in the trend in which members of the same family of a house are Covid infected. “These stand-alone houses inside the blocks are getting demarcated as micro containment zones,” said a BMC official. Officials said that overall the number of active Covid cases in BMC area have been around 300, with an average of about 15 to 20 daily new cases getting reported from across Salt Lake and Rajarhat. Authorities are worried over increase in cases in few pockets of Rajarhat area. “We are conducting sanitisation drives in the affected localities and Covid tests are also being conducted for residents living close to the containment zones. The local ward coordinators and police are keeping in touch with the residents falling within the containment zones for any requirement as and when they need. We are urging people to continue following the Covid safety protocols like wearing masks. We are also preparing to have beds ready for both mothers and children from one to 12 years old in the civic body run hospital, in case there is a third wave,” said a BMC official. In the adjacent South Dum Dum municipality area, a part of an apartment in Jessore Road’s Green Park and another locality in Bangur Avenue Block D have been listed as micro containment zones. Across the district, there has been a marginal reduction in the numbers of micro containment zones from 83 last week to 74. “The list is dynamic and will change from time to time as per reports of localized cases as and when it gets reported,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/salt-lake-house-added-to-list-of-micro-c-zones-takes-bidhannagar-tally-to-16/articleshow/84328388.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Kolkata||West Bengal govt shelves proposal for Rs 8 minimum bus fare for now||KOLKATA: The proposal to hike bus fares by one rupee for every stage, which will make the minimum bus fare Rs 8 for the first three kilometres, has been shelved by the Bengal government for now, a senior official said on Sunday. The Bengal government is reluctant to burden people already reeling under the pandemic, the official added. The special committee appointed by the transport department proposed new fare per stage — Rs 8 for 0-3km, Rs 10 for 3-7km, Rs 12 for 7-10km and Rs 15 for 10-15km. This committee was appointed by the transport department to prescribe the ‘least possible revision of fares’. The Bengal government says it is foregoing a substantial amount in the form of a road tax waiver to passenger-carriages, approximately to the tune of Rs 30 crore per quarter, Rs 120 crore in four quarters. But the relief, according to transport operators, will not be enough to make their services viable since fuel prices have jumped. The relief was announced at the state budget last week. “This would have been a substantial relief for us if the diesel prices were under control. But the operating cost has gone beyond our affordability, making bus operation a loss-making proposition. Under these circumstances, we appealed to the CM to revise fares, the only option to bring life back to this moribund public transport system,” said Tapan Bandyopadhyay, secretary, Joint Council of Bus Syndicates. In the last one year, diesel price rose by Rs 25 per litre, sending operating cost through the ceiling. The last bus fare revision happened in 2018. But, transport officers don’t find hope for any approval from the highest level. Bus and tram fares have always been a sensitive issue in the city. They are the only mode of transport for the urban poor. This is why there was a near-riot situation when the fare of the tram was raised by one paisa in 1953. “But the state must not leave private bus transit system ailing by denying fare revision. If we don’t get a bus, we generally pay double or triple for travelling the same distance by using auto or taxi. Even if the fare is revised rationally, a passenger ends up paying less,” said Aniruudhha Sengupta, a transport economist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-shelves-proposal-for-rs-8-minimum-bus-fare-for-now/articleshow/84328468.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Cramped in three police vans, 37 youths, including techies, BPO executives, teachers, businessmen and students — all from well-to-do families — were brought to the Bankshall court at 3.10pm, 14 hours after they were picked up from multiple rooms on the second and third floors of The Park. There were also relatives of two senior industrialists from Kasba and Howrah among the accused men. A battery of lawyers comprising the defence counsel for the 37 men narrated the story of guests attending two birthday parties at the hotel and claimed they didn’t violate any Covid protocols as they hadn’t headed out to the road. Police sought custody for nine persons who had allegedly assaulted or misbehaved with them during the raid and had sought judicial custody for the rest. State counsel Sazzad Ali Khan termed their act “irresponsible” and opposed the bail plea. Magistrate Suchitra Deb, in her first order, sent the nine who allegedly misbehaved with cops to police custody and the rest to judicial custody. The defence counsel then pleaded for reconsideration and submitted their plea again. “We pleaded that cops didn’t demand interrogation for the 28 people and their fundamental rights were being hampered by being made stay in cramped groups,” said Zohaib Rauf, one of the defence counsels. The magistrate then granted bail to 28 and sent two among the nine to judicial custody and the rest to cop custody. Later, the court made further changes to the order sending all nine to police custody. A woman whose two friends were arrested, said, “When the hotel’s bar shut down at 8pm, we were given an option to buy a bottle of liquor and move up to a room. We bought a bottle of whiskey for Rs 7,000 and five of us sat in a second-floor room. We were about to leave when cops raided the place.” A homemaker whose husband and brother-in-law were arrested said they were attending a birthday party at Roxy when they were also given the option to continue in a room if they bought two bottles of liquor. In a statement, the hotel authorities said, “Guest and staff safety being our utmost priority, the bars and restaurants at our hotel are shut according to Covid protocols. Many of our patrons and their friends or families book stay in the hotel as a weekend getaway on a regular basis. We are complying with all rules and regulations and will continue to do so and there has been no violation.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Copa lost, but Brazil fans happy as Messi lifts Cup||KOLKATA: Usually, when Brazil loses to Argentina, half of soccer-crazed Kolkata plunges into mourning. That though wasn’t the case on Super Sunday when La Albiceleste beat Canarinho by a solitary goal. Sure Brazil fans were disappointed, but they also admitted they were happy Lionel Messi had finally won a trophy for Argentina. “Neymar Jr has some distance to go. His time will come. But for Messi, time is running out. Next year’s Fifa World Cup will probably be his last attempt to emulate Maradona. But given the quality of play that we have witnessed in Copa America and Euro Cup, I think it will take a miracle for either Brazil or Argentina to lay its hands on the trophy,” said Sambit Banerjee, a Brazil fan and a member of Gopalnagar Kalyan Sangha. However, Argentina supporter Sourabh Majumdar, who watched the match with Banerjee, doesn’t agree with this assessment. “The two tournaments are being played on different grounds and in different environments. In Europe, the game is being played before packed galleries while the matches in Brazil are in empty stadia. It does make a big difference to the game. Also, both teams were tense because this was a final. Those who watched the third-fourth play-off between Colombia and Peru got to see vintage Latin American football,” said Majumdar, who celebrated Messi’s success as captain of Argentina with sandesh. Poised between two waves of the pandemic, one half of Kolkata that would otherwise have erupted in joy and hit the streets with bike rallies sporting the Argentine shades was restrained in its celebration. In lanes and bylanes of north, central and south Kolkata, the young brigade did cheer when elders stepped out to go to the market, but did not go overboard over Messi adding the Copa America to his trophy cabinet. “The standard of football that we got to see in the match was poor. The referee was too lenient. Argentina played a rough game. Brazil controlled much of the possession, but lacked finishing. Neymar’s free kick was disappointing. But I won’t grudge Messi lifting the trophy. A player of his calibre deserved it,” said Brazil supporter Vishal Singh. While Messi fan Ayan Mitra rued the legend’s inability to convert a sitter and seal the match with minutes to go, he felt Argentine striker Angel Di Maria’s sublime chip over Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson Moraes was worth watching on repeat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/copa-lost-but-brazil-fans-happy-as-messi-lifts-cup/articleshow/84328252.cms||Subhro Niyogi

It has also initiated drives to encourage more people to register as voters. Officials said that with the changing scenario due to Covid, many people have moved out to their native places and new voters have shifted to Noida. Officials are now asking people to update their details and get their names added to the voters’ list. “Registering new voters is a continuous process. A draft publication is put out every October and the electoral rolls are revised. A new list is publicised at the beginning of every year. Since the election is scheduled for 2022, everyone who will be turning 18 years of age till January 1, 2022, can get enrolled as voters to be eligible to vote,” said Vandana Srivastava, additional district magistrate, GB Nagar. New voters can apply online through ‘www.nvsp.in’ that is the National Voter Service Portal. With reduced rush at the time, officials are trying to generate the electronic Electors Photo Identity Cards (e-EPIC) at the earliest possible. “We are trying that all EPICs be delivered to people within two months of application. Unless there is a discrepancy, we have already cleared all applications that we received since January this year. This is why we are urging that people should get their EPICs made at the earliest. If residents register online through their mobile numbers, they don’t even need a physical card. They will get an e-EPIC that is valid everywhere,” added Srivastava. She added that following the migration trends during the pandemic, many voters may need to change addresses in their e-EPICs. Especially for newer voters who have recently moved to the city and have stayed here for the past six months or those who have moved out in the same period, form 6-part 4 needs to be filled for change in address. This will ensure that their previous voter card is cancelled, and the residents get a new card. As of now, the projected population of GB Nagar is about 24.4 lakh (till 2021). So far, there are 15.4 lakh voters in the district, which include 8.6 lakh male and 6.8 lakh female voters.

The Centre has found the state had borrowed in excess to its limit by showing Telangana’s quota too into its account. The Centre, which fixed the state’s borrowing limit at Rs 37,000 crore for the first three quarters, has now capped it at Rs 20,000 crore by deducting Rs 17,000 crore due to over borrowing in the past. The Union finance ministry asked the state government to clarify whether the borrowing space was calculated inclusive of loan repayments made by Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/centre-trims-andhra-pradesh-borrowing/articleshow/84333704.cms||Samdani MN

While the husband was wearing a helmet, his wife and son were without the safety gear. The family, police said, were on their way to Delhi when the accident happened. The deceased have been identified as Puja and her son Ritesh. Bhagat Singh, the woman’s husband who is battling for life in the ICU of a private hospital in Noida, is a BSF constable. The bodies have been sent for autopsy. Yatendra Kumar Yadav, the SHO of Expressway police station, said they got a call from a passerby around 5am. “A police team was sent to the accident spot. The woman had died from excessive bleeding by the time the cops reached. Her husband and son were rushed to a nearby hospital. The little child, who had a deep wound in the head, died during treatment. The husband is in the ICU,” he added. Singh has suffered critical injuries in the head, shoulder and legs. On Sunday evening, doctors were likely to conduct a crucial surgery on him. “A preliminary investigation has revealed that the family had left their village in Rabupura to go to their Delhi home around 4am. When they reached the Chhaprauli cut on their bike, a speeding vehicle rammed into it from behind. The vehicle did not stop after the accident. We are trying to find out the make of the vehicle,” the SHO said. Singh’s family members lodged a complaint at Expressway police station. An FIR was subsequently registered against unknown persons under sections 279 (rash driving) and 304A (causing death by negligence) of the IPC. “We are relying on CCTV footage from cameras installed on the expressway and other nearby areas. Both the vehicle and its driver would be traced soon,” Yadav said. Expressways in NCR have been notorious for rash driving and accidents. On July 4, a 50-year-old man died while his son was injured when their car hit a divider on the Yamuna Expressway and turned turtle. The father-son duo were on their way to Noida from Gorakhpur when the accident happened near Dankaur. The same day, a traffic constable from Ghaziabad died after his car rammed into a stationary truck on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway in Badalpur village. On June 13, three members of a family were killed and two suffered injuries when their car crashed into a parked truck on the Yamuna Expressway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/woman-2-year-old-son-killed-as-vehicle-crashes-into-bike/articleshow/84328108.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey

Under this, the second office of GNIDA will come up in Noida Extension in about two-three months at a cost of Rs 2.1 crore where CEO and ACEO-level officers will sit on select days of the week. The move comes following increased occupancy of over 2-3 lakh residents and nearly 101 RWAs and AOAs in the region seeking civic, electrical, horticulture, maintenance and property-related redress within their vicinity for which they have to currently travel over 25 km from Kisan Chowk to the present GNIDA office in Knowledge Park IV in Greater Noida. While the recent 122nd GNIDA board meeting held on June 26 last month passed the proposal for the second office in the region, the authority has initiated tendering for the office complex. Two more offices are planned in Phase II area of Greater Noida taking the total to four offices of GNIDA in near future, officials said. GNIDA CEO Narendra Bhooshan said the Noida Extionsio office will be a self-contained office, which will serve the purpose of the area, including property and policy decisions, map and project clearances apart from civic, maintenance and electrical issues. “The office will be built on an 11,000 sqm plot in Techzone IV. We have initiated tendering for the project which will be built at a cost of Rs 2.1 crore.

Teaching faculty said that students have stopped writing proper answers as they have stopped making notes. Students are learning more one-line answers due to multiple choice questions that are being asked in online exams. Teaching faculty said that such a habit will create a lot of trouble for students. “Whether a student is in college or in school his habit of writing should be there. It helps students in understanding any topic properly. However, this time due to Covid online academics was promoted. Several students took it for granted and stopped writing,” said a teaching faculty without quoting his name. Asked why students have stopped the habit of writing, a senior professor without quoting his name said that online studies due to Covid was responsible. “When universities start allowing students to write answers in exams from home without any monitoring, such things would happen. In the name of continuing studies students were allowed to write answers at home and deposit the answer-sheet later in the colleges,” said the professor. Professors also blamed the MCQ based online exams. “In the past year it has been noticed that students were running after one-liner answers instead of indepth studies. Students were not doing proper studies and completely stopped writing,” said another professor. Teachers went on saying that there was no meaning of studies without practical classes. “What kind of students are we developing in disciplines like mechanical and civil engineering without practical classes,” said another faculty. Students also felt that the online classes and exams have affected their academics. “Online classes could be a temporary arrangement not the permanent solution. I have completed 3 semesters but I do not feel like learning much during this time,” said a student Anosh Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/writing-blues-used-to-online-classes-students-avoid-taking-notes-fail-to-write-proper-answers/articleshow/84333667.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Business||Government looks to scrap customs duty relief, exemptions on 97 products||NEW DELHI: From Atlantic salmon and hazelnuts to durians and certain sweet biscuits, the government has proposed to withdraw customs duty relief and exemptions for 97 products imported into the country. While the move is expected to push up the cost, it may also encourage domestic manufacturing of several items. The step follows an announcement in the Budget with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman articulating that certain outdated customs exemptions are proposed to be done away with as part of an exercise to streamline the structure. Now, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has released the list for public consultation with feedback to be given over the next one month. “…last year, we started overhauling the customs duty structure, eliminating 80 outdated exemptions... I now propose to review more than 400 old exemptions this year. We will conduct this through extensive consultations, and from October 1, 2021, we will put in place a revised customs duty structure, free of distortions. I also propose that any new customs duty exemption henceforth will have validity up to the March 31, following two years from the date of its issue,” the finance minister had said in her Budget speech. The list has a wide range of products, including some medicines and basic drugs, contraceptives, oil seeds, and seeds of flowers and vegetables and upholstery fabrics of certain types. Several types of machinery and components used by sectors such as textiles, power, oil & gas and electronics and telecom are also expected to see an impact as the relief to these products is proposed to be scrapped. The government has faced criticism for increasing tariffs over the last few years but in several cases, officials have argued that there is little justification for relief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/government-looks-to-scrap-customs-duty-relief-exemptions-on-97-products/articleshow/84333761.cms||---

---||Business||How will open network for e-commerce work?||NEW DELHI: The government is seeking to replicate the success of the UPI model as it creates the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), hoping to put in place a backbone on which sellers and logistics service providers can connect with buyers. Positioned as a “network”, the idea is to enable consumers to log in and look for products or services to meet their requirements. Based on their location, sellers will be listed along with the product details and price to enable the buyers to choose, sources familiar with the plan told TOI. The proposed ONDC will be connected to payment gateways and in case of specific requirements the platform will also offer the delivery and logistics service providers. Government sources said the broad contours of the model are in place and the advisory group, comprising Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani and National Health Authority CEO R S Sharma, among others, are being consulted to work out a robust platform. An initial pilot involving auto-rickshaws and taxis has been conducted where cabbies and three-wheeler operators were asked to register. Going forward, plans are afoot to focus on kirana stores, delivery service providers and FMCG players for tests in Delhi, Bengaluru, Jaipur, Kochi and Varanasi. These pilots are planned over the next six months or so, sources said. Officials suggested that something like this has not been tried out in other parts of the world. The Centre has been trying to launch a platform for B2B and B2C transactions for several months. The government is seeking to change the rules of the game as it believes that the current platformcentric models require buyers and sellers to be on the same platform, concentrating the market to a handful of players, said sources, adding that sellers are also not in control. If the ONDC model works out, it is seen to emerge as a rival to Amazon and Flipkart with officials hoping that like the UPI boom, large private players will come on board. “ONDC’s case is similar to e-mails, where the sender and recipient need not be on the same platform to exchange emails. Someone can be on Google, the other person can be on Yahoo,” said a source.

It also increased the cap on guests at weddings and funerals to 100 from 50 earlier. Moreover, spas have been permitted to open from 6am to 8pm at half their capacity. Swimming pools will open too, but only for those who are participating in competitions. Among other relaxations, the government has allowed the National Law University to hold its common admission test on July 23 in the state. Although the government relaxed many of the norms, it extended the lockdown by a week to July 19. Cinema operators, who have been out of business since April 30, heaved a sigh of relief. They said the decision to open cinemas was crucial to keep the entertainment industry alive. “It’s a welcome decision. We are looking forward to resuming operations at the earliest. We had been eagerly waiting for such a move as we could not make any business this year and suffered a loss of around Rs 30-35 crore,” said Sanjay Barjatya, regional head of Miraj Cinemas. He assured that all Covid safety protocols would be followed. “Since last year, all Covid norms have been in place in our theatre. All our staff have been vaccinated with at least one dose,” Barjatya said. The theatres are banking on some big releases, such as Bell Bottom, Radhe Shyam and Gangubai Kathiawadi, to recover from the losses. They have also sought a clarification from the government on night curfew so that late shows can be allowed. “We are waiting for movie schedules. Without any content, opening of cinemas makes no sense. Last year, we were showing jukeboxes and old movies and our business was badly affected. Some big movies are lined up but our industry is a national sector. The permission to open cinemas in one state will not drive movie releases,” said a PVR official. Other relaxations announced earlier will continue. Colleges will function for practical classes and examinations. Hostels can open only for students taking tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/cinemas-can-open-with-50-capacity/articleshow/84328879.cms||Akanksha Gupta

She said the pandemic has increased stress and anxiety levels in every age group hence both school mental health and stress and health have been included that will provide better employability to students. Similarly, the social work department will teach students all about the health care system, especially with respect to the Covid-19. “To make the course job oriented we have focused more on fieldwork in our new UG syllabus.

Officials said 12 fire tenders managed to douse the flames in two hours. Late on Sunday evening, residents said they could still see flames here and there. While officials from the fire department claimed that rising temperatures had triggered the blaze, municipal commissioner Mukesh Ahuja said they would need a little more time to ascertain the reason. Fire department officials said they received information about the blaze around noon. Ten fire tenders were rushed to the spot from Gurgaon while two from Faridabad joined later. “Although we managed to control the flames in two hours, smoke billowed out of the trash till evening. Firefighters have been spraying the area (spread across 30 acres) to prevent any flare-up,” said Gulshan Kalra, the additional divisional fire officer. Environmentalists raised concern about the fire’s effect on air quality levels and accused the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG) and its concessionaire, Ecogreen, of not segregating the waste at source to weed out any plastic material. Vaishali Rana Chandra, an activist, said the landfilled site was filled with plastic and other flammable material, leading to emissions of methane. “Landfills are among the highest contributors of green-house gases and Bandhwari is the biggest dumpsite of Haryana. High temperatures could have triggered the fire, which is common due to methane gas emissions. But the civic body has failed miserably in ensuring waste segregation at source,” she added. Every day, 800-1,000 tonnes of waste is added to the mountain of trash at Bandhwari. “It is clear the MCG hasn’t done anything,” Chandra said. Sanjay Sharma, the deputy CEO of Ecogreen, said they were making efforts to reduce the height of the landfill with the help of tromell machines. “Safety norms are in place at the site in keeping with NGT guidelines. It’s the natural combustion due to the presence of methane that has caused the fire,” he added. Meanwhile, MCG commissioner Ahuja said, “We controlled the fire in a timely manner. The cause has not been ascertained yet, but I have asked officials to submit a report after investigation so that such an incident is not repeated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/fire-at-bandhwari-landfill-officials-say-high-temp-caused-it/articleshow/84329065.cms||Akanksha Gupta

All sessions, other than the one for Sputnik, will continue to provide only second doses. Currently, Gurgaon has about 2,000 doses of Covishield and 5,000 doses Covaxin. Therefore, it is not giving first jabs as the stock is limited. “We have a very limited supply of vaccine doses and are focusing on second-dose recipients. We are hopeful of getting more doses in the next few days. We will also start Sputnik V shots at four different sites after we train vaccinators on handling the new vaccine,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurgaon. On Monday, 50 slots will be available at the Sector 31 polyclinic for Sputnik V. At present, Gurgaon has received component one, which is the first dose for Sputnik V.

Another 31 people were still “potentially unaccounted for”, Cava said. With no survivors rescued from the ruins since the first few hours after the collapse on June 24, officials last week declared that their search effort had switched from rescue to recovery. Working around the clock with only a few safety-related pauses, Cava said, workers have removed 6,350 tonnes of concrete and debris from the site.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/florida-building-collapse-toll-90/articleshow/84333903.cms||---

---||World||Short on vaccine, Asia fights Delta||NEW DELHI: In recent days, Indonesia has reported nearly twice as many coronavirus cases as the US. Malaysia’s per capita caseload is roughly on par with those of Brazil and Iran. And the latest Covid surges in Japan and South Korea have prompted harsh new restrictions on movement there, effective Monday. Across the Asia-Pacific region, the Delta variant is driving new outbreaks in places where transmission was once kept relatively low, but where the pace of vaccination has been too slow to contain the latest outbreaks. Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country, is a case in point. Only about 13% of its 270 million people have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and the rise of Delta is pushing its health system to the brink and forcing some patients to hunt for oxygen. The daily average of new cases — more than 33,000 as of Sunday — has continued to climb. The government has said it will administer a third dose, of the Moderna vaccine, to about 1.5 million health workers starting this week. In other Southeast Asian countries, too, the percentages of populations that have gotten even one shot are in the single or low double digits. In Myanmar, cases are sharply rising and schools have been closed until July 23. People in several Malaysian cities are chafing under strict lockdowns as the country reports the region’s highest per capita caseload. Vietnam is restricting movement in its two major cities and scrambling to import vaccines. And a terminal at Thailand’s largest international airport is being converted into a field hospital. Richer countries in the region too are vulnerable as they have made little progress in their vaccination drives. In Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea, less than one person in three has had a shot, according to a New York Times tracker. South Korea reported 1,378 new cases on Saturday, its third consecutive daily record. The government plans to raise restrictions to the highest level in Seoul as of Monday. Schools, bars and nightclubs will be shut. And in Japan, Tokyo’s fourth state of emergency will take effect on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/short-on-vaccine-asia-fights-delta/articleshow/84334028.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Despite CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan orders, pension for Bhopal gas tragedy widows yet to begin||BHOPAL: Following public outrage over a trial court decision on Bhopal gas disaster criminal liability case in which all the accused were released on bail immediately after the verdict in June 2010, the then Union government had announced a second action plan for the Bhopal gas victims in 2011, which also included monthly pension of Rs 1,000 for 5,000 women widowed in the disaster. In the course of a decade, the pension was discontinued twice.. The pension was sanctioned for 5,000 women and the number is going down with many of them dying. About a week ago, when they held a demonstration at CM's residence for the resumption of their pension, 4,474 of 5,000 women were left and now that number too has reduced by two more. The pension was first discontinued in April, 2016, after the state government exhausted the funds received from the Centre for the purpose. The gas relief officials said that the pension was sanctioned for five years only. “Pension is for life. The state government should have created a corpus for giving pension to gas widows so long as they live and if the funds received from the Centre were not enough, they should have demanded more funds or used funds received for other purposes under the second action plan,” said president of Bhopal Gas Peedit Nirashrit Pension Bhogi Manch, Balkrishna Namdeo. However, the pension discontinued in April 2016 was resumed in January, 2018, following intervention of CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan. The pension again got discontinued during erstwhile Kamal Nath government in December, 2019 and has not resumed since despite categorical assurance of the chief minister on the anniversary of gas disaster in December, 2020, that the state government would give pension to widowed gas victims from its own resources. Namdeo said that the provision of funds for the purpose was made in the budget for 2021-22, but 7 months after the chief minister's announcement, the pension has not resumed yet. Deputy secretary in the gas relief department, K K Dubey, said that a cabinet sanction was required for the pension as funds would be allocated for the purpose under a new head. The proposal has been sent to the cabinet for approval and is likely to come up in the next meeting. The pension will be given to widows of the gas disaster with effect from April 1, 2021; no matter when the proposal gets the cabinet nod in July", he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/despite-cm-shivraj-singh-chouhan-orders-pension-for-bhopal-gas-tragedy-widows-yet-to-begin/articleshow/84334082.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

---||Gurgaon||3 years on, 3 key Udyog Vihar roads are still being repaired||Gurgaon: Work on repair and widening of three major roads in the industrial hub of Udyog Vihar hasn't been completed yet, three years after the project was proposed in 2018. While the work on the widening of Shankar Road connecting Shankar Chowk to Old Delhi Road is 71 % complete, the widening of Anath Road, which links the Airtel building to Old Delhi Road, has just recently begun. Meanwhile, work on Shyam Road connecting Shyam Chowk to Old Delhi has not even started yet. In reply to an RTI filed by city-based activist Aseem Takyar, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) said the work on these three roads has been delayed due to several reasons. The widening of Shankar Road has been delayed due to delay in shifting of 11kV lines by DHBVN and encroachments in Dundahera village. “Work on the road connecting Shyam Chowk to Old Delhi Road has not yet begun due to delay in shifting of utilities by the discom, felling of trees by forest department and issues over proposed metro alignment,” stated a copy of the RTI response accessed by TOI. Work on the third stretch too has been delayed largely due to shifting of the utilities, it said. GMDA chief engineer MR Sharma could not be reached for a comment on the matter. The revamp of Shankar Road had been first proposed in the summer of 2018. In November, GMDA had begun the tendering process with a deadline of six months for completion of the work. It was also supposed to be among the first few roads in the city to get a footpath suited for the physically-challenged. While GMDA is spending Rs 7 crore on widening Shankar Road, Rs 20 crore will be spent on the redevelopment of Shyam Road and another Rs 8 crore on Anath Road. Officials said all three roads will be three-way lanes with a width of 9.9 metres on both sides of the central verge, along with footpaths and cycling tracks on both sides. The width of the cycling tracks and footpaths will be 2.5 metres. “There are a lot of labourers employed in these areas who walk or cycle to work. Hence, there will be a special emphasis on footpaths and cycling tracks to ensure their safety,” a GMDA official said. Industries based in the area have often raised this issue of heavy traffic and congestion. Responding to the complaints of heavy traffic on these stretches, GMDA had chalked out a road widening plan and a traffic management plan along with the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation. Years later, however, industries and employees are still waiting for better roads in the industrial hub.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/3-years-on-3-key-udyog-vihar-roads-are-still-being-repaired/articleshow/84329790.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Monsoon is knocking on the door, but stormwater drains nowhere near ready||Gurgaon: Residents and shopkeepers of DLF-1 have complained about inconvenience due to the ongoing construction of storm water drainage project near Arjun Marg adjoining Golf Course Road for over a month. The residents said that huge tranches have been dug up on the service lane, alleging that the contractor is not following any safety measures and blocking their right of way while carrying out the construction work. Moreover, the dug-up road has further aggravated the dust pollution in the area. Jugesh Nanda, a resident, said, “Construction has been going on at a very slow pace due to which our approach road has become inaccessible. When the work started, the authority assured us that no inconvenience would be caused but now I feel like I have been trapped in my own house. We are parking our vehicles in another block as they have left a narrow path for pedestrian movement. The work has been going on for the past one month with only 8-10 labourers at the site that too without any supervision.” With monsoon around the corner, the residents also fear that the dug-up road could lead to accidents. They further alleged that there are no warning signs or barricading at the site making it dangerous for motorists and pedestrians. “We have been facing a lot of inconvenience over the past one month and have raised the issue with the authority concerned but to no avail. They blocked the service lane from both ends making it difficult to access the road for residents and visitors alike. When I raised the issue, the contractor misbehaved with me. I have filed a police complaint on the matter,” said Vikas Gupta, another resident. The DLF is installing the storm water drainage system on 400m of the service lane adjoining Golf Course Road to tackle the waterlogging situation. Meanwhile, a representative of DLF said that they have never blocked any access and are carrying out the work in a phased manner so that no inconvenience is caused to the residents. “We are hoping to complete the drainage work within the next 15 days,” the representative said. A senior GMDA official said, “The project was started late due to delay in approvals and I have already directed the DLF management and contractor to speed up the work. However, I will look into the matter and get the work completed soon,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/monsoon-is-knocking-on-the-door-but-stormwater-drains-nowhere-near-ready/articleshow/84329804.cms||---
---||Bhubaneswar||Rath Yatra: Raths set to roll out today, curfew to keep devotees away from Puri||BHUBANESWAR: The restrictions forced by the Covid-19 pandemic could not dull the fervour of the Rath Yatra with the deities of the Jagannath temple in Puri set to embark on a nine-day journey to their birthplace, the Gundicha Temple,on Monday marking the beginning of the state’s biggest festival. While the 12th century shrine’s centuries-old rituals have remained unaffected by the pandemic, the buzz of devotees on the Grand Road or Bada Danda, as the locals call it, is missing owing to the ban on their participation in the Rath. The three km Grand Road from the Jagannath Temple right up to the Gundicha Temple used to brim with devotees erupting in joy during the Rath before Covid-19 changed everything. While Puri will remain out of bounds for tourists with the imposition of curfew from 8pm on Sunday, local residents were lucky enough to be able to offer their prayers outside the temple and touch the chariots a day before the Rath Yatra. The curfew will remain in force until 8pm on Tuesday. The hotels on both sides of the Grand Road have been vacated. “We cannot move out of our homes on Monday. To get a feel of the Rath Yatra, we went near the empty chariots a day before and paid our obeisance. We will miss the spectacle of the deities aboard the grand chariots for the second year in a row,” Subasini Tripathy, a Puri resident, said. The Singha Dwar (Lion’s Gate) in front of the Jagannath Temple was soaked in religious fervour as servitors pulled the three chariots from the Ratha Khala (where they were being made) to the main gate of the shrine amid the beating of cymbals and blowing of conches. The chief administrator of the Shree Jagannath Temple Administration visited the Govardhan Math and invited Puri Shankaracharya, Swami Nischalananda Saraswati, to offer prayers to the deities atop the chariots on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/raths-set-to-roll-out-today-curfew-to-keep-devotees-away-from-puri/articleshow/84334183.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra
---||Bhopal||Digvijaya Singh booked for protest at Govindpura land site in Bhopal||BHOPAL: Police used water cannons on a crowd led by Congress Rajya Sabha MP Digvijaya Singh on Sunday for protesting allotment of land to an outfit said to be an RSS affiliate in the Govindpura industrial area. “The 10,500sqft land allotted to Laghu Udyog Bharti is a garden according to land use in the master plan and not only him but the incumbent chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has also planted a sapling on the land”, said Digvijaya, who had heated arguments with district collector Avinash Lavania and DIG Irshad Wali, before police resorted to water cannons to disperse the crowd. According to Congress spokesperson J P Dhanopia, who was also among the protesters, office-bearers of the Govindpura Industrial Association had contacted the former chief minister on Saturday and had sought his help in cancellation of land allotment to the RSS affiliate. A ‘shilanyas’ programme was slated for Sunday for the construction of Laghu Udyog Bharti’s state headquarters and the Congress leaders led by Digvijaya had assembled at the site to stop the function. Police said the Congress leaders were repeatedly given warnings for unlawful assembly amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Later, a decision was taken to file FIRs against Digvijaya and other Congress leaders and workers. ASP Zone-2 Rajesh Singh Bhadoriya said that a case under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 269 (spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the IPC were registered against 10 people, including Digvijaya, former minister P C Sharma and around 200 unidentified Congress workers for violating Covid protocol during their protest. The case was registered at Ashoka Garden police station. Digvijaya said he would fight for the cause of industries in Govindpura. Dhanopia said that a PIL has already been moved in the high court against the allotment of land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-digvijaya-singh-booked-for-protest-at-govindpura-land-site/articleshow/84334182.cms||---
