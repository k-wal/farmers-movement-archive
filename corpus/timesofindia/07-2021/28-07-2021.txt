Blinken said in a message sent to all department employees that the vandalism is a painful reminder that antisemitism remains an issue in the US and around the world and must be combatted relentlessly. ``As this painfully reminds us, antisemitism isn't a relic of the past,'' Blinken said in the message. ``It's still a force in the world, including close to home. And it's abhorrent. It has no place in the United States, at the State Department, or anywhere else. And we must be relentless in standing up and rejecting it.'' ``We also know from our own history and from the histories of other nations that antisemitism often goes hand in hand with racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, and other hatreds,'' he said. ``None of these ideologies should have a home in our workplace or our nation.'' Blinken said the swastika, which was discovered on Monday, has been removed and the incident is being investigated. The stepson of a Holocaust survivor who was raised in the Jewish tradition, Blinken has made combatting antisemitism a priority since taking office. Last month in Berlin he and his German counterpart inaugurated a new US-Germany Holocaust Dialogue aimed at ensuring the lessons of the Nazi era are not forgotten.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/blinken-decries-swastika-vandalism-in-state-department-elevator/articleshow/84804899.cms||---

Though Parra’s bail plea was rejected early this month, the order was made public on Monday. Besides being the youth president of PDP, Parra has been a close aide of former J&K chief minister and party chief Mehbooba Mufti. He has been even charged for playing as a conduit between terrorists and Mehbooba when she would fight elections in south Kashmir from time to time, official sources said. This is for the second time in five months Parra’s bail has been rejected by the special court, which said “prima facie terror charges levelled against the accused seem to be true at this stage”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nia-court-rejects-pdp-functionarys-bail-plea/articleshow/84805660.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Police termed it as an act of “gang war”, adding that the victim belonged to “16 Gujjar Chattabal”— a “gang” from Srinagar’s downtown area. Around 11.30am, unidentified assailants opened fire at the youth, Mehran Ali Pathan, in Nawa Kadal’s Bulbul Lanker area, leaving him critically injured. Pathan was rushed to Srinagar’s SMHS Hospital, where he succumbed later. “The attack was an act of gang war, which broke out between two groups. During the gunfight, Pathan was fired upon and killed,” said a senior cop. A professional bodybuilder and gym trainer, Pathan had been earlier questioned by police in a stabbing case in Srinagar’s downtown area. He was allegedly a “ringleader” of his gang, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/srinagar/youth-gunned-down-in-srinagar-act-of-gang-war-police/articleshow/84805954.cms||M Saleem Pandit

In a statement issued on Tuesday, social activist Sukesh C Khajuria — who had lodged a complaint with NHRC in this regard — said that NHRC directed the J&K chief secretary to submit proof of payment of monetary compensation of Rs 3 lakh to the kin of each deceased infant/child within four weeks, or be prepared for personal appearance before the commission. Twelve children had died in Ramnagar, Udhampur, in November 2020 after consuming spurious cough syrup sold by the Baddi-based company. NHRC passed orders for compensation in January this year. “NHRC clarified that the said monetary compensation shall remain subject to the outcome of a petition pending before the Supreme Court of India,” Khajuria stated. NHRC also directed the UT administration that a complete report should be sent latest by August 26, 2021, to the commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/death-of-infants-nhrc-seeks-proof-of-compensation-from-jk-govt/articleshow/84806055.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||Activision workers plan walkout to protest sexism||SAN FRANCISCO: Employees at Activision Blizzard planned a work stoppage on Thursday to protest sexism at the video game company, according to a rallying cry echoing on social media. The Activision Blizzard Walkout for Equality is to last through the work day, with a live event during lunch time hours at the firm's campus in the Southern California city of Irvine. Organizers expected about 50 people to take part in the campus protest, with others joining virtually due to the Covid-19 pandemic. "It is the responsibility of leadership to stamp out toxicity and harassment in any form, across all levels of the company," Activision Blizzard chief and co-founder Mike Morhaime said in a post over the weekend. "To the Blizzard women who experienced any of these things, I am extremely sorry that I failed you." Morhaime acknowledged in the post that harassment and discrimination are prevalent in the video game industry. The call for a walkout came as workers blasted Activision Blizzard's response to a slew of sexism and harassment complaints in a letter calling its reaction "abhorrent." Employees at the company demanded that executives "recognize the seriousness of these allegations and demonstrate compassion for victims," according to the letter posted online. The letter had been signed by more than 2,000 employees by Tuesday, according to media reports. The California department of fair employment and housing filed a civil complaint last week claiming the maker of "Call of Duty" and "World of Warcraft" violated state laws by allowing a "pervasive frat boy workplace culture." In the latest case highlighting claims of sexism in the video game industry, the lawsuit said the company "fostered a sexist culture and paid women less than men," according to a statement from the state agency. Activision Blizzard pushed back on the allegations, saying that the lawsuit "includes distorted, and in many cases false, descriptions of Blizzard's past." "In cases related to misconduct, action was taken to address the issue," it said. The game company said it had been cooperative with the state agency but that it "rushed to file an inaccurate complaint, as we will demonstrate in court." The employee letter condemned the remarks made by Activision in its defense as "abhorrent and insulting." Activision did not respond to a request for comment on the letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/activision-workers-plan-walkout-to-protest-sexism/articleshow/84805730.cms||---

President Kovind said it was unfortunate that the outstanding tradition of peaceful coexistence had been broken in Kashmir."Violence, which was never part of Kashmiriyat, became a daily reality," he said, adding that Kashmir is a meeting point of various cultures. "It (violence) is alien to Kashmiri culture and it can only be termed as an aberration, a temporary one, much like a virus that attacks the body and needs to be purged. Now there is a new beginning and determined efforts to regain this land’s lost glory," he said. Kovind said democracy has the capacity to reconcile all differences and bring out the best in its citizens’ potential, and that Kashmir, happily, was realising this vision. He said almost all religions that came to Kashmir embraced the unique feature of "Kashmiriyat", which shunned orthodoxy and encouraged tolerance and mutual acceptance among communities. "I take this opportunity to urge the younger generation of Kashmir to learn from their rich legacy. They have every reason to know that Kashmir has always been a beacon of hope for the rest of India. Its spiritual and cultural influence has its imprint all across India," he added. The President congratulated KU students who were conferred degrees. "I have been told that nearly three lakh students are receiving degrees today and I am impressed by the number. With more 2.5 lakh bachelor’s degrees and more than 1,000 doctorates, the university has made remarkable progress," he said Kovind, who arrived here on a four-day visit on Sunday, interacted with members of the Unified Headquarters in Srinagar. Senior military commanders briefed him about the prevailing security situation in J&K on Monday, officials said. Kovind could not attend the function at Drass, in Ladakh, on Monday due to bad weather. However, he visited Gulmarg to encourage the armed forces on Vijay Kargil Diwas and paid homage to the Indian armed forces at the Kargil War Memorial from Gulmarg. Officials said the President was briefed about the situation along the LoC, especially in the wake of the ceasefire between India and Pakistan agreed upon in February this year. He was also briefed about counter-insurgency operations in J&K, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kashmir-bound-to-acquire-its-rightful-place-as-indias-crowning-glory-says-kovind/articleshow/84806231.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Dholavira becomes the fourth WHS in Gujarat after Champaner, Rani ki Vav in Patan, and the historic city of Ahmedabad. This is the second WHS honour for India in less than a week — Ramappa Temple in Telangana’s Warangal was granted the status on July 25. The first representation for Dholavira’s inscription was made in 2014 by the Government of India. The ancient town, found in 1967 and excavated in 1989-90 for the first time, is the second biggest Harappan site after Rakhigarhi in India. It was inhabited for about 1,200 years starting 3000 BCE, said experts. Joy erupted among archaeologists, historians, and academics in Gujarat and India after the formal announcement of Dholavira’s new title was made during the ongoing 44th session of Unesco’s World Heritage Committee. Experts said after Mohenjodaro in Pakistan, Dholavira is the second Harappan site to get the tag in south Asia and the first from India. “Absolutely delighted by this news. Dholavira was an important urban centre and is one of our most important linkages with our past,” PM Narendra Modi tweeted soon after the news broke. “It is a must visit, especially for those interested in history, culture and archaeology.” The PM also mentioned that he had visited Dholavira during his student days and was mesmerised by the place. “As CM of Gujarat, I had the opportunity to work on aspects relating to heritage conservation and restoration in Dholavira,” he tweeted. “Our team also worked to create tourism-friendly infrastructure there.” Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani termed it a proud moment for the state. Union culture minister G Kishan Reddy tweeted that Dholavira is the 40th ‘treasure’ of India to be given the Unesco WHS inscription. “Today is a proud day for India, especially for the people of Gujarat,” he tweeted. Dr R S Bisht, former deputy superintending archaeologist of the Archaeological Survey of India, who led the excavation team in 1989-90 at Dholavira, said he was delighted with the news. “The town is truly a World Heritage Site and a window to the past,” he said. “We have learnt so much about the Harappan civilisation from the site, and continue to do so.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/unesco-tags-dholavira-world-heritage-site/articleshow/84806406.cms||---
---||World||Chile's ancient mummies added to UN heritage list||Chile's Chinchorro mummies, the oldest in the world to have been purposefully preserved by humans, were added to Unesco's World Heritage List on Tuesday. The mummies, which were found in the north of Chile at the start of the 20th century, are more than 7,000 years old, meaning they pre-date the Egyptian mummies by two millennia. The United Nations' cultural organization announced on Twitter that it had added the "settlement and artificial mummification of the Chinchorro culture" to its prestigious list during a virtual meeting chaired by China. "Unesco is validating on an international level, through different experts, that the settlements and artificial mummification of the Chinchorro culture has exceptional value, that it has a global importance," Chilean anthropologist Bernardo Arriaza told AFP. The Chinchorro were fishers and hunter gatherers more than 7,000 years ago in an area where the desert and Pacific Ocean meet in what is today the south of Peru and north of Chile. So far, more than 300 mummies have been found, including red, black and bandaged ones. The mummification process consisted of removing the organs, intestines and tissue. The skin was then ripped off the corpse and the body rebuilt using sticks and animal hair, while a thick head of black hair was sewn onto the scalp. Finally the mummies were painted red or black using earth, pigments, manganese and iron oxide. "These bodies are very finely made by specialists. There's a subtlety, a creativity by these first populations," added Arriaza, who is the director of the Chinchorro Center at the Tarapaca University in the city of Arica. Why the Chichorro culture mummified their dead remains a mystery. In 2005, Arriaza developed a theory that it could have been linked to high levels of arsenic poisoning in the water that could have produced premature births, miscarriages, underweight children and high infant mortality. He suggested the mummification was "an emotional response from parents faced with these painful losses, so they painted them, dressed them up and every day this technique became more elaborate."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/chiles-ancient-mummies-added-to-un-heritage-list/articleshow/84806238.cms||---

Accor, which will open India’s first Raffles in Udaipur next Monday (August 2), will soon have 55 properties in the country, says 2022 will be a “hectic time in having hotels join the network.” Kerrie Hannaford, Accor India and South Asia VP (commercial), told TOI: “Accor pipeline is looking very positive in India. We have 52 properties operational here at the moment. Our soon-to-open Udaipur Raffles, Novotel Chandigarh and IBIS Vikhroli (Mumbai) are brand new builds. This is not like we are taking over hotels that have closed. But I have no doubt that our development team has been approached (by existing hotel owners). They have been really busy. I cannot share more at this time. As soon as the ink dries (for signing on more hotels), we’ll share.” “The development team looks at every single opportunity. We have 10 brands (economy to luxury) in India. All our brands are open for discussion and negotiation, whether it is managed or franchised agreement,” she said. Accor has the Raffles brand at the top of the pyramid in terms of luxury. Jaipur will get its own Raffles by the end of next year. In India, Accor has a tie-up with IndiGo co-founder Rahul Bhatia’s InterGlobe Enterprises for the premium economy Ibis hotels. Currently 19 Ibis are operational here, with the 20th to open in Mumbai’s Vikhroli in October and four more under development — one each in Bengaluru, Thane, Goa and Mumbai. “India is a big market with plenty of room from economy to luxury. We have terrific partnership with InterGlobe that is confident to build brand new hotels at this time. Ibis Vikhroli has 249 rooms,” Hannaford said. Among the new trends observed during the pandemic in India, is companies — especially SMEs — working from hotels. “We converted meeting rooms into work spaces. Looked at our rooms from business continuity with day use where people can come and work safely. Necessity, like always, has the mother of inventions. Safety is paramount. Takeaway food is doing well,” Another new things was allowing pets to come in some properties. “It was not that earlier pets were not allowed. There was no demand then (pre-pandemic times). Now there is a demand to travel with pets. That’s really taken off. Taking your pet with you isa thing now,” Hannaford says. Raffles Udaipur is opening on an island in the middle of Udai Sagar Lake. Udaipur is India’s prime luxury tourist market with top hotels brands. What competition does Accor feel its faces from them for Raffles there? “Raffles is an iconic brand. The Udaipur property will be the 16th Raffles in the world. India is ready to experience something that is not here. You can’t compare them to anything that’s here, its in a league of its own. It’s built on 21 acres but has only 101 rooms,” she said. “India is a very young and resilient market. But India will bounce back. It’s love for life, the big weddings, meeting friends and relatives, is tangible. The pandemic has been brutal, horrible, but it does not take the shine away from Indians’ love of life.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/accor-gets-check-in-requests-from-many-covid-hit-hotels-to-open-indias-first-raffles-in-udaipur-next-week/articleshow/84804521.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||World||Hundreds of children under care of London council abused, says report||LONDON: Hundreds of children in the care of Lambeth Council in south London were subjected to levels of cruelty and sexual abuse that were "hard to comprehend" for several decades since 1960s, a report released Tuesday has found. The independent inquiry into child sexual abuse found 705 allegations of sexual abuse against staff members and individuals connected with three care homes in the borough. Victims' accounts of sexual abuse include being photographed whilst being raped. One child was found dead in 1977 in a bathroom at Shirley Oaks, one of the three care homes which closed in 1983. Lambeth Council did not inform the coroner that he had allegedly been sexually abused by his "house father". "The true scale of the sexual abuse against children in Lambeth's care will never be known, but it is certain to be significantly higher than is formally recorded," the report said. Over the course of 40 years, only one senior member of staff was disciplined by the Council for roles in this catalogue of sexual abuse, the report noted. "These children became pawns in a toxic power game within Lambeth Council and between the Council and central government," said Professor Alexis Jay, chair of the inquiry. According to the report, Lambeth Council had a culture "dominated by politicized behavior and turmoil" during the 1980s, when "bullying, intimidation, racism, nepotism and sexism thrived within the Council, and all against a backdrop of corruption and financial mismanagement."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/hundreds-of-children-under-care-of-london-council-abused-says-report/articleshow/84806501.cms||---
---||India||Have sought time till next January for framing CAA rules: Govt to Lok Sabha||NEW DELHI: Indicating a longer wait for operationalisation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, enacted more than one-and-a-half years ago, the government on Tuesday told Lok Sabha that it had sought time until January 9, 2022, to frame the rules under the Act and notify them. In his reply to a query on whether the government is aware of missing the deadline to frame and notify CAA rules, minister of state for home Nityanand Rai said committees on subordinate legislation, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, had been requested to grant further extension of time up to January 9 next year to do so. The CAA received presidential assent on December 12, 2019 and came into force on January 10, 2020. However, foreigners covered by the Amendment Act can submit applications for grant of citizenship only after the CAA rules are notified by the central government. The government, even as it stands firm on granting citizenship to persecuted religious minorities from the three neighbouring countries — Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh — the delays remain unexplained. Some attribute multiple deadline extensions sought by the government to its preoccupation with Covid management. However, a source told TOI that some clarity from the Supreme Court, which is hearing a challenge against the CAA, is awaited on certain aspects including screening criteria. Incidentally, BJP had in its manifesto for the West Bengal assembly polls this year, declared that it would approve implementation of CAA in the first cabinet meeting to be held in the event of its win. The December 2019 enactment of CAA which seeks to grant citizenship to immigrants belonging to six religious minority communities — Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists and Parsis — had triggered nationwide protests with opposition parties and activists terming it as “anti-Muslim” and “discriminatory”. The government had, however, said Muslims, as majority populations in these countries, cannot qualify for citizenship on the grounds of religious persecution. Many linked the CAA issue with National Register of Citizens (NRC), even though the Modi government is yet to announce any intent to prepare an all-India level NRC, and accused the government of trying to oust Muslims on grounds of lacking documents to establish their Indian citizenship. The government on its part clarified that CAA had nothing to do with Muslims and only sought to benefit Hindus, Parsis, Sikhs, Christians, Jains and Buddhists by granting them Indian citizenship with a reduced minimum stay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/have-sought-time-till-next-jan-for-framing-caa-rules-govt-to-lok-sabha/articleshow/84807204.cms||---
---||India||PM reviews issue of OBC, EWS reservation in all-India quota in medical education, asks for priority resolution||NEW DELHI: In a significant move with political bearings, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday reviewed the issue of OBC and EWS reservation in all-India quota (AIQ) of medical education and directed the ministries concerned to resolve the issue on priority. According to government sources, the demand for the quota was discussed in the meeting attended by Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, Health Minister Mansukh Mandavia and relevant secretaries as well as other senior officials. The strong push from the Prime Minister needs to be seen in the context of recent developments like the reshuffle of the Union council of ministers where the government and BJP highlighted the enhanced representation of OBCs. It also comes at a time when the Centre has moved to undo the Supreme Court's ruling that state lists of OBCs will be drawn up by the central government. The clear pro-OBC push, seen in the light of forthcoming elections in states like UP where Mandal politics has dominated till recently, and in the context of the next national elections, reveals the political priorities of BJP. Looking to consolidate the OBC support it has received, BJP would like to seriously undermine its caste-based rivals. The EWS reference is a balancing act, something a pan-national party would consider, to avoid alienating the forwards. OBC reservation in AIQ of medical education has been a long standing demand of medical aspirants. Several litigations have also been submitted in various courts of the country but the issue has been pending for a long time. PM Modi, said sources, desired that the issue of OBC reservation in the AIQ of medical education may be resolved by the ministries concerned on priority. The AIQ seats in medicine were created on the directions of the Supreme Court in 1984. All states were required to surrender 15% undergraduate and 50% postgraduate medical and dental seats in state-run colleges to a “central pool” with the rest going to a “state pool”. So far for admission, SC and ST have reservations in this quota, but there is no reservation for OBCs. In 2019, the Centre government had announced 10% reservations in government jobs and higher education for economically weaker sections in the general category. According to a response to a written question in Parliament, the ministry of health and family welfare had increased 5,200 MBBS seats under the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) reservation quota in medical colleges. “These seats have been increased in state government's colleges, state government-aided society-run colleges, municipal corporation's colleges and colleges set up on private public mode (PPP mode) for the academic session 2019-20,” former minister of state for health Ashwinin Kumar Choubey had said. The PM also asked the health ministry to review the position of implementation of EWS reservation by various states for medical education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-reviews-issue-of-obc-ews-reservation-in-all-india-quota-in-medical-education-asks-for-priority-resolution/articleshow/84807275.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain

---||World||CDC reverses course on indoor masks in some parts of US||The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reversed course Tuesday on some masking guidelines, recommending that even vaccinated people return to wearing masks indoors in parts of the US where the coronavirus is surging.  Citing new information about the ability of the delta variant to spread among vaccinated people, the CDC also recommended indoor masks for all teachers, staff, students and visitors to schools, regardless of vaccination status.  The new guidance follows recent decisions in Los Angeles and St. Louis to revert to indoor mask mandates amid a spike in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations that have been especially bad in the South. The country is averaging more than 57,000 cases a day and 24,000 Covid-19 hospitalizations.  Most new infections in the US continue to be among unvaccinated people. But "breakthrough" infections, which generally cause milder illness, can occur in vaccinated people. When earlier strains of the virus predominated, infected vaccinated people were found to have low levels of virus and were deemed unlikely to spread the virus much, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said.  But with the delta variant, the level of virus in infected vaccinated people is "indistinguishable" from the level of virus in the noses and throats of unvaccinated people, Walensky said.  The data emerged over the last couple of days from 100 samples. It is unpublished, and the CDC has not released it. But "it is concerning enough that we feel like we have to act," Walensky said.  Vaccinated people "have the potential to spread that virus to others," she said.  For much of the pandemic, the CDC advised Americans to wear masks outdoors if they were within 6 feet of one another.  Then in April, as vaccination rates rose sharply, the agency eased its guidelines on the wearing of masks outdoors, saying that fully vaccinated Americans no longer needed to cover their faces unless they were in a big crowd of strangers. In May, the guidance was eased further for fully vaccinated people, allowing them to stop wearing masks outdoors in crowds and in most indoor settings.  The guidance still called for wearing masks in crowded indoor settings, like buses, planes, hospitals, prisons and homeless shelters, but it cleared the way for reopening workplaces and other venues.  Subsequent CDC guidance said fully vaccinated people no longer needed to wear masks at summer camps or at schools, either.  For months Covid cases, deaths and hospitalizations were falling steadily, but those trends began to change at the beginning of the summer as the delta variant, a mutated and more transmissible version of the virus, began to spread widely, especially in areas with lower vaccination rates. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the delta variant has changed the nation's Covid-19 outlook since the the CDC relaxed masking recommendations.  "That is their job. Their job is to look at evolving information, evolving data, an evolving historic pandemic and provide guidance to the American public," Psaki said.  "What has not changed," she added, "is the fact that people who are vaccinated have a huge deal of protection from serious illness, from hospitalization and from death."  Some public health experts said they thought the earlier CDC decision was based on good science, which indicated that the risk of vaccinated people spreading the virus was relatively low and that the risk of them catching the virus and becoming extremely ill was even lower.  But those experts were also critical, noting that there was no call for Americans to document their vaccination status, which created an honor system. Unvaccinated people who did not want to wear masks in the first place saw it as an opportunity to do what they wanted, they said.  "If all the unvaccinated people were responsible and wore mask indoors, we would not be seeing this surge," said Dr. Ali Khan, a former CDC disease investigator who now is dean of the University of Nebraska's College of Public Health.  Lawrence Gostin, a public health law professor at Georgetown University, drew a similar conclusion.  "It was completely foreseeable that when they (the CDC) made their announcement, masking would no longer be the norm, and that's exactly what's happened," Gostin said.  The CDC may be seen as "flip-flopping," he said, because there's been no widely recognized change in the science, he said. Furthermore, it's not likely to change the behavior of the people who most need to wear masks.  "I don't think you can effectively walk that back," he said.  Ken Thigpen, a retired respiratory therapist who now works for a medical device manufacturer, is fully vaccinated and stopped wearing his mask in public after the CDC changed its guidance in May. But he started to reconsider in the last week after his job took him to hospitals in Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama and Florida, where he witnessed medical centers getting inundated with COVID-19 patients.  "That delta variant is intense. It is so transmissible that we have to do something to tamp it down," he said.  "I loved it when I could call the hospitals and they said, 'We actually closed our Covid ward today or we are down to two COVID patients,'" he recalled. "And now we are opening the wards back up, and the numbers are going nuts."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/cdc-reverses-course-on-indoor-masks-in-some-parts-of-us/articleshow/84807613.cms||---

These disputes, according to available information, are between Haryana-Himachal Pradesh, UT of Ladakh-Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra-Karnataka, Assam-Arunachal Pradesh, Assam-Nagaland, Assam-Meghalaya and Assam-Mizoram. In reply to a query in the Lok Sabha, minister of state for home Nityanand Rai said that occasional protests and incidents of violence were reported from some of the disputed border areas. To a specific query on the role of the central government in redressing inter-state border disputes in the country, he replied that the approach of the Centre has consistently been that inter-state disputes can be resolved only with the cooperation of the state governments concerned and that the central government acts only as a facilitator for amicable settlement of the dispute in the spirit of mutual understanding. The chief ministers of Assam and Mizoram had sparred on Twitter on Monday after violent clashes broke out between border residents of both states in Cachar. Though home minister Amit Shah, who was tagged by both the chief ministers in their tweets, did step in to cool tempers and advised them over multiple phone calls to resolve the issue through talks, the situation on the ground turned violent, leading to death of six Assam police personnel in firing. Later chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said there was evidence that Mizos had used light machine gun fire on the Assam police personnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/7-cases-of-running-border-disputes-between-two-states-govt-tells-ls/articleshow/84807539.cms||---

He also denied that any Covid patient had died due to a delay in being provided an ICU bed. Pandey was replying to a starred question raised by Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra in the Vidhan Parishad on the second day of the monsoon session. Mishra said a large number of Covid patients had died in the second wave and claimed that over 30% of these deaths were due to infections in the ICU as equipment was not properly sterilised and hygiene not maintained. He also claimed that Covid deaths had occurred due to a lack of oxygen and failure to provide ICU facilities. He claimed these problems had been pointed out by doctors at AIIMS Patna during a training programme for healthcare workers where health minister Pandey and junior Union minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey were also present. However, the health minister clarified that the doctors at the training session raised such issues to make healthcare workers aware of problems that could occur. He said the government was taking all necessary steps to strengthen health infrastructure. Mishra also alleged that a large number of bodies were thrown into the Ganga. Earlier, RJD MLC Sunil Kumar Singh had demanded a discussion on Covid-19 and preparations for a possible third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-death-in-bihar-due-to-oxygen-shortage-mantri/articleshow/84807542.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The move is the latest upset to the country’s vaccine rollout, which has been derailed by a Senate committee investigation into potential corruption in the process of procuring vaccines. Anvisa said it decided to suspend “the exceptional and temporary authorisation for import and distribution” after Bharat Biotech last week terminated an agreement with its local partner Precisa to represent it in Brazil. Bharat Biotech did not have any immediate comment. It said the import permit, which was issued on June 4, would be suspended until Anvisa receives additional information about the vaccine, including technical and legal documents related to the shot. Bharat Biotech did not have any immediate comment. "The decision also took into account that illegitimate documents may have been submitted ... which could impact the agency's conclusions regarding the quality, safety and efficacy aspects of the vaccine to be administered to the population," Anvisa's statement said. Based on an indicative price per dose of $15, Bharat's contract to supply 20 million shots to the Brazilian government would be valued at $300 million. Bharat Biotech terminated a memorandum of understanding to sell its Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin via a parternship with Precisa in Brazil last week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/brazil-suspends-bharat-biotech-imports-permit/articleshow/84807656.cms||---

In the week ending July 26, around 54 districts reported Covid-19 positivity rate at above 10%, up from 46 districts in the previous week (July 14-20). Health officials warned that though the majority of these districts are currently concentrated in Kerala and north-east indicating localized transmission, strict containment measures are required as many countries including Malaysia and Thailand are witnessing a sharp uptick in cases. “If we look from a global perspective, the pandemic is far from over. There is a noticeable increase in the number of cases across the world, which remains the area of concern. We have to work on containing the spread of the virus with strictness,” Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry said. The 22 districts where daily cases are showing an increasing trend include seven from Kerala, five from Manipur, three in Meghalaya and two from Maharashtra. As per the data shared, there are still 62 districts in the country where over 100 cases are reported every day, which are found in a localized and limited set of areas of these districts. Average daily new cases declined from 3,87,029 cases between May 5- 11 to 38,090 cases between July 21-27. However, there is a significant reduction in rate of decline in new cases week-on-week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-concerned-over-22-districts-showing-rising-trend-in-daily-new-cases/articleshow/84807943.cms||---

The study was conducted on 15 lakh doctors and frontline workers in AFMC who were administered with Covishield. “Protection to the extent of 93% was seen (in people who were administered Covishield) and this was during the second wave which was driven by the Delta variant ... also 98% mortality reduction was seen,” Niti Aayog member, health, Dr V K Paul said underlining the role of vaccination to protect against death as well as infection. He, however, also highlighted the need to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour as no vaccine alone can guarantee protection against the infection. “No vaccine guarantees that infection will not happen but serious disease gets prevented and nearly eliminated,” he said. Underlining that all vaccines available in India are effective against Delta variant, officials said the Indian Council of Medical Research is also studying their effectiveness against the Delta Plus variant and results are being analysed and will be shared soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covishield-generates-93-protection-says-afmc-study/articleshow/84807845.cms||---

The researchers from University College London (UCL) in the UK noted that if the antibody levels carry on dropping at this rate, there are concerns that the protective effects of the vaccines may also begin to wear off, particularly against new variants. However, they said, how soon that might happen cannot be predicted yet. The UCL Virus Watch study also found that antibody levels are substantially higher following two doses of the Pfizer vaccine than after two shots of the AstraZeneca preventive, known as Covishield in India. Antibody levels were also much higher in vaccinated people than those with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, they said. "The levels of antibody following both doses of either the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccine were initially very high, which is likely to be an important part of why they are so protective against severe Covid-19," said Madhumita Shrotri from UCL Institute of Health Informatics. "However, we found these levels dropped substantially over the course of two to three months," Shrotri said in a statement. The findings based on data from over 600 people aged 18 and above were consistent across all groups of people regardless of age, chronic illnesses or sex, according to the researchers. The authors highlight that although the clinical implications of waning antibody levels are not yet clear, some decline was expected and current research shows that vaccines remain effective against severe disease. For Pfizer, antibody levels reduced from a median of 7506 Units per millilitre (U/mL) at 21–41 days, to 3320 U/mL at 70 or more days. For AstraZeneca vaccine, antibody levels reduced from a median of 1201 U/mL at 0–20 days to 190 U/mL at 70 or more days, over five-fold reduction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lancet-pfizer-astrazeneca-antibody-levels-start-waning-after-six-weeks/articleshow/84808281.cms||---

---||India||US secretary of state in India; will meet PM, Jaishankar today||NEW DELHI: US secretary of state Anthony Blinken on his first visit to India will meet foreign minister S Jaishankar for discussions on Wednesday at a time when the US withdrawal from Afghanistan may be plunging the country into civil war, and when the China challenge has become acute for both US and India. This will be the fourth meeting between the two leaders. Blinken is the third senior US official to visit India this year, having been preceded by the defence secretary Lloyd Austin and special envoy for climate, John Kerry. Biden and Modi have met virtually on three occasions thus far — at the virtual Quad summit, the climate leaders’ meet and the G-7 summit. Blinken’s first meeting of the morning will be with NSA Ajit Doval. He will call on the Prime Minister late afternoon before leaving India. Afghanistan and the Quad will take up a lot of the discussions on Wednesday. The fallout of the US withdrawal is having an impact on all countries surrounding Afghanistan, while India believes it is providing Pakistan with another opportunity to continue its support to terror groups targeting India and Afghanistan. This was affirmed by the US side, which said the US and India were “closely coordinating” on Afghanistan. Since the foreign and defence ministers are scheduled to meet in the US this autumn for the 2+2 ministerial, sources in the Indian government said, defence trade and technologies as well as exercises will be part of the discussions. According to a statement by the US state department, the US has “authorised over $20 billion in defence sales to India.” A Quad foreign ministers’ meeting may be scheduled soon, while the US is hoping to host an in-person Quad summit in Washington in September-October. The US side has indicated that they would raise the issue of human rights and violations of civil rights by the government, after reports of hacking and snooping phones of opposition members, activists and journalists using the Israeli Pegasus software became public. The issue has roiled the media as well as Parliament, with opposition parties obstructing functioning of the legislature on the subject. The government has pushed back against potential US activism on this matter. Government sources said this week, “Issues such as human rights and democracy are universal and extend beyond a particular national or cultural perspective. India is proud of its achievements in both domains and is always glad to share experiences. As a long-standing pluralistic society, India is open to engaging those who now recognise the value of diversity.” The Blinken visit has got top billing by the Indian government with the US as its top international partner. Sources here said, the visit would “be an opportunity to further consolidate bilateral cooperation across a vast agenda. Issues like augmenting trade and investment, and tapping opportunities in healthcare, education, digital domain, innovation and security, will be important elements of the conversation.” Covid management and helping economies recover will also depend on whether the Quad — of which US and India and members — can manufacture enough vaccines in time for countries in the Indo-Pacific. It is currently a difficult time as most of these countries are in their third wave of the coronavirus, while India has stopped exporting its vaccines to concentrate its production for vaccinating its own population. However, continuing the conversation he started when he visited the US in May, Jaishankar is expected to push the US to keep supply chains open for ingredients for vaccine manufacture. India will be opening up its vaccine production for global supplies in a few months, sources believe, certainly by early 2022. Officials here said India will push for resumption of international travel, with protective protocols in place, this being key to resuming economic activity “especially easing mobility of students, professionals, business travellers, family reunions, humanitarian cases, etc. The need for resilient supply chains of critical medicines and healthcare equipment is likely to come up.” Climate change is a priority area for both countries and some attention will be paid to this, sources said. On a global scale, Blinken and Jaishankar are expected to touch on some of the pressing issues demanding attention —“political and cultural rebalancing are important trends. India supports a truly multipolar, democratic and diverse world order and expects international conversations to reflect this evolution. We believe in equity and fairness, whether in development, climate change or global decision-making.” Watch US secretary of state Anthony Blinken in India||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/us-secretary-of-state-in-india-will-meet-pm-jaishankar-today/articleshow/84808069.cms||---

The 95-page rejoinder to the NHRC-appointed committee’s 3,428-page report, filed in the Calcutta high court, says the committee has stepped beyond the brief given by the court and — in its haste to conduct a “witch-hunt” — has questioned the judiciary in the state and even the Election Commission besides the state government and the police. “The committee has been deliberately constituted to spearhead a witch-hunt against the entire state machinery in Bengal,” the affidavit by state home secretary BP Gopalika says. The NHRC chairperson “abused the process” and “appointed only those members interested in conducting a hatchet job against a democratically elected government” while he was expected “to form a non-partisan and fair committee,” the affidavit adds. The affidavit also provides the background of three committee members — Rajiv Jain, Atif Rasheed and Rajuben L Desai — to harp on the “relationship they share with the BJP or the Central government”. It alleges that committee members “have converted this inquiry into a political theatre for their political benefit”. The committee members have treated this inquiry as a tool to exercise their political vendetta,” the affidavit states, adding that it has ignored “all principles of fair play and non-partisanship”. The committee’s “concerted efforts to completely discredit a democratically elected state government are a death knell to democracy in this great nation”, the affidavit says in response to the NHRC committee’s “law of ruler instead of rule of law” barb against the state government. The state government, the affidavit adds, “is entitled to cross-examine the members of the committee and compel them to prove the veracity of the statements made in the report”. The recommendations of a CBI probe and shifting the trial outside Bengal are examples of the panel’s clear “bias” and exceeding its mandate, the affidavit says. The panel, by not giving reasons why the trial should be shifted outside Bengal, “has opined that the judiciary in the state is complicit in the purported acts of violence”. The panel’s “questioning bail” to accused persons is meant to “raise allegations of bias against the judiciary as well”, the affidavit adds, explaining that bail is given “by a competent court and is not in the hands of the police”. None of the bail orders had “recorded any adverse comments” against police, the affidavit says. The state affidavit also questions the legal understanding and maths behind “general and sweeping allegations against the police” and says the committee’s stress on arrests is contrary to legal norms. The “Election Commission declared that the election was free and fair”, the affidavit states, adding that the panel’s allegations of a “pernicious politico-bureaucratic-criminal nexus” contradict “the EC’s stand without any basis”. The affidavit mentions 465 people recorded their statements in the presence of judicial magistrates and many more spoke to cops to question the NHRC committee’s assertion that post-poll violence victims were too scared to speak. The committee saw “fear in the eyes of the people” because its own eyes were “biased,” it adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//web-stories/india/perverse-and-politically-motivated-bengal-on-nhrc-report-on-violence/articleshow/84807448.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

The results, released on Wednesday by global higher education consultancy QS Quacquarelli Symonds in its ‘QS Best Student Cities Ranking 2022,’ sees London extend its table-topping run to three years, while Munich replaced Tokyo for the second place. Seoul climbed seven places to share the third position with Tokyo. Bangalore has been named among the top-10 most affordable cities for students, while Mumbai ranks 52nd globally in the “employer activity” indicator, according to the rankings. With students globally seeking to resume their international study plans, these rankings are aimed at providing students with independent data regarding a range of factors driving their study decisions – affordability, quality of life and the standard of university. Though Bangalore lost three places in the affordability indicator, yet it remains firmly among the top 10, placed seventh globally in this metric. Featuring among the top 100, Mumbai ranks 52nd globally in the “employer activity” indicator, another key metric. Overall, Mumbai (106th) and Bangalore (110th) are India’s entry in the rankings for best student cities for 2022. Both cities dropped compared to the previous editions losing twenty-nine places and twenty-one places respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/qs-rankings-mumbai-52nd-among-100-on-student-employability/articleshow/84808259.cms||Manash Pratim Gohain

BSP, RLP, SAD, National Conference, CPI and CPI(M), besides NCP, are the signatories to the letter. The main opposition party Congress is not among the signatories. “We are writing to you to seek an appointment to apprise you of two disturbing developments including the complete stonewalling of demands of the peasantry to repeal the three farm laws as well as use of Israeli spyware Pegasus,” the letter read. SAD’s Harsimrat Badal said it is “unfortunate” that farmers have died while protesting but the Centre is not ready to discuss their issues. The use of Pegasus software “to tape telephone numbers of politicians, journalists and activists besides known detractors of the NDA government has sent shockwaves amongst civil society”, the letter to President Kovind said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/seven-parties-write-to-president-on-farm-bills-pegasus/articleshow/84808416.cms||---

In August, supplies of Covishield from Serum Institute of India (SII) are seen to increase to about 12-13 crore doses per month from 10 crore at present. Bharat Biotech — which is currently supplying around 2 crore doses of Covaxin per month — is projected to deliver around 2.5 crore doses, a senior official said. Pointing out that some of the vaccine supplies are always in the pipeline, the government said that all that is produced is not immediately administered. “We produce and we inject, and when we produce, part of the vaccines are going through testing at the CDL lab, and the batches are released in a certain way. In terms of visibility, we are visualising to the tune of about 15 crore,” Niti Aayog member, health, Dr V K Paul said, adding supply estimates may change and some jabs are always in the pipeline. Times ViewPrivate hospitals are important partners in vaccination. But since they are unable to vaccinate in proportion to the quota they receive, it makes little sense to persist with a 25% quota.Earlier government projections had to be revised as some batches of Covaxin produced in a new facility of Bharat Biotech recently failed to meet stability parameters. Officials said the issues have been resolved now and the supplies will start picking up soon and the projections can be revised again in future. So far, a total of 45.7 crore doses have been supplied to the states and UTs since January. Besides, an additional around 6 crore doses are expected to be supplied by 31st July. This will amount to a total of 51.7 crore doses supplied so far. With the current momentum of vaccination, officials are expecting to achieve a total of around 47-48 crore doses by end of July. With a visibility of 15 crore doses, the average daily vaccinations during August is pegged at 50 lakh doses, up from an average of around 44 lakh doses in July. Over 44.5 crore doses have been administered across the country till Tuesday 7pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//web-stories/india/15-crore-doses-of-vaccine-to-be-available-in-august-says-govt/articleshow/84808133.cms||Sushmi Dey

The CM, in a series of tweets, denied the allegations of wrongdoing and favouritism, terming them as “baseless”, and defended the government’s move to take over the college located in Durg. The row erupted after a newspaper reported that the Congress government is to introduce a bill in the assembly to acquire the Chandulal Chandrakar Memorial Medical College. “This (the bill) is an attempt to save the future of a medical college and hundreds of students in the state,” the CM wrote on Twitter. As far as kinship and vested interests are concerned, I want to tell the people of my state that Bhupesh Baghel is accountable to them and he has always done politics with transparency. There will always be transparency in the government. Once the deal is done, everything will be clear,” he said. The CM said his government is guided only by public interest. “This controversy has emerged from imagination. I challenge this. If there is a question of public interest, the government will also buy a private medical college and (steel) plant at Nagarnar,” said Baghel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/baghel-govt-bjp-spar-over-bid-to-take-over-private-medical-college/articleshow/84808634.cms||---

Emphasising that vaccines available in the system are being utilised completely, officials said the Centre as well as state governments are working with private hospitals to ensure increased accessibility and availability across the country. “States have been asked to motivate as well as facilitate private sector. Required hand-holding is being done to ensure private sector expands vaccination and so that the outreach is wider,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry. The government said it is working with the private sector to address the concerns about the slow utilisation of available jabs and ensure that vaccination picks up pace at these hospitals. “Whatever is being manufactured is being manufactured is being inoculated and efforts are being made to ensure the partnership is expanded,” Niti Aayog member, health, Dr VK Paul said. While 25% of the total locally manufactured jabs are earmarked for the private sector, the vaccine uptake at private hospitals continues to be minuscule, raising concerns about unutilised stocks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/private-sector-key-to-ramping-up-vaccination-drive-govt/articleshow/84808809.cms||---

RJD MLA from Maner Bhai Virendra had said, "Khela shooru ho chuka hai. Aage aage dekhte jaeeye hota hai kya" (The game has already started. See what happens next). He was reacting to the statement of Vikassheel Insaan Party chief and state animal husbandry and fisheries resources minister Mukesh Sahani on Monday that smaller parties were not being given due respect by the two big constituents of the NDA — BJP and JD(U). Reacting to Virendra’s claim, Kushwaha said they (RJD) should first set their own house in order and then think of a new government formation. "Koi agar diwa swapna dekhta hai to dekhe. Hum use kaise rok sakte hain?" (If anyone believes in daydreaming, how can we stop him) he said.

---||World||Senators, White House in talks to finish infrastructure bill||WASHINGTON: Senators and the White House were locked in intense negotiations Tuesday to salvage a bipartisan infrastructure deal, with pressure mounting on all sides to wrap up talks and show progress on President Joe Biden's top priority.  Despite weeks of closed-door discussions, senators from the bipartisan group blew past a Monday deadline set for agreement on the nearly $1 trillion package. They hit serious roadblocks over how much would be spent on public transit and water infrastructure and whether the new spending on roads, bridges, broadband and other projects would be required to meet federal wage requirements for workers. They're also at odds over drawing on Covid-19 funds to help pay for it.  Republican negotiator Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who took the lead in key talks with a top White House aide, insisted the bipartisan group was "making progress." Biden struck a similarly upbeat tone, telling reporters at the White House he remained optimistic about reaching a compromise.  But as talks drag on, anxious Democrats, who have slim control of the House and Senate, face a timeline to act on what would be some of the most substantial legislation in years. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told senators Tuesday they should be prepared to work through the weekend to finish the bill.  Biden met Tuesday morning with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, one of the Democrats' leaders in the infrastructure bargaining, at the White House to discuss the talks, said two people who acknowledged the session only on condition of anonymity.  White House press secretary Jen Psaki said after the president's meeting with Sinema, "They are very much aligned on the path forward."  Psaki said the administration is "not setting new deadlines" for a deal, but sees "good signs."  The White House wants a bipartisan agreement for this first phase, before Democrats go it alone to tackle broader priorities in a bigger $3.5 trillion budget plan that's on deck. A recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC found 8 in 10 Americans favor some increased infrastructure spending, and the current package could be a political win for all sides as lawmakers try to show voters that Washington can work. Securing the bipartisan bill is also important for some centrist Democrats before engaging in the broader undertaking.  The House will also have a chance to weigh in on the legislation if it clears the Senate.  At a private meeting of House Democrats on Tuesday, the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee called the infrastructure measure that senators of both parties are struggling to complete "crap," according to two Democrats who attended the session. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said the Senate effort was being led by "three Republicans" - Portman, Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sinema, D-Ariz., a centrist distrusted by some Democrats.  DeFazio's remarks illustrated the tensions between Democrats in the two chambers over the budget talks. The Democrats spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the closed-door session.  The bipartisan package includes about $600 billion in new spending on public works projects, with broad support from Republicans and Democrats for many of the proposed ideas.  Yet there was little to show Monday after a grinding weekend of talks, putting the deal at risk of stalling out.  The Democrats and the White House had sent what they called a "global" offer to Republicans on remaining issues late Sunday, according to a Democratic aide close to the talks and granted anonymity to discuss them.  But Republicans rebuffed the ideas, saying the new proposal attempted to reopen issues that had already been resolved, according to a GOP aide also granted anonymity to discuss the talks.  Collins said it's time for Biden to become more involved. "I think it's imperative that the president indicates strongly that he wants a bipartisan package," she said.  While much of the disagreement has been over the size of spending on each category, labor issues have also emerged as a flashpoint.  Democrats are insisting on a prevailing-wage requirement, not just for existing public works programs but also for building new roads, bridges, broadband and other infrastructure, according to another Republican granted anonymity to discuss the private talks.  At the same time, transit funding has been a stubborn source of disagreement.  Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, the top Republican on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, which oversees public transit, raised questions about the size of the transit funding increase. He cited, in part, previous COVID-19 federal relief money that had already been allocated to public transit.  Democrats and public transit advocates don't want spending to go any lower than what's typically been a federal formula of about 80% for highways and 20% for transit. They see expanded public transit systems as key to easing traffic congestion and combating climate change.  The senators also appeared to still be debating money for public water works and removal of lead pipes after Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, raised questions about the amount.  Also unresolved is how to pay for the bipartisan package after Democrats rejected a plan to bring in funds by hiking the gas tax drivers pay at the pump and Republicans dashed a plan to boost the IRS to go after tax scofflaws.  Funding could come from repurposing Covid relief aid, reversing a Trump-era pharmaceutical rebate and other streams. It's possible the final deal could run into political trouble if it doesn't pass muster as fully paid for when the Congressional Budget Office assesses the details.  The final package would need the support of 60 senators in the evenly split 50-50 Senate to advance past a filibuster - meaning at least 10 Republicans along with every Democratic member. A test vote last week failed along party lines as Republicans sought more time to negotiate.  Meanwhile, Democrats are readying the broader $3.5 trillion package, which would go beyond public works to include child care centers, family tax breaks and other priorities. It is being considered under budget rules that allow passage with 51 senators in the split Senate, with Vice President Kamala Harris able to break a tie. That package would be paid for by increasing the corporate tax rate and the tax rate on Americans earning more than $400,000 a year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/senators-white-house-in-talks-to-finish-infrastructure-bill/articleshow/84809175.cms||---

Reynoso has also served as the co-chair of the White House Gender Policy Council, a role that has her advocating on behalf of women and girls in the US and around the globe. She is expected to remain in her current role until she is confirmed by the Senate. A successor has not been named, according to the first lady's spokesman Michael LaRosa. The first lady said when she met Reynoso in 2019 they ``immediately clicked.'' ``We stayed in touch, and I knew if we came to the White House, that I wanted her as my Chief of Staff,`` Jill Biden said in a statement. ``She's been exceptional and an incredible leader and friend. Given her experience and her heart, I can think of no one better than Julissa to represent us in Spain and Andorra.`` Reynoso served as an ambassador to Uruguay and a senior State Department official during the Obama-Biden administration. She was already being considered for a top job at the State Department when the first lady recruited her to join her team.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/jill-bidens-chief-of-staff-nominated-for-spain-ambassador/articleshow/84809136.cms||---

Everyone knows my character and my family. I don’t think it’s justified to be present in this august House until the government gives a clear reply on the issue,” Singhdeo announced and walked out even as the opposition BJP demanded a probe by an assembly committee into the allegations levelled against Singhdeo by Congress legislator Brihaspati Singh. Singh had on Sunday gone public with his fear of threat to his life after a group of men waylaid a vehicle in his convoy and smashed its windscreen in an apparent road rage incident in Ambikapur. A relative of the health minister was among three suspects arrested. Singhdeo said law would take its course, but it did little to end the controversy. Chhattisgarh home minister Tamradwaj Sahu on Tuesday read out a statement, narrating the incident and the action taken by police, but BJP members demanded a statement from the government “on the situation arising out of tribal legislator’s claim about a threat to his life”. Amidst the din, TS Singhdeo stood up and left the House. The crisis in Congress has spiralled out of control ever since Brihaspati Singh went public with his claim that Singhdeo was irked with him for praising CM Bhupesh Baghel and saying he “may well remain CM for 25 years”. AICC general secretary in charge of Chhattisgarh PL Punia met Singhdeo and Singh separately, but it appears the issue could not be resolved. Punia on Tuesday said he will serve a showcause notice on Brihaspati over his allegations. “He (Brihaspati) claimed TS Singhdeo wanted to kill him. But he didn't say this before the IG, home minister, or chief minister. I think he said this in a fit of emotion,” Punia said. “Singh Deo's statement, before walking out of the assembly, was also an emotional step. A solution will be found. I have talked to Singhdeo and chief minister Bhupesh Baghel,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/crisis-hits-congress-government-in-chhattisgarh-as-minister-mla-trade-charges/articleshow/84808868.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||BSY’s trusted aide Basavaraj Bommai to be new Karnataka chief minister||BENGALURU: Outgoing chief minister B S Yediyurappa's close confidant and state’s home minister Basavaraj Bommai is to be the 20th CM of Karnataka. He will be sworn in on Wednesday. Bommai’s elevation to the top post keeps two key constituents for BJP — Lingayat community and Yediyurappa — happy. As a Lingayat himself, Bommai will be acceptable to the politically influential community and by choosing him, the BJP high command seems to have rewarded Yediyurappa for walking graciously and promising to work for the party. The 61-year-old three-time MLA from Shiggaon in Haveri district in north Karnataka is the son of late former chief minister and ex-Union minister S R Bommai. It makes the Bommais the second father-son duo after H D Deve Gowda and H D Kumaraswamy to become chief ministers in the state. Bommai Senior was the CM for nine months in 1989. An engineering graduate who started out by working for the Tatas in Pune, Bommai’s name was not prominent among those thought to be in the reckoning for chief minister until Tuesday. But Yediyurappa's support, according to BJP insiders, tilted the balance in favour of Bommai. "It is a masterstroke by Yediyurappa and a putdown to his detractors who raised a banner of revolt against him with an eye on the CM's chair," said a BJP MLA. Bommai took the blessings of Yediyurappa by touching his feet immediately after his name was announced. Read Also'Will win everyone's trust': Basavaraj Bommai to take oath as Karnataka CM todayBasavaraj Bommai, a close aide of BS Yediyurappa, will be the next chief minister of Karnataka. Bommai will take oath as chief minister at 11am on July 28. The decision to appoint Bommai as Yediyurappa's successor was taken during BJP legislature meeting held in Bengaluru. His name was proposed inThe duo later called on governor Thaawarchand Gehlot and staked claim to form the government. Originally from the Janata Parivar, Bommai's selection for the coveted post also marked a new beginning in BJP as it came against a popular assumption that outsiders cannot aspire for big posts in the party or its governments. Bommai joined BJP just before the 2008 assembly elections. He served as water resources minister between 2008 and 2013 and home minister from July 2019. For the past two years, Bommai was literally Yediyurappa’s trusted No. 2 with the latter depending on him for day-to-day administration. It is being said that the BJP central leadership was impressed with Bommai's administrative acumen. He also built bridges with the central leadership with his constant interaction with them and as Yediyurappa's representative for the last two years. His performance at the GST council meetings also received a lot of appreciation by the high command, sources said. BJP has, in recent days, leaned towards unconventional candidates for key positions from Karnataka, including in the Rajya Sabha and the Union Cabinet. So, there was an expectation that it may spring a surprise. But Bommai's choice indicated the party’s keenness to protect the Lingayat vote base rather than indulge in experiments, and also to keep Yediyurappa happy. Bommai, belonging to the less powerful Sadar subsect of the Lingayats, is expected to keep the Lingayat vote base intact. "Though the community is still hurt with the resignation of Yediyurappa, this is an appropriate and good selection." said H M Renuka Prasanna, secretary of the All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha, welcoming the party’s decision. Bommai’s loyalists are hopeful that he would gain acceptance because the community in the second half of the 1980s supported his father, who lost power in an unceremonious way when his government was dismissed. The S R Bommai case that the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the late leader is cited as the important case study in Centre-state relationship.

Officials say thousands of people have lost their homes to creeping encroachment by violent gangs into central and southern parts of the city, where urban sprawl envelops more than 2.5 million people. "I've got no future in this country as a young man. I'm in an unstable situation, I can't build a home, the situation is really critical," said one youth, staying at a shelter in the Delmas 5 neighborhood of Port-au-Prince. Like others who spoke to Reuters at the center, which gives refuge to some 1,800 people, he declined to give his name for fear of reprisals from gangs. Gang violence in Haiti, the poorest nation in the Americas, increasingly marred Moise's rule before he was shot dead in his official residence on July 7. The government says the attack was carried out by a group of largely Colombian mercenaries, though many questions about who was behind his killing remain. Ariel Henry was formally appointed as prime minister of Haiti last week, calling for unity, stability, and international support. But the gangs are powerful and security institutions are weak. Georges Michel, a Haitian historian, said the gangs can muster a firepower superior to official security forces and are highly mobile, used to deploying guerrilla-like tactics to prey on the population and do battle with rival outfits. "I hope that (the government) finds a way to destroy them because they create terror in all the neighborhood," he said. Gangs have threatened to occupy the streets to protest the assassination of Moise. One of the most prominent bosses, Jimmy Cherizier, a former cop known as Barbecue, on Monday led hundreds of followers to a commemoration of the dead president. "We never knew this situation before," said another youth at the shelter. "This stems from the political crisis."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/haitians-displaced-by-gang-violence-face-bleak-future/articleshow/84809200.cms||---
---||World||Western wildfire battles aided by weather but losses grow||INDIAN FALLS: Weather conditions Tuesday were helping at least temporarily to calm two gigantic wildfires in the West but there was bad news for a tiny California community savaged by flames last weekend, and property losses increased in Oregon.  Damage assessment teams have so far tallied 36 structures destroyed and seven damaged in Indian Falls, said Nick Truax, an incident commander for the massive Dixie Fire in the mountains of Northern California.  The assessment was about half complete, Truax said during an online briefing Monday night. The ability to safely tally damage depends on fire activity.  The Dixie Fire had scorched more than 325 square miles (842 square kilometers) as of early Tuesday and was 23% contained. More than 10,000 homes were threatened in Plumas and Butte counties, a region about 175 miles (282 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco.  An inversion layer on Monday trapped smoke over much of the fire, and the shade helped lower temperatures and keep humidity up, incident meteorologist Julia Ruthford said.  Similar smoke conditions were expected through Tuesday. Monsoon moisture was streaming over the region but only light showers were likely on the fire. A return to hotter and drier conditions was forecast for later in the week.  The Dixie Fire, burning mostly on federal land, is among dozens of large blazes burning in the U.S. Nickie Johnny, incident commander for the Dixie's east section, said that with so many fires going on in the nation, use of federal resources has to be prioritized and she credited the assistance of local governments and Cal Fire, the state agency.  "I just wanted to thank them for that because we are strapped federally with resources all over the nation," she said.  Authorities were hopeful that cool temperatures, increased humidity and isolated showers will help them continue to make progress against the nation's largest wildfire, the Bootleg Fire in southern Oregon. It was 53% contained after scorching 640 square miles (1,657 square kilometers) of remote land.  "The mild weather will have a short-term calming effect on the fire behavior. But due to the extremely dry conditions and fuels, as the week progresses and temperatures rise, aggressive fire behavior is likely to quickly rebound," the Tuesday morning situation report stated.  A new damage assessment found that the lightning-sparked fire has destroyed 161 residences, 247 outbuildings and 342 vehicles in Klamath and Lake counties, the report said, cautioning that the numbers could increase as firefighters work through interior of the fire area.  In Montana, four firefighters were released from a hospital and a fifth was being treated at a burn center Monday after a wildfire overran them last week, authorities said. Crews were trying to keep the 10-square-mile (26-square-kilometer) Devil's Creek Fire from reaching Fort Peck Reservoir along the Missouri River in Garfield County. It's one of three major fires in Montana.  Firefighters have frequently dealt with perilous fire behavior, with flames consuming huge areas of vegetation each day. Such conditions are often from a combination of unusual random, short-term and natural weather patterns heightened by long-term, human-caused climate change. Global warming has made the West much warmer and drier.  Elsewhere in California, the 106-square-mile (275-square-kilometer) Tamarack Fire south of Lake Tahoe continued to burn through timber and chaparral but firefighters made progress, aided by cooler weather. The fire was 54% contained and evacuation orders that affected some 2,000 residents in 15 communities on both sides of the California-Nevada state line had been lifted. The fire, sparked by lightning July 4 in Alpine County, California, has destroyed at least 23 buildings, including more than a dozen in Nevada.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/western-wildfire-battles-aided-by-weather-but-losses-grow/articleshow/84809721.cms||---

US State Department spokeswoman Jalina Porter told reporters on Tuesday that the United States was pausing programmatic cooperation with the Public Ministry, which is responsible for the prosecution of criminal cases. Guatemala's Attorney General Maria Porras removed anti-graft fighter Juan Francisco Sandoval from his post as the head of Special Prosecutor's Office Against Impunity (FECI). The office was originally created to tackle investigations spearheaded by the UN-backed International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) but was ousted from the country in 2019. The United States was a vocal supporter of Sandoval's work, which included investigating and litigating cases against former officials, presidents and business leaders in Guatemala. The State Department declared him an "anti-corruption champion" in a February award. The July 23 decision to remove Sandoval "fits a pattern of behavior that indicates a lack of commitment to the rule of law and independent judicial and prosecutorial processes," Porter said on Tuesday. "As a result, we have lost confidence in the Attorney General and her intention to cooperate with the US government and fight corruption in good faith," Porter said. The United States has committed to helping Central American countries fight impunity for high-level law breakers. In recent months, Washington has revoked the US visas of two senior judges in Guatemala on graft suspicions and criticized lawmakers' refusal to swear in a corruption-fighting judge. "We are watching closely for any additional actions that would undermine the rule of law or judicial independence in Guatemala," Porter warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-pauses-some-cooperation-with-guatemala-over-ouster-of-anti-graft-fighter/articleshow/84809683.cms||---

A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah told PIL petitioner Kush Kalra, who wanted removal of all beggars from public places and traffic junctions, that "We will not take an elitist view and order removal of beggars from sight or ban begging. No person would like to beg unless he/she is forced to do so because of poverty. It is a socio-economic problem." "The Supreme Court will never restrain people from begging. There cannot be a ban on begging. The only solution to this socio-economic problem is their rehabilitation and giving them education and employment. This is more needed for the little children who beg at the traffic junctions. We need a humanitarian and sympathetic approach from the states and the Centre," the bench said. It forced the petitioner Kalra's counsel Mohit Paul to delete the prayer for a direction to the Centre and states to "prepare a road map in order to restrain beggars and vagabond from begging and roaming on traffic junctions and markets to avoid the spread of Covid-19". Times ViewBeggary is a fall-out of extreme economic deprivation. If a welfare state cannot provide for all, it shouldn’t at least stop the most disadvantaged from finding ways of getting by. The Supreme Court has rightly taken a big picture view of the issue.Confining the court's efforts for rehabilitation of beggars to the national capital for the time being,the bench issued notice to the Centre and Delhi government on the urgent need for vaccinating all beggars and homeless in the national capital as senior advocate Chinmay P Sharma said that they were the most vulnerable section of the society needing protection from Covid. The bench posted the matter after two weeks and sought assistance from solicitor general Tushar Mehta on vaccination of all beggars and the homeless. The bench said, "A large number of people, including children, are compelled to be on the streets to beg due to the absence of education and employment. This is a socio-economic issue and cannot be remedied by a direction for removal of beggars from the public places. This is a human problem which has to be redressed by the welfare State in a manner which accords with Part III and IV of the Constitution." Read AlsoSC notice of Centre, Delhi govt on plea for rehabilitation, vaccination of beggars amid pandemicThe Supreme Court sought the responses of the Centre and the Delhi government on Tuesday on a plea seeking rehabilitation and vaccination of beggars and vagabonds in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The apex court, which made it clear that it would not take an "elitist view" that no beggars shouldIt said, "Since the immediate issue which needs to be attended is that of vaccinating the persons to whom the petition relates and to ensure the due provision of medical facilities in the Covid-19 pandemic, we would expect a response from the Union of India and the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi on what steps are being taken to deal with this human concern." Though the SC bench said that it would not ban begging, the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959, which is applicable to Delhi, makes begging an offence and prescribes for detention of those found begging in public places. It prescribes detention in a certified institution (Beggars Homes) up to three years by a court of law for a first time offender and up to 10 years for subsequent offence of begging. Many believe that begging in the national capital is an organised and well-oiled business controlled by a mafia. Section 11 of the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act punishes those who force or employ others to beg. it provides : "Whoever employs or causes, any person to solicit or receive alms, or whoever having the custody, charge or care of a child, connives at or encourages the employment or the causing a child to solicit or receive alms or whoever uses another person as an exhibit, shall be punished with prisonment for a term which may extend to three years but which shall not be less than one year." However, in 2018, the Delhi HC had decriminalised the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act in its application to the national capital territory. A PIL is pending in the SC since February this year seeking quashing of the Bombay Act, Bihar Prevention of Begging Act, 1951, Punjab Prevention of Beggary Act, 1971 and the Haryana Prevention of Begging Act, 1971 terming them as unconstitutional. SC has sought responses from the Centre and the states. As per the 2011 census figures on beggar population, as informed by the government to Parliament in 2018, there are 4,13,670 beggars in India, of which 2,21,673 were males and 1,91,997 females. West Bengal had the highest number of beggars at 81,224. Uttar Pradesh had 65,835, Bihar 29,723, Madhya Pradesh 28,695 and Rajasthan 25,853. The National Capital Territory, as per 2011 census, had 2,187 beggars. The petitioner said, "Till date there is no legislation or policy in India that provides for rehabilitation of beggars/vagabonds either at the central level or at state levels despite the fact that the number of beggars in all states and UT’s is more than 4 lakhs." The "Abolition of Begging and Rehabilitation of Beggars Bill, 2018" was introduced in Lok Sabha, but the House has not taken steps to convert it into a law. The petitioner sought a direction to the Centre and the states to ensure food, shelter and basic medical amenities including covid-19 vaccination to beggars across the country. It also sought their rehabilitation and provision for basic healthcare facilities to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cant-take-elitist-view-to-ban-begging-supreme-court/articleshow/84809917.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||World||Inside a KKK murder plot: 'Do you want him six feet under?'||PALATKA: Joseph Moore breathed heavily, his face slick with nervous sweat. He held a cellphone with a photo of a man splayed on the floor; the man appeared dead, his shirt torn apart and his pants wet.  "KIGY, my brother," Moore said to another man who drove up in a blue sedan. It was shorthand for "Klansman, I greet you."  Moore showed the photo to David "Sarge" Moran, who wore a camouflage-print baseball hat emblazoned with a Confederate flag patch and a metal cross.  "Oh, shit. I love it," Moran said. "Motherf----- pissed on himself. Good job."  It was 11:30 a.m. on March 19, 2015, and the klansmen were celebrating what they thought was a successful murder in Florida.  But the FBI had gotten wind of the murder plot. A confidential informant had infiltrated the group, and his recordings provide a rare, detailed look at the inner workings of a modern klan cell and a domestic terrorism probe. The Associated Press has reconstructed the story of the failed murder plot.  That investigation would unearth another secret: An unknown number of klansmen were working inside the Florida Department of Corrections, with significant power over inmates, Black and white.  ___  Thomas Driver, a white prison guard, and Warren Williams, a Black inmate, faced each other in a sweltering prison dorm room in rural north Florida's Reception and Medical Center.  Williams was serving a year, records show, for striking a police officer. He pleaded no contest in exchange for a reduced sentence, and an order to receive a mental health evaluation and treatment under county supervision.  He found himself in front of Driver in August 2013 after he lost his identification badge, a prison infraction.  Williams was angry because the guard kept blowing smoke in his face. The two got into a fight, and, as they struggled, Williams bit Driver, according to both men's accounts.  A group of guards responded, and beat Williams so badly that he required hospitalization, his mother and lawyer said.  Driver, in turn, needed a battery of precautionary tests for HIV and hepatitis C after the bite. They would all be negative, but the ordeal enraged him.  He wanted revenge.  ___  More than a year later, in December 2014, dozens of hooded klansmen gathered around a flaming wooden cross for a "klonklave," a meeting of the Florida Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.  Driver, known by his fellow klansmen as "Brother Thomas," was there with Sarge Moran, who had worked for the Florida Department of Corrections for decades. The men gave a picture of Williams to Joseph Moore, an Army veteran and the group's "Grand Night Hawk," in charge of security. Driver described the fight.  "Do you want him six feet under?" Moore asked.  Driver and Moran looked at each other, then said yes.  Today, researchers believe that tens of thousands of Americans belong to groups identified with white supremacist extremism, the klan being just one. These groups' efforts to infiltrate law enforcement have been documented repeatedly in recent years and called an "epidemic" by legal scholars.  FBI Director Christopher Wray said at a March Senate hearing that "racially motivated violent extremism," mostly by white supremacists, accounts for the most rapidly rising share of domestic terrorism cases.  "That same group of people ... have been responsible for the most lethal attacks over the last, say, decade," Wray added.  When Williams got out of prison a few months after his fight with Driver, the klan was not among his worries. Images of burning crosses and klansmen targeting Black people for violence seemed anachronistic.  But the symbols of the group's reign in his hometown of Palatka, Florida, endure. Each time Williams met with his probation officer, he passed the statue of a Confederate soldier in front of the Putnam County courthouse.  In 1925, the KKK controlled Putnam County. A klansman named R.J. Hancock was elected sheriff and he helped unleash a reign of terror, where lynch mobs dominated civic life. To stop it, Florida's governor threatened to declare martial law in 1926.  But the klan and its ilk have endured. Today it's just one group in a decentralized white supremacy movement.  "It's surprising that we're even having a conversation about something that was prevalent in the 1920s, taking place 100 years later," said Terrill Hill, Williams' attorney and Palatka's mayor. "It's frustrating. It's angering."  ___  In January 2015, Moore arrived at the the home of Charles Newcomb, the klan's Exalted Cyclops, a local chief, who had also been a prison guard.  "I look at it this way brother. That was a direct ... attempted murder on him," Newcomb said, referring to Williams' biting Driver. Newcomb wanted Moore to kill the Black man.  He didn't know that Moore was a confidential FBI informant. The FBI had hired him to infiltrate the klan cell and within a few weeks, Moore had scheduled a meeting with the Grand Dragon and second-in-command at a Dollar General parking lot in Bronson, Florida.  He filled out an application, paid a $20 fee along with $35 in annual dues, and signed a "blood oath." Less than two years later, he was at the center of a murder plot.  Moore's tires crunched as he pulled into Newcomb's driveway, marked by a sign featuring a pistol barrel: WARNING: There is Nothing Here Worth Dying For.  Newcomb was excited about a new idea he'd had for how to kill Williams.  "I have several bottles of insulin in here if you wanted to do it that way," Newcomb said.  "Do we do it fast and get the hell out? Or do we want to grab him up and take him somewhere and shoot him with insulin?" Newcomb asked.  The FBI had outfitted Moore's SUV with recording devices that broadcast live to agents as they drove to Palatka.  By then the agency had moved Williams to a safe house and placed police vehicles around his neighborhood.  When the klansmen drove into Williams' neighborhood, the sight of police patrol cars unnerved them. "Can't make too many rounds with him sitting there," Newcomb said, eyeing a squad car.  "We'll catch that fish," Moran reassured him.  ___  The FBI had other ideas. They contacted Williams through his parole officer, and staged a murder scene. Williams lay on the floor of his mother's house, pretending to be dead. The agents poured water on his pants and tore his shirt to appear as if he'd been shot.  A few weeks later, Moore waited for Driver outside a Starbucks in a strip mall parking lot. He'd already shown Moran the staged murder photo, and recorded his gleeful response. The day before, he'd done the same with Newcomb, who'd told Moore "good job" and hugged him.  Now it was time to show Driver, who had said he'd stomp Williams' "larynx closed" if he had the chance.  Moore handed Driver the phone. "That what you wanted?"  "Oh, yes," Driver said, relaxing into a chuckle.  Soon afterward, Moran, Driver and Newcomb were arrested and held in the prison where they had worked as guards.  A jury convicted Moran and Newcomb of conspiracy to commit murder. They were each sentenced to 12 years. Driver received four years after pleading guilty, and is due out this year.  Even though three current and former Florida prison guards were exposed as klansmen, the state's Department of Corrections says it found no reason to investigate whether other white supremacists were employed in its prisons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/inside-a-kkk-murder-plot-do-you-want-him-six-feet-under/articleshow/84810172.cms||---

A confidant of BS Yediyurappa, he is known to walk a moderate line on Hindutva, combining an astute political sense with troubleshooting skills that have been put to use by the government time and again. Having joined BJP 13 years ago from Janata Dal, Bommai has been considered a former socialist with allegiance to saffron. When Yediyurappa left BJP to float the Karnataka Janata Paksha, Bommai stayed back and it is said that he played a crucial role in bringing the Lingayat strongman back to the party fold in 2013 at the instance of then PM candidate Narendra Modi. While Bommai’s appointment is being seen as a bid to keep Yediyurappa, and the Lingayat votebank, close, the new CM will have to assert himself among other chief ministerial aspirants and take along BSY-baiters — a task that will present itself with cabinet formation. The bigger challenge, of course, will be to sort out the dissidence within and mobilise the state unit ahead of elections in 2023. Political demands aside, the new CM will have to hit the ground running on Covid management, ahead of the anticipated third wave, and tackle the attendant financial crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/on-cms-to-do-list-party-patch-up-pandemic-control-poll-preparation/articleshow/84810283.cms||Manu Aiyappa
---||India||Kerala: Church aid for families with 4 or more kids||KOTTAYAM: The Syro-Malabar Church’s diocese of Pala, Kerala, has come up with welfare projects for families under the diocese who have four or more children. A circular issued by Pala bishop Mar Joseph Kallarangatt on Tuesday said the “offers” are being made as part of the “Year of the Family” declaration by Pope Francis. The church is Oriental Catholic. The circular will be read out during Sunday Mass in churches in the diocese on August 1. The diocese will give job priority in a diocese-owned hospital, as per educational qualifications, to one couple who have five or more children. The welfare scheme also envisages job priority in the diocese’s educational institutions for children born as the fourth, or subsequently, in a financially struggling family. The diocese, it said, would extend monthly financial aid of Rs 1,500 to all couples married after 2000 who have five or more children. Free medical care is also being offered for birth-related expenses from the fourth child onwards at the two hospitals owned by the diocese. Free education has been offered from the fourth child onwards for those who get admission as per government rules at a diocese-owned nursing college. Tuition at the engineering and hotel management colleges of the diocese will be free from the fourth child onwards provided he/she gets admission to these institutions. The move by the Catholic church to encourage large families gains significance in the wake of controversies over the minority scholarship scheme of the state government, which is based on the population of minority communities. The move to encourage more children in a family also comes at a time when Indian states like Uttar Pradesh have started talking about population control measures. Shyju Antony, the official spokesperson, said that officially the church stood for responsible parenthood and not incentivised parenthood. “The parents alone should make the judgment about the number of children and nobody should interfere in this,” he said. “If the church can’t attract anyone new to its fold, and has to encourage childbirth among its members instead, then it’s a failure of the church,” he said. He said that by giving birth to five children, a woman will be dedicating at least 10 years of her life. “She will be further spending several more years to bring up the children,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/church-aid-for-families-with-4-or-more-kids/articleshow/84810170.cms||---

Kerala accounted for more than 50% of all new cases in the country on Tuesday. With numbers spiralling in the state, In dia recorded 42,948 Covid cases, the highest single-day count in 19 days since July 8, when 43,494 infections were recorded. As in the past several weeks, the surge in infections was confined to Kerala, several states of the northeast and parts of Maharashtra. Prior to Tuesday, the last time any Indian state had reported more than 20,000 cases in a day was on June 6, when Tamil Na du had logged 20,421 cases. Kerala’s tally was the highest reported in the state since May 29, in what now appears to be another wave of the pan demic there. Kerala’s numbers have been on the rise for four weeks now. Although the seven-day average of daily cases in the state never fell below 10,000 since the last peak, the average has risen from around 11,300 on June 20-27 to over 16,700 in the last seven days. The test positivity rate in the state was back over 12% on Tuesday, after falling marginally on Monday. With Tues day’s surge, the state’s total caseload crossed 33 lakh, the second highest in the country after Maharashtra (62.7 lakh).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-kerala-logs-22000-cases-first-in-50-days-to-top-20k/articleshow/84810058.cms||Amit Bhattacharya
---||World||Cardinal in Vatican fraud trial: My conscience is 'tranquil'||VATICAN CITY: A fraud and embezzlement trial over alleged mismanagement of the Holy See's investments began Tuesday in Vatican City, with a once-powerful cardinal among the 10 defendants saying he remains "obedient" to Pope Francis, who stripped his privileges to bring him before the tribunal.  ''He wanted me to be on trial, and I'm coming to the trial. I'm serene. I feel tranquil in my conscience,″ Cardinal Angelo Becciu, one of two defendants who attended the largely procedural, seven-hour session, told reporters afterward.  Becciu, a former longtime Vatican diplomat, is charged with embezzlement, abusing his office and with pressing a monsignor to recant information he gave to prosecutors about the handling of disastrous real estate deal involving properties in London.  The 73-year-old prelate, who was elevated to cardinal by Francis in 2018 but later dismissed by the pope from his later post in charge of the church's saint-making office, has denied any wrongdoing.  During the first day of the trial, defense lawyers lamented they hadn't had time to digest about 28,000 pages of documents recently released by Vatican prosecutors. They noted that much of the evidence from the July 3 indictments hadn't been made available to them, apparently due to logistical problems.  Chief Judge Giuseppe Pignatone agreed, setting the next hearing for Oct. 5. A former Rome chief prosecutor, Pignatone earlier had spent years investigating the Mafia in Sicily and criminal economic activity.  The Vatican, an independent city state, has a tiny courtroom, as well as its own jail. But to accommodate all the defendants, lawyers and journalists for what is the largest trial in the Holy See's modern history, the case was moved to a hall that is part of the Vatican Museums.  The makeshift courtroom is adorned only with a crucifix, and, just behind where the three-member prosecution team sits, a photo of Francis in his white robes.  Not waiting for a verdict, Francis has already removed Becciu's rights as a cardinal. So Becciu showed up in court wearing a plain black clergyman's suit and a large, pectoral cross instead of the prestigious red garb reserved for the so-called ''princes of the church.''  Asked by a reporter why he showed up for his day in court while most of his fellow defendants did not, Becciu said: "It's important to be here."  Also in court was Monsignor Mauro Carlino, who is charged with embezzlement and abuse of office. He was a top aide to Becciu when the prelate was a chief of staff in the Vatican's Secretariat of State. The two men chatted during breaks.  All the defendants face prison or fines or both if convicted. They have denied wrongdoing.  Just less than three months ago, it would have been impossible for a cardinal to be in the dock in the Vatican City State, which has its own justice system and even a jail. But, as alluded to in Becciu's comments, Francis had a law changed so that Vatican-based cardinals and bishops can be prosecuted and judged by the Holy See's lay criminal tribunal as long as the pontiff signs off on it. Previously, Vatican cardinals could only be judged by their peers, a court of three fellow cardinals.  The defendants are alleged to have had a hand in actions that effectively cost the Holy See tens of millions of dollars in donations collected at Mass from rank-and-file Catholics. The prosecution contends that the heavy losses resulted from poor investments, dealings with shady money managers and purported favors to friends and family.  At the heart of the two-year probe is the London real estate deal approved by the Secretariat of State. An initial 200 million euros (now nearly $240 million) was sunk into a fund operated by an Italian businessman. Half the money went into the real estate venture in the swank Chelsea neighborhood, an investment that eventually cost 350 million euros. By 2018, the original investment was losing money, and the Vatican scrambled to find an exit strategy.  Among the defendants is Italian broker Gianluigi Torzi, whom the Vatican engaged to help it acquire full ownership of the London palazzo from another indicted money manager, who handled the initial investment in 2013. The Vatican contends it lost money on unwise investments.  The judge said Torzi alone had a "legitimate impediment" to attending the trial. His lawyers noted that Torzi cannot leave London, where he is based, because he is awaiting British judicial developments following an extradition request from Italian authorities in another financial probe.  Also absent was Cecilia Marogna, who was hired by Becciu as an external security consultant. Prosecutors allege she embezzled 575,000 euros in Vatican funds that Becciu had authorized for use as ransom to free Catholic hostages abroad. Marogna has contended that charges she ran up were reimbursement of her intelligence-related expenses and other money was her compensation.  Her lawyer told the court she couldn't attend because an Italian intelligence agency is obliging her to secrecy and Marogna doesn't want to violate that order.  Vatican law, as does the Italian legal system it partially mirrors, permits plaintiffs to join a trial in hopes of winning monetary compensation, to press for justice and to be able to address the court.  "This trial has a strong moral connotation,'' said Paola Severino, a former Italian justice minister who represents the interests of the Holy See and the Vatican bank at the trial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/cardinal-in-vatican-fraud-trial-my-conscience-is-tranquil/articleshow/84810572.cms||---

Petitioner Pankaj Yadav said media reports exposing the deals between the legislators and power brokers to unseat the government has made it clear that elected representatives are playing with the trust of their voters. Yadav claimed that since 2005, the state has become a hub of horse-trading, hinting at the last Rajya Sabha election and the formation of subsequent governments in the state. He said the current sequence of events indicates the involvement of power brokers from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra and has sought a CBI probe into the matter as the case fans out to several states. He has also suggested probes by the ED and the I-T department as the legislators have been offered large sums of money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pil-seeks-cbi-probe-into-bid-to-topple-hemant-soren-government/articleshow/84809994.cms||Chandrajit Banerjee
---||World||In 1st visit to intel agency, Biden warns of cyber conflict||MCLEAN: President Joe Biden used his first visit with rank-and-file members of the US intelligence community _ a part of government that was frequently criticized by his predecessor Donald Trump _ to make a promise that he will ``never politicize'' their work. Biden waited more than six months to make the short drive across the Potomac River on Tuesday to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, giving analysts and national security leaders _ often derided by Trump as the ``deep state`` _ some breathing room. The president in his remarks to about 120 ODNI employees and senior leadership officials sought to make clear that he understood the complexity and critical nature of their work. The agency oversees the 17 other US intelligence organizations. ``You have my full confidence,`` he said. ``I know there's no such thing as 100% certainty in the intelligence world. Occasionally that happens. Rarely, rarely, rarely.'' Biden told the audience that his administration would be ``getting us back to the basics.'' ``I'll never politicize the work you do. You have my word on that,'' he said. ``It's too important for our country.'' Biden also mentioned Russia and China as growing threats to American national security and noted the growing wave of cyberattacks, including ransomware attacks, against government agencies and private industry that US officials have linked to agents in both countries. ``I think it's more likely ... if we end up in a war, a real shooting war with a major power, it's going to be as a consequence of a cyber breach of great consequence,'' Biden said. Biden toured the National Counterterrorism Center Watch Floor, where analysts work to collect information and intelligence from various sources to ascertain potential threats. He was accompanied on the tour by Avril Haines, director of national intelligence, and Christy Abizaid, director of the National Counterterrorism Center. Trump visited the Central Intelligence Agency on his first full day in office, praising the agency but also airing personal grievances. Standing in front of CIA's memorial wall with stars marking each of the officers who have died while serving, Trump settled scores with the media and repeated false claims about the size of his inauguration crowd. The relationship between the intelligence community and the president ``went downhill from that very day,'' said Glenn Gerstell, who then served as general counsel of the National Security Agency and stepped down last year. Trump would go through four permanent or acting directors of national intelligence in four years and engaged in near-constant fights with the intelligence community. In particular, he was angry about its assessment that Russia had interfered on his behalf in the 2016 presidential campaign and its role in revealing that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate Biden, an action that ultimately led to Trump's first impeachment. Trump eventually fired the inspector general at the national intelligence office _ the internal watchdog who brought that pressure to light. By contrast, Biden has repeatedly insisted that he would not exert political pressure on intelligence agencies, a message repeated by his top appointees. He also came to office with a long history of working with intelligence officials as vice president and while serving in the Senate. The president has already called on Haines with several politically sensitive requests. Perhaps the most prominent is an enhanced review of the origins of Covid-19 as concerns increase among scientists that the novel coronavirus could have originated in a Chinese lab. Biden set a 90-day timeframe and pledged to make the results of the review public. Haines and CIA Director Bill Burns are also investigating a growing number of reported injuries and illnesses possibly linked to directed energy attacks in what's known as the ``Havana syndrome.'' The CIA recently appointed a new director of its task force investigating Havana syndrome cases, an undercover official who participated in the hunt for Osama bin Laden. And intelligence agencies are having to adapt to the military withdrawal from Afghanistan, with growing concerns that the Taliban may topple the U.S.-backed central government. Haines and Burns have also said that their review of Covid-19 origins may be inconclusive, probably disappointing lawmakers and observers who have pushed for more aggressive action against China. Former officials said Biden's choice of visiting the national intelligence director before the CIA was significant because it makes clear he wants Haines to be considered his principal intelligence adviser. When her office was created in 2005 to better coordinate intelligence sharing following the 9/11 attacks, it subsumed a leadership role once held by the CIA director. Since then, agencies and leaders have periodically fought for preeminence, causing concerns that some agencies' views are more strongly heard than others. ``I think we've had a couple of presidents in a row where the supremacy of the DNI was put in some question either through the selection of people they chose in the job or how they engaged with the community,'' said Larry Pfeiffer, a former senior official at both the CIA and the intelligence office who now leads the Hayden Center at George Mason University. Pfeiffer said he strongly supported Biden's visit and also hoped the president would eventually visit the memorial wall where Trump spoke in January 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/in-1st-visit-to-intel-agency-biden-warns-of-cyber-conflict/articleshow/84810649.cms||---

Speaking to the media after adjournment of RS, leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge asked why Modi government was ducking the snooping scandal when France, Israel, Germany and Hungary have ordered investigations. He was joined by Manoj Jha of RJD, Sukhendu Sekhar Roy of TMC, Ram Gopal Yadav of SP, Tiruchi Siva of DMK, Binoy Viswam CPI, Sanjay Singh of AAP, Elamaram Kareem CPM and Anand Sharma of Congress. Earlier in the day, Modi asked BJP MPs to take on the opposition for stalling Parliament. Speaking at the weekly parliamentary party meeting, the PM asked MPs to take part in the “Amrut Mahotsava’ up to the village level, suggesting that they should highlight that party and government is prioritising development as opposed to obstructionism of the opposition. “The opposition parties, especially Congress, have been politicising even Covid management. People of the country should be made aware and opposition should be exposed,” Modi said, according to party sources. The PM said that when the government offered to hold a debate on issues raised by the opposition, they should allow the House to function and let the debate take place. The Rajya Sabha opposition leaders reminded BJP of its blockade of Parliament over the demand for JPC probe in the 2G scam during the UPA regime. The BJP has previously said its demand came in the wake of the Supreme Court and CAG finding serious infirmities with the spectrum allocations. The opposition bloc in Lok Sabha also decided to keep its focus on its twin demands, with parties deciding to “move the same adjournment notice separately on Wednesday”. The decision was taken in a meeting which included Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, BSP, National Conference, Shiv Sena, NCP, RSP’s N K Premachandran among others. “The IT Act lays down that the government has to give permission for tapping phones. So, it is clear that the government ordered the spying of judges, opposition leaders, journalists and others. This is dictatorship. The PM should call all the parties for talks,” Kharge said. Trinamool’s S S Roy said, “The government should hold a structured discussion on this issue. Without discussion, we will not allow any other business to run…What happened in 2G? BJP did not allow one complete winter session while demanding the JPC. We are not asking for any JPC. Then why are they shying away now.” Deputy leader of opposition Anand Sharma said the opposition was doing its duty of preventing the government from turning “our republic into a surveillance and police state”. Siva complained that only treasury benches were being shown in the live telecast of RS proceedings while the opposition benches were blacked out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/oppn-warns-entire-session-could-be-disrupted-if-demand-for-discussion-in-house-inquiry-into-pegasus-not-accepted/articleshow/84810797.cms||---
---||World||Bhutan fully vaccinates 90% of eligible adults within a week||GAUHATI: The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has fully vaccinated 90% of its eligible adult population within just seven days, its health ministry said on Tuesday. The tiny country, wedged between India and China and home to nearly 800,000 people, began giving out second doses on July 20 in a mass drive that has been hailed by Unicef as "arguably the fastest vaccination campaign to be executed during a pandemic.'' In April, Bhutan grabbed headlines when its government said it had inoculated around the same percentage of eligible adults with the first dose in under two weeks after India donated 550,000 shots of AstraZeneca vaccine. But the country faced a shortage for months after India, a major supplier of the AstraZeneca shot, halted exports as it scrambled to meet a rising demand at home as infections surged. Bhutan was able to restart its drive last week after half a million doses of Moderna vaccine arrived from the United States as a donation under the UN-backed Covax program, an initiative devised to give countries access to coronavirus vaccines regardless of their wealth. Some 5,000 shots of Pfizer were also facilitated through Covax, which is co-led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation. It also received more than 400,000 AstraZeneca shots from Denmark, Croatia and Bulgaria in the last two weeks. "Our aim is to achieve herd immunity among our population in the shortest possible time to avert a major public health crisis,'' Dechen Wangmo, Bhutan's health minister, told The Associated Press. Many Western countries with far more resources are yet to vaccinate such a high rate of eligible adults. Health experts say Bhutan's small population helped, but the country also benefited from strong and effective messaging from top officials and an established cold chain storage system. More than 3,000 health workers participated and 1,200 vaccination centers across the country helped ensure that shots reached every eligible adult. In some cases, health workers trekked for days through landslides and pouring rain to reach extremely remote villages atop steep mountains to administer doses to those unable to get to a center, said Dr Sonam Wangchuk, a member of Bhutan's vaccination task force. "Vaccination is the pillar of Bhutan's healthcare initiative,'' he said. Bhutan's government is also led by medical practitioners. The prime minister, the foreign minister and the health minister are all medical professionals. And frequent messaging from the government, which directly answers questions from the public about the coronavirus and vaccinations on Facebook, also helped combat vaccine hesitancy among citizens. "In fact, people are quite eager to come and get themselves vaccinated,'' Dr Wangchuk said. Its prime minister, Lotay Tshering, and monarch, King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, were also early advocates of the vaccine, which allayed fears surrounding the rollout. The king also toured the country to raise awareness about the vaccination drive. Bhutan is the last remaining Buddhist kingdom in the Himalayas, but it has transitioned from an absolute monarchy to a democratic, constitutional monarchy. Another crucial ingredient in the vaccine drive is the country's extensive network of citizen volunteers called"desuups,'' said Will Parks, the Unicef representative for Bhutan. Some 22,000 citizens volunteered over the last year and a half to raise awareness, dispel misinformation, help conduct mass screening and testing and even carry vaccines across the country's difficult terrain, he said. Bhutan's success is an anomaly in South Asia where countries such as India and Bangladesh are struggling to ramp up their vaccination rates. Experts say it underscores the importance of richer countries donating vaccines to the developing world and highlights just how big an impact the government and community outreach can have. "Perhaps this little Himalayan kingdom can be a beacon of hope to a region that is on fire,'' Parks said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/bhutan-fully-vaccinates-90-of-eligible-adults-within-a-week/articleshow/84810824.cms||---
---||World||End of Covid-19 pandemic in Britain may be near, epidemiologist says||LONDON: The end of the Covid-19 pandemic in Britain could be just months away as vaccines have so dramatically reduced the risk of severe disease and death, Imperial College epidemiologist Neil Ferguson said on Tuesday. But, he said, a recent fall in daily cases still needed to be watched carefully. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is betting that he can get one of Europe's largest economies firing again because so many people are now vaccinated, a decision that marks a new chapter in the global response to the novel coronavirus. The number of new daily Covid-19 cases has fallen each day for the last six days, though Johnson has stressed the pandemic is not over. "We're not completely out of the woods but the equation has fundamentally changed," Ferguson, whose early 2020 modelling of the virus's likely spread alarmed governments around the world at the outset of the pandemic, told the BBC. "The effect of vaccines has been huge in reducing the risk of hospitalisation and death and, I think, I'm positive that by late September, October time we will be looking back at most of the pandemic." British Covid-19 data shows a spike of infections earlier in July has so far not led to a vast increase in deaths, which fell to just 14 on Monday, though the number of Covid-19 patients in British hospitals has risen to 5,238. The closure of schools for the summer holidays, the end of the Euro 2020 soccer championships and warmer weather are among the factors epidemiologists say might have reduced social mixing indoors and therefore cases, even as England's economy has fully reopened. Johnson's decision lifted rules in England on July 19 in favour of restarting an economy damaged by a series of on-off lockdowns since March 2020. If it pays off, Britain's example could offer a way out of the pandemic, though Johnson's gamble could be derailed by the possible emergence of a variant capable of resisting vaccines - or if ill people overwhelm the health service. Britain has one of the highest official death tolls in the world, 129,460, though new daily cases, which in the current wave peaked at 54,674 on July 17, have fallen to 24,950 on Monday. Case numbers have been falling for longer in Scotland, where the recent peak in cases was on July 1 than in England, corresponding to an earlier elimination from the Euros. "From a sporting perspective... Scotland went out far too early, but epidemiologically that probably did us some favours," Scotland's National Clinical Director Jason Leitch said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/end-of-covid-19-pandemic-in-britain-may-be-near-epidemiologist-says/articleshow/84810757.cms||---

A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justice Surya Kant issued notices to all states, UTs and National Human Rights Commission and said, "Let's hope the governments will respond positively." Appearing for NGO 'Jan Swasthya Abhiyan', senior advocate Sanjay Parikh said with the focus shifting from strengthening the public sector healthcare system to private sector, only 30% of patients get treatment from government owned hospitals and healthcare centres. With privatisation of the healthcare system, the patients are getting fleeced by the private hospitals and clinics as there is no enforcement of the Clinical Establishment Act of 2010 and the relevant Rules framed in 2012. Times ViewDisplaying rate charts is the law which many private hospitals flout. We need strict monitoring to ensure that the law is duly followed. Violators should be punished.Parikh said the Union government, in consultation with states, is yet to frame and notify "conditions for registrations: minimum standards of facilities and services; minimum requirement of personnel; provisions of maintenance of records and reporting; fixation of rates for each type of procedure and services within the range of rates determined by the central government issued from time to time." He said in the absence of framing and notifying the minimum standards, the clinical establishments in 17 states and UTs are operating on the basis of provisional registration. The PIL, filed through advocate Srishti Agnihotri, sought a direction to the Centre to "operationalise all the provisions of the 2010 Act and 2012 Rules, and among others, direct that the conditions for registration which include the observance of minimum standards, display and observance of determined rates for procedures and services.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pil-fix-minimum-healthcare-standard-and-rates-for-hospitals/articleshow/84810871.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The committee submitted its report on July 23 and was released on the NGT website on Tuesday. According to the joint committee, the mechanical failure of one of the fuel pipeline elbows caused a leak which then caught fire due to elevated temperatures of the hydrocarbon fluid. The committee which conducted the inspection found out that the refinery did not carry out hydro-testing of the pipelines in 2020 and delayed it due to the pandemic.

KDMC chief Dr Vijay Suryawanshi, who is the brain behind the idea, had last month held a meeting with all civic ward officers and various NGOs, and appealed them to save reserved plots from encroachments by planting trees around them. Dr Suryawanshi also directed the ward officers to raze unauthorised constructions on some plots. The appeal made by Dr Suryawanshi has received good response. On KDMC’s appeal, several NGOs such as Nanasaheb Dharmadhikari Pratisthan, Morning Walker Group Kalyan, Kalyan Runners Group, Rotary Club of New Kalyan, Rotary Club Dombivli West, Kalyan Janta Sahkari Bank, Eye Nature Foundation and Innerwheel Club have come forward to plant trees on these plots. The KDMC, with the help of various NGOs and environmentalists, is planting trees on 9 such reserved plots that will be made open to public once rains recede. “The aim is to protect 343 such open reserved plots. While several NGOs and environmentalists have come forward to plant trees on 9 reserved plots, some others have also shown interest to plant trees on 25 other plots,” said Dr Suryawanshi. “By doing this, we can save plots from encroachment till the time they are utilised for the purpose they have been reserved for,” he added. On Monday, Dr Suryawanshi again held a meeting with chief of gardening department Sanjay Jadhav and other officials and directed them to also build walking tracks, cricket nets, kabbadi grounds and tennis courts on plots bigger than 500 metres. “So far, different NGOs like Eye Nature, Nana Dharmadhikari Pratisthan, and others, have planted 15,000 trees on 9 reserved plots. Once the monsoon ends, these plots can be used by public,” said Jadhav. The KDMC has started developing reserved plots as gardens in Umbarde in Kalyan (West), Swarajya Neptune in Ambivli west and Tharwani project in Titwala, among others. Activist Shashikant Dayma said, “The KDMC’s initiative is highly appreciable because along with creating more grounds and play areas, it will also create a green belt in the city which will help protect the environment.” The KDMC is also making a biodiversity park on a 40-acre forest land in Ambivli by planting 12,000 saplings to compensate for trees being cut for the Kalyan ring road project. The land will be develop into thematic gardens such as bird, bat, butterfly, bee, medicinal and nakasthatra gardens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-trees-to-fence-open-reserved-plots-keep-encroachers-at-bay/articleshow/84809616.cms||---

The state government is gearing up to launch strengthening and maintenance works for 9,000 km roads after securing the bank loan. The government is making special arrangements to clear bills of contractors through banks to avoid delay. “The chief minister has given an in-principle consent to open an escrow account to clear the bills of contractors through the bank from the loan amount. It will help build confidence among the contractors and complete the works as per the schedule,” said MT Krishnababu, principal secretary, R&B. Krishnababu told reporters that that they have completed a comprehensive survey by chief engineers in all districts and identified major works which required immediate repairs. He said that they have readied plans to take up strengthening and reconstruction of roads for about 9,000-km across the state with a total cost of Rs 2,205 crore. He said that the process of sanctioning the loans were at an advanced stage at the level of banks boards and expecting the disbursements in a fortnight. He said that road development cess being levied on petrol and diesel would be routed to RDC to secure the loan. Krishnababu also said that they would be shortly launching the works proposed with New Development Bank (NDB) loan of Rs 6,480 crore. He said that all the roads from district headquarter city to the mandal headquarter town would be converted into two-lane with new alignments and facilities. He said that they would begin the first phase works with Rs 2,970 crore in a couple of months. He said that the chief minister had also agreed to open a separate bank account to handle the loan amount to be released by the NDB as per the advice of the Centre. “As per the existing procedure, about 70% of the amount will be reimbursed only after completion of the work. This process is getting delayed due to involvement of various agencies. The Centre has agreed to route the amount to the specific works in case separate bank accounts are opened,” said Krishnababu. He denied the charge that the government was not clearing the pending bills leading to delay in taking up the road development works. He said the government had increased the budget for road maintenance from Rs 230 crore to Rs 900 crore following the chief minister’s intervention. The properties owned by Roads and Buildings (R&B) department have been transferred to AP Road Development Corporation (APRDC) to strengthen the balance book of the RDC, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/govt-to-secure-rs-2200-cr-loan-to-launch-road-repair-works-soon/articleshow/84803677.cms||Samdani MN

Sahani had expressed his anger over not being allowed by the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh to take part in a programme at Varanasi on former MP late Phoolan Devi’s death anniversary on Sunday and sent back from the airport itself. VIP MLAs Raju Kumar Singh (Sahebganj) and Mishrilal Yadav (Alinagar) said it was Sahani’s individual decision to abstain from the NDA meeting. “None of the four party MLAs was taken into confidence by Sahani. We should have participated in the meeting and place the matter before CM Nitish Kumar. This could be the right move,” Raju told the media on the state assembly premises. He alleged that Sahani was running the party like a private limited company. “He should have consulted us before jumping to any conclusion,” he asserted. Mishrilal also described Sahani's decision as politically incorrect. Two other MLAs, Aparna Singh and Musafir Paswan, however, preferred to skip the media. The two MLAs come from the BJP background. When asked, Sahani said, “Everybody in the party is free to speak his mind.” Even HAM(S) chief and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi termed Sahani’s decision as politically immature. On the other hand, JD(U) MP Sunil Kumar Pintu said Sahani was made MLC and minister despite losing the state assembly election. “He will meet a similar fate like Chirag Paswan if he continues to attack the ruling dispensation,” he added. Slamming Sahani, BJP MP from Muzaffarpur Ajay Nishad said even if Sahani quits, it would not affect the NDA’s prospects in Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sahani-draws-flak-from-party-mlas-for-skipping-nda-meet/articleshow/84802504.cms||Ramashankar

Our vote share increased from 44.73 to 56.43% while TDP’s vote share dipped to 28% from 42% in 2019 elections,” said Sajjala. Sajjala said YSRC won all 12 municipal corporations and 74 of 75 municipalities to which the elections were held almost two years after coming into power. He said Tirupati Lok Sabha by-election result also proved the same where the party’s vote share had improved significantly. He said securing more than 50 per cent vote share was considered as positive vote for the government. He exuded confidence that YSRCP would win any election as people were on their side. He said that people were happy with the good governance of chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. He said that the similar results will be seen in the MPTC and ZPTC results once declared. “We must thank Chandrababu Naidu and Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar for allowing us to celebrate the victories throughout the year by creating hurdles to the election process which led to declaration of results in separate phases. This gave our party cadres to celebrate in different spells instead of one-day celebration,” said Sajjala. He said the election process was completed under difficult circumstances and were held up due to political conspiracies of Chandrababu Naidu. He said the people had rejected Naidu in 2019 by confining TDP to 23 seats and not ready to accept him again. Sajjala criticized TDP leaders for enacting dramas on roads with the protests despite knowing that potholes on the roads were result of the TDP government’s negligence to take up maintenance works. He said that all those potholes should be called as Chandranna potholes. He alleged that TDP and a section of media is spreading false campaign about the damages to the roads in the capital city. He said that no one would resort to theft of road material except TDP leaders. He advised TDP not to keep farmers in delusion regarding the capital city in Amaravati. He said Naidu could not even complete the river bank road adjacent to his bungalow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/eluru-win-reconfirms-jagans-charisma-sajjala/articleshow/84804129.cms||Samdani MN

RJD MLA from Maner Bhai Virendra told the media on the state assembly premises, “Khela shooru ho chuka hai. Aage aage dekhte jaeeye hota hai kya (the game has already started. See what happens next).” Reacting to the RJD MLA’s claim, Kushwaha they should first set their house in order and then think of a new government formation. “Koi agar diwa swapna dekhta hai to dekhe. Hum use kaise rok sakte hain? (If anyone believes in daydreaming, how can we stop him),” he said. Bhai Virendra was reacting to the statement of Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) chief and state animal husbandry and fisheries resources minister Mukesh Sahani on Monday that smaller parties were not being given due respect by the two big constituents of the NDA — BJP and JD(U). Sahani was miffed at his detention at Varanasi airport on Sunday and was not allowed to take part in a programme on the death anniversary of former MP Phoolan Devi in the city there. He was sent back by the local police by the next flight. “Hamari baat NDA mein nahi sooni jaati hai,” Sahani had alleged. “NDA mein mil baith kar iska nidan ho jayega,” Sahani, however, told the media on Tuesday, a day after his party MLAs abstained from the NDA legislators’ meeting. Kushaha also said, “It's an internal matter and we will discuss it at the right platform.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/several-oppn-mlas-ready-to-switch-sides-kushwaha/articleshow/84801779.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||HC pulls up Bihar govt for ‘inadequate’ Covid test counts||PATNA: The Patna high court on Tuesday pulled up the state government for inadequate number of tests to detect Covid-19 infection in people across the districts and not mentioning its preparation for the possible third wave. The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Karol was hearing two PILs filed by Shivani Kaushik and Gaurav Kumar Singh. The government submitted that the state had a low positivity rate of 0.05%. But the court observed, “We find that though the government has put in place enhanced systems for testing, but for some reason the number of tests conducted on the daily basis is just 75,000 (approx). Whereas in the month of April/May, 2021, the testing had gone up to almost 1.25 lacs. Then why this sudden drop in testing is not clear from the affidavit. Then how it can claim a low positivity rate of infection when the testing count itself is inadequate.” The government data with other information were mentioned in a counter affidavit submitted by health department's additional chief secretary Pratyaya Amrit on behalf of the state government on Tuesday. The government also claimed that 71% people in urban areas had been vaccinated, but the affidavit was silent on the categorical details. The court was dissatisfied with the information furnished on vaccination. The bench also expressed dissatisfaction as the affidavit was silent on the future course of steps for vaccination as there was no district wise information available about health infrastructure for treatment of Covid-19 and non-Covid patients in the government and private hospitals. The court directed the state government to file another counter affidavit especially focussing on district wise vaccination and health infrastructure for oxygenated beds and other facilities before the next hearing on Friday. The court, however, appreciated the state’s effort to increase people’s awareness about Covid-19, but directed the government to take further necessary stern decisions to ensure that people wear masks, keep social distancing and follow other norms. The bench also made adverse oral observations against state government for laxity as advocate general Lalit Kishore didn’t appear before it on the pandemic matter for a second time and there was also no instruction given to additional advocate general Anjani Kumar for assisting the court. Dealing with the issue of ESIC Medical College and Hospital in Bihta, the court directed its dean Saumya Chakraborty to file another affidavit that by what time 247 vacant posts of doctors and paramedics would be filled there. The bench was dissatisfied with it as no timeline was mentioned in the affidavit regarding completing the recruitment process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-pulls-up-bihar-govt-for-inadequate-covid-test-counts/articleshow/84801446.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The Centre has asked all states to join the common counselling to avoid inconvenience to students. Since all admissions into the medical stream are being done on the basis of the National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET), the Centre wanted the states to join the common counselling. Sources said that about 20 states have expressed their willingness to join the central counselling. However, the expert committee constituted by the health department is reported to have advised against joining the common central counselling for medical admissions keeping in view separate reservations being implemented in the state. After taking chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy’s consent, the state will formally communicate to the Centre its decision to conduct the medical counselling process on its own. NTR University of Health Sciences (NTRUHS) will continue the counselling for medical admissions in the state. The Centre has decided to conduct the NEET on September 12 across the country and started identifying seats available at the undergraduate level in all the colleges with recognition. According to the information shared by the Centre, about 5,010 seats are available at the UG level in both government and private medical colleges in the state. As many as 2,185 seats are available in government medical colleges while 2,673 seats are available in private medical colleges. Another 152 seats are available in autonomous Padmavathi Women’s Medical College. About 335 seats will be spared for the EBC quota in all colleges. Andhra Medical College (Visakhapatnam), Government Medical College, Guntur and Rangaraya Government Medical College, Kakinada are the three colleges that will fill the highest number of seats with each college having 250 seats.

---||Business||Dr Reddy’s tanks 10% on news of US legal action||HYDERABAD/MUMBAI: The Dr Reddy’s Laboratories scrip tanked over 10% on Tuesday, which ended up pulling the BSE sensex down, after the company admitted that it could face civil or criminal enforcement actions in the US and other countries over a whistleblower complaint. The stock crashed after the company informed the bourses that it has been subpoenaed by the US markets regulator Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 6 for documents pertaining to certain Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. Dr Reddy’s said, “The matter may result in government enforcement actions against the company in the US and/or foreign jurisdictions, which could lead to civil and criminal sanctions under relevant laws, the probability of such action and the outcome are not reasonably ascertainable at this time.” An anonymous whistleblower complaint had alleged that healthcare professionals in Ukraine and other countries were provided with improper payments by or on behalf of the company in violation of US anti-corruption laws, specifically the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The court order came after it had disclosed the matter to the US Department of Justice, SEC and Securities Exchange Board of India, the BSE filing said. The company is in the process of responding to the case. A US law firm is conducting the investigation at the instruction of a committee of the company’s board, it said. The scrip of the Hyderabad-based pharma major opened at Rs 5,421 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) but plummeted to a low of Rs 4,781 before closing 10.4% down (a fall of Rs 565) at Rs 4,844 as compared to the previous close of Rs 5,409. Though Dr Reddy’s had informed the bourses about the whistleblower complaint and the commencement of a detailed investigation in November 2020, the company’s admission on Tuesday of the possibility of legal troubles ahead — coupled with a 1.5% decline in consolidated net profit for the first quarter ended June 30, 2021 — proved too much for the markets to digest. Dr Reddy’s Q1FY22’s consolidated net profit fell to Rs 571 crore from Rs 579 crore in Q1FY21, largely due to price erosion in the key North American market. The company’s profits fell despite an 11% rise in consolidated revenues at Rs 4,919 crore from Rs 4,418 crore in Q1FY21. As a result, the stock crashed by 10%, making Dr Reddy’s the biggest laggard among the 30 sensex constituents. Heavy selling in Dr Reddy’s also had its impact on several other pharma stocks. As a result, the BSE Healthcare index closed 2.9% lower with Alembic Pharma, Glenmark and Lupin all closing between 5% and 11.5% lower. Of the total 274-point slide in the sensex, Dr Reddy’s accounted for 62 points, BSE data showed. Market players said the news about Dr Reddy’s receiving a subpoena from the US legal authorities/regulators had spooked investor sentiment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dr-reddys-tanks-10-on-news-of-us-legal-action/articleshow/84806416.cms||---

The district administration officials claimed that this is first of its kind initiative taken in the state to monitor the work at the district level and to speedily approve job cards. According to officials, at present, people looking for work have to approach the gram pradhans (village heads) if they need work under the MGNREGA. However, in most cases the pradhans start the projects at their own leisure which defeats the purpose of providing work within 15 days as mandated under the Act. Speaking to TOI, Nainital chief development officer (CDO), Sandeep Tiwari, said that the purpose for providing work using WhatsApp is also to monitor the situation more proactively at the district level especially after Covid when thousands of migrants have returned home and are looking for work. “We want to monitor the situation at our level. As soon as we receive any request, we will verify the claim and provide work to the needy within the stipulated time which, many times, doesn’t happen when people approach the pradhan,” he said. However, there could be one more reason for taking this step. District level data has revealed that Nainital missed its target in providing work under the scheme. According to the data, the district has achieved only 64% of the target allotted to it in the month of July even though the month has almost come to an end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/job-under-mgnrega-now-a-whatsapp-message-away/articleshow/84799829.cms||Prashant Jha

Dholavira becomes the fourth WHS in Gujarat after Champaner, Rani ki Vav in Patan, and the historic city of Ahmedabad. This is the second WHS honour for India in less than a week — Ramappa Temple in Telangana’s Warangal was granted the status on July 25. The first representation for Dholavira’s inscription was made in 2014 by the Government of India. The ancient town, found in 1967 and excavated in 1989-90 for the first time, is the second biggest Harappan site after Rakhigarhi in India. It was inhabited for about 1,200 years starting 3000 BCE, said experts. Joy erupted among archaeologists, historians, and academics in Gujarat and India after the formal announcement of Dholavira’s new title was made at about 3.30pm during the ongoing 44th session of Unesco’s World Heritage Committee. Experts said that after Mohenjodaro in Pakistan, Dholavira is the second Harappan site to get the tag in south Asia and the first from India. “Absolutely delighted by this news. Dholavira was an important urban centre and is one of our most important linkages with our past,” PM Narendra Modi tweeted soon after the news broke. “It is a must visit, especially for those interested in history, culture and archaeology.” The PM also mentioned that he had visited Dholavira during his student days and was mesmerized by the place. “As CM of Gujarat, I had the opportunity to work on aspects relating to heritage conservation and restoration in Dholavira,” he tweeted. “Our team also worked to create tourism-friendly infrastructure there.” Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani termed it a proud moment for Gujarat. Union culture minister G Kishan Reddy tweeted that Dholavira is the 40th ‘treasure’ of India to be given the Unesco WHS inscription. “Today is a proud day for India, especially for the people of Gujarat,” he tweeted. Dr R S Bisht, former deputy superintending archaeologist of the Archaeological Survey of India, who led the excavation team in 1989-90 at Dholavira, said that he was delighted with the news. “The town is truly a World Heritage Site and a window to the past,” he said. “We have learnt so much about the Harappan civilization from the site, and continue to do so.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hurrah-appa-guj-jewel-is-now-a-world-heritage-site/articleshow/84806156.cms||---

---||Patna||House panel led by Bihar CM Nitish Kumar should meet PM for caste-based census: Tejashwi Prasad Yadav||PATNA: Leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Tuesday said a House committee consisting members from all parties headed by CM Nitish Kumar should call on PM Narendra Modi and plead for the caste-based census in the country. Tejashwi made the suggestion to Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha during the Zero Hour, and also pressed for a discussion on the matter in the House. He said the Speaker should constitute the committee. However, the Speaker observed that it was just a “suggestion” and could not be taken for a discussion. The Narendra Modi-led NDA government at the Centre had maintained in the Lok Sabha that caste-based census will be conducted only for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. However, in Bihar, the state assembly had adopted unanimous resolutions on two occasions – in 2019 and 2020 – urging the Centre to hold the caste-based census in the country. While the RJD led by Lalu Prasad has been demanding caste-based census since 2015, CM Nitish Kumar has also been pressing for it. The RJD and JD(U) are on the same page with regard to the demand for caste-based census. The BJP has been toeing the line of the central government. Meanwhile, in reply to the question of MLA Ram Prawesh Rai, mines and geology minister Janak Ram said in the state assembly that only two private sand mining companies were opposing the recent 50% increase in the revenue earned from sand mining. “The two companies were in the habit of making tax evasions. All other sand mining companies are agreeable to the bid of the government to increase its revenue returns by 50% from sand mining,” he said. In reply to the question of BJP member Janak Singh, education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said the government would extend maternity leave of 730 days for two children to teaching and non-teaching women staff of the university and colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/house-panel-led-by-nitish-should-meet-pm-for-caste-based-census-tejashwi/articleshow/84802169.cms||Abhay Singh

He said taking into account the predicted third wave of Covid pandemic, 40 paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) were being set up – 30 in government medical colleges and hospitals and 10 in sadar hospitals. Replying to two different questions raised by Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra, the minister said establishment of 1,600 health institutes in 15 months would be biggest initiative in the state’s health sector after the independence. “Tenders have already been floated in this regard. Five health and wellness centres and one primary health centres will be established in each assembly constituency along with 122 community health centres,” the minister said while replying to Mishra’s charge that several health centres in the state were being used to keep animals and stock their food. On the likely third wave of Covid, Pandey said apart from establishment of additional PICUs, existing beds in the PICUs were being attached with the oxygen pipeline. “To tackle the third wave, almost 28,594 beds are ready in government hospitals, including 16,986 with oxygen facility and 2,584 are ICU beds. Different government hospitals have also been provided 1,150 ventilators to tackle any emergency,” he added. Giving details of work being done by his department, Pandey said liquid medical storage tanks would be set up in all the government medical colleges and hospitals. “Pressure swing absorption oxygen plants are being set up at different hospitals and community health centres. District hospitals have been given 10,924 B-type and 3,696 ED type oxygen cylinders as well as 6,183 oxygen concentrators,” the minister added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/1600-health-institutes-to-be-established-in-bihar-in-15-months-minister/articleshow/84801896.cms||---

This makes it South Asia’s first global business-to-business (B2B) payments unicorn (valued at more than $1 billion). The current round is led by Riverwood Capital, a US-based high-growth tech investor. Temasek, Visa, Vertex Ventures, Atinum Group of Funds, Beacon Venture Capital, Rocket Capital Investment and other angel investors including DoorDash executive Gokul Rajaram, FIS chief product officer Vicky Bindra, and Tribe Capital co-founder Arjun Sethi also contributed to the round. Singapore-based Nium’s business has significantly scaled during the pandemic. The company processes $8 billion in payments annually and has issued more than 30 million virtual cards to date. Its revenues grew by more than 280% year-on-year from markets across EMEA and APAC. The company, which recently announced two major acquisitions, said that the series-D investment provides the flexibility to explore additional strategic opportunities. According to Nanu, the funds from this round will be used to accelerate growth in the US and Latin America. “We started Nium with the humble goal of taking out regional complexity in cross-border payments. Today, our sights are set higher. We believe we can be a global catalyst to increase commerce worldwide, removing some of the payments friction which has traditionally held businesses back,” said Nanu. He added that the Nium platform simplifies the B2B payments experience by enabling critical financial services to be easily embedded. According to a statement issued by the company, its success will be driven by two recent strategic acquisitions — the acquisition of B2B travel payments leader Ixaris, which added comprehensive virtual card issuance capabilities to the Nium platform, as well as the acquisition of Wirecard Forex India, which gives Nium greater reach into India’s booming payments market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/b2b-co-nium-becomes-latest-unicorn-with-200mn-mop-up/articleshow/84806548.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||CM Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy sets deadline for construction work, tells officials to focus on quality||VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has asked officials to ensure quality in construction works. He told collectors and joint collectors to monitor the construction of various government buildings and houses across the state. The chief minister held a video conference with the district collectors, joint collectors and the SPs on Spandana, the grievance redressal programme from his Tadepalli camp office on Tuesday. He reviewed the progress of the construction of village secretariat buildings, Rythu Bharosa Kendra (RBK), health clinics, digital libraries and the houses for the poor. The chief minister said that people would be closely monitoring these construction activities across the state as they were being held in the habitations. The buildings for the village secretariats, village clinics, digital libraries and the RBKs are in the midst of villages, where people would be watching the quality of the work. He also said that the state government had distributed 30 lakh house sites across the state and taken up construction of 15.6 lakh houses. The beneficiaries would be keeping an eye on the quality of these works, he said and cautioned the officials to ensure quality in every work. The chief minister told the district collectors and the joint collectors to ensure quality in cement, sand and iron, besides other furniture required for all these buildings and the houses. The quality of the work would reflect the commitment of the government towards the people, he told the officials. The chief minister had asked them to visit the village secretariats on weekly basis to ensure quality delivery of services at the grassroots. The chief minister also set the deadline for completion of each category of the buildings. He wanted the collectors to complete the construction of RBKs and digital libraries by December 2021, village secretariats and health clinics by September 2021 and urban clinics by November 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/jagan-sets-deadline-for-construction-work-tells-officials-to-focus-on-quality/articleshow/84802853.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Surat||Now, Veer Narmad South Gujarat University students will say when to take exams!||SURAT: Students of Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) will be able to give exams every month, if, things go as planned. Meanwhile, VNSGU’s syndicate and academic council has approved a proposal to prepare modalities of the new ‘On Demand Exam’ (ODE) system. If this turns into a reality, VNSGU will probably create a unique record in the country to approve the system for which it has already started preparations. A committee will be appointed by the vice-chancellor to decide on the modalities. The system will help students save at least nine months in getting admission in the next academic session, or course or employment. In the initial phase, the system is being brought for only those students who have failed in the exam. ODE will, however, not benefit regular students. As per the requirement of minimum time required for each course a student cannot appear in exam before the course period is over. Earlier, those who failed had to wait for at least six months to appear in the next semester exam and one month later for announcement of results. If the student fails again, he can appear in next semester exam. “In the existing system it takes a minimum six months to clear an exam and for admission in next year or course students have to wait for a year. But ODE will save at least nine months if the student clears the exam in the first attempt,” said K N Chavda, vice-chancellor, VNSGU. It will be a herculean task for the teachers and exam department of VNSGU to conduct exams on demand. They will have to keep sets of multiple question papers, organise seating arrangement and get the answer books checked on a regular interval. “Our planning is such that a student can appear in an exam once in a month. This will be a massive task but we have started preparations for it,” said Chavda. With this new system, 12 exams will be conducted in a year and students can choose a date themselves for the test. The varsity recently approved a double entry system in which a student can take admission in a year during the start of the academic year or in the middle of the academic year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/now-vnsgu-students-will-say-when-to-take-exams/articleshow/84803604.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

But the mystery over disappearance of 65-year-old Sheikh Babu Nisar is yet to be solved. The CID (crime), Gandhinagar that is investigating the case hasn’t been able to trace his body even as six policemen were booked for custodial death and arrested in August last year.  Though there is no clue about Nisar’s body, CID sleuths said that their efforts are still on. “Our investigations showed that the accused may have disposed his body within 60 to 100 km from Vadodara city. We visited several villages in the vicinity and examined details of the unidentified dead bodies that were found after Nisar went missing,” said Girish Pandya, SP, CID (crime), Gandhinagar.  Pandya said four to five unidentified bodies whose description matched to Nisar were found, but they were decomposed and the face wasn’t recognizable. “Samples were taken from the bodies and sent to Surat FSL for DNA test. We are waiting for the results,” Pandya told TOI. He added that the accused cops have maintained that Nisar walked out of the police station and they have no role in his disappearance. “But we have enough evidence against them,” Pandya said.  The accused cops including police inspector, Dharmendrasinh Gohil, PSI Dasrath Rabari and LRD jawans Pankaj Mavjibhai, Yogendrasinh Jeelansinh, Rajesh Savjibhai and Hitesh Shambhubhai are in judicial custody. On December 10, 2019 Nisar, who sold clothes for a living, had parted ways with his son-in-law Ibrahim Khan Pathan and they were to meet up at Vadodara central bus depot within few hours.  When Nisar didn’t return, Pathan and his family began looking for him. A month later, they filed a missing persons complaint at Sayajigunj police station. Investigators learnt that Fatehgunj police had picked him up on suspicion of theft on December 10 and the cops said that they let him off within few hours. Pathan later approached Gujarat high court that ordered the city police to probe Nisar’s disappearance and submit a report. CID (crime) was later given investigation of the case.  Investigations and CCTV footage revealed that Nisar had entered Fatehgunj police station but there was no evidence of him leaving. Based on the evidence, six cops were booked in July 2020 for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, disappearance of evidence, destruction of evidence and giving false information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/18-months-on-nisars-body-still-untraced/articleshow/84802361.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Patna||Police officers, oppn MLAs under lens for Mar 23 incident in House: Speaker||PATNA: State assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha on Tuesday said action would be taken against police officers if they were found responsible for the unprecedented scenes on the premises of the House on March 23 during the passage of the Bihar Special Armed Police (BSAP) Bill, 2021. “The ethics committee of the House has also been looking into the role of the opposition MLAs on that day,” he said. The issue recurred yet again on Tuesday when leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said during the Zero Hour that two constables had been suspended, but the police officers who gave the order were spared. “There should be a debate on the March 23 incident and the government should also make a statement on it,” Tejashwi said. Cutting Tejashwi short and noting that the House members from across the parties will be asked to make their statements when the proper time comes, the Speaker read out the text of his detailed observations on that “unprecedented” incident, adding it was not the first time that “undignified behaviour on the part of the MLAs had occurred in the House.” He referred to five occasions from the past when the MLAs concerned were suspended, reiterating that upholding the dignity of the House was the responsibility of every member since they were being watched by lakhs of people whom they represented. As to the March 23 incident, the Speaker said, “Based on its initial findings, the high-level committee comprising additional chief secretary of the home department and DGP had recommended action against two constables and both of whom have been suspended.” “The committee will submit its full report later. If officers are found responsible, action will be taken against them,” the Speaker said. The Speaker said he was “insulted” by the MLAs and what unfolded on March 23 was “anarchical” that required “very stringent step”. “The Chair is the custodian of the House. It is an instrument to give proper direction to this House, so that people’s interests are fulfilled. If you insult the Chair and also close him in the room, an anarchical situation will prevail in the House. This is what happened on that day,” the Speaker said. “That day’s incident was the climax of the passions of the members. Everything had gone out of hand. To put things in order, stringent steps (calling in the police) were taken,” he said. Pointing to the recent observation of the Supreme Court on the incidents in Kerala assembly, former Speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary said the freedom of the House members meant the freedom to make their statements, observations and opinions on the floor of the House, but it did not mean resorting to methods that amounted to “damaging the House property, like chairs, microphones and tables”. “We should not do something that invites interventions from constitutional institutions (like the Supreme Court in the case of the Kerala House) into the affairs of the House,” Choudhary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/police-officers-oppn-mlas-under-lens-for-mar-23-incident-in-house-speaker/articleshow/84801545.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Business||Upskill in line with new job trends to thrive amid crises||By Chaitanya Sreenivas The pandemic has altered many facets of our professional lives, and given some important lessons that are crucial to thriving in the new normal. It has brought the significance of foundational skills to the fore, as they have a longer life when compared to perishable skills associated with specialised processes or tools. Today, foundational skills are becoming critical. These enable employees to cope with the new normal of work-from-anywhere and are indispensable for their career growth. As for organisations, they need their workforce to own these competencies to help catalyse their shift to new business models, accelerate innovation and improve customer experience. Emerging competency framework An observation of the corporate workplace trends and recent studies show that resilience, perseverance, interpersonal communication and holistically managing your well-being are important foundational skills that employees should possess. Career resilience, which is fast emerging as a core professional competency in the new normal, should be the priority for employees. With resilience, they gain the ability to adjust to career change — irrespective of the surrounding circumstances — and can navigate obstacles in their career paths. By becoming resilient, they can also make their organisations future-proof. To create career resilience, employees should assess and benchmark the functions that will help them excel and accordingly develop competitive abilities in line with the evolving job trends. The shift from career dependence to career resilience is inescapable. Further, in an increasingly autonomous environment, employees need improved creativity and problem-solving abilities, for which perseverance is vital. Perseverance also fosters cognitive functions that are essential for innovations. Another competency that employees should build in the distance economy is interpersonal communication to ensure they effectively collaborate with their teams, retain & grow client relationships and drive organisational change. Besides, strong interpersonal communication is necessary to show empathy and self-expression. Well-being is a skill too that they should have and hone, following an appropriate fitness regime and a clear delineation of work, personal and family time. Employees should also be mindful of their financial, mental and physical health as working in isolation does take its toll over a period. Lifelong learning can’t stop Employees should not stop the continuous learning mechanisms in the realm of digital skills. These are now economic imperatives that provide a competitive advantage to employees. Those who plan and improve their skills continuously are likely to evolve into high performers. In the fully digital environment that we live in, every employee should inculcate basic digital skills to work and collaborate with team members, clients, partners and other stakeholders. These skills will give them a basic understanding of data concepts, and processes like data visualisation and advanced analytics that are crucial in the new normal. While employees embark on a path of building foundational skills and continuous learning, organisations, for their part, should put in place talent strategies focusing on these functions besides investing in across-the-board employee learning programmes. They should reimagine the competencies that their employees should possess to continue working remotely or in a hybrid model. If organisations do not set out on this path now, they may find it difficult to do so at scale in the future. To summarise, the name of the game in the Covid era should be the new attributes — resilience, perseverance, and interpersonal communication, coupled with continuous learning. They are fundamental to enhancing product development and delivery, customer experience and the ability to innovate as new working environments, business models and technologies emerge. The workforce and their organisations should embrace these changes. As the Greek philosopher, Heraclitus, remarked hundreds of years ago, “Change is the only constant in life.” The writer is VP & HR head, IBM, India/South Asia||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/upskill-in-line-with-new-job-trends-to-thrive-amid-crises/articleshow/84806767.cms||---

Altogether 22 people were arrested in connection with ACP and 83 others were detained for travelling without tickets in the last three days. Danapur divisional railway manager (DRM) Sunil Kumar said cases of ACP, HPD, stone pelting and cattle run over were rampant in the division. “A team of RPF personnel headed by Uday Kumar Singh and Munna Kumar intensified track patrolling on the Buxar-Ara-Patna, Patna-Mokama-Jhajha and Biharsharif-Rajgir sections of the division to check ACP and HPD cases,” he said, adding such illegal activities by the vested interests badly affected punctuality of passenger trains and caused inconveniences to passengers. Stray cattle are often run over by trains at several places in the division. “Some cattle were found tied to a pole near tracks at Zamania near Buxar recently. The RPF team visited the nearby villages and counselled villagers not to tie cattle to the poles along the tracks,” the DRM said. He added the RPF team has so far visited 18 villages located along rail tracks in the division and urged villagers to desist from indulging in chain pulling and stone pelting. ECR chief public relations officer Rajesh Kumar said men in uniform are also suggesting villagers to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour while travelling by trains. “The RPF men visited Pali Ghorikwa, Harkarnapur and other villages in Patna and Bhojpur districts recently to create awareness among villagers about Covid pandemic,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/22-arrested-in-three-days-for-pulling-chain-in-trains/articleshow/84800866.cms||Kumod Verma

---||Business||Paytm, ICICI slug it out on FASTag leadership||Mumbai: ICICI Bank and Paytm Payments Bank are slugging it out for the leadership position in National Electronic Toll Collection with both banks claiming market leadership. Paytm said that the payments bank is the largest FASTag issuer in the country as well as the largest acquirer of toll plazas. “Paytm has become the first bank in India to issue 1 crore FASTags, it has become the largest acquirer bank for payment collection at 280 toll plazas. This is almost 30% of the total FASTags issued by 32 banks in the country,” said Paytm Payments Bank chief business officer Sajal Bhatnagar. On Saturday, ICICI Bank executive director Sandeep Batra said that the bank has acquired market leadership in FASTag with 36% of the value of toll collections in FY21. “Our FASTag numbers during the first quarter have seen 146% growth year-on-year,” said Batra. Toll collection is a remunerative business for banks as the issuer bank gets a 1.5% commission on the transactions. ICICI Bank was one of the early movers to partner with the ministry of road transport and highways in its pilot project for electronic toll collections in 2014. Paytm has been able to ramp up the numbers because of its large user base. The big advantage Paytm has is that the primary e-wallet can be the FASTag wallet. This means that the user does not have to block his funds in an idle FASTag-only wallet. According to Bhatnagar, Paytm has an advantage over other issuers as customers can dip into their regular e-wallets for making toll payments. In most e-wallets, the money is locked in a separate wallet. Paytm is also working with the National Highway Authority of India toll concessionaires to implement multi-lane free-flow tolling using automatic number plate-recognition technology. This will make toll collections more efficient. Despite issuing a large volume of FASTags, ICICI Bank can generate higher value as heavy commercial vehicles account for the bulk of road toll payments. According to government data, toll collection in June 2021 increased to Rs 2,576 crore, which is around 21% higher than Rs 2,125 crore collected in May 2021. It is not just FASTag issuance that banks are competing for. Banks are also in a race to acquire as many highway toll concession holders as possible. Electronic toll collection is already operational at 780 toll plazas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/paytm-icici-slug-it-out-on-fastag-leadership/articleshow/84806633.cms||Mayur Shetty

The high court directed concerned authorities to take immediate steps to pay salaries to teachers and others working in various institutions under Mansas Trust. Former Union minister Ashok Gajapati Raju moved the high court seeking directions to set aside GO 75 issued by the state government to appoint board members to the trust. Senior counsel D V Seetharama Murthy and advocate N Ashwani Kumar argued on behalf of Ashok stating that the GO 75 has become invalid after the GO 74 was set aside by the high court as it was consequential to GO 74. Murthy further argued that the EO was not cooperating with the chairman of the trust in day to day affairs like payment of salaries to employees and renewing of agriculture land leases. He said that the EO issued proceedings based on GO 75 which cannot stand to the test of law after Go 74 was set aside. Justice M Venkata Ramana asked who has the authority to draw salaries to the employees and what was the role of EO in paying salaries. Murthy said that the correspondent and principal of respective institutions are the authorised personal to pay the salaries to employees. Justice Venkata Ramana asked when the principal and correspondent are the authorised personal, why the EO was interfering in drawing salaries. The high court observed that the employees should not be deprived of their salaries and suspended the proceedings issued by the EO freezing the bank accounts of the trust. Additional advocate general, Ponnavolu Sudhakar Reddy, and counsel for endowments department, K Madhava Reddy, argued that the EO is acting according to the rules prescribed to protect the interests of the trust. They said that the allegation of non-cooperation by EO were not true and he only sought time to give the information asked by Ashok in the capacity of chairman of the trust. Considering the arguments on both sides, the high court suspended the proceedings of the EO and asked to pay salaries to employees. The high court also directed that the district audit officials to conduct the audit of books of the trust according to the rules. The high court further directed the state government to file an affidavit regarding the plea to set aside GO 75.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-cancels-eos-move-to-freeze-mansas-bank-a/c/articleshow/84803512.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat in bottom 5 with fewer insured women||AHMEDABAD: With fewer women in the workforce, Gujarat ranks among the bottom five states with the least number of women having life insurance coverage. Only 27% life insurance policy holders in Gujarat, one of the most industrialised states in the country, are women. This is much lower than the all-India average of 32%, states Insurance Regulatory & Development Authority of India (IRDAI) in its annual report for 2019-20. Gender equality in the labour market is one of the major concerns in the state due to which the number of policy holders is less, say insurance experts. Other states and Union territories with the least number of women covered for life are Daman, Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli (19%), Ladakh (22%), Haryana (27%) and Jammu and Kashmir (27%). “The declining trend of working women impacts uptakes for life insurance policies. Female labour force participation rate (FLFPR) in Gujarat is 16.9% -- lower than the national average of 18.6%, according to Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) 2018-19. This is true for both rural and urban Gujarat,” said Naval Goel, founder & CEO, PolicyX.com, an insurance comparison portal. “Further, gender differences in labour force participation rates are wider in Gujarat (40.8%) compared to those observed at the national level (35.4). Due to this, fewer women are insured,” Goel added. The total number of policies sold in the year 2019-20 across India stood at 2.88 crore, with a first-year premium (FYP) of Rs 1.02 lakh crore. Of these 93 lakh policies were bought by women in India. Industry sources also said that the awareness is also one of the major deterrents for the lesser adoption among women. “The level of awareness about having a life insurance policy is less among women and is not a priority. This is especially true among home makers, which impacts overall uptakes,” said a city-based insurance sector expert, on condition of anonymity. The top five states and union territories with the highest ratio of women life insurance policy holders include Kerala (43%), Andhra Pradesh (40%), Mizoram (40%), Puducherry (39%) and Tamil Nadu (38%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-in-bottom-5-with-fewer-insured-women/articleshow/84806065.cms||Niyati Parikh

The MPs led by party leader V Vijayasai Reddy met Union minister for road transport and highways, Nitin Gadkari, and requested him to upgrade two state highways into national highways. The MPs wanted the central government to declare the Narsipatnam-Sabbavaram Junction road and Narsipatnam-Tuni road as national highways. The MPs suggested the road from Sabbavaram junction be developed via Venkannapalem, Chodavaram, Vaddadi, Ravikhamatham and Kothakota, which is now the state highway. Similarly, the road from Narsipatnam to Tuni be developed passing through Gannavaram and Kotananduru. The upgradation of these two roads would come to 100 km, the MPs said. These two roads are already connected to the Kolkata-Chennai, Raipur-Visakhapatnam, Rajamahendravaram-Vizianagaram and Pendurthy-Bowdara national highways. The state highways like Waddadi-Paderu, Anakapalli-Chodavaram Road, Narsipatnam-Tallapalem Road and Narsipatnam-Revupolavaram road are also connected. The upgradation of these two roads would ease the vehicular traffic on these connecting national highways and the state highways too, the MPs said. The MPs met Union minister for rural development and panchayat raj, Giriraj Singh, and requested him to clear Rs 6,750 crore dues to the state. They also requested the minister to increase the wage days for the state from 100 to 150 considering the need to provide wages to the people. The MPs sought to inform the Union minister that the state has been ahead of others in providing work for the wage seekers. The state had provided 18.4 crore wage days in 2020. They also informed the Union minister that AP had provided 16.7 crore wage days by June 30, 2021 against the target of 16 crore wage days. The also requested him to increase the unit cost of Anganwadi centre to Rs 20 lakh from the present Rs 7 lakh. They said the material component cost had gone up over the years and requested the minister to consider the proposal. They also wanted the minister to change the unit cost of Rs 20 lakh at Rs 15 lakh as central share and Rs 5 lakh as state government share.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ysrc-mps-meet-central-mins-seek-funds-for-devpt-projects/articleshow/84802774.cms||Gopi Dara

He promised to look into their grievances. At a meeting to review these demands, the CM expressed concern over how the continued agitation had impacted the functioning of various departments. An official said a committee of officers had found the origins of these grievances in the pre-2006 government’s decisions and not in the 6th Punjab Pay Commission report. The committee will take the recommendations of the departments concerned on the demands. Certain demands linked with the intra or inter-department issues will be addressed in consultation with the personnel and finance departments. The state government had decided to implement the 6th Punjab Pay Commission’s recommendations within a month. The implementation with effect from July 1 has resulted in a financial outflow of Rs 4,692 crore a year to about 2.85 lakh employees and 3.07 lakh pensioners. On an average, it works out to Rs 79,250 a year, over and above what each employee gets at present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-cm-appeals-to-govt-staff-to-end-strike/articleshow/84807626.cms||---

Notably, last week a young industrialist had allegedly ended his life by suicide, attracting the attention of the industry body to help entrepreneurs in overcoming challenges being faced by them. “We have noticed that many of the entrepreneurs are going through a bad phase during the current pandemic and struggling to sustain their industries. In view of this grim situation, the CMIA has established a helpdesk for carrying out counselling of such entrepreneurs,” CMIA president Shivprasad Jaju said on Tuesday. Aurangabad and its fringe areas have around 5,000 different industrial units with many of them going through a rough ptach. CMIA secretary Satish Lonikar said the helpdesk will guide entrepreneurs so that they can come out of the tough situation and continue to run the industries. “The CMIA has a legacy of more than five decades during which noted industrialists and leaders served as its office-bearers. The experience of such veterans would prove handy to entrepreneurs in tiding over the current unprecedented crisis,” he said. The CMIA has appealed to the industries facing various challenges to contact its helpdesk on 0240-2324509, 2355090, 2333029 8888889670, 8668415762.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/cmia-starts-helpdesk-for-troubled-industries/articleshow/84807621.cms||---

Treasurer Aarendra Sharma also took charge at the event at the Congress headquarters on Rajpur Road. A procession of Godiyal, with former chief minister and Congress’s election campaign committee head Harish Rawat present, passed through city roads on Tuesday and was greeted by party members along the way. “If voted to power, Congress will bring laws which will limit purchase of land in Uttarakhand by non-residents,” Rawat said. Addressing party members, Godiyal said, “It is time to uproot the BJP government. It has proved to be a failure on all fronts. Be it prices of petrol, diesel or LPG cylinders, the BJP, despite having a clear majority at the Centre and the state, has failed the common man.” Godiyal reiterated that changing three chief ministers in four months had revealed the BJP’s failure to the people. “When the country and the state was fighting the second wave of Covid-19, BJP was busy experimenting with chief ministers, putting development and healthcare on the backburner,” he said. Harish Rawat agreed, calling BJP a “rollback government”. “Its chief ministers, rather than solving public issues, are busy reversing decisions of their predecessors. If the decisions were wrong, why were they taken in the first place? Poor handling of the Covid situation, coupled with the failure to provide employment to people, has exposed the current government to the people,” he said.  Godiyal, 55, who hails from Bahedi village of Pauri district, won the Thalisain assembly constituency in 2002. In 2012, he won from Srinagar assembly constituency and later lost the seat to BJP candidate Dhan Singh Rawat in 2017. Harish Rawat was the first Congress state chief of Uttarakhand from November 9, 2000 to 2007. He was replaced by Yashpal Arya, who held the post from 2007 to June 12, 2014. Former minister Kishore Upadhyay became the third state Congress chief from June 13, 2013 to May 3, 2017. Chakrata MLA Pritam Singh took over on June 14, 2017 and held the post till July 22 this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/godiyal-takes-charge-as-state-cong-chief-vows-to-uproot-bjp-in-upcoming-polls/articleshow/84799900.cms||Kautilya Singh

Opposition leader V D Satheesan who released an RTI document in the House claimed that there is a difference of 7,316 deaths from the official figures released by the government. Satheesan said the government was covering up the deaths and it has become evident from the information received from the Kerala Information Mission under RTI, which said a total of 23,486 deaths have occurred in the state till July16 this year. However, according to the official release from the chief minister’s office, the total number of deaths is just over 15,000. “It has become evident that the state government is covering up the deaths. The opposition is now exploring the possibility of taking the issue to the court. The government will have to release the entire data of the actual deaths occurred in the state. For that the opposition will go to any extreme,” said Satheesan. The opposition also alleged that the health minister has informed all the district authorities not to report the death as Covid if the patient was having any kind of comorbidities. “We have clear information that the minister had given this instruction through a Zoom meeting of the health officials,” said Satheesan. As per the RTI document, the total deaths occurred in the state due to Covid-19 from January 2020 to July 16, 2021 is 23,486. Of this, May (2020 and 2021 combined) recorded the highest number of deaths — 11,258. The opposition leader said the centre and ICMR had expressed concerns over the reporting of deaths in Kerala, but the state government still swear that they are reporting the deaths based on the WHO and ICMR guidelines. The government will be forced to reveal the exact numbers before the people for which the opposition would try its maximum, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/state-covered-up-7316-deaths-oppn/articleshow/84805192.cms||---

Agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal told TOI that schools and colleges will operate with full capacity, “The decision has been taken in view of the declining number of Covid cases in the Himalayan state,” he said. The education department will soon issue a standard operating procedure (SOP) for the opening of schools, colleges and universities, the minister said, adding that the school administration will be required to enforce Covid protocols. “School authorities will ensure that building premises are sanitised and teachers, students and staff are wearing masks,” he said. The move has not gone down well with parents who said the decision has been “taken in haste”. Arif Khan, president of the National Association of Parents for Students Rights, said, “The government seems confused. On one hand, it is cautioning people about the Delta variant and the expected third wave of Covid-19 and on the other hand, they are opening schools for children who are likely to be most vulnerable to the third wave.” Khan added that it doesn’t make sense to open schools and colleges at a time when the night curfew has continued in the state and Kanwar yatra was also cancelled in the wake of the pandemic. The association will appeal against the decision. “We will approach the district magistrate on Wednesday with a memorandum addressed to the chief minister, requesting him to not open the institutions as it will directly impact the health of our children,” said Khan. Schools in the state have been closed since April 2020 due to the pandemic. Though the state government had tried to reopen schools for classes 11 and 12 last year, the order had to be withdrawn as Covid numbers went up again. Students of classes 10 and 12 had attended school for a brief period in the early months of 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/schools-to-open-for-classes-6-to-12-parents-body-to-appeal-against-hasty-decision/articleshow/84799882.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Ahmedabad||HC stays self-appointed arbitrators’ orders||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court has stayed two orders allegedly passed by self-appointed arbitrators in property disputes, when two petitioners complained that they had not consented to arbitration and the proceedings were held fraudulently. One such case involved Murari Todi’s family, who lived in a bungalow in Ambawadi as tenants for the last four decades. The bungalow was bought a couple of years ago by one Kamlesh Patel, who allegedly appointed an advocate, Rohit Patel, as an arbitrator on a so-called arbitration agreement. Patel passed an award on July 15 by which the Todi family were to give possession of the bungalow to the owner. Execution of the arbitrator’s award requires an order from the civil court by instituting execution proceedings. According to the Todis, this did not take place and the owner with private persons and police personnel entered the bungalow on Monday morning, threw the furniture out and evicted the family. They rushed to the high court through senior advocate Sudhir Nanavati. The HC heard the case on Monday evening after court hours. It was submitted that the advocate who fraudulently issued arbitral award in this case was allegedly involved in other fraudulent arbitration proceedings earlier, and his orders were stayed by the high court. The orders were shown to the court. It was also submitted that Rohit Patel had claimed that his appointment was under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act by the high court, but no such order was ever passed by the high court. After hearing the case, Justice Nikhil Kariel stayed the arbitration award and summoned Rohit Patel, who had acted as arbitrator, to the court on July 30. On the HC order, the city police commissioner granted protection to the Todi family and it took a DCP’s visit to the house to remove trespassers from the premises, advocate Nanavati said. A similar case came up for the hearing earlier in the day. It involved an advocate, Morris Christian, who passed an arbitration order in connection with a property dispute. Christian had conducted arbitral proceedings in 2017-18 allegedly without appointment by the HC. On the basis of his order, one of the parties moved the city civil court for execution of the order. On the civil court’s notice, the other party came to know about the alleged fraud and moved the HC, which immediately stayed the arbitrator’s order. Besides staying Christian’s order, the HC also ordered him to restrain himself from passing such orders as an arbitrator. His practice of acting as a self-appointed arbitrator had come to the high court’s notice and contempt of court proceedings were initiated against him. The HC has summoned Christian on August 12 and issued him a show-cause notice, to explain why contempt of court proceedings should not be initiated against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-stays-self-appointed-arbitrators-orders/articleshow/84805196.cms||---

Justice N Anand Venkatesh observed that as per the report, Tangedco falls in the last grade ‘C-Grade’ within the scores 0-20 and unless effective steps are taken, reduce the power purchase cost and bring down the dependency on government subsidy, it is only going to move from bad to worse. The court made the observations while hearing a batch of petitions filed by AMRL Hitech City Limited which has established a multi-product special economic zone (SEZ) on 2,518 acres in Tirunelveli district. The company entered into a lease agreement with Tangedco, whereby a portion of the land was given for establishing and commissioning an electric sub-station. The Tamil Nadu Transmission Corporation Limited (TANTRANSCO) wanted to implement a scheme in order to cater to the growing power demand for further expansion of factories in the SEZ. After a route map was proposed for laying transmission lines, the company sought a deviation as the lines will be cutting across its property and affect the SEZ. Though TANTRANSCO accepted the deviation, an order was passed asking the company to pay the defrayment cost for deviation, failing which the work would be carried as per the original route. Challenging the same, the company filed these petitions. Justice Anand Venkatesh observed that the issue involved is an area of expertise and this court is completely ill-equipped to deal with the same. This court cannot give a definite finding on any of the issues raised on either side. Hence, the judge observed that this court is not inclined to interfere with the project implemented by the authorities. However, it is left open to the petitioner to make a representation to the concerned ministry to find a solution by coordinating with the concerned ministry, said the judge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/take-steps-to-turnaround-finances-hc-to-tangedco/articleshow/84805176.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The firm, Highway Construction Company, which has faced allegations of shoddy work in the past and has been penalised in the BMC’s penguin enclosure contract, was supposed to complete installation of the plants in one month. TimesViewDespite several allegations, the BMC went ahead and allowed work to be given to a tainted company. Now, since the company has failed to deliver on time, before awarding any new contract the BMC should come clean on all allegations and ensure that the work is awarded to competent firms in a transparent manner. Stern action must be taken for all delays and irregularities must be probed.BMC officials said that as per the tender conditions, the company will face a penalty of 0.5% of the total amount per week of the delay. Officials said while some sites were handed over to the company on June 16, some were handed over later by June 25 and that they would calculate the exact amount of penalty for locations where the oxygen plants are not operational in 30 days. The BJP has now demanded that given the company’s poor track record, the BMC must debar the company from a new Rs 320 crore oxygen plant contract. The BJP had last sought blacklisting of the company, which was awarded a Rs 84 crore contract for installing oxygen generation plants at 16 locations in Mumbai. The BJP alleged that the company had failed to install and commission the oxygen plants in 30 days as per the work order on July 16. “The BMC must immediately blacklist the company and file an FIR against it since it is playing with the lives of people. An enquiry must also be initiated against the officials from the BMC’s mechanical and electrical department who are conniving with the contractor,” said BJP MLA Ameet Satam, who inspected the plants at Juhu’s Cooper Hospital. “The new Rs 320 crore contract must not be given to this company. Instead of 1% per day, the BMC is imposing a penalty of just 0.5% of the total contract cost on the company,” he said. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said: “We are going to move the Lokayukta and the Bombay high court if the BMC gives the new Rs 320 crore oxygen contract to the same company. We are also filing a complaint with the Central Vigilance Commission,” Mishra said. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects) said: “We have issued a notice to the company. The penalty is 0.5% per week as per the tender condition. We will calculate the penalty once the work is over and it will be recovered. We will take stern action against the contractor for the delay and if there are any lapses.” Romin Chedha of Highway Construction Company did not respond to queries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-to-impose-0-5-penalty-on-co-for-delay-in-o2-plants/articleshow/84807676.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

I had worked on some of the Harappan-era sites in north India, but what we encountered at Dholavira was something unique – it was an intact town with very defined upper town, middle town and lower town areas, water reservoirs and water management system. When we started the work, there was only a makeshift road connecting the island to Rapar. Once I had to make a call to Delhi to coordinate a visit. I tried one place after another but could not find a single phone. I travelled 120km for a 10-minute conversation. There was no arrangement for stay, and we were often put up at government schools, making our meals on stoves. But what mattered was history unfolding in front of our eyes. The brick wall was among the first structures we encountered. Layer by layer, the town was revealed, and with it, the artefacts and Harappan precision. I remained associated with the area for 13 years, making some great friends, and meeting dignitaries ranging from the then CM Narendra Modi to union ministers and governors who were keen to see one of the finest examples of Harappan era. I am very happy that Dholavira has been acknowledged as a heritage site. I just wish that it gives impetus to archaeology, research and continuous curiosity to know about our past through latest technology. ‘Site helps us study changes that took place over a millennium’ Dr RS Bisht | Former joint DG, Archaeological Survey of India The site was initially marked by J P Joshi, an eminent archaeologist. When I arrived in Gujarat, initially I did not get permission to excavate, but the details at Dholavira were so striking even without much of a probe, that I realized that it could be a major discovery. In 1987, I was presenting a paper in Paris about comparison of Banawali, a Harappan-era town in north India, and Dholavira. Experts from across the globe were surprised that such town and town planning existed. They were even more surprised that Dholavira was still to be excavated completely. I am very happy that Dholavira exceeded expectations and emerged as a major town. On and off, we spent 13 seasons at the site, excavating it fully. In a way, I was also associated with Rani ki Vav excavation – happy that I was associated with two World Heritage Sites from Gujarat. Dholavira helps us study change over a millennium. For example, later era seals do not carry famous motifs such as bull or unicorn. Late Harappan period also shows some drastic changes from Mature Harappan in several aspects. Due to presence of major water reservoirs, we can assume that the inhabitants faced water shortage in later times. The find of ‘sign board’ was momentous – the 3m wide board with white gypsum letters matched perfectly with the width of the gate. It must have been seen from a distance on the flat plains.

A survey by the institute’s students’ magazine, Insight, for the freshers’ newsletter reveals what first-year students are going through. Students claimed they would miss recording of live lectures, spending time with school friends, attending two sessions at one time, and also rolling out of bed right into the class, after they return to the campus. Some claimed that getting attendance easily was possible only because of the online classes. Around 238 first-year students responded to the survey. “It was interesting to find out what the first-years think about this whole scenario. This is the batch which joined the institute in the pandemic,” said one of the editors of the magazine. Tapanendu Kundu, dean, students’ affairs, said they understand what students are going through. “They have joined their dream institute, but have not seen the campus even once. We are trying to bring them back in a phased manner. Final-year students are already returning; for the rest, it will depend on the pandemic situation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai1-in-3-freshers-at-iit-b-is-unsure-of-people-skills/articleshow/84809704.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Book Punjab minister Arora in liquidation scam, says SAD||Chandigarh: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has demanded a criminal case against Punjab industries minister Sunder Sham Arora for allegedly causing a loss of Rs 400 crore to the state exchequer by presiding over the sale of 31 acre prime land of the liquidated JCT Electronics in Mohali to a private real estate developer. SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia said only a CBI inquiry or an inquiry monitored by the high court could uncover the alleged scandal. He added that besides the minister, senior officers who had committed criminal negligence should also be proceeded against immediately. He demanded that chief minister Amarinder Singh should take the first step in arriving at the truth in the case by sacking Arora immediately. Majithia said the Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation (PSIEC) did not stake claim to Rs 161 crore unearned profit that was to be paid to it upon the sale of property. He said PSIEC agreed to sell the lease land at a reduced cost of Rs 90.56 crore of which the corporation would get only 50%, amounting to Rs 45 crore. Stating that PSIEC did not adopt the correct procedure for liquidating JCT Electronics, the SAD leader said it was shocking that a private lawyer was engaged by the corporation to get a tailor-made recommendation to the industry minister’s cronies. He said the PSIEC went ahead and even recommended that the government accept the recommendations of the lawyer even when its parent department – Punjab Infotech - objected to the sale. Majithia said the PSIEC did not follow procedures in its hurry to offload the property and did not even take approval from the finance department. He said the scale of corruption could be measured from the fact that against a market price of Rs 30,000 per square yard, PSIEC recommended offloading of the JCT Electronics lease at the rate of Rs 5,000 per square yard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/book-punjab-minister-arora-in-liquidation-scam-says-sad/articleshow/84807666.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 88% of Covid patients and 95% fatalities in state-run hospitals weren’t vaccinated||MUMBAI: Almost 95% of Covid-19 deaths at state-run medical colleges in the past two months have been among the unvaccinated. In a strong demonstration of how effective vaccination is against Covid, the analysis also found that 87.5% of those hospitalised were not vaccinated. A study by the medical education department showed that there have been 15,202 hospitalisations across government medical colleges between May 11 and July 12 of which as many as 13,298 (87.5%) had not received a single dose. It also means that vaccinated people accounted for merely 13% of hospitalisations. The impact of vaccines on mortality numbers appeared starker. Of 4,942 deaths among those admitted, 4,681 had not got a shot. Of the 261 who died despite vaccination, 88% had taken a single shot and only 12% were fully vaccinated. The case fatality rate among the unvaccinated was as high as 35.2% compared to 13.7% in the vaccinated cohort. “The trend that emerges from the data echoes what healthcare authorities have been saying about the importance of vaccination,” said Saurabh Vijay, secretary, medical education. Echoing him, Dr Dilip Mhaisekar, director of medical education and research (DMER), said that people should no longer have inhibitions about the role of vaccination in preventing deaths. “It is important to get vaccinated. Ignorance can be the reason why some sections are still hesitating to get the shots,” he said. A further analysis of deaths among the vaccinated showed that 63% had comorbidities, while 68% were above the age of 68 years. The deaths occurred after an average of 33 days after receiving the last dose. Nearly 140 of these patients were brought dead, leaving no scope for any clinical intervention. Dr Rakesh Waghmare from the medical education department, who led the study, said that they had started tracking the vaccination status of hospitalised people from May since inoculation of common people had gathered steam only from March. About 12% of all vaccine-eligible people in the state—18 years and above—are fully vaccinated, and 25% have got one dose. A senior doctor from Sion Hospital said that deaths among elderly and even those with comorbidities have declined in the city since vaccination started. “At this stage, one can say that many Covid deaths are preventable with vaccination. It is, therefore, unfortunate that we are unable to vaccinate at a swifter pace,” the doctor added. Dr Abhijit More, convenor of Jan Arogya Abhiyan, said that it is imperative to protect those with comorbidities knowing the risk of death is higher. “People are somehow managing to get the second dose. The real challenge is to get the first dose now,” Dr More said. Going a step further, Soumitra Ghosh from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences’ School of Health Systems Studies said that vaccination unavailability amounts to violation of one’s right to life. “Now that we know vaccines can prevent premature deaths and serious hospitalisations, unavailability is a critical deprivation. A lot of Indians are struggling to get vaccines, including in the big cities,” he said. In Mumbai, the civic body has reached out for CSR help to meet the rising demand for the second dose of Covid vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/88-of-covid-patients-and-95-fatalities-in-state-run-hosps-werent-vaccinated/articleshow/84809684.cms||Sumitra Debroy

According to a statement from Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre (MMHRC), though the patient had already undergone angioplasty a month ago, it was found that his left anterior descending artery had two blocks. The medical team headed by Dr R Sivakumar, senior consultant – interventional cardiology, used high-definition intravascular ultrasound catheter (IVUC) and instant flow reserve (IFR) to more accurately analyze the form of plaquesand to map the area that required stent support. Dr Sivakumar said that an optimal balloon angioplasty and stent placement could be achieved.  “While usually most hospitals use IVUC of low frequency (usually 20 MHz or below), we introduced a 45 Mhz solution, which increases the visibility of the plaques that block arteries,” he said. The patient has since recovered and is able to carry out regular activities without struggle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/advanced-tech-used-for-2nd-angioplasty/articleshow/84805275.cms||---

The deceased was identified as R Muthusamy, 62, of Arivozhi Nagar at Madukkarai. The firm where he works is situated about 500 meters from the reserve forest of Boluvampatti block in Madukkarai range. Forest department officials said the area was frequented by elephants. As there were no facilities for Muthusamy to relieve himself, he came out of the premises around 6am. Suddenly, he was attacked by an elephant and he died on the spot, a forest officer said. Residents of the area alerted forest department officials, who reached the spot and sent the body to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital. Following the postmortem, the dead body was handed over to the family of the deceased. The forest department officials also handed over Rs 50,000 to the family members as the immediate relief and Rs 3.5 lakh, the rest of the relief amount, will be given to the family members soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/security-guard-dies-in-elephant-attack/articleshow/84805263.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Opposition, Kerala government spar in House over lockdown guidelines||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government on Tuesday rejected the opposition’s call for direct cash transfers to people whose livelihood has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. It also dismissed the opposition’s claim that the state’s lockdown policy did not make sense and hence required a thorough review. The government made its stand clear while replying to the opposition’s notice seeking leave of the house to discuss the impact of the economic crisis brought about by the pandemic and lockdown restrictions. “The economic crisis brought about by the pandemic is unprecedented. Joint efforts are required to address the situation. There is a 3.8% dip in GSDP. Tax and non-tax revenue have registered a steep decline. The state government is trying its best to address the crisis,” said finance minister K N Balagopal. However, the positive signals in GST collection in the last three months did indicate a revival of the economy provided the third wave did not leave much damages, he said. He said the government was doing its best to offset the impact of Covid in the lives of economically weaker sections. “We have introduced two stimulus packages and continues to supply free grocery kits to 85 lakh rationcard holders in the state. Over 55 lakh people in Kerala are given social security pension worth Rs 1,600 a month. Those who do not receive such pensions are also given Rs1,000. No other governments in the country spends so much money to address the Covid-induced financial crisis,” Balagopal said. Deputy leader of the opposition, P K Kunhalikutty, who served the adjournment notice, said the government has not been able to put in place follow a prudent Covid management practice. “Kerala has the highest case load in the country. The government should follow the trace, test, and treat strategy. Continuous lockdown is not a solution. Only common sense is required to understand its impracticality. It’s time the government reviewed the lockdown policy and made corrections. The objective should be to minimise the chances for crowding. Lockdown is not an option when people are slipping to poverty,” he said. Grocery kits alone were not enough. The government should make direct cash payments to the needy to revive the local economy, he said. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the opposition’s approach towards the government’s Covid management was highly unfortunate. “The opposition seems to have developed a deep intolerance towards distribution of kits…When talking about TPR rate, one should keep in mind the density of population in Kerala. The Covid policy is formulated after seeking proper guidance from experts. No experts have pointed out any drawback in our Covid management,” he said. Opposition leader V D Satheesan demanded the government to appoint a Covid crisis mitigation commission to study the impact of Covid in several sectors and chart out rejuvenation programmes. Since the speaker denied permission to discuss the notice by suspending all other business of the house, the opposition staged a walkout from the house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/oppn-govt-spar-in-house-over-lockdown-guidelines/articleshow/84818576.cms||---

Arun Sundaria, 34, who runs an import-export business and is also into manufacturing and trading of papers in Kathwada GIDC, said that the accused Maria Walter called him on March 5. She said that her company would buy a herbal oil from him for $4,000 if he invested in the business. She told Sundaria that she worked for a pharmaceutical firm in the UK and her company had earlier imported the herbal oil which is used as pain reliever for patients of arthritis.  She said the previous importer had snapped ties with her firm. So, she wanted Sundaria to invest and coordinated with a man from Delhi named Rakesh Kumar. Sundaria said that he had told Kumar to provide only 20ml oil first which he sent to Walter’s firm for which Sundaria was given $400. Convinced with the deal, he began further business dealings with Walter’s firm, said the FIR. On instructions of Walter, Sundaria contacted Kumar whom he gave bulk orders and paid Rs 52.70 lakh on different dates in March to get the oil which he could sell to Walter’s firm. But he later did not get any money from Walter’s firm and she along with Kumar went incommunicado. On inquiring into the case, Sundaria came to know that he has been duped by the duo. He approached cybercrime police and filed a case of cheating and breach of trust.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/trader-duped-by-london-woman/articleshow/84805272.cms||---

Despite strict checking at railway stations and heavy police presence, kanwarias continue to troop in. On Tuesday, 400 kanwarias were sent home from Haridwar railway station, a day after 240 had been ferried out of the state. At least 100 vehicles that had an unknown number of kanwarias were also turned away at Narsan and Chidiyapur borders by Haridwar police. On Tuesday, 10 Gangajal tankers were stationed at various border areas. Haridwar SSP Senthil Avoodai Krishna Raj S told TOI that 30 tankers have been kept ready to transport Gangajal on demand to neighbouring states. “While 10 tankers are currently deployed in border areas, one each has been sent to Bijnor and Muzaffarnagar in UP. We will also send some tankers to Haryana.” TOI had earlier reported that kanwarias were arriving in plain clothes in the district, making it harder for police to spot them. Now all passengers exiting the Haridwar railway station are being asked for RT-PCR reports and other information. Some are being subjected to rapid antigen testing. “We are checking details of all passengers to ensure no kanwarias can enter Haridwar,” said station house officer Anuj Singh (Government Railway Police). Twenty-eight buses at eight railway stations are carrying kanwarias out of state borders while others are being sent back on trains. The railways are also distributing pamphlets and making announcements at stations about cancellation of Kanwar yatra. On Sunday, 14 kanwarias from Haryana who reached Haridwar were detained and booked under Disaster Management Act. They were quarantined at a local ashram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/10-gangajal-tankers-at-ukhand-borders-for-kanwarias-as-more-try-to-sneak-in-despite-ban/articleshow/84800059.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Pune||Maharashtra government mulls walls near rivers to prevent flooding||PUNE: The state government will explore the option of building retaining walls near rivers to protect residents living along the banks from floods. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, while chairing a meeting on flood relief measures, told the irrigation department to draft a proposal in this regard. The residents of Vadgaon, Satara Road, Pune-Mumbai highway, and central parts of Pune face flooding after heavy rainfall and have asked for retaining walls to be built. Those affected by the September 2019 floods have also pushed for better river and nullah cleaning work. Residents said floodwater enters the parking lots after heavy rainfall, damaging vehicles. Houses on the ground floor in societies face more problems, residents said, wondering why the issue of flood lines was never considered at the time of issuing building permissions. Pravin Nangude, a resident of Gururaj society on Satara Road, which was ravaged when Ambil Odha overflowed in 2019, said people feel they have no option but to leave their homes. “Those living on the ground floor are constant afraid that floodwater will enter their homes. The water level was so high during the 2019 floods that water entered even houses on the first floor,” he said, adding private housing societies like theirs can be protected by retaining walls. Shreyas Apte, a resident of Sinhagad Road, too was in favour of this proposal. “This will resolve the problem once and for all,” Apte said. Mahesh Sathe, a resident of Puja Park in Vadgaon, said that cleaning of the river was a cause for concern. “The fear of floods haunts us every time we get heavy rainfall. The government should find an alternative. A retaining wall will help to a large extent. Permanently shifting the residents of societies near the river is not a practical solution,” he said. Pune Municipal Corporation officials said areas like Rajput slums, Pulachi Wadi, Patil estates, Ambil Odha, Parvati, Dattawadi, parts of Sinhagad Road, Katraj, Karvenagar, Narayan Peth, Kasba Peth, and Bopodi witness frequent flooding due to their proximity to the river. PMC officials said a decision on building retaining walls will be taken after receiving orders from the government. “The PMC had built such walls in some areas, but demolished them after objections from activists,” a PMC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-mulls-walls-near-rivers-to-prevent-flooding/articleshow/84807685.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

Vaishali Zankar, the secondary education officer of the Nashik Zilla Parishad, said that on July 19, 208 such schools had started operations. That number has now risen to 254, though about 332 schools had expressed willingness to start classroom lessons. “The number of schools reopening physically has increased. More and more schools are getting good response from the students and their parents,” said Zankar. The officer said there are at least 282 villages with schools for Classes VIII to XII and which haven’t reported a single Covid active case in at least the past 30 days. The data from Dindori taluka and Kalwan taluka is yet to be updated, the officer said. At present, Igatpuri has the highest number of operational schools (39), followed by Malegaon (36). In Baglan, 25 schools have started physical assembly, while in Sinnar taluka, 24 schools have started operations. The total number of students expected in these schools is 51,298. Of them, 30,545 (59%) are attending the classes. “When the schools began on July 19, we had 208 schools and 8,331 students in attendance.

---||Mumbai||Maha rain loss pegged at Rs 4k cr, toll up to 209||Mumbai: Even as the Centre on Tuesday sanctioned over Rs700 crore as compensation against the Rs3,700 crore sought by the state towards the rainfall-related losses in Maharastra last year, the preliminary estimate of this year’s losses has been pegged at Rs4,000 crore till now, with damages to government infrastructure making up for a large chunk. As the toll rose to 209, the state cabinet is likely to announce a special compensation package for Konkan and Western Maharashtra regions that were worst hit. The compensation will be on the lines of that announced during the Nisarg and Tauktae cyclones. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray met deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and other ministers to discuss the compensation package. A final proposal will be tabled in the state cabinet on Wednesday. The state is considering giving some relief to affected traders and shopkeepers.The death toll in rain-related mishaps across the state climbed to 209 on Tuesday. Ratnagiri recorded 14 deaths and two more fatalities were added to Thane’s toll, taking the total toll in Konkan region to 150. Rescue operations at Posare Khurd landslide site in Khed taluka of Ratnagiri were called off on Tuesday where eight more people continue to remain missing. The number of people evacuated from their homes has crossed 4.3 lakh. Governor B S Koshyari visited Taliye in Raigad, where the worst landslide took place. He also reviewed the situation in Chiplun. Urban development minister Eknath Shinde said Rs 2 crore will be provided as assistance for flood-ravaged Chiplun. “A five-member committee has been constituted for restoration and revival of Chiplun,” Shinde said. Officials said preliminary estimates of damage from the affected districts have started to trickle in and so far 3.3 lakh hectares of agricultural land has been affected. Government infrastructure like roads, bridges, school buildings, electricity infrastructure and even water supply schemes have been damaged. The estimate of damage to 96,000 hectares of agricultural land in the flood-hit districts of Sangli and Kolhapur has been pegged at over Rs 700 crore. Crops over 58,000 hectares from Kolhapur district and 38,000 hectares from Sangli district have been damaged as per visual assessment carried out by the authorities of both districts. Kolhapur and Sangli district collectors have prepared a preliminary report of the damage caused due to the floods to Panchganga and Krishna rivers. In Kolhapur district, losses are worth Rs 243.4 crore, while the figure is Rs 466.8 crore in Sangli district. Both district authorities have, however, categorically said the actual estimates are yet to be calculated and they may be far higher. The state government’s compensation proposal to the Centre for rain-related losses last year was over Rs 3,721 crore. The state had sanctioned Rs 4,375 crore for the affected districts. “The central norms for compensation were drafted in 2015. The state has been hiking the norms and giving compensation, so a large burden falls on the state,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maha-rain-loss-pegged-at-rs-4k-cr-toll-up-to-209/articleshow/84809716.cms||---

The proposal will be submitted this week for final approval from the chief minister, he said. Except for districts with high weekly positivity rates, the rest will be allowed to relax restrictions, which will allow businesses and movement for extended hours. Currently, almost all districts and regions are under level-3 restrictions. “The chief minister had directed the public health department to ready the proposal. We'll be submitting it this week and the final approval will come from the chief minister," Tope said. Full vaccination coverage will also be a key criteria for relaxed curbs across sectors, the minister said, adding that there are nearly 13 to 14 districts (from a total of 35) that have been recording a WPR of 0.1%-0.9%. These districts definitely need some relaxations for economic revival, Tope said. He said there are also districts that have been recording (for at least three weeks) a WPR of above 1%, but lower than the state average. These districts may be placed in a separate category. Districts with higher WPRs may also be considered for separate categories of relaxations, he said. Tope said, “We have submitted the broad outline and based on local conditions, districts can take a call after assessing their WPR. This [proposal] has been readied with the help of the state task force. However, all care will be taken to ensure that even as relaxations are given, there are no violations of Covid protocols." On Monday, Maharashtra became the first state in the country to fully vaccinate over one crore people against Covid-19. Tope said the proposal to ease restrictions also includes this factor. Several sectors of the industry had put up proposals for relaxed curbs, with some suggesting the return of staff into bio-bubbles. Experts too had said that with the right mix of rules, restrictions and vaccination rules, some sectors should be allowed to reopen. State task force members said that while the public health department is working on preparedness, vaccination coverage should be made a major component ahead of de-escalation of restrictions. Good coverage can help district administrations make decisions that can boost economic activity, task force members had said. Head of state task force Dr Sanjay Oak has also reiterated that de-escalation should be a graded, gradual and closely monitored exercise. Dr Oak said two critical components of bio-bubbles are full vaccination and 100% adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour and masking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/plan-ready-to-ease-curbs-in-districts-with-low-cases-tope/articleshow/84807698.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation resumed bus service on Tuesday after the roads were deemed fit to travel. “Railway officials have been helpful and provided food and shelter,” Manish Giri, (30) one of the stranded passengers, said. As per an official at Miraj station, around 76 passengers left for Kolhapur on board two MSRTC buses. The railways will foot the bus bill, as the passengers had already paid for a train ticket to Kolhapur.Rail officials said if buses start to Ratnagiri and other Konkan districts, the necessary arrangements will be made. “We have four waiting halls and passengers have been staying there since July 22 and 23.

---||Mumbai||‘Mumbai airport may be last to see recovery in flyer traffic’||MUMBAI: Among the major airports in India, Mumbai airport is likely to be the last to recover to pre-Covid passenger traffic, according to aviation consultancy firm Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA).  The unprecedented slump in traffic as a result of the pandemic set the clock back by 13 years as the total traffic at Indian airports fell by 66% in 2020-21 to 115 million passengers, a level last seen in 2007-08. Among public-private partnership airports, Hyderabad is expected to recover closest to pre-Covid traffic at -31.3%, while Mumbai will be the furthest behind at -52.3%, said CAPA Advisory India Airport Outlook FY2022. Its model showed Mumbai’s recovery underperforming other metro airports. This was based on the actual traffic performance in first quarter of 2021-22. However, it may be possible for the airport to accelerate during the year and achieve higher volumes, CAPA added. According to Airports Authority of India data, in the April-June period, Delhi airport handled five million passengers, while Mumbai and Bengaluru handled about roughly two million each. In the past one year, the frequent changes to travel restrictions brought about by state governments hit passenger traffic at airports across India, but Mumbai airport took the worst hit—it may have lost 3.5-4.5 million passengers—registering the steepest decline (76%) among metro airports. In comparison, Delhi and Bengaluru airports saw a decline of 66% each. Total traffic could have been 7-10 million passengers higher, were it not for frequent changes to travel restrictions, said CAPA. Domestic traffic declined by 61.8% to 105 million passengers, while international traffic was decimated, declining by 84.8% to just 10.1 million passengers, the lowest level in almost 30 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-airport-may-be-last-to-see-recovery-in-flyer-traffic/articleshow/84807727.cms||---

Madurai has a section of people still commuting by bicycles. While some from the lower rung of the society travel by bicycle to save transport costs, a section of them do it for a healthy lifestyle. They feel that they are largely left out. While most of the city roads are narrow, some of the roads, which are wide, can be converted into bi-cycle friendly roads. Users said that it can be achieved by regulating haphazard parking, streamlining of shared auto rickshaws and removing sand from the roads. G Vasanthakumar, a bicycle enthusiast from Bangajam Colony, said that only a few roads in the city are too narrow, while others have become narrow due to encroachments. At many palaces, shopkeepers encroach on the pavements. As a result, pedestrians walk on the motorway creating hindrance to commuters. “If the encroachments of pavements are removed and haphazard parking issues are solved, there will be enough space for people to pedal. Motor vehicles should be banned in Masi Streets and other streets close to Meenakshi Amman Temple to encourage walkers and bicycle commuters,” he said. J Vijayalakshmi from Simmakkal said that share auto rickshaws should be banned in select stretches and bus transportation should be promoted. Pedestrian pathways should be kept free without any pits to encourage pedestrians. Once people start using pedestrian pathways, there will be adequate space for cyclists, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/call-to-make-city-bicycle-friendly/articleshow/84805308.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

AEPC chairman A Sakthivel, who met chief minister M K Stalin on Tuesday, submitted a memorandum, highlighting proposals to accelerate exports from the state by three folds from the present $30 billion in a period of five years. AEPC’s first suggestion was to create a separate export policy for the state. “In order to achieve further growth in exports, we need a separate export policy along with the formation of a new export promotion board, comprising government officials and representatives of export councils as board members,” the representation said. Sakthivel said Tamil Nadu’s garment exports were mostly limited to cotton fiber. This fulfils the need of overseas buyers only for three months, because they are mostly using synthetic garments, ethnic wear and performance wear, all made up of synthetic/ man-made fiber garments. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/state-needs-separate-export-policy-aepc/articleshow/84805313.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Only the sole vacant berth can be filled up. Only five months are left for elections, it is time for MLAs to go back to the electorate. However, there is no harm in appointing two deputy CMs, as is being promised by other parties,” said Jalalpur. Another Congress MLA Kulbir Singh Zira added that two deputy CMs can be appointed. It has been the culture of Congress to take every section along as has been done in naming the four working presents of the state unit, he said. Earlier, the option of appointing deputy CMs was being considered as part of the peace formula b y the Congress high command.

In other parts of the city, the speed limit is capped at 40kmph. To effectively implement the speed limit in the city, traffic police officials, regional transport officers, Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation officials and state highways department officials conducted a meeting with the representatives of Lorry Owners’ Association, Omni Bus Owners’ Association, Goods Transport Association, tourist van operators and call taxi and auto drivers at the police community hall here on Tuesday evening. Addressing the meeting, S R Senthilkumar, city deputy commissioner of police (traffic), said the revised speed limit for the vehicles in the city limits was published in the gazette as well. “If the motorists operate their vehicles in the fixed speed limits within the city, fatal accident rate will be reduced drastically. Traffic police are using speed radar guns to check the speed of the vehicles. Those violating the speed limit will be booked and fined.” The city police, however, have only two speed radar guns. “We are planning to procure more speed radar guns to book more cases of violation of speed limits,” he said. Senthilkumar said they were installing sign boards with the speed limits in the city limits. Pointing out that they had stopped checking for drunk driving since March 2020 because of the pandemic, the DCP said they had resumed the same on Tuesday. “Motorists will be made to blow breath analyser device to see if they are under the influence of alcohol. If yes, a traffic cop will take down the alcohol level and issue the challan for drunk driving.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/traffic-police-resume-drunk-driving-checks/articleshow/84805293.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: HC says Sec 467 not made out yet, bail granted to woman in fake PhD cert case||Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Tuesday granted bail to a 39-year-old woman, a resident of Kalina, in connection with a ‘fake PhD degree’ case. The woman was accused of allegedly practising at a hospital in Bandra (West) for at least two years ‘using a fake degree’ of a clinical psychologist before she was removed from the post. The HC directed her release on a bail bond of Rs 25,000 with two sureties. Advocate Abha Singh appearing for the women, Swapna Patker, who also described herself as a film producer, argued that it was a “revenge arrest” by the police as the woman had filed a case in which she alleged being stalked by certain persons “allegedly at the behest of a Maharashtra minister”. She said the arrest was in the aftermath of the woman filing three petitions in the HC against the minister. Singh had argued before a bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar for bail after a magistrate rejected it. Later even the sessions court rejected her plea. Singh said the woman, a single mother, has been behind bars “illegally in a motivated and mala fide case” for almost over two months in Byculla women’s prison. She filed for quashing of the case and, as interim relief, sought bail. Public prosecutor Aruna Pai opposed any relief being given as sought. Singh said “aggravated non-bailable IPC charges under section 467 for forging a valuable security was invoked by the Bandra police”. By no stretch of imagination can a PhD degree be considered a ‘valuable security’, argued Singh. The woman was arrested on June 8, 2021, “all of a sudden”, said her advocates Abha Singh and Isha Singh. Pai, the HC noted, “urged with degree of vehemence that the investigating agency has adequate material to demonstrate, at this stage, that PhD degree certificate is a forged document”. The HC, in its 13-page order, said, “The petitioner is a woman. In the exigency of the situation on account of Covid-19, the aspect of continued detention of the petitioner also merits consideration. The petitioner claimed that a minor son and an old mother are dependent on her. Since we are of the view that the offence punishable under Section 467, which entails imprisonment for life, is not prima facie made out, in the peculiar facts of the case, ...persuade us to grant the relief of bail pending the hearing of her quashing plea. The HC said since investigation is at the nascent stage, court would not be justified in delving into issue of quashing the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-says-sec-467-not-made-out-yet-bail-granted-to-woman-in-fake-phd-cert-case/articleshow/84809811.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Activist in wheelchair gets city disabled-friendly road||MUMBAI: Part of a key Vile Parle road has been transformed after an activist with cerebral palsy doggedly pursued BMC to make it universally accessible. A 400-metre stretch of Nehru Road now has a wider footpath with tactile indicators for the visually challenged and kerb ramps for wheelchair users. Encouraged by the transformation, Jasmina Khanna is now pushing for accessibility for other streets and public amenities in the city. “Guidelines for accessibility were laid down by the central government a few years ago but implementation was lacking,” said Khanna, a software tester, who during her trips overseas had noticed how infrastructure was planned keeping the differently abled in mind. In 2018, she and her physiotherapist, Sanket Khadilkar, carried out a survey of public amenities in Vile Parle (East). The duo then went to the BMC with their findings and hired an architecture firm to create designs of the interventions needed. The BMC finally began work on Nehru Road earlier this year, but it was no cakewalk. “We had to remove obstructions so that the footpaths could be widened to at least two metres for a wheelchair to pass,” said assistant engineer Sambhaji Dorugade of the BMC’s K-East ward. Encroached spaces had to be taken back from shopkeepers who were not too happy about it. The municipal team replaced paver blocks with concrete. Tactile indicators were laid on the footpath and warning signs were provided around trees, streetlights and electric boxes for guiding the visually challenged. “One of our suggestions was to give the kerb ramps a rough surface so that wheelchairs don’t skid,” said architect Parul Kumtha, who is working alongside Khanna and Khadilkar for the initiative and has prior experience in creating inclusive spaces. Then, just before lockdown-like restrictions were applied, the group met the additional municipal commissioner (projects) to explain about their work. He swiftly responded with an instruction to all ward officers that new footpaths were to be made accessible and pedestrian-friendly. The big challenge now is to keep hawkers off the transformed stretch on Nehru Road as some of them have already started to creep back. After the monsoon, the civic body intends to complete accessibility work on the remaining stretch. Khanna has her sights trained on the neighbouring Juhu and Andheri areas and has already initiated meetings with the civic staff there. “Our architects have done an audit of Juhu-Versova Link Road and we are pushing with the BMC for accessibility,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/activist-in-wheelchair-gets-city-disabled-friendly-road/articleshow/84809771.cms||Nitasha Natu

The association has sent a memorandum to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal, seeking extension in timing for hotels, bars and restaurants. ABHAR Nashik president Sanjay Chavan said the business has been badly hit and they have incurred heavy losses due to the Covid pandemic since last year. “Hence, there is need to give further relaxation in restrictions for the survival of this industry,” he said. “Around 90% of our business comes at night. Hence, there is no use if we are allowed to open till 4 pm. The government needs to allow hotels, bars and restaurants to open at night. It will help revive our business if we are allowed to do business till 10pm,” he added. Chavan said it has become difficult to survive as they have to pay salaries to the staff along with other taxes and bills. “The new cases of Covid-19 have reduced significantly and even buses and railways have been started, but timings for the hotels and restaurants have not been changed. Hence, the government needs to take a call on allowing hotels and restaurants to function at night too,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/extension-in-timing-for-bars-restaurants-and-hotels-sought/articleshow/84807701.cms||Tushar Pawar

Rajvi said that as the lane to his brother’s place is very narrow and a few members of the Thakor community had blocked the way by parking their motorcycles, he requested them to remove their vehicles. He alleged that these members of the Thakor community did not like it and began abusing Rajvi. One of them brought a sword and attacked Rajvi with it and later others assaulted him with sticks. He said that they were constantly abusing him with caste-based slurs and threatening him. The accused allegedly threatened Rajvi saying his family is the only scheduled caste family in the village where other communities are in a dominant position. As he suffered severe injuries, he was admitted to Gandhinagar Civil hospital, where a medico-legal case was filed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/advocate-files-fir-for-assault-atrocity/articleshow/84805310.cms||---

A day after reporting record low cases, the state added 6,258 cases and 254 deaths, the highest in 38 days since June 19 (257). With this, the total cases rose to 62.7 lakh and fatalities touched 1,31,859. While the daily death count in Mumbai has been hovering around 10 for over a month now, cases have been hovering between 300 and 500 on most days. The city added 344 cases, taking the total caseload to 7.34 lakh and death toll to 15,850 crore. “The positivity rate is low, cases are low and there is no cause for concern right now in Mumbai,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. The BMC machinery is focused on reducing the impact of the third wave, which experts say could occur during the festival season in September-October. The BMC’s awaited genome sequencing equipment landed from Singapore at the Mumbai airport on Tuesday evening. “We expect the customs clearance within the next 24 hours and the machine should reach Kasturba Hospital for installation either late on Wednesday or early on Thursday,” said Kakani. The Kasturba genome laboratory would help the BMC spot and track SARS-CoV-2 variants early. “We are in a state of readiness for any rise in cases, if at all. We will have no shortage of beds as our jumbo centres are prepared for this,” Kakani said. With the cases stabilising and even declining in many parts of the state, the government is expected to issue revised orders lifting certain restrictions in districts with low positivity rate and high vaccination average.

U Vijayaramu, an archaeological enthusiast, said he was called upon by local youths at Santhankudi village to check the statue. ``They told me that it was overturned and buried but nobody thought of finding out what it was as it was big and heavy,’’ he said. However, some of them dug it out on Sunday as the tank had become dry and found the twin statues. Vijayaramu said twin statues could be those of Chera chieftains Ponnar Shankar (990 AD to 1020 AD) or of the Marudhu Pandiyar chieftains of Sivaganga (born in 1783 to 1801). Both would have swords in their hands and would be seen wearing turbans. ``But Ponnar Shankar have been idolised and worshipped in temples till date and their statues are usually very elaborately decorated with chain and jewellery to show them like deities. Statues of Marudhu Pandiar have swords but are usually seen with a shawl and swords and a single strand of beads on their neck,’’ he said. This statue is one metre in height, 50 cm in width and 25 cm in thickness. Vijayaramu said it was common to see the statues of Marudhu Pandiar in front of temples and this statue too has both the figures clasping their hands together as if in worship. There are also similar statues of Nayak rulers in temples, but those statues have a hair bun or ‘kondai’ on one side of the head. In this, it is just turbans. As the statue has the figures in worshipping position it may have fallen down while being transported to be installed in some temple and then left there, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/statue-of-twins-found-in-tank-may-be-of-marudhu-brothers/articleshow/84805373.cms||---

A day after reporting record low cases, the state added 6,258 cases and 254 deaths, the highest in 38 days since June 19 (257). With this, the total cases rose to 62.7 lakh and fatalities touched 1,31,859. While the daily death count in Mumbai has been hovering around 10 for over a month now, cases have been hovering between 300 and 500 on most days. The city added 344 cases, taking the total caseload to 7.34 lakh and death toll to 15,850 crore. “The positivity rate is low, cases are low and there is no cause for concern right now in Mumbai,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. The BMC machinery is focused on reducing the impact of the third wave, which experts say could occur during the festival season in September-October. The BMC’s awaited genome sequencing equipment landed from Singapore at the Mumbai airport on Tuesday evening. “We expect the customs clearance within the next 24 hours and the machine should reach Kasturba Hospital for installation either late on Wednesday or early on Thursday,” said Kakani. The Kasturba genome laboratory would help the BMC spot and track SARS-CoV-2 variants early. “We are in a state of readiness for any rise in cases, if at all. We will have no shortage of beds as our jumbo centres are prepared for this,” Kakani said. With the cases stabilising and even declining in many parts of the state, the government is expected to issue revised orders lifting certain restrictions in districts with low positivity rate and high vaccination average. The state is expected to extend shop timings, dine-in timings for restaurants and even allow local train travel for more people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-fatalities-shoot-up-to-254-in-state-drop-to-5-in-city/articleshow/84811723.cms||---

He faced the action after a police raid found a fully-operational gambling den in an area under his jurisdiction. The raid was carried out on the outskirts of Hingoli town on Sunday night. Eight suspects were arrested and several articles, including a car, three bikes, several mobile phones, playing cards, liquor and cash were seized. Nanded range IGP Nisar Tamboli said, “We have suspended assistant inspector Ravi Hundekar as the raid by our officer has found a gambling den that was rampantly operational.” The officer said that a warning has been issued to all the police station chiefs by the superintendents of police heading the Nanded, Latur, Hingoli and Osmanabad district units. It states that any illegal activity or business found operational, the respective police station chief will be not only be held responsible, but will also face action. Hingoli’s ASP Yatish Deshmukh, who conducted the raid at the gambling den, told TOI, “Most surprising part of this raid was that the gambling den was being run from a government-owned grazing land. The suspect had put up a make-shift shed with a tarpaulin and people from far off places were visiting it.” “Soon after the raid, a report was sent to Akhada Balapur police station head and he was found to have failed to justify his failure in duty, due to which an action was proposed,” said Yatish. When contacted, API Hundekar said, “The suspects were running a gambling den on the porous border of Nanded and Hingoli districts. The suspects would mislead us saying that it is a social club being run from the jurisdiction of Nanded.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hingoli-api-suspended-after-gambling-den-is-busted/articleshow/84807730.cms||Mohammed Akhef

This is not only to accompany or visit the loved ones, but for elective surgical procedures that involve several hours or days of hospitalization. Most of the major multi and single specialty hospitals say they have begun to perform elective surgeries almost 80% to 100% of their pre-Covid capacities. For the past one month, the Tamil Nadu Health Systems Project has been approving insurance claims for elective surgical procedures as well. This, along with the falling number of Covid-19 patients, easily available oxygen and drop in hospital infections, has better positioned the hospitals to perform elective surgeries. PSG Hospitals, the main Covid-19 treating private hospital, says the second wave could be divided into two phases. “In the first phase, we performed only emergency surgeries and deliveries, while cancelling all elective surgeries including the ones for hernia, cysts, gall bladders and hysterectomies, etc. In the second phase, due to acute oxygen shortage, we were referring emergency procedures for non-Covid patients to other hospitals,” says Dr J S Bhuvaneshwaran, the hospital director. In June third week, the hospital slowly began performing 10 surgeries a week and four weeks later the number was gradually increased to 35 surgeries a week, which is 90% of the pre-Covid times. “Our outpatient services have also touched 75% of the pre-Covid times,” he says. Many hospitals, in fact, have resumed major transplants and replacement surgeries in the past one month. Dr Kumaran, dean, Kovai Medical Center and Hospital, says, “We have restarted knee replacements, major ENT surgeries, crucial cardiac procedures like by-pass surgeries and angioplasties, and skin grafting, etc. We have started performing almost 75% of our earlier capacity of 80 procedures a day.” Dr C Palanivelu, chairman of Gem Hospital, says the fear among patients has come down. “We had asked people with simple piles, gall bladder issues and hernia to manage with medications during the peak of the wave.” Hospitals say elective surgeries contribute to anywhere between 50% and 100% of all the procedures performed and account for a sizable chunk of revenue. “While it’s a crucial portion of revenue, some elective procedures are also crucial for patients, especially when it comes to dealing with cancerous tumours and spreading infections,” says Dr S Rajasekharan, chairman, Ganga Hospital’s orthopaedic and spine department. “We had so many people come in after June-end with extreme pain and complications, and cancerous tumours on the spine.” Dr Palanivelu says they too had a lot of patients with severe ulcers and hernias. “They were relieved, as we were able to get the procedures done.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/elective-surgeries-major-transplants-back-on-track-in-major-hospitals-in-dist/articleshow/84805374.cms||---

The brutal act was also filmed and later made viral on social media by people present there. Moradabad police said that two people spotted in the video have been arrested and they are being interrogated. The incident took place in Rooppur village under Bhojpur police station limits of Moradabad, on Monday and the video went viral on social media on Tuesday. Police said that as the video came to the light, police teams were rushed to the spot. The youth is being treated in a hospital. Moradabad additional superintendent of police (rural areas) Vidya Sagar Mishra said, “The victim who was hung from a tree and beaten up is a resident of Mohabbatpur Ganj village of Tanda, Rampur, and was spotted by the family and relatives of the girl, who had gone missing from Rooppur village two weeks ago. Based on the viral video, an FIR has been registered under sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 322 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and section 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).” Thakurdwara circle officer Anoop Singh said, “Two people spotted in the viral video have been arrested and are being interrogated. A probe has been ordered in the case. The victim is admitted in Moradabad district hospital for treatment. He is out of danger.” Bhojpur SHO Rashid Khan told TOI, “An FIR was registered under various IPC sections, including 363 (punishment for kidnapping), 366 (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage, etc) following a complaint from the minor girl’s family against a local youth on July 17.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/youth-hung-upside-down-from-tree-beaten-up-over-girls-abduction/articleshow/84800193.cms||Maria Khan
---||Pune||Plan ready to ease curbs in districts with low cases, says Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope||PUNE: State health minister Rajesh Tope said on Tuesday that a new strategy for easing restrictions is being prepared for districts with lower than 1% weekly Covid positivity rate (WPR) or lesser than the state’s average (4.5% this week). The proposal will be submitted this week for final approvals from the chief minister, he said. Except for districts with high weekly positivity rates, the rest will be permitted to relax restrictions, allowing businesses and movement for extended hours. Currently, almost all districts and regions are under level-3 restrictions. In Pune, for example, malls and multiplexes remain shut. Restaurants, bars and food courts are not allowed to have customers over on weekends. “The chief minister had directed the public health department to ready the proposal. We’ll be submitting it this week and the final approval will come from the chief minister,” Tope said. Full vaccination coverage will also be a key criteria for relaxed curbs across sectors, the minister said, adding that there are nearly 13 to 14 districts (from a total of 35) that have been recording a WPR of 0.1%-0.9%. These districts definitely need some relaxations for economic revival, Tope said. He said there are also districts that have been recording (for at least three weeks) a WPR of above 1%, but lower than the state average. These districts may be placed in a separate category. Districts with higher WPRs may also be considered for separate categories of relaxations, he said. Tope said, “We have submitted the broad outline and based on local conditions, districts can take a call after assessing their WPR. This [proposal] has been readied with the help of the state task force. However, all care will be taken to ensure that even as relaxations are given, there are no violations of Covid protocols.” On Monday, Maharashtra became the first state in the country to fully vaccinate over one crore people against Covid-19. As on Monday, the state had given two doses to a whopping 1,00,99,524 people while 2.15 crore had received their first jab. Tope said the proposal to ease restrictions also includes this factor. Several sectors of the industry had put up proposals for relaxed curbs, with some suggesting the return of staff to bio-bubbles. Experts too had said that some key sectors — like manufacturing and hospitality — should be allowed to reopen with the right mix of rules, restrictions and vaccination coverage. State task force members said that while the public health department is working on preparedness, vaccination coverage should be made a major component ahead of de-escalation of restrictions. Good vaccine coverage can help district administrations make decisions that can boost economic activity, task force members had said. Head of state task force Dr Sanjay Oak has also reiterated that de-escalation should be a graded, gradual and closely monitored exercise. Dr Oak said two key components of bio-bubbles are full vaccination and 100% adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour and masking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/plan-ready-to-ease-curbs-in-districts-with-low-cases-tope/articleshow/84807746.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Madurai||Madurai to have Intelligent Traffic Management System||MADURAI: Madurai city is all set to get an Intelligent Traffic Management System, which will enhance the pace of vehicles movement on the city roads by avoiding congestion and also improving the safety of the commuters. Two private companies, Tata Consultancy Services and Urban Transit Company Ltd, have been roped in for the preparation of a report for this project. A detailed project report would be prepared for its implementation and assess its cost. The project will be implemented through Tamil Nadu Urban Infrastructure Financial Services limited and the state government, officials said. Madurai Corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan told TOI that the companies have already commenced their work starting with meetings with stakeholders such as city traffic police, road users’ association, lorry and private bus operators’ association, government transport officials and representatives from Madurai airport and railway terminal. A complete report is expected to be ready by December. The project would be implemented soon after by obtaining funds from the World Bank, the commissioner said. Explaining the features of the project he said that it would help monitor traffic movement centrally and to act swiftly to regulate congestions. While the location of the signals and pedestrian crossing would be determined in the study, one of the key objectives is to bring down the number of signals and ensure free flow of vehicular movement. “People can commute between places in a short time with enhanced safety on the road. Black spots (places prone to accidents) will be identified and the issues found there would be rectified. Pedestrian movement will be smoother,” he said. Another official said that if a route is congested the details will be gathered real time and alternative routes will be opened to divert the traffic. This will reduce the delays in the public transport movement making buses a more reliable option. “The Vaigai River Roads, which are undergoing expansion, will be available for transport in a few months. The roads will be effectively used for easing city traffic,” he said. Suitable junctions will be identified to bring them under CCTV coverage to help the city police crack whip against traffic rule violators with evidence, ensuring greater accountability of drivers. The commissioner said that the system will primarily focus on the core city and some of the key peripheral areas such as the Ring Road will be covered. The system can be updated periodically as the city develops in future, he said. Once the system is in place, converting green corridors for ambulances and fire engines can be done easily, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-to-have-intelligent-traffic-management-system/articleshow/84805406.cms||V Devanathan

The first unit test has been scheduled between August 2 and August 9. As per a circular issued by the district chief educational officer (CEO), instructions for holding unit tests every month to help students effectively prepare for board exams have been provided. Government school headmasters and teachers have been instructed to monitor the participation and response of students. The question papers will be provided from the CEO office to school headmasters. The unit test will be conducted online by sharing the question papers through WhatsApp groups created specifically for class X and XII students. Each unit test is set for 50 marks. Students will have to download the question paper and write the exam on paper. After completion, parents have to submit the answer scripts directly to the school in person. “Even last year, we were asking students to write exams at home for practice by sending them question papers, for which there was mixed response. The only difference is that these unit tests are expected to be more regular and parents have been asked to submit answer scripts in person instead of students sending scanned copies. Students may show more interest in studies if such tests are conducted,” said the headmaster of a government HSS. Even as teachers are hoping for schools to reopen soon, efforts are underway to engage students by connecting through phone calls or WhatsApp. For the first unit test, questions will be taken from the syllabus covered in June and July on Kalvi Tholaikatchi video lessons. Language and English exams have been scheduled on August 2 and August 3 respectively, whereas the main subjects have been scheduled between August 4 and August 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/unit-tests-every-month-for-classes-x-xii-students-of-govt-schools/articleshow/84805416.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune citizens and activists irked as yet another monsoon brings potholes||PUNE: The monsoon, which has been intense over the past couple of weeks, has brought with it an annual menace — potholes. The heavy rain that has been pounding the city has exposed the poor quality of roadwork in Pune — many roads are pockmarked; some roads have wide and deep potholes and others’ surfaces have washed away. City-based Sajag Nagrik Manch said it warned Pune Municipal Corporation on June 2 that potholes will develop as the repairs were not being done scientifically. “Even now the potholes are not being repaired as per guidelines and another spell of rain will create potholes at the same spots,” Vivek Velankar, founder of the citizens’ group, said. Velankar wrote to municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar on Tuesday in this regard. “The repairs were carried out during the monsoon and were hurried. Resurfacing was done in patches. Concrete mix was used for resurfacing tar roads. After just eight days of heavy rain, the roads have potholes,” he said. Velankar — part of a committee set up by PMC four years ago to draft guidelines for construction and repair of roads —said taxpayers’ money was being wasted. Civic officials said they have mobilized men and machinery to repair roads. “Road maintenance vans will repair potholes on main roads on priority, while major repairs will be done during a break in the monsoon,” V G Kulkarni, head of PMC’s road development department, said. Residents of Wagholi, recently merged in PMC limits, took to the streets to protest an alleged lack of response to complaints on damaged roads. Nitin Kumar Jain, director, Wagholi Housing Societies’ Association, said, “Repairs were last done in 2019, before the pandemic — a gram panchayat member filled the potholes with sand, which only made matters worse.” Vishal Gore, social worker from Kharadi, said, “The main road near Radisson Hotel resembles a pond. The local corporator has said there is no budget for repairs,” Gore said. Rupesh Dani, who travels regularly on Bajirao Road, said all the patchwork repairs in the past month have been undone. “It is a very busy road and repairs should have been done properly. Potholes slow down vehicles and cause snarls,”he said. Sarang Wable, a resident of Baner-Balewadi, said, “The bylanes are riddled with potholes, caused mainly by constant digging on the roadside.” The situation is no different in Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits. On June 24 in Chikhali, residents sat on a waterlogged road in protest; in Sangvi, residents said potholes and smart city work have made commuting an ordeal.

While Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University (SRTMU), another state university from the region, has given an option of offline examination to the students, Bamu has decided otherwise. Notably, a section of principals from colleges affiliated with the Bamu raised the demand for conducting examinations in an offline manner as well during the meeting of the academic council held on Tuesday. The university administration, however, remained firm on holding the examinations in an online mode only. Bamu public relations officer Sanjay Shinde said the decision to conduct examinations in online manner was taken in light of the directives from the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the State Higher and Technical Education Department. “The previous examinations held online saw smooth conduct but that was not the case with a few other state universities in Maharashtra. Considering the safety of students and other stakeholders, examinations will not be held in offline manner,” he said. Citing the pandemic situation, the state-level Association of College Principals has also thrown its weight behind the conduct of online examinations. “The conduct of offline examinations involves risk of Covid infection and therefore majority of the state and private universities have only been choosing virtual mode for the conduct of examinations. While online examinations have become a norm during the outbreak of Covid-19 such virtual conduct of examinations must be made foolproof and free from any possible malpractices,” association leader Nandkumar Nikam said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/all-examinations-will-be-held-online-says-bamu/articleshow/84807765.cms||Prasad Joshi

Currently, the transport body plies 1,000 buses across Pune city, Pimpri Chinchwad and rural areas every day. A transport body official said that they were waiting for the state government to announce relaxation in curbs. “There are talks about increasing the timings of shops and restaurants. Once it is done, we will increase the fleet by an additional 200 to250 buses. However, it is solely based on the decision of the administration. All buses will continue to ply at 50% capacity unless a decision to the contrary is taken,” the official added. The officials said that owing to the monsoon, all depot managers, drivers and conductors have been told to ensure that buses are properly checked before the start of the trip to rule out any breakdown. The official said that the conductors and drivers have been told to keep the front gates of the buses shut during the journey. “The back door is for entry and the front door is for exit. Often people tend to board the buses from the front, which is not permitted. Also, passengers are requested to wait for the bus to stop before disembarking and not take any unnecessary risks. Passengers should be patient and follow all the regulations,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmpml-plans-to-ply-200-additional-buses-post-relaxation-in-curbs/articleshow/84807783.cms||Joy Sengupta

The BMC has got a list of 4,488 names so far which are being assessed to understand their level of illness and disability. They are also being advised to get a medical certificate or opinion from a doctor stating their fitness to get vaccinated. State and civic authorities had agreed to the door-to-door drive after a PIL was filed in the Bombay high court three months ago. Civic officials said since August 1 is a Sunday, the drive will be started from the following day. Multiple teams of doctors, nurses, paramedic and attendants are being formed to carry out the drive. The biggest concern, which the authorities are working around, is to avoid wastage of doses. A vial contains 10 doses and once opened, it must be used within four hours. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said they have divided the 4,488 benef-iciaries between 216 health posts across wards. “We are still findi-ng the best way to immunise. We are trying to locate clusters, but most buildings appear to have one or two individuals,” he said. The 30-minute observation time is another challenge, he added. On Tuesday, vaccinations saw a significant uptick in the city with 96,107 people taking the shots. Over 73,000 doses were given in the public centres. Civic officials said they have adequate stocks to vaccinate till July 29. Across Maharashtra, nearly 5.7 lakh people got vaccinated on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-prepares-for-doorstep-vax-to-kick-off-from-august-2/articleshow/84807886.cms||Sumitra Debroy

This lockdown gave me a second chance in life -- to learn things that I never imagined perfecting in. Prior to that I had been working and enjoying it too, but then I had to take a necessary break. I spent time with my family. I understood the value of socialising with people and the need to meet our loved ones. My two main fears were driving a car and cooking perfectly. ‘Face the brutes’, Swami Vivekananda said. I used my time productively and gradually overcame my fears. This lockdown has taught me more than all the things I’ve ever learnt in my life. The importance of self-care, mental and physical health and family bonding.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a heavy-to-very heavy rain alert at isolated places in Raigad and Ratnagiri districts on July 30-31. Pune, Kolhapur and Satara districts have a similar warning for their ghat areas, where several landslides were recently reported. The Central Water Commission (CWC) on Tuesday said the Panchaganga, Warna, Krishna and Yerala rivers were already flowing within the danger and highest flood levels at five places in the state. State water resources minister Jayant Patil told TOI, “It can be a difficult situation if the quantum of rain is again like the recent spells. If the rain remains in the limit of 200-300 mm in a 24-hour period, we may be able to cope. But it will be difficult to manage anything beyond that, like 400mm or more in a 24-hour period.” Patil said, “We have told the IMD to get more details about the upcoming heavy rain on July 30-31. In the meantime, we are trying to reduce the dam levels in the state by gradually releasing water before the heavy rains.” One worry was the heavy rainfall in the free catchment areas (area ahead of the dam’s wall). “This time, the heavy rain was concentrated in free catchment areas. For example, the rainfall on July 23 was almost 719mm at Navaja near the Koyna dam. But the rainfall in around 50km of the dam was around 250-300 mm. Around 70% water that flowed into the rivers was due to the rain from the free catchment area. We had also curbed the releases from the dam to manage the situation,” Patil said. The rain in the free catchment areas and the gushing water from this region caused flooding in Ratnagiri’s Chiplun. Heavy downpour in the Sahyadri ranges and the Koyna region had flooded the shallow rivers of the coastal Konkan region, causing floods in Raigad and Ratnagiri districts during the recent spells. Patil said though the water was gradually being released from the state’s dams, it was not receding fast enough at some places. “We are waiting for the water levels to go down in the Sangli city area and Shirol taluka in Kolhapur. In addition, water release from Rajapur dam has gone up to 3.28 lakh cusecs. This is also the maximum release amount,” he said. State relief and rehabilitation secretary Aseem Kumar Gupta told TOI that a major worry was landslides and the authorities were planning for any emergency. “Floods can still be managed and people can be evacuated in time. But landslides are unpredictable and sudden. We, however, have enough forces to tackle any emergency,” he said. Anupam Kashyapi, head of the weather, IMD, Pune told TOI, “Fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with isolated heavy falls are very likely over Konkan and Goa and the ghat areas of Madhya Maharashtra during the next two days and may increase to isolated heavy to very heavy falls over the region from July 29. The rain will be a result of the low pressure area over the north Bay of Bengal. This is likely to become a well marked low pressure area over the north Bay of Bengal and adjoining Bangladesh and slowly move westwards across West Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar during the subsequent 48 hours.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/imd-issues-fresh-rain-alert-for-5-battered-dists/articleshow/84807839.cms||Neha Madaan

At least 100 aspirants who clear the prelims for Uttarakhand Public Service Commission will also get a financial assistance of Rs 50,000. Agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said the aid is meant to help aspirants prepare better. “We have slightly amended a previous policy that awarded aspirants Rs 50,000 after they cracked CDS, OTA and NDA exams. But these were aspirants who had already qualified the exams. This time, we will give the financial assistance soon after they crack the preliminary exams.” In another major decision, the state cabinet announced that the assembly session would be held in Dehradun from August 23 to 27. It has also authorised the Airports Authority of India to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) for Pant Nagar greenfield airport within six months. Land has already been identified for the expansion of Pant Nagar airport into a greenfield airport. The cabinet has also formed a four-member committee headed by a retired IAS officer to look into the pay discrepancy in government departments since there have been a number of protests on the issue. The cabinet also authorised the chief minister to take a call on the payment of three-month salary — amounting to Rs 57.2 crore — to the roadways employees. “The CM had recently approved Rs 34 crore as salary to roadways employees. Since the start of Covid-19 and lockdown, we have distributed salaries worth Rs 209 crore to the Uttarakhand Transport Corporation employees,” he added. For faster development of Kasauni, the cabinet has decided to make the hill station a nagar panchayat. The cabinet also approved a financial assistance of Rs 197 crore for the tourism department. With fresh infusion of funds, people employed in the tourism sector and registered with the department would be provided financial assistance of Rs 2,000 per month for six months. Under the Uttarakhand Tourism Travel Business Manuals, financial assistance of Rs 10,000 would be provided to 655 registered tour and adventure tour operators. River guides — 630 of them — will get Rs 10,000 while 93 boat operators registered under Tehri Lake will get Rs 10,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/govt-rolls-out-rs-50k-aid-for-those-clearing-prelims-for-upsc-other-competitive-exams/articleshow/84802870.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Coimbatore||Woman, lover, four minors held for bid to murder husband||Coimbatore: A 25-year-old woman, her lover and four minor boys were arrested on Monday for attempting to murder her husband at Nesavalar Colony near Ondipudur here on Sunday night. Police said Soundarya, wife of 29-year-old M Sethurajaram Singh, was having an illicit affair with her former colleague M Gunasekar, 23, of Neelikonampalayam. A daily wage labourer, Singh had married Soundarya six years ago and they have two children together. A police officer said Soundarya had befriended Gunasekar at the ESI Hospital, where she was working as a sanitary worker on contract basis. “While Gunasekar had left his job at the hospital, the two were having an extra-marital affair for the past two months. When her husband came to know about their relationship, he used to fight with her often.” Unable to bear his torture, Soundarya had on July 23 lodged a complaint with the all-woman police (East) against her husband. Police had subsequently pacified the couple. But as Singh continued to torture her, Soundarya hatched a conspiracy with Gunasekar to finish off her husband. “She brought her lover, his younger brother, a minor, and three of their minor friends to her house around 11.30pm on Sunday when her husband was asleep. Gunasekar and the minor boys stabbed Singh on his neck and face and left the house as he began to cry for help. Left with no other option, Soundarya took him to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital in the early hours of Monday,” the officer said. Soundarya told doctors that her husband, who was unconscious, was assaulted by unidentified people who broke into their house. “When Singh regained consciousness, he told the doctors that his wife, along with her lover and four others, had attempted to murder him,” the officer said. CMCH authorities immediately alerted the Singanalllur police, who arrested Soundarya, Gunasekar and the four minor boys on Monday itself for attempting to murder Singh. The minor boys were lodged in the observation home for juveniles at Lakshmi Mills Junction, while Soundarya was lodged in the special prison for women in Coimbatore. Gunasekar was lodged in Pollachi sub-jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/woman-lover-four-minors-held-for-bid-to-murder-husband/articleshow/84805445.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Allahabad||National Teacher Award-2021: No teacher from Prayagraj shortlisted||Prayagraj: At a time when the state government has begun the process of shortlisting the teachers of government primary and upper primary schools across the state for the prestigious National Teacher Award-2021, not a single teacher from Prayagraj has been able to make a place in the list. As many as 91 teachers have been shortlisted from across the state who will participate in the presentation and interview round for the prestigious National Teacher Award -2021. Director of basic education, UP, Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh, had sent this list of 91 teachers along with a letter to all basic shiksha adhikaris (BSAs) on July 25, and no name from Prayagraj figured in it. However, few teachers from the neighbouring districts of Kaushambi, Pratapgrah and Fatehpur are in the list of 91 teachers. Hariom Singh from Kaushambi, two teachers from Pratapgarh, including Mohf Farheem and Alok Kumar Singh, and another two from Fatehpur made it to the presentation and interview rounds. Prayagraj BSA, Praveen Tiwari, said that at the primary school level, applications of 60 teachers were received and forwarded to the state-level committee, but none could get shortlisted for the next phase of the selection process. “As per the missive, the shortlisted teachers of the state who had their names in the list from serial number 1 to 60 made their presentations and appeared in the interview by the designated panel members that took place virtually on Google Meet on July 26, while the rest did went through the same process on July 27,” he shared. “It is sad that no one among the 12,000 government primary school teachers of Prayagraj could make the cut for the presentation and interview rounds. The applications for the National Teacher Award-2021 were accepted till July 10. However, we are confident that next year, the teachers of Prayagraj will perform better,” said a senior official of basic education department. State Teacher Award-2019 winner and a teacher at a government upper primary school in Jogiya Shiekhpur village (Phulpur) of Prayagraj, Neelima Srivastava, said that the last two sessions had been challenging for all teachers due to the pandemic, and this could be a reason why any teacher from the district was not able to get selected for the presentation and interview rounds at the state level||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/national-teacher-award-2021-no-teacher-from-prayagraj-shortlisted/articleshow/84805501.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Pune||Pune: Health department focus on completion of second dose||PUNE: The health services department has asked the Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad, and Pune rural officials to focus on completion of the second dose of Covid-19 vaccination for beneficiaries. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said it has been suggested that 70% of the available doses of Covishield and Covaxin be allotted for the beneficiaries awaiting their second dose, and 30% to those requiring the first dose. “The state has already achieved vaccination of over 1 crore people with both the doses, and the focus is clearly on the completion of the second dose of the beneficiaries. We have been told by the state authorities that the supply of vaccine will be streamlined in August for the civic-run facilities as well as private hospitals,” he said. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) immunisation officer, Suryakant Devkar, told TOI, “We will follow the instructions from Wednesday onwards. We will reserve 60% doses for the second dose beneficiaries, while 40% will be for first dose recipients.” Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) commissioner, Rajesh Patil, said that they will follow the suggestion after they receive the next vaccine lot. “We are aware of the rising number of second dose beneficiaries and we will make sure that more doses are reserved for them,” he said, adding that the inconsistent vaccine supply has posed a major challenge in conducting regular as well as special vaccination drives. The Pune district has registered inoculation of 14.63 lakh people with both the doses, as against 45 lakh who have been given the first dose till July 26. Meanwhile, as per the CoWIN data on Tuesday evening, the district registered vaccination of 56,265 beneficiaries.

The overwhelming majority of private schools, particularly those affiliated to CBSE and ICSE are still closed. While the private schools are mounting pressure on the administration to allow regular classes of students of class 11th and 12th or at least three days a week for each student, the district administration is asking them to wait for sometime before a decision on enhancing the school days could be taken. “As of now, a student of class 12 and 11th is coming to school for a day in a week as only 50% attendance of students is allowed and classes are taking place 2 days a week for each class. We are saying that each student of the two classes should at least come to school 3 days a week and the ceiling of 50% could be lifted because there is no dearth of space with the schools and students of only class 11th and 12th are coming to school”, said Babu Thomas, secretary of CBSE Private Schools’ Association. District collector Avinash Lavania, when asked why the private schools are still shut, said, “We have allowed them to open schools, if they are not opening them, it’s their decision. He, however, added that they are demanding regular classes and we in the administration ae asking them that Covid cases are going down and if the situation remains the same, regular classes can be allowed in course of time.” Lavania, who also had a meeting with representatives of the private schools on Tuesday, said that in the next two days, private schools are likely to start classes of 11th and 12th. Both the district administration and private school managements are looking forward to August 5 when classes of 9th and 10th will also start and the situation may change then. The other major issue discussed at the meeting of district collector with school representatives was waiving off of the school fee for students, who have lost the bread earning member of the family to infection. While private schools affiliated to MP Board of Secondary Education has agreed to the suggestion of the district administration, CBSE schools are also likely to ratify the proposal in the meeting of their association on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/pvt-schools-stay-shut-only-15-attendance-on-day-2/articleshow/84805532.cms||---

The high court was hearing petitions filed by Kishankumar Bhawnani and Vinay Tekwani, who were detained under the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities (PASA) Act. Surat police commissioner invoked PASA against them after they were booked in two prohibition cases. The case in question related to an FIR at Adajan police station, when the duo was caught with 12 bottles of IMFL. When the petition against PASA order came up for hearing, Justice Paresh Upadhyay questioned the preventive measure for the seizure of 12 bottles in Surat, where liquor is normally seized in huge quantities. “I am not remotely suggesting that PASA should not be invoked in bootlegging cases,” the judge said and then told the prosecutor further, “We can catch small fish only, but there is no scope for you to touch the big fish.” While quashing PASA orders for Bhawnani and Tekwani, the court said that in invoking PASA on the basis of two FIRs, the detaining “fell in error in treating the activities of the petitioner as prejudicial to the maintenance of the public order.

From 846 farmers dying by suicide in 2017 to 900 taking their lives in 2018, the number fell to 491 in 2019, the Centre said in reply to a query on farm sector in Lok Sabha on Tuesday. While Madhya Pradesh recorded the second highest decline of farmer suicides in the country, agriculture activists and farm experts said Telangana’s Rythu Bandhu scheme had a major role in the declining number of farmers resorting to suicided in the state. GV Ramanjaneyulu of Centre for Sustainable Agriculture agreed that Rythu Bandhu had helped the farmers to some extent. “Also, many farmers shifted to crops having the minimum support price, primarily cotton and paddy. To comprehend the stress in the agriculture sector, it is necessary to consider suicides of not just farmers, but also of farm labourers and others closely involved with cultivation,” he said. Telangana began implementing Rythu Bandhu from October 2018. The first-ever direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme for farmers in the country was soon followed by other states like West Bengal and Odisha. For that matter, in these three years, no farmer suicides were reported in West Bengal, Odisha, Punjab, Bihar, Haryana, Uttarakhand and north-eastern states. Only a few farmers received the benefit because all were not covered by institutional credit. Telangana also has a state-level farm debt waiver scheme, but the scheme was implemented for farmers who owed up to Rs 25,000 to banks in this season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ts-farmer-suicide-rate-dipscentre-says-lowest-in-country/articleshow/84807937.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Taking cognisance of the protest, Beed collector Ravindra Jagtap has asked the tehsildar to address the issue on priority. The community members threatened to go on an indefinite strike against the alleged discrimination. A large number of children also participated in the agitation. The trigger came from about 40 Bhil families who reside on the state-owned grazing land outside Mandavjali village, about 15 km from Beed town. Vilas Pawar, 50, who joined the protest said that their pleas and complaints have been falling on deaf ears for years. He said that the “undeclared social boycott” added to their difficulties. The tribals are already struggling due to loss of work from Covid-19 related restrictions. The Bhil community members said that they were not even being allowed to draw water from any of the wells in the village, forcing women and children from the community to walk two km to fetch drinking water. In addition, they have to travel to Beed town to purchase grocery and even to grind the wheat. Advocate Suryakant Pawar said, “These tribal families are being discriminated to an unbelievable extent. On two occasions, ministers have visited the village and promised to ensure regular drinking water supply and social justice to the tribals, but in vain.” When contacted, village sarpanch Mirabai Bahirwad refuted the allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/bhil-community-members-allege-social-boycott-in-beed/articleshow/84807953.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The rape survivor, a married woman, accused one Sarfaraz Rangrez alias Mufti of impregnating her. When she approached the court first last week, her pregnancy was in its 14th week. She sought the court’s permission for abortion at a private facility saying she was not in a mental condition to deliver the child. She also said that she is disturbed and gets nightmares. The court said that when there is a proper facility available at Civil Hospital, there is no point getting the abortion done at her own expense, particularly, when this is a medico-legal case. The public prosecutor, Sudhir Brahmbhatt, submitted that looking at the peculiar circumstances of the case, the rape survivor may be granted permission to terminate her pregnancy and the court may pass appropriate orders.

---||Pune||Need regular supply of doses as 10k shop staffers yet to be vaccinated: Traders’ body||Pune: The traders’ federation in the city has said more than 10,000 staffers attached to their shops were yet to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and irregular supply of doses was not helping in the inoculation drive. The traders have joined hands with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and have set up a centre at a school to vaccinate traders and their employees. Manendra Pitaliya, secretary of the Federation of Trade Associations of Pune (FTAP), reiterated irregaular supply of vaccines. “On some days, the vaccination centre gets good supply. And there are days when the sessions are not held because of vaccine shortage. We are hoping for regular supply of doses to vaccinate remaining staffers at the earliest,” Pitaliya said. Shopkeepers said they were already facing huge losses because of restricted business timings and banking on the government as they were not in a position to spend money on vaccinating all their staffers. Sanjay Baheti, who has eight people working at his cloth shop, said he couldn’t spend money to vaccinate allof them. “We are already facing losses for the last one-and-a-half years. There is no substantial support from the government yet. Spending on vaccinations for staffers at private centres will be a huge expense,” he said. Ajay Rahane, another shopkeeper, said it was not possible for every shopowner to pay for the staffers’ vaccination. “The authorities should hold the camps in city’s every area to vaccinate at least those who are working in the markets.” The FTAP had received registration of about 33,000 traders and staffers for vaccination. Pitaliya said vaccination of senior citizens was done in the initial phase. “The PMC and social organizations are helping in the ongoing drive. But the availability of doses has to be increased,” he added. Sachin Nivangune of Pune District Retailers’ Association said they had been holding camps in the city’s various parts to inoculate retailers. “We are taking help of local corporators and social organizations to speed up vaccination of retailers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/need-regular-supply-of-doses-as-10k-shop-staffers-yet-to-be-vaccinated-traders-body/articleshow/84807969.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat to trade 40 lions for Kevadia menagerie||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat will trade 40 lions from the Sakkarbaug zoo for various animals from zoos across the country. Since the exchange value of the royal beast is high, each lion will fetch several animals for Gujarat. All the animals coming to Gujarat under this programme will be housed at the Kevadia zoo. The state government has approved the exchange programme and has told the Sakkarbaug zoo authorities to identify mainly subadult lions for the swap. Chief wildlife warden Shyamal Tikadar said: “The transfer of lions has been approved by chief minister Vijay Rupani. The lions will be transferred from Sakkarbaug to get animals for the Kevadia zoo.” Officials in the Gujarat forest department said that since the exchange involved lions, the chief minister’s nod was mandatory. Now that the permission has been secured, the modalities can be worked out. The officials said that the Delhi zoo will get three lions from Gujarat for breeding under the animal exchange programme. “The Central Zoo Authority has approved the proposal to send one lion and two lionesses from the Sakkarbaug zoo to Delhi,” said a forest department official. “Sakkarbaug is also the breeding centre for the Asiatic lions.” Officials said that the Delhi zoo will give five brow-antlered deer and two hippopotamuses for the Kevadia zoo. The officials said that talks are on to acquire gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) from a southern state or from Rajasthan. The officials said that the zoos of Chennai, Hyderabad, Assam, and Bhopal are in talks with Gujarat to barter their animals for lions. The officials are yet to get a confirmation about the animals that Gujarat will receive. The officials said that the Sakkarbaug zoo will transfer lions that are subadults or below three years of age. Meanwhile, the Kevadia zoo will get a pair of sloth bear from the Sakkarbaug zoo. The officials said that the forest department has a large population of 115 lions in various zoos and gene pools in Junagadh and adjacent districts of Saurashtra. These zoo lions represent nearly 15% of the total Asiatic lion population of Gujarat. Of the 115 lions held in captivity at various zoos and wildlife parks in the state, 85 are found at the Sakkarbaug zoo alone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-to-trade-40-lions-for-kevadia-menagerie/articleshow/84805620.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

As per the coWIN portal around 2.89 crore vaccine doses have been administered in MP till 9 pm on July 26. Highest number of vaccine doses have been administered in Uttar Pradesh where 4.51 crore vaccine doses have been administered, followed by Maharashtra where 4.17 crore vaccine doses have been administered and then it is Gujarat where 3.18 crore vaccine doses have been administered, after Gujarat it is Rajasthan where 3.05 crore vaccine doses have been administered and then it is Karnataka where 2.91 crore vaccine doses have been administered. Sources said that if population of the state is also taken into account, apart from Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra all other states like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Karnataka where more vaccination doses have been administered so far than Madhya Pradesh are either having around same population or are having slightly less estimated population. Thus despite a major push in vaccination in the state from June 21 onwards when mega vaccination drive was initiated in the state, still there is a far way to go. Of the total 2.89 crore doses more than 1.25 crore doses have been administered in the state since June 21. On the very first day of the drive around 17 lakh doses were administered in the state. In the first week of the drive itself, from June 21 to June 26 a total of 46.32 lakh vaccine doses were administered in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/with-over-2-89cr-vac-doses-mp-stands-sixth-in-country/articleshow/84805586.cms||---

Their boat trip through the flooded Gavbhag locality of the city has now become the talk of the town. For many, the sight of the young couple celebrating a joyous occasion acted as a balm to soothe the frayed nerves. The couple’s muhurtmed (a pre-wedding ritual) was held on July 23.

However, the Sangli city got flooded on the night of July 23.The couple’s muhurtmed (a pre-wedding ritual) was held on July 23. As per the tradition, once the muhurtmed is held, then the wedding too must take place on the fixed date. However, the Sangli city got flooded on the night of July 23. Rohit, who runs a salon, added: “We had planned a grand wedding with Covid-appropriate measures. The date was fixed much in advance and we had finished all the preparations and shopping. Usually, we have a grand procession after the wedding to take the bride home. However, most out plans had to be set aside. But we did not want to postpone the wedding date.” Rohit Suryawanshi told TOI: “Earlier, we had picked a wedding hall near my house. However, when the floodwater started entering many localities, evacuated people had to be relocated to the wedding hall. Since our muhurtmed was done, we had to proceed with the wedding anyhow. Therefore, we decided to get marry at Sonali’s house with just a few guests. For the wedding, I left with few close relatives on a boat. As the bride’s gruhapravesh and varaat (the trip to bring the bride to her marital home) are important steps, we decided to take the boat back home too.” Rohit, who runs a salon, added: “We had planned a grand wedding with Covid-appropriate measures. The date was fixed much in advance and we had finished all the preparations and shopping. Usually, we have a grand procession after the wedding to take the bride home.

At around 1pm, the woman Sarita and her live-in partner Pankaj Chavda were having lunch when the accused Aakash Maurya barged inside and fired at her from a country-made gun. Sarita, who was seven months pregnant, died on the spot due to heavy blood loss. Sarita and Maurya, both natives of Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, had separated around a year-and-a-half ago. She had come to Rajko with some acquaintance and met Pankaj. They started living together and she was running a beauty parlour at her house. Maurya’s father Ramanuj owns a readymade garment shop in Gorkhpur and Sarita used to work there. She and Maurya fell in love and got married. However, disputes started arising in their marital life. Fed up of daily squabbles, Sarita left Gorakhpur and came to Rajkot. Preliminary investigation suggested that Sarita had taken Rs 3 lakh from their house in Gorakhpur when she came to Rajkot. Three months ago, Maurya had come to Rajkot after getting to know that she was living with Pankaj. He met Sarita then and there was a bitter altercation over money, police said. On Tuesday, Maurya hired a rickshaw and went to Ravi Park. After firing at Sarita, Maurya ran out of the house, leaving the weapon at the spot. Pankaj tried to catch hold of Maurya and chased him for some distance. But Maurya boarded the rickshaw and sped away. Pankaj then saw his neighbour Kunal Chudasama going in the car and told him about the murder. Chudasama and Pankaj started following the rickshaw in the former’s car. On the way, Chudasama also informed the traffic police near Indira Circle about the murder and requested them to alert the police control room. “A traffic policeman also got into their car and followed the rickshaw which went towards Madhapar chokdi on 150 foot Road. More police teams also came from various directions,” police said. After a seven km long chase that lasted 40 minutes, Maurya was finally nabbed. “We are investigating the case in detail and trying to get the background of the families,” said Manoharsinh Jadeja, deputy commissioner of police (DCP). Same rickshaw hired The rickshaw that Aakash Maurya hired on Tuesday was the same that he had taken three months ago when he came to Rajkot. He had befriended the driver and taken his mobile number. He asked the rickshaw driver to wait for about 15 minutes and went walking inside the lanes to Sarita house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/pregnant-woman-shot-dead-by-ex-husband-caught-after-dramatic-chase/articleshow/84803161.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Ramappa dossier fails Unesco grandeur test||HYDERABAD: Political and diplomatic efforts seem to have fetched the Unesco World Heritage Site tag for the historic Ramappa temple in Telangana. The dossier prepared by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Department of Heritage Telangana (DHT) and the Kakatiya Heritage Trust (KHT), however, failed to convince the Unesco experts on the uniqueness and grandeur of the 13th century temple complex. If the report of the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) submitted to the ongoing extended 44th session of the World Heritage Committee of Unesco is any indication, the experts involved in the preparation of the dossier did not come up with a foolproof plan. For instance, when ICOMOS asked for details of comparison of the 13th century Ramappa temple in Mulugu district with other temples of Kakatiya period, the dossier just mentioned two temples - 1,000 pillars temple in Hanamkonda and Swayambhu temple in Warangal. It described the latter two as inferior to Ramappa. This despite the fact that Telangana had wanted heritage tag for Warangal fort and its temples. Later, it dropped the Warangal structures in favour of Ramappa. Specifically mentioning this, ICOMOS said, “The State Party submitted a brief addition to the comparison of the two temples at Hanamkonda and Warangal describing their inferiority when compared to Rudreshwara (Ramappa) temple at Palampet. No other Kakatiya testimonies were mentioned.” “Unfortunately, comparison with these two temples is limited to very general considerations in terms of their integrity and authenticity,” the ICOMOS report said. It added that such comparative material remains essential to illustrate the temple complex’s potential exceptional features in artistic terms. Telangana officials, however, said they would add more information once the current research work comparing the temples is completed. ICOMOS in its report pinpointed the loopholes in the dossier and explained how the ‘state party’ failed to come up with clinching scientific evidence in support of the claims made for the heritage status. As the dossier focussed only on Ramappa temple ignoring other structures in the complex, ICOMOS noted that “this nomination, as currently presented, does not meet the requirements for outstanding universal value at this stage.” Stating that while Ramappa temple has the potential to demonstrate an outstanding universal value as an exceptional testimony of the cultural traditions of the Kakatiya dynasty, the ICOMOS report said, “None of the cultural criteria has been demonstrated at this stage.” It further noted that “while the conditions of authenticity are satisfactory, the conditions of integrity cannot be fully met in terms of completeness due to the missing features and attributes as well as a general vulnerability of the temple’s setting as a result of a lack of protection mechanisms.” The report also expressed regret that no details are provided as to how the monitoring is implemented. “ICOMOS, therefore, considers that further information on existing monitoring programmes and their implementation are needed in order to assess their appropriateness and effectiveness… The justification for inscription lacks specific elements of the narrative and value concepts, as well as integrity, in terms of completeness, and therefore, cannot be demonstrated at this stage,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ramappa-dossier-fails-unesco-grandeur-test/articleshow/84809974.cms||Syed Akbar

A division bench headed by Justice Ajay Tewari issued the notice on a plea filed by Sidhu. In his plea, Sidhu claimed a March 27 order passed by joint commissioner of the income tax department was in complete disregard of the principles of natural justice. According to Sidhu, he declared an income of Rs 9,66,28,470 in his income tax return of assessment year 2016-17 on October 19, 2016. The assessment under Section 143(3) of Income Tax Act was completed by the assessment officer on December 21, 2018, and assessed income raised to Rs 13,19,66,530. Aggrieved, Sidhu filed a revision petition under Section 264 of the Act after taking various grounds before income tax joint commissioner, Range 1, Amritsar. According to Sidhu, instead of going into the merits of the revision, the joint commissioner focused on seeking an explanation on reasons and circumstances behind Sidhu’s preference for revision under Section 264. The commissioner then dismissed the plea in March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-haryana-high-court-notice-to-centre-on-navjot-sidhus-plea/articleshow/84808036.cms||---

Finally, after a chase, Sonu was nabbed. In the firing incident, the police have registered a case of attempt to murder and using criminal force to deter a public servant from performing his duty against the three men helping Sonu flee. Sonu, alias Bhong Rajendrasingh Chavan, is a 20-year-old hardened criminal on police record and the key accused in the Zameer Baig murder case. On July 6, Baig, a 35-year-old autorickshaw driver, was stabbed within the limits of the Wazirabad police station, after he allegedly refused to give Rs 100 to Sonu and his 17-year-old friend. The injured driver was admitted to a hospital, but he succumbed on July 17, following which, the attempt to murder charge against Sonu was turned into a murder case. Superintendent of police Pramodkumar Shewale said: “Initially, the attempt to murder case was registered against unidentified suspects. After the investigation revealed Sonu and his accomplice’s role, they were named as accused in the murder of the autorickshaw driver.” Police teams then launched a manhunt for Sonu and the minor accomplice. On Tuesday, the Wazirabad police received a tip that the duo was hiding in a house in Sakhojinagar. Senior inspector Jagdish Bhandarvar told TOI: “When our team reached the hideout on Tuesday morning, Sonu threatened the policemen with a sword. He managed to flee, while his minor accomplice was rounded up.” While the police teams continued to chase Sonu, he managed to evade them for a while, before being spotted on a bike with three other accomplices near the Maltekdi bridge. These accomplices were helping him flee. Police teams started tailing the bike. But as soon as the cops got near, Sonu allegedly tried to attack them with the sword. “Not taking any chance, our policeman fired a round. We suspect that it hit one of the three accused helping Sonu flee on the leg. They went on for a while and then dropped off Sonu before fleeing themselves,” said Nanded range IGP Nisar Tamboli. The police teams soon nabbed Sonu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/cops-shoot-at-fleeing-murder-accused-injure-accomplice/articleshow/84808056.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The drug, a cocktail of two fasting-acting lab-made (monoclonal) antibodies, can cost as much as Rs 60,000. Despite the price, demand is being pushed up by at-risk patients hoping to avoid serious Covid and steroids during treatment. And doctors in small towns, often with limited infrastructure and keen on reducing patients' hospitalisation period, are reporting positive outcomes. Physician Dhanesh Gandhi, with the Akluj Critical Care and Trauma Centre, said he has been able to treat 52 mild to moderate Covid patients with a pre-existing medical condition with the antibody cocktail, ever since its availability improved from June 20. "Except for three patients, the rest reported recovery within 48 hours of therapy," Gandhi said, adding that he knows of at least four other nursing homes in Akluj that have deployed the therapy. In Jaysinghpur, physician Pravin Jain said 20 patients were given the antibody cocktail, with good results, at his 30-bed Sanjeevan Hospital. "A majority of them were senior citizens. The oldest recipient is 86," Jain said. Early on, soon after the country's drug regulator had approved its use in late May, the antibody cocktail was only available at a few big hospitals. It's a single-dose shot, given through a drip, that takes up to 45 minutes. A patient is then put under observation for 30 to 60 minutes or 24 to 48 hours, depending on need. "Be it a small nursing home in a city or a healthcare setup in Maharashtra's semi-urban areas, the single-shot therapy has become quite popular among Covid patients who can afford it. Those with comorbidities are opting for it, to avoid worsening of Covid symptoms, drugs such as steroids and opportunistic fungal infections such as mucormycosis," said physician Aniket Joshi, a member of the Association of Physicians of India (API). In the state capital, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation's Seven Hills Hospital reported good outcomes in 212 patients who were given the antibody cocktail in July. Persistent fever in the patients was resolved within 48 hours and there was an overall reduction in the hospitalisation period. Joshi said, "The widespread dissemination of this information boosted doctors' confidence in the experimental drug and contributed to its growing use even at small Covid hospitals/nursing homes and health centres." The drug can be given on a day-care basis. "The cost-benefit analysis favours early use of this drug as it reduces hospital stay, need for oxygen support and other expensive drugs," Joshi added. Pune-based infectious diseases expert Ameet Dravid, of Noble hospital, said, "There is growing acceptance for the therapy, even in small towns like Kolhapur, Satara and Sangli." Dravid himself has treated 20 patients using the therapy. But opinions remain divided on the overall usefulness of the antibody cocktail. First, experts argued, it's not meant for all Covid patients. Only those who are not on oxygen support, with multiple comorbidities and those at risk of severe disease progression should be considered, they said. The cocktail also needs to be administered within three days of Covid diagnosis and within a week of symptom onset. Infectious diseases expert Mahesh Lakhe said, "With the results we are seeing from India, the single-dose cocktail of monoclonal antibodies seems to be highly effective at stopping disease progression in people at risk of developing severe Covid-19. It cuts chances of ICU admission as well as death." Parikshit Prayag, an infectious diseases expert at Pune's Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said, “The cocktail is not a miracle drug. Studies have shown that it can reduce hospitalisation or repeat emergency visits by about 70%. Studies have also shown it works against variants like B1.617. But efficacy may reduce as new variants emerge. Currently, evidence is not robust for its usage."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/docs-in-small-towns-battling-covid-deploy-rs-60000-antibody-cocktail/articleshow/84808067.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Children like me have missed their schools as well as classes. The fun we had at school can never be replicated at home. However, thanks to technology, we can learn and study through online interaction. Online classes are the only option now, but I limit my screen time as much as possible. Yes, this is the time when I have learnt coding. It was really interesting and fun to make new apps by myself. Time passed and I developed a passion for drawing, poetry, reading and many more activities. I even tried to be more mature and responsible by doing some household chores by myself. During this lockdown time, life was very boring but slowly I made the journey interesting. I bought new story books, different types of Rubik's cube, blocks and different indoor games, which kept me going. I even devoted time to reading newspapers. Nowadays it has become one of my favorite things to indulge in and it also helps me gain knowledge. I have started participating in various online competitions, learnt to cook a few dishes and started doing meditation before bedtime which helps me sleep well and brings positivity to my life. This lockdown has taught me that we must use our time as productively as we can. Life will always have ups and downs. All we can do is face it with a smile.

He said the allegations against Rana Sodhi for getting compensation on the acquired land at Mohan Ke Utaar village twice on Ferozepur-Fazilka road were very serious. The AAP has obtained documentary evidence of this matter, which will be disclosed in more detail soon, he added. “Rana Sodhi is being accused of double compensation not only by us (AAP) but also by former Punjab Congress president and senior leader Sunil Jakhar. Therefore, the Congress high command and chief minister Amarinder Singh should take immediate and stern action against Rana Sodhi,” said Cheema. The AAP leader said that on the one hand, Punjab farmers were compelled to hold permanent dharnas from the roads to Moti Mahal, Patiala, for adequate compensation for their acquired lands; while on the other hand Congress ministers after getting double compensation for their acquired lands were looking to get compensation for the third time; which was a very shameful and reprehensible act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/remove-rana-sodhi-from-punjab-ministerial-cabinet-aap/articleshow/84808134.cms||---

Since I was already quarantining from the day I started showing symptoms, that part of the procedure was not a struggle. But now the question was, how do I spend the rest of my days? Since my road to recovery was not a bumpy one, I had a lot of free time on my hands. The first two days were fine, but the next day I was getting frustrated at even the smallest of things. I then thought, I should try something new, something creative to keep myself composed. I started with yoga and some breathing exercises. By pushing my bed to one side, I got enough room to do all the asanas. I then rediscovered my passion for arts and with the help of some online tutorials, I drew various sceneries and sketches. I was particularly interested in origami. Many of my friends do it and their models turn out to be very beautiful. I first started with the origami crane. Although its general shape was correct, it had a lot of blunt tips. As I continued making more animals and figures, they slowly started to turn out cleaner and nicer. I also read my school books that are now helping me understand all my concepts quicker and easier than it generally would. Somehow the 15th day came, without me even noticing! The tests were done and my relief, I had finally defeated the deadly virus.

---||Dehradun||Outage across Uttarakhand for hours after power employees go on strike||NAINITAL: Entire towns and villages faced blackouts for hours on Tuesday as power sector employees went on a strike after a long deadlock over their demand for equal pay. With no sign of the workers going back to generation units or fixing power lines, the government first banned strikes by power employees for six months. Later, a meeting was hurriedly convened with union representatives and power restored in the evening. Over 3,500 workers from the Uttarakhand Power Corporation Limited, Uttarakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited (UJVNL) and Power Transmission Corporation Limited ceased work on Monday midnight. For years, they have been making the same demands — equal pay for equal work, an increase in allowances and regularisation of contractual employment. When nothing came out of talks with the government again, they announced a strike. In less than 12 hours, their protest started having a palpable impact. In Kumaon’s largest city, Haldwani, the subdivisional magistrate’s court went dark in the morning. “Officials were working with no power supply. We tried calling engineers and linemen but no one answered the calls,” said Ramesh Rawat, 34, a resident of Haldwani. In Dehradun, when energy minister Harak Singh Rawat was about to meet the workers’ unions, ironically, the lights went out. Generators were quickly powered up. Uttarkashi relies on UJVNL but every single plant run by it was shut and the district had to borrow power from the NTPC plant. “There was no power all morning and afternoon,” said Naveen Tiwari, 29, a local. The workers, meanwhile, said the strike was an indefinite one. As town after town faced blackouts, the state government invoked the Essential Services Maintenance Act and announced that protests by power corporation employees were banned for six months. Yet, no one went back to work. Finally, around 5pm, there was word that the strike had been called off. The meeting between the unions and Rawat had ended in a temporary truce. “The strike was called off after Rawat’s assurance that the government would take steps to address our issues. We asked the minister to work on problems directly under his control within a fortnight and to resolve the ones that need cabinet-level discussions within a month,” said Ansar Ul Haq, coordinator of the union’s joint front. “If that doesn’t happen, we will call a strike again.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/outage-across-ukhand-for-hrs-after-power-employees-go-on-strike/articleshow/84800502.cms||Prashant Jha

From my years of experience of being a homeopathy medicine recipient and having read many books on the subject, with the advice of my family doctor, I made some very economic anti-infection medicine at home -- about 100+ bottles -- and distributed them among all community helpers in my area like policemen, road cleaning staff, domestic helpers. I even deposited some in my community temples, to be given to those interested. I distributed biscuits and water to all stray animals in my locality so that no living being goes without food at a time when other sources of food were closed. And I do this regularly even now as my animal friends have started looking forward to their daily meal! To conserve nature, I undertook a water harvesting project in my area and restored a ruined park by getting new trees planted. Apart from this, I ensure to report any issues in my vicinity relating to infrastructure, road or street light repairs or maintenance work that cause inconvenience to fellow citizens as I feel I have some spare time during the day to follow up with concerned government departments. All this work gives me a lot of satisfaction and I will always continue to do so. It has given my life a new direction and outlook.

---||Hyderabad||Dr Reddy’s scrip crashes 10% over likely US probe||Hyderabad: Dr Reddy’s Laboratories’ scrip crashed 10% to hit the lower circuit on Tuesday. The downslide was triggered after the company admitted that it could face civil or criminal enforcement actions in the US and other countries over a whistleblower complaint, as well as lower than expected performance in the first quarter of FY22. The scrip of the Hyderabad-based pharma giant opened at Rs 5,421 a share on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) but plummeted to a low of Rs 4,781 before closing 10.44% down (a 565 points fall) at Rs 4,844.35 as compared to the previous close of Rs 5,409. The stock tanked after the company informed the bourses that it has been subpoenaed by the US markets regulator SEC for documents pertaining to certain CIS countries. A whistleblower complaint had alleged that healthcare professionals in Ukraine and other countries were provided with improper payments by or on behalf of the company in violation of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. “…the matter may result in government enforcement actions against the company in the United States and/or foreign jurisdictions, which could lead to civil and criminal sanctions under relevant laws, the probability of such action and the outcome are not reasonably ascertainable at this time,” the company said in the P&L statement filed as part of its Q1FY22 results. “The company has commenced a detailed investigation into an anonymous complaint…A US law firm is conducting the investigation at the instruction of a committee of the company's board of directors…The company has disclosed the matter to the US Department of Justice, SEC and SEBI and on 6 July 2021 the company received a subpoena from the SEC for the production of documents pertaining to certain ClS geographies…,” Dr Reddy’s said. Though Dr Reddy’s had informed the bourses about the whistleblower complaint and the commencement of a detailed investigation into the anonymous complaint in November 2020 itself, on Tuesday the company's admission of the possibility of legal troubles ahead coupled with a 1.5% decline in consolidated net profit for the first quarter ended June 30,2021, proved too much for the markets to digest, hammering the stock. Dr Reddy’s Q1FY22 consolidated net profit fell to Rs 571 crore from Rs 579 crore in Q1FY21, largely due to price erosion in the key North American market. The company's profits fell despite an 11% rise in consolidated revenues at Rs 4,919 crore from Rs 4,417.5 crore in Q1 FY21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dr-reddys-scrip-crashes-10-over-likely-us-probe/articleshow/84809997.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Registration for optional CET, for class XI admissions in the state, had opened on July 20. A day later the website was shut down due to technical glitches. Registrations reopened on Monday and those registered were told to use their application form numbers to be eligible for the exam. But students pointed out several errors in application forms. In Mumbai, many complained of being registered in wards different from their place of residence. A student who had registered from ‘P’ ward in Goregaon found that the site recorded her ward as ‘N’ (Ghatkopar). “If there is an error in ward, the exam centre will end up being away from the residence,” said a parent. Students said that despite entering Aadhaar details, including residential address, they were allotted different wards. They are worried they may end up getting exam centres away from home. Errors in email addresses were also there in several applications, said students. A state board official said they received many complaints last week, adding that the errors were being fixed. The last date for registration is August 2. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-many-students-complain-of-errors-in-cet-forms-now/articleshow/84808167.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Nandurbar was one of the hotspot districts in the state during the second wave of the pandemic. At the peak of the second wave, the district was registering around 1,200 cases a day. Data from the state health department shows that Wardha district has not reported a single Covid case over the Sunday and Monday. On Monday, Wardha, Bhandara, Gondia and the Chandrapur municipal corporation, rural parts of Akola district and Dhule municipal corporation did not report a single new Covid case. Overall, the state reported 4,877 new Covid cases and 53 deaths on Monday. Dr Kantrao Satpute, additional civil surgeon of Nandurbar district, told TOI that four patients from among the nine active cases have been admitted to hospitals while the other five are in home isolation as they are asymptomatic. Since mid-June, active cases in the district had reduced to double digits and this was for the first time that they had dropped to a single digit. Satpute said the health authorities are conducting over 500-600 RT-CPR and Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) daily despite the decline in Covid cases in the district. Health officials said there were no positive cases on five of the last 10 days. Nine fresh cases were detected in the last 10 days. Satpute said two of the six talukas in the district — Akkalkuwa and Dhadgaon — have become Covid-free as no fresh cases have come to the fore for over five days at a stretch. “The second wave of the pandemic was deadlier in our district than the first. During the second wave, we had around 30,000 positive cases as compared to around 10,000 in the first,” Satpute said, adding that even the number of deaths during the second wave were higher. Of the total 950 deaths in the district during both waves, 728 were during the second wave alone. The previous district collector, Rajendra Bharud, had led the district team in ramping up health infrastructure and stepping up surveillance to test and identify Covid patients so that they could get early treatment. Bharud was recently transferred as commissioner of the Pune-based Tribal Research & Training Institute. Apart from increasing beds at the Nandurbar civil hospital, which is the main government Covid treatment facility in the tribal district, the administration had set up DCHCs and CCCs in various talukas. It had even used train coaches stationed at Nandurbar railway station as isolation centres to treat male Covid patients. At one point in time, the administration had even stopped home isolation as a section of the asymptomatic patients were found moving around in public places despite having tested positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/from-1200-cases-daily-at-2nd-wave-peak-nandurbar-now-has-only-9/articleshow/84808124.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

They said that offline classes should be conducted at least two days a week for primary students. “Even as per ICMR, the impact of Covid-19 on children under the age group of 10 is much less when compared with elder children and adults. Why not start physical classes for them as well,” V Amarnath, director, Slate-The School. “These students are unable to concentrate, their confidence is low and communication skills have been impacted,” he said, adding that holistic development of a child has been impacted overall. Teachers said that physical classes should be resumed for all children in August within a gap of 10-15 days and all students should get to attend offline classes on alternate days. “Now, almost all teachers are vaccinated. The same is the case with parents. So the risk of children spreading Covid seems to be comparatively lower. However, the state should provide sanitation, medical staff and allocate sufficient budget to follow Covid protocols in schools. By following all norms, physical classes should be started,” said M Ravinder, a government teacher, adding students are already facing memory and conceptual loss. Parents agreed that it is a matter of urgency to resume physical classes, although they said that the same cannot be done in a haste. The government should form a committee and study the impact of reopening of schools. They need to communicate with parents, explain what to expect and give an assurance about their children and family members’ safety||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/resume-physical-classes-for-primary-students-teachers/articleshow/84808151.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Investigators said Sohail and Alisha fled from their village early on Tuesday morning and reached the bridge over Mahi River near Sindhrot. The duo then jumped in the river that is flowing at high level due to rains. On July 16 too, a couple had hung itself on a tree in Savli taluka.

Meanwhile, local manufacturing of the two-dose Sputnik V is expected to begin by September-October. “We are now in the process of receiving data on Sputnik Light. We should be going to SEC with the updated data once we receive the full and final clinical data maybe in about a week’s time and that’s something that could ensure better availability of the vaccine,” M V Ramana, CEO branded markets (India & emerging markets), Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, said on Tuesday. The company said it would be leveraging the Russian Phase-3 trials data of Sputnik Light for its India filing as per the SEC recommendation. Sputnik Light comprises the first adenoviral vector – Ad26 – which has shown an interim efficacy of 79.4% in Russian trials. SEC, which advises the Indian drug regulator Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), had observed that as Sputnik Light is the same as component-1 of the two-dose Sputnik-V, for which the safety and immunogenicity data had already been generated in the country, there was no need to conduct a separate trial in India. Deepak Sapra, CEO of API & services, Dr Reddy’s Labs, said the local manufacturers of Sputnik V are currently in the process of technology absorption and scaleup. “We expect that from the September-October timeframe we are likely to have locally manufactured Sputnik available,” he said during a virtual media interaction on the sidelines of the Q1 results for financial year 2021-22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/russian-trials-data-of-sputnik-light-next-wk/articleshow/84810036.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Teachers said that many students are unable to communicate, read and write even basic sentences. “The IQ levels of children have dropped drastically. There is memory loss as well. Some, in fact, completely forgot about school and education as they are unable to follow online classes being taught on mobile or computers. While younger students are busy playing, the elder ones have turned to child labour,” said Shabbir Ali, president, Telangana Private Teachers Forum. He added that physical classes should be resumed by following all protocols. Teachers said that if the same situation continues for another year or two, a generation of students will be affected as they don’t have access to quality education and are not learning anything. They said that instead of promoting students year after year without having minimum subject knowledge, the government should announce a year as zero year, if needed. “This year, many students are not even learning anything assuming that they will be passed without exams. This cannot continue. It’s important that students understand the importance of learning and study, even if it’s for the fear of exams,” said Lakshmi S, a private teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/primary-students-are-forgetting-even-basics/articleshow/84808177.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Meanwhile, the Union government has agreed to provide 5 lakh vaccines on Wednesday. The consignments will be reaching Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the five lakh vaccine doses coming to the state will be finished in two days going with the pace of the vaccination here. At present the state has recorded a vaccination of up to 4.5 lakh vaccinations a day. Hence, the state needs enough stock in the coming days to provide at least four lakh vaccines a day, the chief minister said. “Hence it has been decided to write to the Centre again seeking more vaccines. Before Onam, the state should achieve maximum vaccination,” said the chief minister. He also made it clear that RT-PCR test results will not be made mandatory in the state for taking vaccination. Earlier, a delegation of MPs from the state met Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya in New Delhi and apprised him of the need for sending the vaccine consignment immediately to the state. In the meeting, the Union minister promised that the vaccines would be sent to the state soon. The delegation led by MP Elamaram Kareem submitted a detailed report on the shortage of the vaccines in the state and stressed the need for vaccinating more people in the wake of increasing caseload. The MPs delegation also informed the minister that the vaccination drive was partially hit in the state since Monday due to the shortage of vaccine. Textile showrooms to open Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that the government was considering to allow opening of textile showrooms in the state gradually. The showrooms will be allowed to function with a limited number of employees and all of them will have to be vaccinated before opening the shops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/vax-stores-go-dry-5l-more-to-arrive-today/articleshow/84805826.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Amritsar||Sacrilege case: 4 accused granted bail||Bathinda: Four men accused in a September 2015 sacrilege case were granted bail by a Faridkot court on Tuesday, till the pendency of the case. The court’s relief for the accused has come at a time when the issue of sacrilege and killing of two protesters in police firing in 2015, has snowballed into a political storm for the serving Congress party in Punjab. Sukhjinder Singh, Shakti Singh, Ranjit Singh and Baljit Singh were on Tuesdy granted bail in connection with case of derogatory posters being pasted at Bargari village in Faridkot on September 25, 2015. On July 20, these four had been granted bail in connection with torn pages from a Bir of Guru Granth Sahib being strewn around in Bargari on October 12, 2015. At the time, they could not be released from jail as they were still being probed in connection with the case of derogatory posteers. Defence counsel Vinod Kumar Monga submitted in the court that the four men had been falsely implicated in the case as the CBI had already provided them the clean chit. SIT counsel Pankaj Taneja, however, opposed the bail. He said if set free, the accused could influence evidences in the case. The court directed the accused not to leave the country. A bail application has also been moved for two other accused, Nishan Singh and Pardeep Singh. The court is expected to take up the matter on August 3, when the hearing in the derogatory posters’ case will be held.

---||Mumbai||Pornography case: Raj Kundra sent to judicial custody; Mumbai police say app got Rs 1.1 crore in a year||MUMBAI: The city crime branch probing the pornography case involving businessman Raj Kundra said the controversial app Hotshot has generated Rs 1.17 crore from Apple for downloads of the alleged pornographic contents from August 2019 to July 2020. Kundra was sent to 14 days’ judicial custody. The crime branch had earlier said that after the Hotshot app was removed by YouTube, Google Play and Apple, Kundra created another app called Bollyfame. It said that accounts containing cash to the tune of Rs 1.13 crore had been frozen. Police in the remand plea said since Google has more users, they are expecting more revenue to have been generated from there. A request has been sent to Google for the information via email, the plea said. Police believe Kundra’s brother-in-law Pradeep Bakshi is just a frontman for Kundra’s shell company. Hotshot is owned by Bakshi’s company Kenrin, registered in UK. Police believe Kundra has been involved in production and dIstribution of pornographic videos. Through his tech firm named Arms Prime, he had developed several apps, including Hotshot which was later sold to Bakshi, it is alleged. Even though Kundra sold the app and resigned from Arms Prime, he continued to be involved in day-to-day activities of the app and it was handled by his former PA Umesh Kamat, who was arrested in the case in February. During the course of investigations after the arrests of Gehana Vasisth, Rowa Khan and Tanveer Hashmi, it was revealed that all these accused used to make porn films for one Yash Thakur alias Arvind Srivastav, who used to run a similar application named Flizmovies. The investigation revealed Thakur had registered the app in the name of wife of an intelligence officer on the pretext of hosting award-winning short films. But police have not found any links between Kundra and Thakur. In 2019, Thakur contacted the officer and started the app. Meanwhile, the officer found transactions of Rs 1.4 crore in his wife’s account, which was handled by Thakur. When the officer checked the app, he was shocked to find pornographic content, and he backed off. Only then did Thakur allegedly start a new app named Nueflicks which he registered in the US. Police said they have issued a red corner notice against Thakur. Police said a new victim has come forward and has recorded her statement. Kundra’s lawyers Abad Ponda and Subhash Jadhav submitted his bail plea. It will come up for hearing on Wednesday. The plea said the chargesheet was already filed in the case and as such, no case was made out against Kundra. It further said there was no evidence to show Kundra was involved and his name had not even featured in the initial probe. The remand plea said Kundra had not co-operated with investigations as he had refused to sign a notice issued to him. It said his wife, film actor Shilpa Shetty Kundra’s statement was recorded and a search of their residence was conducted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-kundra-sent-to-judicial-custody-police-say-app-got-rs-1-1-cr-in-a-yr/articleshow/84808208.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Hyderabad||HC to Telangana govt: Explain policy on cinema ticket pricing||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Tuesday gave the state government three weeks to explain its policy on fixing prices of cinema tickets and its implementation. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy issued notices to the chief secretary and secretaries of home and GAD, asking them to respond to a PIL on arbitrary pricing by exhibitors. The bench had converted a letter by G L Narasimha Rao of ‘Cine Prekshaka Viniyogadarula Sangham’ alleging that state authorities were hand in gloves with cinema owners who were fixing prices at times arbitrarily. When the bench sought to know the status from the home and cinematography wing, state counsel Palle Nageswar Rao said that the rules pertaining to this area were earlier set aside. The PIL also accused the state of doing precious little after the high court earlier directed it to form an experts committee to monitor the situation and make suggestions. The petitioner urged the court to punish all those who allowed theatre owners to enrich themselves at the expense of the public. But when home department counsel Srikanth Reddy informed that the state had indeed formed the experts committee and that it also gave its suggestions, the bench told him to file a counter explaining these developments. “Tell us what recommendations were made and how they are being implemented,” the bench said. “We will also hear the appeals filed by theatre owners who are aggrieved by the order of a single judge,” the bench said before posting the case to October 26.

The incident happened on Monday evening. Gowrinanda (18), a native of Idukkupara in Chadayamangalam was standing in a queue for withdrawing money from an ATM at Chadayamangalam Junction. Seeing the police imposing a fine on an elderly person for violating social distance norms, she stepped in and argued in favour of the elderly person. She pointed out that the ATM was on the roadside and there was little space for people to form a queue. Bank authorities have not made any arrangements to prevent people from crowding before the ATM, she said. Visibly annoyed by the girl's questioning the sub-inspector slapped a fine on the girl. As she tore off the notice, they registered a case against her for obstructing the police from discharging their official duty. With onlookers shooting the video of the incident and posting it on social media, police said they would consider withdrawing the case only if the girl reported at the police station and tender an apology. As the video went viral on the social media, Youth Commission chairperson Chintha Jerome has sought a report from rural SP. Speaking to media, Gowrinanda who is waiting for her Plus Two results said she raised her voice against police only when they used foul language against her. “They informed me through some politicians that they would withdraw the case only if I tender an apology. But I won’t do that," she said. However, Chadayamangalam police said the issue was blown out of proportion and they would withdraw the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/18-yr-old-girl-booked-for-obstructing-officer-on-duty/articleshow/84805854.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Kivi said that in the last national elections in Estonia, over 40% of the people had used the e-voting system to cast their votes. She pointed out that an e-voting system would be more suitable in the Covid world. In fact, the Baltic country has been the first in the world to adopt e-voting, which was first used in its elections during 2005. Telangana had mooted plans to test-pilot e-voting during the GHMC polls held recently. However, the state election commission had dropped the plan citing lack of preparedness and decided to go with paper ballots instead. Meanwhile, Kivi also stated that Telangana and Estonia would collaborate in areas of e-governance, data security and strengthening the innovation ecosystem to help startups in both the countries achieve higher growth. She also invited KTR to visit Estonia along with a business delegation and explore business opportunities in her country and shared details about Estonia’s e-Residency programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/estonia-keen-to-help-telangana-understand-e-voting-process/articleshow/84808241.cms||---

Kundra’s case, argued by senior counsel Aabad Ponda, was that no mandatory notice was given to him prior to his arrest in a case of publishing and transmission of sexually explicit content via a mobile app. The app is no longer operational. Ponda cited the remand application to show the police have “admitted” to not issuing any notice under Section 41A of Criminal Procedure Code to first seek an explanation. Public prosecutor Aruna Pai submitted before Justice Ajay Gadkari that she was ready with the case diary and the investigating officer too was present virtually to counter Kundra’s plea. The HC sought a reply from the police and posted it on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-to-hear-bail-plea-on-thu-asks-state-to-file-its-reply/articleshow/84808249.cms||---
---||Guwahati||After bloody face-off, uneasy calm on border; Assam police move back, CRPF at disputed site||GUWAHATI: A day after five Assam cops were killed in a border clash with allegedly armed Mizo intruders backed by police, Mizoram on Tuesday refused to budge on deployment of state forces in the disputed zone even as Assam retreated 100 metres from the site on the instructions of Union home minister Amit Shah. While there was no further aggression from either side, an uneasy calm descended on the border, with the CRPF watching over the disputed site of a police outpost that Assam vacated for the “neutral force”. An ANI quoted CRPF DG Kuldiep Singh as saying that “Assam police have retreated from the disputed area but Mizoram police continue to stay at their temporary posts”. “Assam is ready to give up anything for peace. We do not want land. But it (the disputed area) is a reserve forest that cannot be utilised for human settlement. The rest of India should know the dispute is not over land, but a forest that Assam wants to protect,” CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said. “This is not a political issue but a long-pending border dispute between the two states.” Sarma said Assam would soon move the Supreme Court, seeking protection of the 509sq mile "inner-line reserve forest" at the heart of the dispute. This reserve forest straddles parts of Cachar and Hailakandi districts in south Assam, bordering Mizoram and Manipur. "We have decided to deploy three commando battalions, each with 1,200 personnel, to guard the Assam-Mizoram border at Hailakandi, Silchar and Karimganj." Four additional companies of the CRPF have already been dispatched to the disputed area to ensure status quo. Sarma, who visited Silchar to lay wreaths on the bodies of the slain cops, said intruders from Mizoram had been trying to encroach on five sectors of the reserve forest in the last six months. "In last two months, Assam has successfully protected the constitutional boundary and continued steps for peaceful resolution. On July 8, the chief secretaries of the two states met in New Delhi, where we said that Assam was ready to maintain status quo from any date decided by the Mizoram government, based on satellite images on that day. But Mizoram refused to sign the deal." On July 25, the DFO of Silchar reported that Mizoram had started building a new road and an outpost, besides clearing a part of the forest for jhum cultivation, Sarma said. The CM had initially announced on Twitter that six cops were killed in Monday's firing. He revised the casualty count to five late in the night. The BJP-led government has announced Rs 50 lakh each to the kin of the slain cops and a government job to one family member. Each of the injured will get Rs 1 lakh, while all police personnel deployed along the border will be paid an extra month's salary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-police-move-back-but-mizoram-cops-stay-put-on-border/articleshow/84811096.cms||Prabin Kalita
---||Pune||Parking ban may free up key link road in Pune's Kondhwa||PUNE: The traffic branch of the Pune police have issued a notification inviting public feedback on a proposal to ban parking of vehicles on either sides of a 500m stretch of the NIBM-Salunke Vihar link road. The road has several eateries and commercial establishments, and a hospital which is also a Covid vaccination centre. The traffic authorities received complaints from citizens that visitors haphazardly park their vehicles on either sides of the road, narrowing the carriageway and causing vehicular congestion. Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Rahul Shrirame told TOI, “We have taken the initiative to clear the carriageway so that more space is created for smooth flow of traffic. We will identify alternative places where motorists can park. The PMC has not constructed a parking plaza to decongest traffic in Kondhwa. Large number of vehicles are parked indefinitely on the road.” They may launch the P1/P2 system or tell the PMC to paint white lines on the road and install sign boards to streamline parking. Public feedback is awaited. Assistant inspector Lekhaji Shinde from Kondhwa traffic police said, “A study revealed that there is severe congestion and haphazard parking by small and big vehicles. We are identifying places where space can be reserved for parking without affecting the two-way-traffic on the link road or adjoining roads in a week.” Local corporator Nanda Lonkar said the link road width is 12m and there are plans to widen it to 24m. The proposal to ban parking of vehicles is not in public interest because it will impact business in the locality, she said. “The P1/P2 system cannot be launched because the road is narrow. There was a plan to convert the stretch into a one-way, but the residents have opposed it,” she said. NIBM Road Residents’ Forum president Alka Kapoor favoured the ban on parking vehicles on the road because it has become difficult for the local residents to travel at peak hours. Kapoor suggested that the police with the help of PMC and NGOs conduct a joint survey and identify places where vehicles can be parked if the ban comes into force. Activist Rohan Gaikwad said more than 70 housing societies are in the vicinity. The ban on parking must be for four-wheelers and not two-wheelers because it will not impact business. The bylanes will be free of traffic. “The PMC has constructed a parking plaza in Lullanagar Chowk, but it is not possible for motorists to park their vehicles there because of the huge travelling distance,” he added. “Visitors park their cars in front of the society gate, sometimes they even parallel park on the narrow roads which leaves no space for other four-wheelers. More commotion is caused when water tankers come to the housing societies, as there is no space for them too,” Daniel Jawale, a resident of Amba Vatika housing society, said. Every day there is some event or the other held at a hall and the visitors park their vehicles along the road in a haphazard manner for a long duration, Bhavana Gaikwad, a resident of Kubera Garden, said. “People who come for vaccination to a Covid care centre too have no choice but to park on the road. Some arrangement should be made so it doesn’t inconvenience the residents. It takes more than half an hour to move along the road. Senior citizens find it even more difficult to walk on this road,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/parking-ban-may-free-up-key-link-road-in-kondhwa/articleshow/84807509.cms||Asseem Shaikh

VHP leaders claimed that there would be at least 56 office bearers including women for the ranks of the president, vice president, secretary and deputy secretary in every committee who would be appointing gau rakshaks (cow protectors) in Kashi prant. These protectors of cows would be appointed in every village to check the smuggling of cows and other cattle. Lal Mani Tiwari, regional secretary (VHP gau raksha) told TOI that VHP aims to protect every cow of Indian origin and for this purpose, the organisation would be imparting training to farmers so that they are motivated to breed cows of Indian origin. He further added, "we have chalked out a strategy to make gau raksha campaign effectively and for that, farmers and gau rakshaks would be imparted training to check cow smuggling. Moreover, office-bearers have also been appointed to create awareness among the masses for the proper upkeep of cows of Indian origin and their breeding. Tiwari, meanwhile, said that cow slaughter would not be tolerated at any cost in the country and the organisation has also chalked out a detailed plan to impart training to farmers and volunteers. Moreover, VHP also aims that every household should have a cow of Indian origin and for that purpose, they would be creating mass awareness campaigns in blocks, villages and towns. "As cows are the central point of devotion (Aastha) for the Hindu community, volunteers would be protecting cows, Ganga and villages to preserve Indian culture," added Tiwari. “Currently, most of the people keep jersey cows for their economic interest and if the similar condition continues, cows of Indian origin are going to be extinct species soon,” said a senior VHP leader, adding that the number of Indian origin cows is declining with every passing day and we must take corrective measures to protect our Indian origin cows," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/vhp-to-set-up-257-gau-raksha-panels-in-kashi-prant/articleshow/84805950.cms||---

The girl’s mother permitted her to accompany him. The accused walked along with the girl for some distance before bundling her into an autorickshaw and taking her to Aarey Colony. When the girl did not return, her mother got worried and searched for her frantically before approaching the Kurla police and registering a case of kidnapping. Meanwhile, the accused took the girl to unit no. 32 in Aarey and allegedly sexually abused her around 10.30pm. The girl raised an alarm and tried to fight back.

---||Hyderabad||After suspending Covaxin trials, Brazil closes EUA request||HYDERABAD: After suspending the clinical trials of Covaxin following the termination of Bharat Biotech’s MoU with its Brazilian partner Precisa Medicamentos, Brazil’s health regulator Anvisa (Agencia Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitaria) has now closed the emergency use authorisation (EUA) request for the Indian vaccine as well. Anvisa said it decided to close the process that dealt with the temporary authorisation of emergency use of Covaxin without evaluating its merits after Bharat Biotech informed it that Precisa is no longer authorised to represent the company in Brazil. “The Collegiate Board of the National Health Surveillance Agency unanimously decided…to close the process that dealt with the temporary authorization of emergency use, on an experimental basis, of the Covaxin vaccine. The process will be closed without evaluating the merits of the request for temporary authorisation for emergency use, on an experimental basis, filed by the company Necessidade Comercialização de Medicamentos Ltda on June 29 this year,” read a loosely translated version of the notice put up on Anvisa’s website. According to Anvisa, Director Meiruze Freitas, rapporteur of the process, highlighted in the vote that “the disruption of the commercial relationship between the companies, as well as the decay of a fundamental requirement for the Authorization of Emergency Use, implies impediment to the maintenance and continuity of the evaluation of the request. Since it is anchored in the principle of efficiency, going ahead with a technical evaluation of an already administratively corrupted petition would imply a significant waste of the administration's efforts and resources.” Anvisa had suspended the proposed Phase-3 clinical trials of Covaxin, which were to be conducted on around 4,500 volunteers, over the weekend. However, Bharat Biotech had said that it would continue to work with Anvisa to complete the regulatory approval process for Covaxin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-suspending-covaxin-trials-brazil-closes-eua-request/articleshow/84808285.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Kitex group CMD Sabu M Jacob said the inspection went against the government’s policy on inspections. “Two weeks ago, the industry minister had said there would be no more surprise inspections in factories. He had said a high-level team of officials would coordinate inspection of various departments through a single-window facility. But, the surprise inspection at Kitex was carried out by groundwater authority under the water resources department. This shows that the promises made by the government and ministers will not materialize,” he said. Recently, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh had invited Kitex to invest in their countries when the firm had announced that it was withdrawing its investment plans in Kerala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/surprise-check-at-kitex-by-water-dept/articleshow/84805946.cms||Shenoy Karun

The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has converted the open space adjacent to its indoor fish market into a ‘mini Bhandewadi’, allege shopkeepers and residents from quarters housing over 200 families nearby. Even though the garbage dumping problem remains unaddressed for years and has only aggravated, the latest dengue scare has residents and commercial establishments more worried. Mushaib Ansari, who runs a biryani centre at Mangalwari Complex, said government employees residing in quarters are fearful of raising their voice against the garbage dumping. “We approached elected representatives and also filed several complaints to the NMC. But no action has been taken. I have suffered from dengue. People keep falling ill in this area because of unhygienic conditions. Some have even vacated the quarters and left after their children frequently fell ill,” he claimed. Ansari said beside residents, visitors to religious places, educational institutes and many private offices also have to bear the nuisance. In East Shankar Nagar, incomplete underground electric cable-laying work has become hotspot for mosquitoes. Activist Akshay Samarth has started a signature campaign regarding the hazards from the incomplete works. “Portion of a playground in Dandige Nagar under prabhag 15 has been converted into a dump yard. Also, the incomplete works have led to water contamination. People in the area are suffering from dengue and other diseases,” he alleged. A TOI staff highlighted mosquito breeding on an open plot in Narendra Nagar a couple of weeks ago, but no action by the authorities. Some citizens had been tagging the NMC on Twitter with the sorry state of affairs regarding health and sanitation. “This is the upcoming garbage dump behind WCL Colony in Uppalwadi. Everyone from NMC staff, fish sellers to nearby residents deposit trash here. It is breeding ground for mosquitoes this dengue season. Request NMC to please ensure safety of its citizens,” reads a tweet posted on July 19. With the month’s dengue tally rising to 162 till date, citizens are now worried of falling ill despite no fault of theirs. NMC’s malaria and filaria officer Dr Dipali Nasare said spraying larvicide, putting oil and releasing gappi fish in known spots of water contamination is going on. “I am yet to get zone-wise report on breeding spots in the city,” she said. Dr Gajendra Mahalle, who is holding the charge of solid waste management, said he would check the garbage piling in localities and get them removed. Meanwhile, divisional commissioner Prajata Lavangare-Verma instructed officials to survey each home where dengue patients have been found. The district has recorded 374 dengue patients, including 162 from city, this year. As per district information office, many children are among those affected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/several-dengue-hotspots-in-city-yet-no-action-by-nmc/articleshow/84805984.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||India||SC cites ‘value to personal liberty’ grants bail to accused in Bhanwari Devi murder case||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday frowned at the long pendency of trial in cases investigated by the CBI and said the central agency has not been able to complete prosecution evidence despite lapse of years in many cases. A bench of Justices Sanjay K Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy said the track record of the CBI in expeditious completion of prosecution evidence is not so good. "There is a value to personal liberty. We cannot keep everyone behind bars for all the time that the CBI would take to complete a trial," it said. Releasing an accused in the 2011 abduction and murder of a nurse in the Rajasthan health department, Bhanwari Devi — allegedly at the behest of then state minister Mahipal Maderna — the bench said, "The matter is no doubt serious. But the accused Paras Ram Bishnoi is in jail as an undertrial for the last eight and a half years. What will happen if he gets discharged at the end of the trial? Will the prosecution be able to compensate him?" Times ViewThe Supreme Court has correctly underlined the importance of personal liberty. The onus is on prosecution agencies to build their case within a decent time frame. Delay cannot be indefinite and the process can’t become the punishment.Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, appearing for Bishnoi, had said that the prosecution evidence is now complete and that the accused does not want to lead any evidence in defence. For the CBI, additional solicitor general S V Raju said if one is released on bail, then all others except one would take the same plea — not examining defence witnesses — to seek bail in a heinous offence punishable with life term. Justice Kaul narrated his "not so good" experience with the pace of trial in special CBI courts in Delhi. "We do not have a good experience with special CBI courts. The CBI's prosecutors many a time do not even have the files to argue the cases." In its order, the bench said, "We have no doubt that the matter in issue is a serious one and the offence is also heinous. However, we are faced with a position where the appellant, amongst other accused, has been in custody for eight and a half years. The prosecution evidence is over and so as also the statement to be recorded of all the accused under Section 313 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The appellant before us has already made a statement through the counsel that he does not propose to lead any defence evidence." "Thus, insofar as the appellant before us is concerned, the case is ready for hearing. However, in view of the large number of accused in the case, that is not the position for all the accused as some of the accused seek to lead defence evidence. On consideration of the matter, we are of the view that pending the trial, we cannot keep a person in custody for an indefinite period of time and taking into consideration the period of custody and that the other accused are yet to lead defence evidence while the appellant has already stated he does not propose to lead any evidence, we are inclined to grant bail to the appellant on terms and conditions to the satisfaction of the trial court," it ordered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-cites-value-to-personal-liberty-grants-bail-to-accused-in-bhanwari-devi-murder-case/articleshow/84810949.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The complainant, who is into fabrication and construction-related business, told TOI, “I had downloaded a business application on my cellphone in 2018 to look for business opportunities. I received a few messages from people who wanted to collaborate with others to develop their business. One of these messages was related to oil seeds and oil products having ayurvedic properties.” “The suspects had shared their contact details on the business application. Their phone numbers suggested that they were registered in England. I called on these numbers and we decided to hold a meeting to discuss business plans,” he said. “Two men held a meeting with me in Pune. They told me that there was a huge profit margin in oil seeds and related products and promised me handsome returns on investment. I agreed and transferred money to their bank accounts,” he said. “I have given six names to the police, but all the names have turned out to be fake,” he said. Inspector Ankush Chintaman of the cyber police said, “The suspects just routed their calls from various servers to pretend as if they were in England. The businessman transferred money to the bank accounts operated by these suspects with various private banks. Barring initial consignment of some oil seeds, the suspects did not send any oil seeds and oil products to the businessman.” The police have registered a case of cheating and criminal breach of trust and invoked provisions under the Information Technology Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/conmen-dupe-bizman-of-rs-1-24cr-in-online-scam/articleshow/84807514.cms||Gitesh Shelke

Under the Smart City Project, sporting facilities at AU would be given the much-needed fillip for which the authorities would be spending an amount over Rs 11 crore. Following a tender floated by Smart City authorities, the AU campus (especially the Science faculty) would have facilities like synthetic tennis, basketball and volleyball court besides synthetic athletic track, enhanced pathway, solar lighting, facility of proper drainage of rainwater from sporting courts etc. Commenting on the issue, divisional commissioner Sanjay Goyal told TOI, “As part of our efforts to provide top-class sporting facilities in Prayagraj smart city, we have decided to significantly upgrade available facilities for different sports like basketball, football, hockey, volleyball and athletics among others on Allahabad University campus. We have invited tenders for undertaking the necessary infrastructural development projects for this which would give a huge impetus to sporting facilities on AU campus and in the long run, help the university to produce world-class sportspersons who can earn laurels for the country”. Goyal is also the CEO of the Smart City Project. Following the enhancement of the sporting facility, AU would be getting synthetic hockey turf and a synthetic court for football. There would be landscaping around the existing trees and seating area around the existing trees, paved area with suitable materials, classic style lamp posts to create harmony etc would also be done. The approaches to the sporting complex would be provided in four locations and there would also be a jogger track inside the AU campus. The existing Football court of AU would be redeveloped and prepared as per norms of FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association, which in English is called as International Federation of Association Football). Likewise, the existing Hockey ground would also be renovated with national-level facilities. A synthetic astroturf (8-layers) with proper drainage, shock pad and sprinkler arrangements will be provided as specified by Fédération Internationale de Hockey (FIH). Commenting on the ambitious project AU Vice Chancellor, Prof Sangita Srivastava told TOI, "These facilities would write a new chapter in terms of enhancing the sporting facilities in the AU's history for which I was in touch with administration for the past many months. I hope AU will regain it's lost glory in the sporting field after the facilities are put in place". An elevated press box for media coverage has been proposed for the national level tournaments. Changing rooms, toilets and conference rooms along with the other facilities have been planned for the hockey court. Along with this, the existing steps will be renovated with necessary civil work and stone cladding, sensibly chosen to match with the existing heritage structures, for the upliftment of the overall appearance. Besides, AU would also be getting a world-class volleyball court with 8 layers of synthetic acrylic surface as per the sports authority requirement. A revamped Basketball court, as per norms of FIBA is also on the cards. This will also be 8 layers of synthetic acrylic surface as specified by the International Basketball Federation i.e., Fédération Internationale de Basketball Amateur (FIBA). A synthetic Tennis court would also be constructed at AU.The existing masonry structure should be demolished and replaced with metal bleachers with wooden seating provisions. The northern part of the football field is enclosed with a low height wall with existing steps and an elevated Indo-Islamic style decorative pavilion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/smart-city-project-au-campus-to-get-a-facelift/articleshow/84805986.cms||---

The arrested suspects are related to a private company from Bhayander in Thane district, which has supplied 289 conservancy staff to the PCMC. “The PCMC had fixed a salary of Rs17,000 per month for each staff. However, the probe revealed that the company directors and office bearers would only pay Rs9,000 to the workers. They would extort the remaining sum. Since 2017, the company had forcibly taken least Rs8 crore of these workers,” Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said. The fraud came to the light when some women workers approached the commissioner and informed him about it. Following this, PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil issued orders to conduct an inquiry, which revealed the company’s involvement. As per PCMC rules, the workers’ salaries would be deposited in their bank accounts. “The arrested persons are not company employees but were appointed to extort money. They had forcibly taken debit cards of workers and would withdraw Rs8,000 from their accounts,” Krishna Prakash said. The police have recovered 31 debit cards from the suspects and are yet to arrest the directors of the firm. The police commissioner has appealed to the contract workers to come forward and inform the PCMC officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/seven-held-on-charge-of-cheating-extortion/articleshow/84807515.cms||---

In a video which went viral last week, accused Abdul Salam is heard threatening the boy and forcing him to use abuses for Hindu gods and goddesses, and say Allahu Akbar .The boy is seen pleading with folded hands and feeling threatened. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) member of National Assembly (MNA) Lal Chand Malhi said the video was posted on social media on Wednesday night and it went viral by Thursday morning, following which both the Hindu and Muslim representatives of Tharparkar district in Sindh province of Pakistan demanded immediate arrest of the “mischievous and anti-social element” who had brought disgrace to Hindu deities and disrupted communal harmony. “Tharparkar has a population of around 1.6 million with both Hindus and Muslims sharing almost equal number. This district is an example of interfaith harmony in Sindh,” said Malhi He said the preliminary investigation suggested that Salam was from Punjab province and worked as a driver with a mining company in Thar coal block I. “When he realised that police were chasing him, he tried to flee, but was arrested from the nearby Badin district with the help of his mobile location,” said the Pakistani lawmaker. Earlier also, Abdul had posted derogatory videos abusing Hindu deities on social media. “He had used highly disparaging words for Hindu gods and goddesses in his videos,” he said Malhi said a case under sections 295 A and 298 of Pakistan Penal Code had been registered at Mithi police station . “Police have begun investigation. We are hopeful of the case being taken to its logical conclusion,” said Malhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/pak-cops-nab-man-who-forced-hindu-boy-to-use-expletives-for-deities/articleshow/84808373.cms||Yudhvir Rana

The general administration department (GAD) issued orders in this regard on Monday and sent it to all department heads. The GAD orders stated, “State government noticed that it is believed in Section 17-A in The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, it is mandatory for a police officer or investigating agency to take permission from the state government. “But in the previous circulars issued by the government, it was clear that government did not issue any order wherein a police officer or investigating agency should have to take prior permission for investigation under the Section 17-A of the act,” it stated. “Rather in the circulars issued, the government just laid down the procedure of taking permission from the government wherein a police officer or investigating agency wants in such cases. With the motive to clear the wrong interpretation, the general administration department supersedes its circulars issued on December 26, 2020 and January 6, 2021. The government would reissue directions in this regard,” the GAD stated in its orders, a copy of which is with The TOI. The issue had become a bone of contention between Lokayukta and the government and the authorities had also communicated on the issue and a meeting was also held at the top level. The circular, dated December 26, 2020, came as a breather to scores of officials who were under the scanner, but it made work tougher for investigators. Many officials also called the circular ‘unprecedented’. However, to clear the misconception, the orders have been issued so that the cases of corruption against government employees can be investigated without any hindrance from the government, officials added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/no-govt-nod-for-graft-probe-against-officials/articleshow/84806020.cms||---

---||Meerut||Hindu man marching 200km on foot to SC to prove he hasn’t converted||MEERUT: It's a long and lonely journey through rain and seemingly endless stretches of deserted roads that stretch from Saharanpur in UP to the Supreme Court in Delhi for Praveen Kumar. The PhD scholar is covering a distance of over 200km on foot to reach the apex court with a petition to “reclaim his honour” after his name figured, inaccurately, on a list of thousand people allegedly converted to Islam by two Delhi-based Muslim clerics. While Kumar was given a clean chit by the UP Anti Terrorist Squad (ATS) that picked him up for questioning last month, those in his village of Shitla Kheda were unforgiving and relentless in their persecution of the distraught man. The self-proclaimed “Hindu nationalist” who has written books on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath has been facing social boycott and constant threats since his return home. “I want the country to know what I am going through,” he told TOI on Wednesday, days after he woke up to find "terrorist" written on his door. “Go to Pakistan,” the message warned him. On Tuesday, Kumar, a cane officer at a sugar mill, embarked on his “protest march” with little more than a backpack filled with essentials and blessings of his family. By Wednesday evening, Kumar had walked 32 km and crossed Rohana toll plaza in Muzaffarnagar. He will spend the night at a railway station before starting again at dawn. The 32-year-old hopes to complete his journey in 11 days. “I want the apex court to clear my name. I hope things will change after that,” he said. The ATS had knocked on Kumar’s door on June 23, looking for ‘Abdul Samad’ after the leaked list of alleged converts had a certificate with Kumar’s picture and information on it. It said that Kumar had converted to Islam and was now Samad. The case being pursued is against the chairperson of Islamic Da’wah Centre (IDC) Mufti Kazi Jahangir Qasmi and Mohammed Umar Gautam. Their names allegedly came up during interrogation of two men accused in another case — an alleged "assassination plot" against Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati, head priest of the Dasna Devi temple in Ghaziabad where a Muslim boy was beaten up after he entered the premises to drink water.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Ahead of third wave, experts split over efficacy of Covid vaccines||KOLKATA: Even as the supply of Covaxin has been down to a trickle in recent weeks, making thousands of second-dose recipients wait for their jabs, experts and doctors remain divided in their opinion on the relative merits and disadvantages of the two major vaccines even as a third wave looms. While some argue that Covaxin will now be a better bet since it could be partially effective against mutated strains — which are likely to be active during the third wave — others claim that Covishield can fight the spike protein, the most damaging part of Coronavirus, better than Covaxin. The latter, they say, has not yet proved its effectiveness against other strains or even other proteins of Coronavirus. Covishield replicates only the Covid spike protein and is modified to resemble a Coronavirus, attached to a weakened adenovirus and injected. Covaxin uses a dead Coronavirus in its entirety. “The human system reacts to them in a very similar way and generates antibodies. It is wrong to say that Covaxin generates better resistance since it is designed to act against all the four viral proteins, including the spike protein,” said a professor of the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research (IPGMER), Diptendra Sarkar who called the Covishield-Covaxin controversy “needless”. The spike protein is the most prominent part of the virus and Covishield is designed to act only against it, which, it can recognize and fight off, explained Sarkar. The spike protein of coronavirus, Sarkar added, is almost 40% of the size of the ordinary influenza virus. CMRI Hospital pulmonology director Raja Dhar pointed to a recent study that claimed Covishield may provide life-long immunity. “While there is little to choose between the two, available data doesn’t show that Covaxin acts better against the non-spike proteins of Coronavirus or that it resists the variants,” said Dhar. “Covishield neutralizes the spike protein only while Covaxin provides secondary immunity against the other viral proteins as well,” said Peerless Hospital microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri. “So, it could be more effective against the mutated strains. The third wave is likely to be dominated by the mutants and Covaxin will definitely offer more resistance, certainly more than Covishield. That doesn’t, however, mean that Covishield is ineffective. Any vaccine is a good protection,” Chaudhuri added. The immunity induced by Covaxin is likely to be more robust, especially against variants, said Belle Vue Clinic internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain. “All the antigens of the virus enter the body inducing a gallery of antibodies that are more likely to be more durable. In case of only spike protein antigen, as in Covishield, if there is spike protein mutation, the antibodies may not be fully protective,” Jain said. Sarkar, on the other hand, argued that antibodies generated by Covaxin against the other three Coronavirus proteins don’t last long.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ahead-of-third-wave-experts-split-over-efficacy-of-covid-vaccines/articleshow/84806010.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Locals said that many non-functioning laterite stone quarries are filled with rain water and have turned unsafe for people as they do not have fencing. In Bicholim, there are about 30 laterite stone quarries in Mayem, Maulinguem-Kudchirem, Amthane, Usap, Latambarcem, Karapur, Nanora, Ladfe and other villages. Locals said that during monsoon, state administrative authorities like mines and geological department or panchayats don’t maitain a watch and no remedial measures have been taken. In August 2020, a 10-year-old child had died after accidentally falling into an open laterite stone mine in Latambarcem. In 2019, a school student drowned in a laterite stone quarry at Tuem in Pernem. After these incidents, the North Goa collectorate had issued orders directing respective mamlatdars to adopt safety measures. Following this order, Bicholim mamlatdar along with PWD officials had conducted a survey of such mines and had erected signboards directing the authorities concerned to erect fencing. However, it has been found that most of the functioning and non-functioning mines do not have fencing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bicholims-stone-quarries-pose-threat-to-residents/articleshow/84806019.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The suspect, Yogesh Tiwari, operated through his Instagram page that had over a lakh followers. The cops started tracking.the suspect after receiving a complaint from a woman on July 22. The victim stated in her complaint that she saw an advertisement on Instagram page of an online mobile shop named Foneofy, which was selling iPhone 12Pro at Rs 25,000 while other e-commerce sites were selling it at over Rs 1.2 lakh. She contacted Foneofy on Instagram and over WhatsApp and provided her postal address for courier and also made a payment of Rs 24,290 in the account of Foneofy through an online gateway. After waiting for several days, she again contacted Foneofy and found that she had been blocked on Instagram and WhatsApp. “An FIR was registered on the basis of the complaint and a team led by sub-inspectors Rohit Saraswat and Rohit Bhardwaj was formed to crack the case,” DCP (north) Anto Alphonse said. The cops found that the WhatsApp number of Foneofy was located in Faridabad. Details of the online payment were also studied. During the investigation, the cops came across a video on YouTube— uploaded by a Chennai resident —which aided in their probe. “The accused was apprehended from Faridabad. Four mobile phones, nine SIM cards and a motorcycle were recovered from him,” the DCP added. Earlier, the accused used to buy Chinese iPhone from Gaffar Market and was sending them to people. Later, he stopped even sending mobile phones. The accused revealed that he had bought a lot of followers on Instagram to gain trust of online shoppers. During interrogation, he also confessed about cheating people from different states using this modus operandi.

---||Meerut||Day 2 of strike by ambulance staffers leaves patients in lurch across Uttar Pradesh, pregnant women worst hit||MEERUT: People in need of emergency health care across Uttar Pradesh, especially the pregnant women going into labour, had a harrowing time as most government-run ambulances remained off the road for the second day in a row on Tuesday due to the indefinite strike called by the union. The strike was called after the UP government decided to give the contract to run ambulances to a new firm, which, according to the union, is giving less wages to staffers, is demanding a draft of security before hiring the existing employees and has put several other riders in contract. Over 19,000 ambulance workers continued their strike, leaving around 4,600 ambulances stranded in 75 districts. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed strict action if any needy person doesn't get the ambulance service. He tweeted, “UP government is committed to provide quality health facilities to the people of the state. It should be ensured that the ambulance service is provided on time to the needy. If this does not happen, then strict action should be taken against the concerned ambulance provider.” The private firm, GVK EMRI -- which manages 108 and 112 ambulance services in UP-- filed an FIR on Tuesday against union leaders and terminated over 20 staffers across UP. 108 is emergency ambulance while 102 is for maternity facility. Sharad Yadav, one of the union leaders of ambulance staffers whose name is in the FIR in Lucknow’s Ashiyana police station, told TOI that the government has given the contract to run ambulances to a new firm, Ziqitza Gulf Medical Response and Ambulance Services (Ziqitza), after which the jobs of 19,000 staffers hired by GVK EMRI is under a threat. FIR has also been filed against Hanuman Pandey, the president of UP ambulance workers association, under Epidemic and Diseases Act, 1897 and under Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA). The complaint was filed by VSK Reddy, senior vice president GVK EMRI. A meeting between ambulance association members and Mission director (MD) of National Health Mission (NHM) Aparna U remained inconclusive on Monday night. “We all have been working for the government since 2012. We have worked even amid pandemic. This is what we are getting in return. We are all experienced, why we are not being hired again. Government must ensure that even if the new firm takes over, we don’t lose our jobs,” union leader Pandey told TOI on Monday. The government should promise that there would be no salary cuts even if the company running the services is changed, Pandey has said. Just four to five ambulances are working in each district of UP so that the cases of extreme emergency are taken care of. Subhas Kumar who took his wife Vineet to medical college in Meerut after she fell on the floor, had to take her back in public transport as a private ambulance asked Rs 5,000. “We came in a government ambulance when she met with the accident. But when she was discharged, there was no ambulance. Private one asked for Rs 5,000 and I had no money which is why I am taking her back in e-rickshaw and bus,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/day-2-of-strike-by-ambulance-staffers-leaves-patients-in-lurch-across-up-pregnant-women-worst-hit/articleshow/84803608.cms||---

The minister, while replying to the questions raised by opposition members Mathew Kuzhalnadan, Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan, PT Thomas and CR Mahesh, said the notification inviting applications to the post on a temporary basis was called without diluting the qualification. “The qualification was only broadened for the posting on deputation. No omission has been made,” she said. Meanwhile, Kerala University senate member Joyil John Joseph petitioned governor Arif Mohammed Khan demanding the removal of the lexicon editor. He alleged that Poornima was appointed as the lexicon editor under the influence of her spouse, R Mohan, a former income tax officer who is currently working as the officer on special duty at the CM’s office. The petitioner has also sought action against the university registrar who issued the notification, which allegedly was not in sync with the provisions in the university ordinance. University authorities have already justified her appointment on the ground that Poornima being a multi-linguistic expert has the academic capabilities to discharge the duties of Malayalam lexicon editor. Moreover, the university was taking steps to scout for a more-suitable candidate to be appointed as the editor on a permanent basis, varsity authorities had claimed. Course ban lifted temporarily:The minister informed the assembly that the government has temporarily lifted the ban on universities, other than the newly set up Sreenarayanaguru Open University, for conducting distance education courses in Kerala. The government issued orders permitting all state universities to offer distance education courses until Sreenarayanaguru Open University gets requisite permission from UGC for offering distance education courses. As per the rule 72(1) of the Sreenarayana Open University Act, no other university in Kerala should offer distance education courses ever since the act came into effect on September 25, 2020. However, Covid restrictions hampered the open university’s process to gain clearance for its courses and hence the government has decided to grant permission to Kerala, MG, Calicut and Kannur universities to offer distance education until further orders. But, opposition leader VD Satheesan criticised the government for overriding the provisions in the University Act through an executive order. “This is an insult to the House. Only the House has the right to make changes in the provisions in the Act passed by it,” he said. The minister defended the government’s action. She said the changes in the Act have been carried out as per Rule 63 of the Act, which permits changes in the provisions included in the Act in order to remove hurdles. Opposition leaders claimed that the executive order did misinterpret Rule 63. Unless the government makes an amendment in Rule 72 (1) of the Act, no other university would be able to offer distance education courses, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/no-violation-in-appointing-lexicon-editor-says-min/articleshow/84806099.cms||---

He had lost one eye during childhood and had vision only in one. But all hell broke loose on this 69-year-old when Cyclone Tauktae struck Gujarat coast in May. While working in the farm, some sharp metallic pieces flew due to strong winds and pierced Savaliya’s working eye. The family lost all hope and the old farmer was staring at life-long blindness. However, a complicated surgery done in Ahmedabad hospital has proved to be nothing short of a miracle for him.Dr Parth Rana of Netralaya Hospital, who performed the surgery, told TOI: His cornea was torn and had vitreous hemorrhage along with traumatic cataract. The situation was very delicate and three doctors were required for as many surgeries as multiple parts of Savaliya’s eye were damaged.”The surgery was performed using 3-D technology that enables doctors to see the eye and interiors almost 100 times magnified. On July 26, doctors declared that his vision had returned to normal after two months of observation.Dr. Rana said, “Such surgeries are not rare but difficult. Due to 3-D technology, it could be performed in a single sitting. We are gad that he has regained vision.” Savaliya said, “I thought I would go completely blind. But it’s a miracle that I can see again. We had first gone to Amreli, then Dhandhuka and finally came to Ahmedabad for treatment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/man-regains-vision-lost-in-cyclone/articleshow/84803659.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

With the ‘bio bubble’ system of a residence for workers and employers at the work site turning out to be burdensome, the focus is now to fully vaccinate the work force of all types of industries. According to a survey done by the joint director of industries, around 55.75% of cluster workers have either taken the first dose or have been vaccinated. In the large industries the figure is 65%. “The administration is now focussing on ensuring the left out segment is also vaccinated before the anticipated third wave,” said AP Dharmadhikari, the joint director. Apart from starting vaccination centres near industrial clusters or zones in consultation with the local administration, Verma is learnt to be insisting on large industries diverting corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds towards vaccinating labourers. With the government allotting 25% vaccine to the private health sector, Verma has appealed to the big industrial houses to get the labourers vaccinated before starting full-fledged manufacturing. “We have already issued them the standard operating procedure (SOP) for the industrial sectors and are now focussing on the vaccination,” said Verma. Another plan mooted is a dedicated transport system from residence of workers to industry. Following last week’s instructions to divisional commissioners and collectors by the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, initiatives have started across the state to revive economic activities.

---||Bhopal||Buxwah activists take up cudgels against politicians||BHOPAL: To protest against felling of 2.5 lakh trees for a diamond mining project in Buxwah, activists have lodged a complaint with the superintendent of police of Chhatarpur against mining minister Brajendra Pratap Singh and MLA from Bada Malhera Pradhyuman Singh for ‘issuing threats to activists, using objectionable remarks against them and violating Corona guidelines by holding meeting and assembling crowd’ in Buxwah. A group of activists had also taken out a cycle rally from Chhatarpur to Buxwah to create awareness regarding chopping of trees, linking such acts with droughts of Bundelkhand. They also urged the Centre to recognize the significance of the rock paintings of Buxwah and conserve these precious sites. Criticising the politicians, one of the activists, Amit Bhatnagar, alleged that on June 30, they held a meeting in Buxwah and talked about the “ benefits of tree felling.” He also alleged that while conducting the programme, the politicians blatantly violated the Covid norms. “They made threatening and objectionable remarks against us,” said Bhatnagar. The activists also submitted a memorandum to the SP on Monday. Ever since the news of proposed felling of 2.5 lakh trees for a diamond project in Buxwah spread, widespread protests have been taking place across the district on various platforms. The government has, however, denied that all the trees would be cut together. The government has also said that it would ensure adequate plantation in lieu of the trees cut.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/buxwah-activists-take-up-cudgels-against-politicians/articleshow/84806054.cms||---
---||Kolkata||After over 2 months, 100 take-offs from Kolkata twice in July||KOLKATA: The number of departing flights from Kolkata airport has touched the 100-mark twice this month after a gap of nearly three months, courtesy a nod from Centre to increase the percentage of flights in a sector as well as an exponential rise in domestic business and family travel. On July 23, 101 flights departed from Kolkata with 9,869 passengers, clocking a net movement of 19,600-odd passengers. This was for the second time in this month that the number of departing flights in a day crossed 100 since April 30 when 113 flights had departed from Kolkata. On July 16, 108 flights had departed from Kolkata, carrying 11,656 passengers — a significant jump due to Eid in the following week. “These are good signs for the airport as well as the aviation industry. We have been informed that the number of flights will increase further in the coming days and we have been making adequate changes to handle the excess passengers. However, utmost stress is being given on sanitization and cleaning along with the maintenance of social distancing,” said a senior official of the Kolkata airport. Earlier this month, the ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) increased the capacity of domestic flights to 65% from 50% of pre-Covid times. The order dated July 5 reads: “After a review of the current status of scheduled domestic operations viz-a-viz passenger demand for air travel in terms of the purpose specified in the initial order no 01/2020 dated 21.05.2020… 50% capacity may be read as 65% capacity.” Airline officials said that the current number is still lower than the allotted percentage of flights by the MoCA and that more flights will be added over the next one week. “The allotted quota is still unutilized and by next week, there can be a rise of anything between 25 to 30 departing flights per day at the airport as compared with this week,” said an airline official in Kolkata. TOI had reported on July 9 how the decline in Covid cases, the easing of restrictions and the removal of mandatory RT-PCR tests by several states helped in revival of traffic at Kolkata airport after two difficult months when both arrival and departure figures had come down to a trickle. From less than 6,000 passengers a day in May end, the number has gone up to around 20,000 a day since the beginning of this month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-over-2-mnths-100-take-offs-from-city-twice-in-july/articleshow/84806079.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Allahabad||‘Dona & pattal’ bowl/plates made by these women see high demand||Prayagraj: In the Amahta Sawaiya villages of the Pratapgarh district, a group of rural women are working tirelessly to shape "Dona and Pattal" (bowl and plate made up of Sal or Banyan tree leaves) with the help of automatic machines. The group of 11 women, led by Pushpa and associated with a single self-help group (SHGs) of Shivgrah block are manufacturing eco-friendly anywhere between 200 to 400 "Dona and Pattal" plates every day.Interestingly, the fine branded plates have seen buyers not only from UP but also from the neighbouring states. Moreover, demand for the plates has increased in the rural belt across the state.Ratan Mishra, district mission manager (Pratapgarh), told TOI, “A group of 11 women started working to manufacture ‘Dona and Pattal’ plates from April month of this year after investing around Rs 1.5 lakh. They purchased semi-automatic machines and are now earning Rs 8,000 per month.” He further added, "We have organised a weeklong maiden training camp of "Dona and Pattal’ making for women in Amahta Sawaiya village where women are taught the entire process of making the plates with machines." The move was initiated under the UP State Rural Livelihood Mission (UPSRLM) and was also aimed at facilitating the financial independence of rural women associated with the self-help group.He, however, said the "Dona and Pattal" making project started yielding good results since its installation of machines when women group started receiving orders from the local markets of Pratapgarh and neighbouring districts like Sultanpur and Jaunpur.Currently, women are making all kinds and different shapes of ‘Dona and Pattal’ plates as per the requirement of the markets and dispatching the consignments. Kavita, a woman, said that the ‘Dona and Pattal’ plates are eco-friendly and can be easily discarded after use." She added, “Not only is it made of plants leaves, but it also doesn’t harm our ecosystem.”She further said that demand for "Dona and Pattal" plates have increased manifold during local fairs as well as big religious gatherings like Kumbh or Ardh Kumbh where plastic and thermocol articles were completely banned”.Laxmi, another woman, said, "People have become quite aware of environment protection and they ask for better and fine shaped "Dona and Pattal" as it serves various kinds of food during the events. She said that government agencies must promote natural products like 'Dona and Pattals' which are environment friendly."Moreover, women groups were also engaged in making ‘Phoolbati’ at Parashramour village under Mangraura block of the same district and more rural women are getting attracted towards this enterprise of "Phoolbati" manufacturing. UPSRLM officials claimed that women are being imparted training for making ‘Dona and Pattal’, murtis and "Phoolbati" with an objective to create self-employment as well as empower women in the rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/dona-pattal-bowl/plates-made-by-these-women-see-high-demand/articleshow/84806064.cms||---
---||Mumbai||It’s the pits! BMC spent Rs 21k crore on roads in 24 years, shows RTI||MUMBAI: The BMC has spent more than Rs 21,000 crore on the repair, maintenance and construction of new roads in little over two decades, showed the civic body’s data in reply to a Right to Information (RTI) application. The data further showed the maximum money—Rs 3,201 crore—was spent between 2013 and 2014. Immediately thereafter, in 2015, the road scam had come to light, raising questions over the expenditure. TimesViewHumungous amounts spent on road works in Mumbai shows it is a money guzzling racket. The cash-rich corporation allocates a huge budget running into hundreds of crores a year to repair and augment the road network. It also has in-house expertise; an engineering department with an army of qualified engineers. Despite these resources, Mumbai’s roads are in a shambles. The BMC must be pressured to appoint an independent audit team to check the works.Taking note of TOI’s July 27 report on potholes, Andheri MLA Ameet Satam said this January, the BMC said its road department had spent more than Rs 21,000 crore since 1997, in reply given to his RTI plea seeking details about it. “Bad roads are among the most pressing problems in this city, yet their condition has not changed for decades. There are multiple reasons for this, one being lack of coordination between multiple utility agencies and the BMC. So, when a road is newly made, the very next year it is dug for laying of cables. Another problem is that no major road construction company comes forward to take up works as the tender size is very small for them (anywhere between Rs 1 crore and Rs 6 crore). Secondly, they are hesitant as they feel they may have to grease palms at multiple levels,” said Satam. Data from the BMC’s pothole complaints website shows their numbers have risen to 437 now compared with 315 in 2020. Dhaval Shah of Andheri Lokhandwala Residents’ Association said citizens need not have to complain about potholes. “The civic body has its ward level teams that are expected to move around. They should ensure that a pothole or any bad road patch in their ward is filled once they notice it,” he said. Experts called it a vicious circle as they said one, adequate quality checks are not done when a road is repaired, two, no one demands best quality work for the enormous amount of money spent, and three, traffic is only growing, putting greater load on city roads, which go on to develop potholes or uneven patches in a few years after repairs. IIT-Bombay professor Pradipta Banerji, a structural engineer, said ensuring quality control is key. “For this, one needs to be competent enough to understand the quality of work done. Another problem is the huge vehicle load, as a result of which road work does not stay intact for many years. In a city like ours, traffic is always moving. For good road works, traffic needs to be halted. If the authorities do that, motorists may complain. Hence, I say, it’s a vicious circle.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-its-the-pits-bmc-spent-rs-21k-cr-on-roads-in-24-yrs-shows-rti/articleshow/84804284.cms||Richa Pinto

Roads were blocked and police and PAC teams were chased by locals. On Tuesday morning, about 12 hours after the suicide, five policemen, including the station house officer (SHO) of Binoli, were booked for rioting and abetment to suicide. Another 11 were taken off duty and sent to police lines. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath condoled the youth’s death and announced an ex-gratia of Rs 5 Lakh for his family. According to the family, the row started during a vaccination drive on Monday afternoon. The youth, Akshay ,wanted his mom, 65, to be given priority considering her age. It led to an argument with a policeman posted there, who slapped Akshay. “My son was at the vaccination camp when his name was called by the staff. When he tried to enter, two policemen started abusing him and stopped him from going inside. They then took him inside another room and started beating him. All this happened in front of me and my brother. We tried to save my son but couldn't,” said Akshay's father Shree Nivas, who is block head of RSS in Baghpat. Shree Nivas added, “Later, SHO of Binoli, Chandrakant Pandey, along with policemen Musli, Saleem, Udham Singh and one more arrived at my house. They ransacked the house, misbehaved and thrashed my wife Kusum. My son left the house soon after that. Later his body was found hanging from a tree in the village.” As the word of his death spread, the entire village surrounded Binoli police station. Heavy police force was sent to the village along with a PAC unit, but villagers chased them away. The body was cremated on Tuesday morning only after senior officers, including SP Bagpat Abhishek Singh, reached there and ordered an FIR against the accused cops. “We have booked five policemen, including the SHO, under sections 147 (rioting), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 306 (abetment to suicide) etc. Also, 11 policemen have been attached to police lines,” the SP said. Sooraj Pal Singh, district president of BJP, said that the chief minister has announced compensation of Rs 5lakh for the family. “We will ensure that the guilty are booked and suspended. We will also ask the government to help the family in all possible ways,” added Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/fir-against-5-cops-as-man-hangs-self-after-police-beating-at-vax-centre/articleshow/84803696.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Kolkata||Trial of third vaccine nears end in Kolkata; results encouraging||KOLKATA: A trial for an Indian version of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine — which is nearing completion at Peerless Hospital — has found “good immunogenic qualities that may outstrip those of other vaccines now being used.” Researchers at Peerless hope to have all the data on the vaccine prepared by August 10. It should be ready for a commercial roll-out in September-October, provided that all the mandatory clearances are secured, said a representative of the Hyderabad-based Hetero Group that will manufacture the vaccine and has commissioned trials across the country, including at Peerless in Kolkata. While Sputnik V is now imported by Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, this will be for the first time that the vaccine is going to be manufactured outside Russia. According to the research team, local availability will help to ease the frequent shortage of vaccines in Bengal and the rest of the country. The vaccine is a replica of the Sputnik V Russian vaccine and the trial, a multi-centric phase — III study, started at Peerless on June 23. Thirty-two people took part in the trial. They received the Russian and Indian Sputnik V in a 1:3 ratio. “The results have been extremely encouraging. Our version has been found to have good immunogenicity that could be more effective than the Indian vaccines we now have. It is modelled on the Russian version with certain modifications,” said Peerless Hospital clinical research director, Subhrojyoti Bhowmik. “The clinical study results will be referred to the designated subject expert committee (SEC). After a positive nod by the SEC, Central Drugs Standard Control Organization takes it up for review of the manufacturing data and then provides a manufacturing and marketing authorization,” said Hetero Group medical director, Shubhadeep Sinha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/trial-of-3rd-vaccine-nears-end-in-city-results-encouraging/articleshow/84806104.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Goa||Three-day session meant to escape debate, says Goa Forward Party president Vijai Sardesai||MARGAO: President of Goa Forward Party (GFP) Vijai Sardesai on Tuesday said that the three-day assembly session that begins from Wednesday was a “farce” played by the government to divert people’s attention from more serious issues like loss of lives owing to Covid mismanagement and flood-induced damages. “Tokenism of a three-day assembly session is a fraud by the government. The government is allergic to democracy; it wants no dissent or debate which is the fuel of democracy,” Sardesai said and charged the government with committing “murder of democracy right in front of our eyes.” Criticising the government for having a debate with the Delhi government over power, instead of agreeing to the demand to hold a full-fledged assembly session, Sardesai accused the government of “manipulating procedures to escape questioning in the name of Covid.” He also criticised the government for turning the BJP national president J P Nadda’s visit into a gala event. “These two events that have happened are a systematic conspiracy to undermine the legislative assembly of Goa by diverting the attention of the people from the misdemeanours of the government. The two events are orchestrated to subdue uncomfortable assembly proceedings,” he said. Sardesai further termed the AAP-BJP debate a “joint venture” between the two parties. “For both these parties, oxygen-related Covid deaths and floods are no issues,” he said. He further said that if his party MLA becomes a power minister in the next government, Goans would get highly subsidised green energy, and that the use of energy derived from burning of fossil fuel will be discontinued. “We will set up solar farms across many places in Goa. Government has lakhs and crores of sq m of land in Goa (for setting up such projects). We will give huge subsidies to erect solar plants. We will make it compulsory for industries to use solar power, but at the same time we will do away with the use of fossil fuel, which means no coal. To make Goa healthier we have to ban coal,” Sardesai said at a press conference. He accused the government with bulldozing with the three linear Centre-sponsored projects despite the SC-appointed Central Empowered Committee to stop Railway’s double tracking project. He also slammed the government on increase in crimes, “declining” economic condition, and unemployment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/three-day-session-meant-to-escape-debate-sardesai/articleshow/84806090.cms||---

---||Noida||Gang trafficking Rohingya women, kids to NCR busted||Lucknow: A Bangladeshi national and two of his Rohingya associates were arrested from Ghaziabad railway station on Tuesday on charges of human trafficking. A team of the anti-terrorist squad (ATS) of UP Police also rescued two girls from Myanmar — aged 16 and 18 — and sent them to a shelter home in Lucknow. The accused have been identified as Mohammed Noor, Rehmatullah and Shabiullah. The trio was not just involved in trafficking of women and children from Bangladesh and Myanmar, but allegedly smuggled gold into India and helped people sneak into the country with forged documents. The ATS is looking for a fourth member of the gang, who is believed to be hiding in Hyderabad. The three accused were picked up from the Brahmaputra Mail, which was on its way to Delhi from Assam. Bundles of Bangladeshi currency and forged documents, including a photocopy of cards issued by the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees, were recovered from them. “Mohammed Noor is from Bangladesh and leader of the gang while Rehmatullah and Shabiullah are Rohingya. The gang members were involved in human trafficking and gold smuggling and also helped other refugees sneak into the country through various channels,” said ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar. Noor, according to police, would lure the men with the promise of jobs in factories. They would promise to find suitable matches for the women in India, but would eventually sell them off to clients. “They would illegally enter India and secure jobs as labourers in factories,” Kumar said. “The trio had prepared fake Indian certificates for the men so that they got jobs easily. The women were trafficked,” the officer added. Sources said the gang members were on their way to Delhi in the express train. They had allegedly wanted to take the women to Jammu. The ATS had been working on inputs about human trafficking for some time. GK Goswamy, IG, ATS, said that after a tip-off, they had put the gang members under electronic surveillance and were waiting at Ghaziabad railway station on Tuesday for the train to arrive. Sources said Noor and the others had boarded the train from Kamakhya in Assam. “We arrested three of the accused and rescued the two girls. The girls were sent to Asha Jyoti Kendra in Lucknow. We will question them later,” Goswamy said. According to ATS sources privy to the investigation, Noor had been living in the state illegally since 2012. The girls had been told their marriage was about to be fixed with a youth from Jammu, the sources said. The youth was also questioned, but let off.

---||Mumbai||Accessible footpath now faces hawker challenge||Mumbai: Part of a key Vile Parle road has been transformed after an activist with cerebral palsy doggedly pursued the BMC to make it universally accessible. A 400-metre stretch of Nehru Road now has a wider footpath with tactile indicators for the visually challenged and kerb ramps for wheelchair users. Encouraged by the transformation, activist Jasmina Khanna is now pushing for accessibility for other streets and public amenities in the city. “Guidelines for accessibility were laid down by the central government a few years ago but implementation was lacking,” said Khanna, a software tester, who during her trips overseas had noticed how infrastructure was planned keeping the differently abled in mind. In 2018, she and her physiotherapist, Sanket Khadilkar, carried out a survey of public amenities in Vile Parle (East). The duo then went to the BMC with their findings and hired an architecture firm to create designs of the interventions needed. The BMC finally began work on Nehru Road earlier this year, but it was no cakewalk. “We had to remove obstructions so that the footpaths could be widened to at least two metres for a wheelchair to pass,” said assistant engineer Sambhaji Dorugade of the BMC’s K-East ward. Encroached spaces had to be taken back from shopkeepers who were not too happy about it. The municipal team replaced paver blocks with concrete. Tactile indicators were laid on the footpath and warning signs were provided around trees, streetlights and electric boxes for guiding the visually challenged. “One of our suggestions was to give the kerb ramps a rough surface so that wheelchairs don’t skid,” said architect Parul Kumtha, who is working alongside Khanna and Khadilkar for the initiative and has prior experience in creating inclusive spaces. Then, just before lockdown-like restrictions were applied, the group met the additional municipal commissioner (projects) to explain about their work. He swiftly responded with an instruction to all ward officers that new footpaths were to be made accessible and pedestrian-friendly. The big challenge now is to keep hawkers off the transformed stretch on Nehru Road as some of them have already started to creep back. After the monsoon, the civic body intends to complete accessibility work on the remaining stretch. Khanna has her sights trained on the neighbouring Juhu and Andheri areas and has already initiated meetings with the civic staff there. “Our architects have done an audit of Juhu-Versova Link Road and we are pushing with the BMC for accessibility,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-new-footpath-faces-hawker-challenge/articleshow/84808447.cms||Nitasha Natu

The chairman had come for the hearing in a case where he had found a cleaner cleaning a manhole without a safety kit. At Tuesday’s hearing in Circuit House, heated arguments were exchanged between the chairman and engineers, and the former asked the cops to book the latter for disrupting the meeting. The engineers threatened to go on a strike if the FIR was registered. A few days back, Geja Ram had found a few sewer cleaners manually cleaning the manholes in Jugiana without kits and he went to the police station for registering FIRs against officials who were not present at the spot. As per the Manual Scavenging Act of 2013, manual cleaning is banned and if it is to be done the sewer cleaners must enter with all safety gears and in the presence of officials. The chairman had also complained to CM Captain Amarinder Singh. When the chairman came to attend the hearing, the engineers of the operation and maintenance cell, from JEs to executive engineers, were present. When Geja Ram started addressing the mediapersons and said that carelessness of officials was proving fatal for cleaners, the engineers contested the claim and asked journalists to get a statement of the cleaner, Vijay Pal, who was caught by the chairman. Vijay Pal also levelled allegations against the chairman, saying he had asked him to enter the manhole that day. He said he had refused to go inside, but the chairman and his men forced him to go. A video was also circulated wherein the chairman was seen asking him to enter the manhole again. This led to a tussle and the chairman asked the cops to get an FIR registered against the engineers, who later tried to resolve the matter and requested him not to get them booked. The chairman said action would be taken against all JEs and SDOs who interrupted the meeting. So the engineers moved out of the meeting hall and Geja Ram continued with the hearing and called out those sewer cleaners and engineers who were responsible for the incident. He said they have heard the cleaners and officials of the Jugiana incident, but another was reported in Model Town, so a hearing would take place again, after which a final decision would be taken. SAD leaders support officials Akali Dal councillor Tona Garcha and senior SAD leader Nirmaljit Singh Sekhon came in support of officials and claimed that in their wards the situation was bad because of the poor sewerage system. They asked the chairman to get some better machines for cleaning so that cleaners need not enter the manholes. The chairman asked them to give their requests in writing.Phone of official snatched Sanitation employees and union members were recording the proceedings of the meeting on their mobile phones when an SDO of MC had a tiff with the chairman and he showed him a video on his phone. He alleged that it was on the directions of the chairman that sewer cleaners had entered the manhole. This irked the chairman and his aides snatched the phone and refused to return it even after the meeting. After the MC employees’ union president tried to convince the chairman, the phone was returned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/verbal-spat-between-safai-karamchari-panel-chairman-engineers-turns-ugly/articleshow/84803678.cms||---

He appears to be a man of confidence,” NCP chief Sharad Pawar said. The Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamna targeted both Koshyari and BJP, terming opposition visits to the flood-affected zones as “political tourism” and an attempt to benefit from a grim situation. Pawar appealed to politicians not to visit flood-affected areas, saying it has an adverse impact on the administration. “For the chief minister and deputy chief minister, such tours are essential since they are responsible for providing relief. But other leaders should avoid such visits. Instead of focusing on relief, the administration has to concentrate on the visit of politicians,” Pawar said. In the same vein, Saamna said: “Following the chief minister’s visit, union minister Narayan Rane and opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis also reached the worst-affected village, Taliye in Raigad. Now, the governor is also visiting the area while rescue operations are still underway. This kind of tourism leads to more chaos during the rescue operation. “How serious are these visits or are they just limited to ‘political tourism’ and photo shoot opportunities?” While taking a dig at Fadnavis’s statement that the Centre will help affected people, Saamna said: “There is no doubt that the Centre is ‘maai-baap’ of all states. But it indicates that they [opposition BJP] do not recognise the state government elected by the people.” State Congress unit president Nana Patole also criticised Koshyari, saying that ever since he came to Raj Bhavan, he had behaved like a BJP activist. “Even at an event at Raj Bhavan on Monday, he took on none other than former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. He should tender an unconditional apology and should be recalled,” Patole, who once was in the BJP, said. Koshyari said: “The local administration should ensure flood-affected people and traders receive assistance.” Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut, who is the executive editor of Saamna, also took a dig at union minister Narayan Rane, who was once a member of the Shiv Sena, saying: “We will welcome it if a union minister is able to receive a Rs 2,000 crore cheque signed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for flood-affected people in Maharashtra.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-koshyari-flies-over-flood-hit-region-with-suspended-bjp-mla-gets-flak/articleshow/84810205.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Even as the municipal corporation has the machinery, officials say there are certain areas where manual cleaning is the only option.“Sewers mostly remain choked in areas with migrant population, like Giaspura, Dhandhari, Prem Nagar, Durga Colony, Vijay Nagar, Muslim Colony, Railway Colony, Punjabi Bagh and Tibba Road, among others. Maximum complaints about sewer blockage come from here. Those who live in vehras here throw in manholes everything, whether plastic carrybags or other garbage,” says an official.Another official says, “We know manual scavenging is banned. We do not let cleaners enter the sewers, but at times, we do not have a choice. We ask the cleaners to be equipped with safety kits, but these are not easy to handle. If they use the safety kits, then they cannot enter the manholes and clean those.” MC operation and maintenance cell executive engineer Ranbir Singh says, “We have issued orders in writing that nobody will enter manholes for manual cleaning. If anybody is going inside, he is doing it as per his own will. No officer asks them to do so.” The MC has 16 jetting sewer cleaning machines. Besides, a few small machines were purchased recently under the Smart City mission. Despite this, cleaners can be seen cleaning the sewers in many areas of the city. While the MC officials often visit other cities to study their better technology and beautification ideas, there has been no trip aimed at improving sewer cleaning techniques.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/manual-cleaning-the-only-option-in-some-areas/articleshow/84803688.cms||---

The government has neither approached the Supreme Court nor raised the ‘raw deal’ meted out to Telangana on the floor of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha till now. Soon after a gazette notification was issued 10 days ago, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao held an emergency meeting with senior irrigation officials and had decided to move the Supreme Court. It was also decided to meet Union minister of Jal Shakti and, if possible, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, apart from raising the issue in Parliament. “As Parliament is witnessing a bedlam over the Pegasus snooping controversy and farm laws, our MPs could not find time to raise the issue in the Lok Sabha. We also sought an appointment with Union ministers who are busy with the Parliament session,” TRS floor leader in Lok Sabha Nama Nageswara Rao told TOI on Tuesday. Party floor leader in Rajya Sabha K Keshava Rao said: “Since we did not get an opportunity to raise the issue, we will raise the gazette notification issue at another appropriate forum.” Sources in the government said as the Jal Shakti ministry had referred the issue of constituting a new tribunal to legal experts, the state government will wait for the decision of the Centre and then decide the future course of action. The Centre reportedly assured the state government of getting a report on legal issues concerning the new tribunal within a month. Irrigation special chief secretary Rajat Kumar held a meeting with irrigation officials to collect project-wise information. The Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) and Godavari River Management Board (GRMB) have once again asked both Telangana and AP to submit detailed project reports on the irrigation projects in their respective states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-yet-to-move-sc-on-centretaking-over-irrigation-projects/articleshow/84808477.cms||Koride Mahesh

The strike was called after the UP government decided to give the contract to run ambulances to a new firm, which, according to the union, is giving less wages to staffers, is demanding a draft of security before hiring the existing employees and has put other riders in contract.  Over 19,000 ambulance workers continued their strike, leaving 4,600 ambulances stranded in 75 districts.CM Yogi Adityanath directed strict action if any needy person doesn't get the ambulance service. He tweeted, “UP government is committed to provide quality health facilities to the people of the state. It should be ensured that the ambulance service is provided on time to the needy. If this does not happen, then strict action should be taken against the concerned ambulance provider.” The private firm, GVK EMRI -- which manages 108 and 112 ambulance services in UP-- filed an FIR on Tuesday against union leaders and terminated over 20 staffers across UP. 108 is emergency ambulance while 102 is for maternity facility. A meeting between ambulance association members and Mission director (MD) of National Health Mission (NHM) Aparna U remained inconclusive on Monday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ambulance-service-of-up-govt-hit-by-stir/articleshow/84810279.cms||---

---||Rajkot||Soon, towed vehicles’ owners will receive SMS alerts||Rajkot: Vehicle owners’ biggest nemesis has been the tow van! Finding where the towed vehicle has been taken away to, happens to be the worst nightmare, which, will be much smoother now if things go as envisaged. Rajkot police from next month is going to implement a software-based system, which will send an SMS to vehicle owners to alert them about their vehicle being towed away. The traffic police is creating it’s own database with the mobile numbers of vehicle owners. While Rajkot traffic police is moving towards a paperless fine system, it is also creating a database of its own on vehicle owners’ history during this shifting process. Generally RTO keeps record of vehicle owners and in newly purchased vehicles now mobile number is available. The police is using that database, but for older vehicles they are preparing a database from vehicles that come into the system during traffic checking drive or violation of traffic rules. Based on this data, vehicle owners will be sent an SMS alert whenever traffic police tows a vehicle. Cops enter the data of vehicle registration number into the mobile application which generates a challan as well as an alert messages for the vehicle owner. This mobile application is exclusively prepared for traffic police to go paperless. Deputy commissioner of police, zone-1 Praveen Kumar said, “This will help owners locate vehicles easily and they can come to the spot, pay fine and get the vehicle released. The vehicle owner can pay by scanning UPI code and paying the fine online. They will also get an SMS alert of the paid amount.” Rajkot traffic police currently has a fleet of 20 cranes, of which four are used for four wheelers. The city police is planning to increase cranes for four wheelers in the near future. At present around 65 to 70 vehicles get towed every day, which is less then the pre-Covid period’s nearly 120 vehicles per day. The major crowded areas from where vehicles are towed include Sadhu Vasvani road, KKV chowk on Kalavad road, Trikon Baug, Dhebar road, Yagnik road and Racecourse. Going eco-friendly Handwritten receipt for payment of fine has become a passé, nowadays. Rajkot traffic police’s head constable on duty simply enters the vehicle registration number and owner’s details and type of violation on a newly prepared mobile application to generate an e-challan. The vehicle owner gets the challan and after online payment will receive an SMS alert. This new system that has been implemented from May 1, has generated around 18,000 challans so far and a fine of Rs 45 lakh collected. “We are now 99 percent paperless. We gave one receipt book to the police inspector in case of need but the number of physical receipts is in single digit now.” said Manoj Agrawal Rajkot police commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/soon-towed-vehicles-owners-will-receive-sms-alerts/articleshow/84803796.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Kochi||Corp not to encourage transfer of houses in daughters’ names||Thiruvananthapuram: The corporation is taking a stand against the practice of beneficiaries using homes received under housing projects as a lucrative option to fix marriages. The development standing committee has received two applications from beneficiaries who had received houses under the landless-homeless category in connection with the people planning project. Both the applications pertained to transfer of ownership of houses to daughters’ name for marriage purpose. The corporation took a stand that such a change of ownership could not be encouraged as per the given terms of contract and that it can be done after the death of the beneficiary to whom houses were allotted. “There could be two reasons why people apply for change of ownership. A girl with a house registered in her name will attract more marriage proposals or the house could be pledged for raising money to meet marriage expenses. Showcasing a house to solicit a marriage proposal is tantamount to offering dowry in an indirect manner. What happens is that the actual beneficiary for which house has been allotted may end up homeless and the whole purpose of the scheme to provide houses for homeless gets defeated,” said a corporation official. When houses are given to beneficiaries as part of the housing scheme, the corporation keeps custody of sale deed for a specified period of time and an agreement is drawn with the beneficiary which makes it impossible to sell or pledge the house until the expiry of the agreement. Earlier, the applications for change of ownership would be forwarded to the state government, later it was shifted to the district collector. In 2014, about 78 beneficiaries had withdrawn from various housing schemes being implemented under the basic services for the urban poor (BSUP). The readiness of the beneficiaries to repay the amount came as a surprise for the officials who later found out that some of them have already reached an agreement with third parties to sell off the property and partly-constructed house. Probe revealed that most beneficiaries come under pressure to sell off the property either to marry off their daughters or to move out to new places. The welfare standing committee screened all the names of people who had withdrawn from the scheme and rendered them ineligible for applying for any housing scheme in future. The state which set a model in timely disbursal of Ockhi relief fund had watched its plan for financial security of dependants of Ockhi victims being rattled by applications for using Ockhi fund for marriage expense. The revenue department had been forced to issue an order allowing collectors to give consent to the families to withdraw amount from separate accounts of dependants for marriage expense after inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-not-to-encourage-transfer-of-houses-in-daughters-names/articleshow/84803780.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) and the Panaji urban health centre began door-to-door vaccination last week and have decided to continue with the drive on Wednesday and Friday this week. Panaji mayor Rohit Monserrate appealed to people who are bedridden and the elderly to contact their local councillors and get vaccinated. The health centre will be vaccinating ten citizens each day, three days a week. The team comprising one doctor, two nurses, one helper and one health inspector visits the homes of those who cannot travel to vaccination centres “The team will also vaccinate one caretaker who is caring for the patient at home,” CCP co-opted councillor Kishore Shastry said. Those who cannot make it to vaccination centres can contact their health centre, councillor or even booth level officer. The team has already received requests from over 50 persons. Booth level officers in the city have also begun a survey to find out how many residents have taken the jab and are assisting in CCP’s aim of vaccinating 100% of the population as the corporation hasn’t received city specific data of vaccinated persons from the health department. The Panaji urban health centre has vaccinated the highest number of persons compared to any other health centre, however, not all the beneficiaries are residents of the city. The door-to-door vaccination drive on Tuesday began around 10am and was completed around lunchtime, where ten persons got the jab. A vaccine vial contains at least ten doses of the vaccine and must be consumed within four hours of being opened. Majority of them were administered their first dose and others their second dose. Vaccination was simultaneously carried out at Don Bosco. The centre, like many others, functions seven days a week and on public holidays. Chief minister Pramod Sawant had said the state government aims to vaccinate its entire eligible popuulation with first dose by July 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ccp-begins-jab-drive-for-elderly-bedridden-at-home/articleshow/84806207.cms||Lisa Monteiro

The high court stated that it would not interfere in the matter as the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has been monitoring the issue for many years and suggested that the petitioner go back to the NGT over his grievance. “According to us, the NGT was monitoring the issue of the demarcation of private forests in the state of Goa for quite some time. It is in pursuance of the orders made by the NGT that the Committee came to be appointed,” the division bench stated. “Ultimately, the NGT has accepted the report of the Committee. Therefore, if any party has any grievance against the orders made by the NGT on this issue, then, it is only appropriate that such parties, avail of the statutory remedy of appeal provided under the NGT Act,” the court added. The petitioner Pedro Januario Carlos Barreto stated that his property was declared as private forest without applying correct parameters and without giving him an opportunity to be heard and hence violated the principle of natural justice. The petitioner went to high court seeking quashing of the report dated June 20, 2019 prepared by the Review Committee headed by Deep Shikha Sharma. The court stated that aggrieved parties already have an alternate remedy provided to them under the NGT Act itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ngt-monitoring-pvt-forest-issues-wont-intervene-hc/articleshow/84806241.cms||---

As the toll rose to 209, the state cabinet is likely to announce a special compensation package for Konkan and Western Maharashtra region that were worst hit. The compensation will be on the lines of that announced during the Nisarg and Tauktae cyclones. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray met deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and other ministers to discuss the compensation package. A final proposal will be tabled in the state cabinet on Wednesday. The state is considering giving some relief to affected traders and shopkeepers. 4.3L moved, loss pegged at Rs 700 cr in K’pur, Sangli; plan to revive ChiplunThe death toll in rain-related mishaps across the state climbed to 209 on Tuesday. Ratnagiri recorded 14 deaths and two more fatalities were added to Thane’s toll, taking the total toll in Konkan region to 150. Rescue operations at Posare Khurd landslide site in Khed taluka of Ratnagiri were called off on Tuesday where eight more people continue to remain missing. The number of people evacuated from their homes has crossed 4.3 lakh. Governor B S Koshyari visited Taliye in Raigad, where the worst landslide took place. He also reviewed the situation in Chiplun. Urban development minister Eknath Shinde said Rs 2 crore will be provided as assistance for flood-ravaged Chiplun. “A five-member committee has been constituted for restoration and revival of Chiplun,” Shinde said. Officials said preliminary estimates of damage from the affected districts have started to trickle in and so far 3.3 lakh hectares of agricultural land has been affected. Government infrastructure like roads, bridges, school buildings, electricity infrastructure and even water supply schemes have been damaged. The estimate of damage to 96,000 hectares of agricultural land in the flood-hit districts of Sangli and Kolhapur has been pegged at over Rs 700 crore. Crops over 58,000 hectares in Kolhapur district and 38,000 hectares in Sangli district have been damaged as per visual assessment carried out by the authorities of both districts. Kolhapur and Sangli district collectors have prepared a preliminary report of the damage caused by the floods to Panchganga and Krishna rivers. In Kolhapur district, losses are worth Rs 243.4 crore, while the figure is Rs 466.8 crore in Sangli district. Both district authorities have, however, categorically said that the actual estimates are yet to be calculated and they may be far higher. The state government’s compensation proposal to the Centre for rain-related losses last year was over Rs 3,721 crore. The state government had sanctioned Rs 4,375 crore from its coffers for the affected districts. “The central norms for compensation were drafted in 2015. The state has been hiking the norms and giving compensation, therefore a large burden falls on the state,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-4-3l-moved-loss-pegged-at-rs-700-cr-in-kpur-sangli-plan-to-revive-chiplun/articleshow/84810236.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Attend next hearing without fail, Kangana Ranaut told in Javed Akhtar case||MUMBAI: As a “last chance”, a magistrate court on Tuesday allowed actor Kangana Ranaut’s plea for exemption from appearance in the defamation case filed against her by writer-lyricist Javed Akhtar.  “Exemption application filed by advocate for accused is granted for today as a last chance and the advocate is directed to keep the accused present on next date without fail,” the court said. The matter will come up for hearing on September 1. The court also rejected a plea submitted by Akhtar’s lawyer for issuance of a non-bailable warrant against Ranaut. The court, however, said, “On failure of accused to remain present before the court on next date, they (complainant) may file application for warrant against her.” Submitted in November through advocate Niranjan Mundargi, Akhtar’s plea had said he was shocked when he learnt on July 19, 2020, that Ranaut had given an interview to Arnab Goswami of Republic TV and Republic Bharat, damaging his “immaculate reputation by falsely attributing statements to him”. The plea further said that during the interview, which lasted approximately 57 minutes, Ranaut proceeded to give her opinions on the circumstances around actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death without appearing to have any direct personal knowledge of these. The plea also said in the same interview she referred to Akhtar as being part of an alleged “suicide gang”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-attend-next-hearing-without-fail-kangana-told-in-akhtar-case/articleshow/84808554.cms||---

Mishra said Congress failed to fulfil its promise made in the poll manifesto to reduce tax on petrol and is now raising the issue for political gains. “It was Congress that had increased VAT on diesel-petrol in the state, while in their manifesto the party had promised to reduce taxes. It is the fault of Congress” said Mishra, rejecting allegations that taxes imposed by the MP government on fuel are the highest in the country.  Congress has launched a statewide protest against hike in petrol and diesel prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cong-raised-vat-on-fuel-during-its-tenure-mishra/articleshow/84806232.cms||---
---||Varanasi||Even a joint opposition won’t be able to come to power: Maurya||Varanasi: Attacking the opposition parties for attempt to appease the Brahmin vote bank ahead of the 2022 Assembly elections in the state, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya on Tuesday said “even if Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Congress come together, they won’t be able to assume power in the state as people are now well aware about their real designs”. Talking to reporters here on Tuesday, Maurya said, “SP, BSP and Congress have no future in Uttar Pradesh (UP) even if they unitedly fight against the BJP. The BJP will retain power in the state with over 300 seats in the 2022 assembly polls.” Reacting to SP chief Akhilesh Yadav’s announcements regarding forming alliance with small parties, Maurya said, ”He (Akhilesh) should stop day-dreaming. He had contested 2019 Lok Sabha election by forming an alliance with BSP, but could do nothing against BJP.” Maurya said, “Even if SP, BSP and Congress join hands again, they will not be visible in the assembly like they remained out of sight at the time of the challenges faced by the people. The result of LS poll of Amethi seat is evidence as Congress’s Rahul Gandhi was the candidate of Congress, SP and BSP but BJP’s Smriti Irani defeated him.” Regarding the bid of appeasing Brahmin voters by BSP, SP and Congress, Maurya said, “It is nothing more than the voice of frogs, which is heard during the rainy season. Those who start appeasing a caste at the time of election, can’t be the wellwishers of Brahmin or any other caste. BJP believes in the politics of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ and the 24 crore people of the state are equal to it.” He added that people of all castes have full faith in BJP. Reacting to BSP’s Satish Chandra Mishra visiting Ram Mandir in Ayodhya and his claim of cleaning the Ganga if BSP came to power, Maurya said, “BSP is not coming to power, hence instead of dreaming to clean the Ganga he (Mishra) should try to clean his own party. Cleaning Ganga is being ensured by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.” “It is the powerful leadership of Modiji that all these leaders, who avoided speaking about Hindus, Kashmir and Ram Mandir, have now started running to temples,” he said adding, “Soon the people in Kashi will start witnessing these leaders chanting Har Har Mahadev in the streets of holy city and visiting one temple to other to woo the people.” On agitating farmer leader Rakesh Tikait’s call of march to Lucknow, Maurya said, “Tikait has become a victim of the conspiracy of opposition parties and those seen with him in his sit-in stir are not farmers. Farmers are with BJP as they are well aware about the moves initiated by the Modi government for their benefit. Farmers’ protest is nothing else but drama.” Maurya also termed Rahul Gandhi’s move of reaching Parliament on a tractor as “nothing else but a bid to create a photo opportunity for himself.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/even-a-joint-opposition-wont-be-able-to-come-to-power-maurya/articleshow/84806262.cms||---

According to sources in the department, Basu sought a report from Das on the action being taken regarding more than 20,000 students who could not clear the state board Class XII exams. After the meeting, Das said the matter would be sorted out soon and that all headmasters had been told to submit the relevant marks. “The protests, which have broken out at various schools in the state, have embarrassed the government. The education minister met the HS council president on Tuesday evening in an effort to solve the problems,” said an official of the department. Of the 8,20,000 HS candidates, close to 24,000 have failed the Plus-II boards, leading to widespread protests in Bengal. “Since this is a pandemic year, the state wants everybody to pass,” said the official. The council has instructed heads of schools, where students are upset with their poor boards marks, to again submit the scores, along with relevant documents, for a review. But the way protests spread in different schools in the state the government wants an immediate solution to the issue. “A student passed Class X to reach Class XI and then Class XII. So, it is strange that same student failed the HS, the results of which was calculated, based on his two previous examinations—X and XI— which he cleared. It seems there has been some error in calculating the marks,” said the headmaster of a school in Kolkata. The council cancelled the Higher Secondary examinations this year owing to the pandemic. The final scores were calculated after factoring in marks from Class X boards, Class XI annual exams and projects and practicals conducted in Class XII. Other boards, like CISCE and CBSE, too, cancelled their classes X and XII examinations and devised different formulae to assess the students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pass-marks-for-all-hs-students-likely-after-review/articleshow/84818450.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kochi||‘Stone rain’: Kerala experts warn of landslide possibilities||IDUKKI: The geology department’s preliminary study has revealed that the ‘stone rain’ reported in Idukki was not a natural phenomenon. An expert team, including Idukki district geologist Sunil Kumar, on Tuesday visited the two houses, over which stones were falling, and collected samples. According to the two families, stones have been raining over their houses since July 2. When it became unbearable, the families of Paravilayil Suresh and his father-in-law Selvaraj, who live in adjacent houses at Pulinkatta near Upputhara in Idukki, were temporarily shifted to another place by the panchayat officials. Sunil Kumar said the family members complained that the stones lying in the courtyard of the two houses were ‘falling’ on to the rooftops. “But as per our verification, there was no such phenomenon. Our primary study indicates that there is no chance of ‘stone rain’, as claimed by the families, to occur in the area. The family members said that stones had fallen inside their homes through windows too. But that can’t happen. We have collected soil and stone samples from the region for further study,” he said. The official said that a forensic verification of the stones was needed to arrive at any conclusion in the issue. He also said that the families living in the area are under landslide threat and they should be evicted during rainy season. “I will submit a detailed report to the Idukki district collector about the incident,” Sunil Kumar added. Other experts have also warned that falling of stones in an area could be an indication of possible landslides and such incidents had happened in many other places. Sajinkumar K S, assistant professor, department of geology, University of Kerala, said “Falling of stones or debris is quite common in landslide susceptible areas.” “These are indications of the initial nature of the land failure. For example, the Varunavat landslide which occurred in Uttarkashi in 2003 started with such a phenomenon, which later turned to be a massive landslide engulfing a good part of the town. So, the better action will be to rehabilitate the people who are staying in such areas during the monsoon so that the effects of landslides could be minimized,” Sajinkumar said. Though the exact reason behind the ‘stonefall’ is yet to be identified, the asbestos roofs of the houses of Suresh and Selvaraj have been severely damaged. When the incident was reported last week, geology department officials had said that the ‘stone rain’ could be part of weathering process. However, the officials who inspected the spot ruled out the possibility of weathering.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/stone-rain-experts-warn-of-landslide-possibilities/articleshow/84806276.cms||Sandeep Thomas

---||Agra||14,000 Ayushman cards cancelled in Etah district, beneficiaries not informed||AGRA: Registration of at least 14,000 beneficiaries under the Ayushman Bharat scheme of the central government has been cancelled in Etah district. However, the beneficiaries whose cards were cancelled have not been informed about it by the district health department. According to the chief medical officer, the Ayusham cards of 14,000 people were cancelled after it was found that their personal details, including name, address and age mentioned in the application form, did not match with the list of eligible beneficiaries compiled on the basis of the socio-economic survey in 2011. The Ayushman Bharat scheme of the central government scheme is aimed at providing affordable healthcare in the form of tertiary hospital treatment to the poor and the vulnerable though a health cover of Rs 5 lakh per family per year. The scheme was launched in September 2018. The eligible beneficiaries were shortlisted based on the national socio-economic survey 2011. In Etah district, a total 4,33,510 people of 86,702 families were found eligible to avail of the cashless treatment facility under Ayushman Bharat scheme. So far, 99,170 Ayushman cards have been issued in the district. Out of these, 14,000 have been cancelled following errors in the details of the beneficiaries following scrutiny. According to sources, in most of the cases, the reason for cancellation of the Ayushman Bharat card is an error in the spelling of the name or an incomplete name. The sources said the health department had conducted a scrutiny of the registered beneficiaries based on the socio-economic survey of 2011. It was the responsibility of the ayushman mitras and the village-level entrepreneurs (VLE) to check that the details collected matched with the list of eligible beneficiaries compiled by the state health authority. The district health department should have also checked details before issuing the Ayushman card, they added. By not informing the people about their cancelled card has created problems for the beneficiaries. As Vinod Kumar, an Arun Nagar resident, said, “My mother was having difficulty in breathing and suffering from high fever. I took her to a private hospital empaneled under the Ayushman Bharat scheme. Doctors advised that she needs to be admitted for a few days. I presented our Aysuhman Bharat card for cashless treatment at the time of admission, but learnt that the card has been cancelled. We were not informed about this by the health department. Now, I have to pay for her treatment.” Dr Umesh Tripathi, chief medical officer of Etah district, said, “Ayushman cards are generated through details of the applicants uploaded on an online portal by the team of ayushman mitra and VLE. Mismatches were found in the names and other personal details of 14,000 people in the scrutiny process of eligible beneficiaries. And their Ayushman cards were cancelled. The scrutiny process was done by the state health authority. We have directed the Asha workers to help people correct the errors and get a fresh Ayushman card issued.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/14k-ayushman-cards-cancelled-in-etah-district-beneficiaries-not-informed/articleshow/84803817.cms||Deepak Lavania

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh granted time to the three corporations, Delhi government, Delhi Jal Board, Delhi Cantonment and New Delhi Municipal Council to file the latest status report and listed the matter for further hearing on September 16. “You file your latest status report keeping in view the monsoon season,” the bench said, expressing concern that any possibility of rise in vector-borne diseases amid the Covid-19 pandemic if the situation must be tackled immediately. The corporations earlier said they had carried out inspections and public awareness campaigns and sprayed pesticides to control mosquito infestation and prevent vector-borne diseases. While initiating a PIL suo motu on May 24, the court had said that due to the pandemic, the steps to be taken by Delhi government and the civic authorities had taken a back seat and they needed to pull up their socks. “All of us are seeing the mosquito problem. Let’s be aware of it. If people get dengue or something and they need to be hospitalised in Covid times, it will multiply the problem very very badly,” it had said. Meanwhile, North Delhi Municipal Corporation had said it was taking all measures, including focusing on health education and community awareness, to control vector-borne diseases.  It claimed to have carried out house-to-house inspections, dealt with mosquito breeding and conducted anti-larval measures and spraying insecticides in drains, stagnating water and residential areas on a weekly basis. It had also issued challans to house owners who were not taking steps to prevent mosquito breeding on their premises, despite clear instructions of the corporation. Similar steps were also taken by South Delhi Municipal Corporation, according to its affidavit, which had said that till May 27, there were four malaria, 10 dengue and two chikungunya cases in its areas. East Delhi Municipal Corporation had said it carried out vector surveillance and conducted public awareness campaigns. Till May 27, it had recorded one malaria and two dengue cases. During the hearing, advocate Arpit Bhargav sought to intervene, saying the court had issued orders on the same matter in 2017. However, the bench said it would examine the plea once the status reports were received.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-how-ready-are-you-to-fight-dengue/articleshow/84806356.cms||---

---||Goa||Heavy fines if casinos violate Gambling Act||Panaji: The state government has decided to impose heavy fines or imprisonment if casinos are found to be violating the Goa Gambling Act. The bill will be introduced in the next assembly session that commences next week. A senior official said that the earlier fine was very nominal, and it has now been decided to impose heavy ones. The proposed fines, however, are neither listed in the bill nor the cabinet note. Goa currently has six offshore casinos and dozens of onshore casinos. The bill will amend Sections 3, 4 and 11 of the Act, which deals with fines and imprisonment. “The quantum of fine payable under the penal provisions of Sections 3, 4 and 11, being meagre, needs enhancement. And on account of the same, the offenses punishable under the said sections will be either imprisonment or fine or both,” a cabinet note said. The law concerned was enacted in 1976, when Goa was part of the Union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu. Now, the cabinet, in its approval to amend the Goa, Daman and Diu Public Gambling Act, 1976, will omit the expression ‘Daman and Diu’ and ‘Union Territory’ in the Act. Goa was conferred statehood on May 30, 1987, and Daman and Diu was made a separate Union territory. Thus, the state law department noted that that the expressions ‘Daman and Diu’ and ‘Union territory’ need to be removed. The state government had notified the Goa Public Gaming (Amendment) Act, 2012, to ban the entry of Goans into the six offshore and nine onshore casinos from February 1, 2020, and appointed the commissioner of commercial tax as gaming commissioner to keep tabs on whether Goans were gambling at the said casinos.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/heavy-fines-if-casinos-violate-gambling-act/articleshow/84806308.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Plan to cancel 5% annual water tariff hike before standing panel||NAGPUR: To provide relief to citizens in financial distress due to coronavirus lockdowns, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has finally decided not to implement the annual 5% hike in water tariff. The civic administration has submitted a proposal before the standing committee, which will meet on July 30. This is the first time in last 11 years that the civic body has dropped the hike in water tariff ever since Orange City Water Private Limited took charge of the water supply operation in 2010-11. TOI had earlier reported that municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B had taken the decision despite the fact that NMC has been incurring a loss of over Rs80 crore per annum from water supply. “The decision will further add to the loss,” said sources. The public health engineering department’s proposal revealed that the civic chief had okayed the annual hike on April 29, 2021. Later, Radhakrishnan B changed his decision considering the Covid-19 pandemic. Sources pointed out that this is the first time annual tariff hike has been cancelled. Last year, BJP-led ruling alliance had wanted the civic administration not to levy the revised water tariff. It also raised the issue in the general body meeting. However, the then municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe had rejected their demand. Sources, however, said the ruling party will take all the credit as early next year NMC is going to polls. Even in June this year, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari had announced a 10% rebate for early property tax taxpayers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/plan-to-cancel-5-annual-water-tariff-hike-before-standing-panel/articleshow/84806352.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

According to businessmen, rates of steel products have registered a slight drop, but the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME), who are biggest consumers of these products, are anticipating a further fall and purchasing only in limited quantities.Maninder Pal Guliani, president of Ludhiana Beopar Mandal, says, “In the last two months, there has been no buyer in the market for steel due to low demand in the domestic sector. On the other hand, steel companies are not correcting the prices, though there has been a small drop. Present market rate of HR coil is Rs 62,000 per tonne, which means there is a correction of around Rs 7,000 per tonne in two months, but still the demand is low as the buyer is expecting more correction. The price correction in long products is around Rs 8,000 per tonne, but that too has failed to bring an upward movement in demand.” “TMT bars of SAIL company cost Rs 49,000 per tonne as compared to Rs 56,000 in May. Overall, there has been a marginal correction in the rates of the steel products, but it has failed to attract MSME sector for bulk purchases. The factories are purchasing as much material as they need. But steel companies are pressuring the dealers to buy more despite the earlier stocks lying unsold,” Guliani adds. Another steel trader Sachin Singla says business has been badly impacted due to the sluggish demand. “The biggest concern right now is the huge quantity of unsold stocks piling at our stores. There is no hope of any change in this situation and it is likely that we will suffer record losses,” he says. Rajkumar Singla, president of Fasteners’ Suppliers’ Association, Ludhiana, says, “As of now we are buying steel raw material in very limited quantities as there is no demand of end products, like fasteners, cycle parts, auto parts, sewing machine parts, among others, due to lockdowns. Moreover, the rates of raw material are on a lifetime high and have witnessed an increase of almost 100% in some cases. The prices must come down to the earlier level.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/drop-in-demand-firms-asking-to-buy-bulk-stock-steel-raw-material-traders/articleshow/84803834.cms||Mohit Behl

---||Lucknow||Nationalist Congress Party announces alliance with Samajwadi Party for Uttar Pradesh elections||LUCKNOW: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Tuesday announced its alliance with Samajwadi Party (SP) for the UP state assembly election 2022 due early next year, making a U-turn from its strategy for the two assembly elections in 2017 and 2012 that it contested alone. The decision is prompted by the party’s urgency to check the BJP from getting a second term in UP. While making an announcement of the alliance on Tuesday the NCP also propped SP as the ‘main opposition party’ in UP. NCP national general secretary and UP in-charge KK Sharma said, “That’s what Pawar Sahab exactly wants that we should contest in alliance with the main opposition party to check the BJP from coming to power in every state. In UP, the main opposition party is SP.” On the Congress, which is also getting aggressive against the Yogi government, Sharma said, “Everyone should come together to fight against BJP.” The alliance partners have yet not discussed the number of seats they would contest. State president of the NCP Umashankar Yadav said the arithmetic is being worked out. “We are ready to contest on a lesser number of seats. All we want is some of our MLAs in UP assembly.” Contesting the UP assembly elections in alliance with the Samajwadi Party, NCP might benefit from the aggressive campaigning that the latter has already resorted to.  NCP had contested the 117 seats in 2017 UP assembly elections independently. Today, the party termed it as a bad decision. BJP had romped to victory. The party had contested the 2012 assembly election also on its own. Given that the NCP wants to be a part of the anti-BJP alliance in UP and its main focus is to stop the BJP from getting a second term in the state, it makes clear that the party has its eyes set more on national politics than gaining ground in UP by winning a considerable number of seats. In UP, NCP has chosen to remain on the fringes ever since it opened its office in Lucknow in 2001. Meanwhile, the state unit of the NCP would also launch a ‘Samvidhaan Bachao, UP Bachaao’ campaign. The party workers would hold public meetings in the districts to tell people ‘about the undemocratic and unconstitutional’ functioning of the BJP government. The party, despite being in alliance with the SP, would go to the public with the issues it feels need to be highlighted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ncp-announces-alliance-with-sp-for-up-elections/articleshow/84808570.cms||Neha Shukla

The Thunderbolts, an elite command force of the Kerala Police, gunned down the Maoists while they were combing in the forests in October 2019. On Sunday night, a gun-wielding three-member gang, suspected to be Maoists, forcibly entered a house at Kattekkad in Chittur close to the forest and took away food items, said a complaint filed by the house owner Parippumannil Balachandran with the Agali police. A man wearing a mask and the entire body covered knocked at his door and enquired about people in the house, according to Balachandran. When he said he was alone, two other persons forced their entry into the house. One of them snatched his mobile phone. They took away the stocked rice and escaped through the back door. While escaping, they threw back the mobile phone. They were speaking in Malayalam, Balachandran told police.

Santosh and one of his aides, Veeru Valmiki, were arrested on Tuesday. Their accomplice, Anshul Rathore, is absconding, police said. Giving details, IG (Agra range) Naveen Arora said Santosh and his associates had planned the murder and slit the throats of the four victims with a knife and a pair of scissors. On July 21, the trio called on Rekha at her house at around 12:30. They parked their scooter at some distance. They allegedly drugged Rekha and her children by lacing their tea with some sedatives and later, killed them, Arora added. After killing them, they ransacked the house for almost four hours and stole cash, jewellery, a laptop, a tablet and a mobile phone. They left the house at around 4:15 pm, said the IG. Subhash Chandra Pandey, station house officer of Kotwali police station, said during interrogation, Santosh told police that he had borrowed Rs 2 lakh from Rekha two years ago but was unable to repay the sum. She had been humiliating him publicly for it. He decided to take revenge from her and planned the killings along with his associates. Santosh was also aware that Rekha had received Rs 4 lakh from somewhere, and he thought he could steal it after killing her, the SHO added. The case was solved with the help of electronic, digital surveillance and CCTV footage. The IG announced a reward of Rs 25,000 for the police team for solving the blind murder case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/man-kills-cousin-her-3-kids-for-public-insult-over-money/articleshow/84803857.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat to amp up mucormycosis drug production||AHMEDABAD: During the second wave of Covid, citizens had a tough time procuring Amphotericin B, the drug of first choice to treat mucormycosis or black fungus. Learning a lesson from this situation, Gujarat has granted permission to a dozen pharmaceutical companies to produce the anti-fungal drug. The prominent among them, according to the state FDCA, are Emcure Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Sun Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Alembic Pharmaceuticals Ltd, BDR Pharmaceuticals International, Lyka Labs Limited, Swiss Parentarals Ltd and Gufic Biosciences Ltd. Confirming this, Gujarat FDCA commissioner H G Koshia said, “Gujarat Food and Drugs Control Administration has issued as many as 19 licences to a dozen companies since May 2021 to manufacture Amphotericin B — in the form of both liposomal and emulsion injections — in Gujarat.” Amphotericin B is an anti-fungal drug usually injected into a vein and it is used to treat serious, possibly fatal fungal infections and leishmaniasis. In India, it is also used as a drug of choice for the treatment of mucormycosis disease (mainly a post-Covid complication). Mucormycosis is a rare but potentially fatal infection if not treated adequately. While some of the companies have already started making this drug, few others are in the process to do so. “Emcure has been granted a licence to make Amphotericin at its plant at Gujarat and production has already started,” said Samit Mehta, president-operations, Emcure. “As of now, 54,000 units per month are being produced from the plant in line with the current orders. We will continue to produce the quantity as required to meet the challenges that India faces in the present pandemic scenario,” Mehta added. Ahmedabad-based Intas Pharmaceuticals could not start production due to the short supply of a key excipient (DSPG-Na). “The delivery is now expected on August 2. Based on that, we will be able to manufacture the drug in the second week of August and deliver 1,600 units by the end of the month,” said an Intas spokesperson. The entry of more companies will help create adequate supply of this anti-fungal drug. The rapid surge in incidence of black fungus in Covid patients during the second wave of the pandemic posed a major challenge to the country and multiple states grappled with the shortage of Amphotericin B. The recent data tabled in Rajya Sabha on July 20 showed that India recorded 45,374 cases of Covid-19-mucormycosis infection. Maharashtra (9,348 cases) and Gujarat (6,731) alone accounted for 35% of the cases registered in India. “Gujarat is also the largest manufacturer of the bulk drug or raw material for Amphotericin B. One company already manufactures it in the state and another pharma major has recently obtained a permission to make it,” added Koshia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-to-amp-up-mm-drug-production/articleshow/84806358.cms||Kalpesh Damor

On each occasion, the Mizoram chief minister’s only response was “I am very, very sorry”, he said. “He proposed that I come down to Aizawl and sign an agreement to maintain status quo on the border, to which I agreed. But when I was getting calls on the other line about the firing, I requested him to put a stop to it,” the Assam chief minister said. “Someday, he will realise that no one should fire upon one’s countrymen with LMGs.” Sarma posted a video on Twitter that purportedly shows Mizoram police personnel and civilians celebrating together. “Very unfortunate that they are rejoicing after killing their fellow countrymen. This has shocked and annoyed people of Assam, but Assam will protect its borders at any cost. We will follow instructions of government of India,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/called-up-mizoram-cm-6-times-he-kept-saying-sorry-assam-cm-himanta/articleshow/84811354.cms||Prabin Kalita

---||Delhi||Weather department predicts light to moderate rain in Delhi on Wednesday||NEW DELHI: The average expectation of rainfall in July is 210.6mm. Having gone beyond that mark this year, Delhi is likely to cross the 400mm mark in the next 24 hours, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasting light to moderate rain on Wednesday. The forecast for Wednesday has the maximum temperature hovering around 28 degrees Celsius and light to moderate showers across the capital. IMD classifies rainfall as ‘heavy’ when the precipitation is higher than 64.5mm in a 24-hour duration. While 100mm was recorded at Safdarjung, which is the base station for Delhi, the stations at Palam, Lodhi Road and Ayanagar logged, respectively, 68mm, 86.8mm and 69.8mm of rainfall on Tuesday. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD and head of the regional met office, said that despite a late onset, the intensity of the monsoon rainfall had been strong and wet weather is expected till the end of the month. “Light to moderate rainfall is expected on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, while drizzles may occur on Thursday. Light showers are also expected on Sunday, which could possibly take the monthly rainfall to over the 450mm mark,” said Srivastava.  Many of those frustrated by the misery on the rain-drenched streets on Tuesday would perhaps think the monsoon arrived in the city 16 days late but has already outlived its welcome. Delhi woke up to an early morning torrent — the second meteorologically ‘heavy’ precipitation of the season — that measured 100ml of rain till 8.30am at the Safdarjung weather station.  With 380.9mm of rainfall recorded so far till Tuesday morning, this is already the wettest July in the last 18 years, surpassed only by the 632.2mm recorded in 2003. Rain-cooled Delhi’s maximum temperature on Tuesday was 29.4 degrees Celsius — five notches below the normal. The relative humidity oscillated between 79% and 100%. IMD data showed that while the average rainfall logged at Safdarjung until July 27 each year was 183.5mm, 2021 has yielded a surplus of 108%. Palam and Lodhi Road also had surplus rainfalls, 81% and 90% over the normal, respectively. The first ‘heavy’ rainfall day of the current monsoon season came on July 19, when Safdarjung recorded 69.6mm of precipitation and four other stations – Palam, Najafgarh, Narela and Pitampura — also crossed the same benchmark. Meanwhile, Delhi’s air quality slotted into the ‘satisfactory’ category on Tuesday, with an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 98, with PM 2.5, PM 10 and NO2 being the lead pollutants. The high NO2 count indicated idling vehicles due to traffic snarls caused by waterlogged roads. This year saw the slowest onset of the monsoon in 19 years, beaten only by 2002, when the rains arrived in Delhi on July 19. The normal date for the moisture-bearing winds to reach Delhi is June 27. IMD says a late onset is not likely to change the overall forecast for Delhi for this year, and the likelihood is ‘normal’ rainfall in the region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rain-verdict-its-capital-punishment/articleshow/84806368.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh to host ‘anna utsav’ in August, PM to brief PDS beneficiaries||BHOPAL: The state cabinet headed by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan met for a meeting at the secretariat on Tuesday morning. The CM said that ‘anna utsav’ under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana will be observed across the state on August 7. Foodgrains will be distributed through 25,435 PDS shops in the state while Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address beneficiaries virtually. Briefing the media after the cabinet meeting, home minister Narottam Mishra said, “Following Covid guidelines, 100 beneficiaries will be given grains under the scheme from each shop. MPs, MLAs, and Union ministers will be present at ration shops where beneficiaries will receive grains under the scheme. The CM will also be present at a ration shop.” The home minister said that after an inaugural speech by a guest MP, the Prime Minister will join the function virtually. He said the link will be available to all and not just the beneficiaries of the scheme, so that everyone can listen to PM Modi. In a major decision, the cabinet sanctioned 419 posts of dentists for the Directorate Health Services under the PHE department. These posts will be filled in several phases over the next three years. “There will be one post of joint director dental health, one post of deputy director dental health, seven more posts of deputy director dental health for the divisional level (one for each division) and 34 posts of dental specialists for the district hospitals in urban areas. Additionally, there will be 46 dentists and a total 89 posts have been created. For rural areas of the state, 330 dentists will be posted in community health centres,”the home minister said. In another decision, the council of ministers approved extension of country liquor supply procedure for the year 2020-21 till March 31, 2022. The country liquor supply procedure rules were initially marked till July 31, 2021. The government also extended the time-limit of transfers by a week till August 7. The ban on the transfer of government employees was lifted from April 1 and was to end on July 31. However, the cabinet decided to give one more week to permit more transfers of state employees. CM Chouhan informed the cabinet that a review meeting has been scheduled on July 30 with district collectors. “CM Chouhan will review the preparations of the ‘anna utsav’ along with the coronavirus situation in the districts,” Mishra added. The government said that 25 lakh persons have been vaccinated across the state this month while Khajuraho and Amarkantak are now 100% vaccinated. “A Covid presentation was given during the cabinet meeting. With 70,000 tests being conducted daily, cases have reduced in the state whereas there are states in the north-east and south where Covid numbers are growing,” Mishra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-to-host-anna-utsav-in-aug-pm-to-brief-pds-beneficiaries/articleshow/84806410.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur Municipal Corporation to set up mineral water bottling plant||NAGPUR: Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is all set to start its own bottling plant for packaged water. A brainchild of mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, the civic body aims to generate additional revenue with this venture. The proposal got nod at the Nagpur Environmental Services Limited (NESL) board meeting on Monday. “To lessen the dependency on ever-constrained conventional sources of income, NMC has come up with a blueprint with finer details still being worked out to give the Orange City safe drinking bottled mineral water at affordable rates,” the mayor told TOI while confirming the development. The bottling plant will come up at Kanhan water treatment plant under private public partnership model, and is in the tendering stage. Tiwari said it will be the responsibility of the firm to promote and publicize the bottled water as NMC may fall short of resources in marketing it. The mayor said NMC will provide 1 litre water bottle at half the market price. Though NMC has not decided the name of the product, we may name it as NANEE (Nagpur Neer), the mayor said. A senior official from NMC said the public health engineering department is finalizing the tender document and it will be floated soon. The civic body has not yet estimated the capital cost to be incurred in the project. Sources, however, said NMC will face stiff opposition from the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority (MWRRA). It had already raised objections over the civic body’ supplying domestic water to commercial units, including Indian Railways, Airport Authority of India and restaurants. As per MWRRA condition, NMC is drawing water from two sources — Navegaon Khairi and Kanhans — for domestic purposes, while it is also providing water to commercial consumers. MWRRA had advised the civic body to revive its existing water bodies in the city to meet its commercial demands. MWRRA had already identified around 11,000 commercial users and institutions to whom NMC is supplying water by levying commercial rates, sources from the MWRRA said. NMC is supplying potable water to around 3.73 lakh consumers which included 10,988 commercial and institutional consumers. It levies Rs8.15 per unit water from domestic consumers, while for institutional and commercial consumers, the rate varies from Rs21.17 to Rs97.74 per unit. For lifting raw water from Navegaon Khairi and Kanhan rivers, NMC pays Rs12 crore to the irrigation department. When TOI brought this to the notice of the mayor, he clarified that if MWRRA says so, NMC will won’t mind paying additional charges to the latter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-to-set-up-mineral-water-bottling-plant/articleshow/84806473.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: President Ram Nath Kovind takes note of last rites Samaritan Mohammad Shareef's plea||AYODHYA: President Ram Nath Kovind has taken cognizance of a petition filed by Padma Shri awardee and last rites Samaritan, Mohammad Shareef, seeking medical aid and delivery of the Padma medallion at his home, considering his rapidly deteriorating health. The President's secretariat informed that Shareef’s July 19 petition has been forwarded to UP CM’s office for necessary action. In his letter to the President’s secretariat helpline, Shareef Chacha as he’s popularly known, pleaded that since he’s on death bed, the Padma medallion be delivered to his doorstep so that he can take a glimpse before he dies. Also, he cited family debts, debilitating disease and crammed existence in a two-room tenement to seek financial assistance from the government. Honoured with Padma Shri last year for providing honour in death to over 25,000 people whose bodies lay unclaimed, Shareef, 85, is yet to receive the medallion after the Rashtrapati Bhawan ceremony was deferred due to the pandemic.  “I am living in a two-room house on waqf land, which is too small for my joint family. After the Padma honour, the district administration allotted an 80sqft house, which was still smaller. I am facing a severe economic crisis after my sons lost their livelihoods during the pandemic. I am neck-deep in debt and don’t have money for medicines. My elder son, Sagheer, has taken forward my mission of performing the last rites of unclaimed bodies. He sought help of local legislators, but to no avail. Please provide financial assistance and a house for us,” Shareef stated in his petition to the President.Taking to TOI, Shareef's son, Mohammad Sagheer, said, “My father is suffering from serious heart ailments and since both his knees are jammed he’s unable to move. The arteries of the heart are choked and he immediately needs stent implants and a knee surgery, according to senior cardiologists. But we barely have the money for two square meals a day. We hope the government will act after the appeal to the President.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/prez-takes-note-of-last-rites-samaritans-plea/articleshow/84808655.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
---||Agra||New history for universities ‘flawed, communalised’, has to be scrapped: AMU, JNU professors||AGRA: The major overhaul of university syllabus for undergraduate history students has run into a controversy, with historians objecting to what they called a “flawed” and “communalised” approach. Days ago, the country’s largest historians’ body had flagged a similar revision of history in school textbooks, TOI had reported. The University Grants Commission (UGC) had come up with the draft Learning Outcome-Based Curriculum Framework on February 15 and invited public response to the proposed changes. It outlined the new syllabus for 25 subjects, including history. The new framework was adopted on June 24. It advocated moving away from a historian-based approach. “Despite the incessant efforts of a historian, it is impossible for him to capture everything ... Availability of evidence, its reliability and consistency, available time and the objectives of the study shape his selection and utilization of sources and evidence,” the new framework said. “This may be a defining line for a historian, but cannot be a defining line for history of a nation.” It added that “serious remodelling of the medieval period has been done” and “we have also tried to develop terminology befitting to our National context.” Contesting these changes, historians from Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) said the syllabus leaves out what’s important, adds “false” information, lends a “communal” colour to interpretations and is qualitatively “poor”. “When we come to the syllabus for ancient India, we soon realise that mythology, not history, is the framers’ chief objective … The ‘Indus Civilisation’ or ‘Harappan culture’ becomes “Indus-Saraswati Civilisation” in the syllabus,” noted AMU historian Irfan Habib wrote in a note. The syllabus has a topic, ‘Epic literature and culture’, “as if there was a period when the events in the Ramayana and Mahabharata really took place”, he added. “Even the name of Akbar is not mentioned.” These omissions and inclusions, historians said, are “agenda-driven”. The first paper in the curriculum is called ‘Idea of Bharat’. “I fail to understand the meaning of that … The major problem is that there is no medieval history in the idea of Bharat … Only the so-called glorious civilisation of the Hindus is presented, which is seen as embedded in the ancient period. And by erasing the medieval period, they are erasing what they consider to be a Muslim period, which is in fact a colonial periodisation and understanding of Indian history,” said Prof R Mahalakshmi from JNU. “In terms of content, it’s very poor.” Her faculty colleague Prof Najaf Haider added, “It’s a completely flawed document.” The reason, they said, is that experts were not consulted. “The basics have been ignored … Research done over the past 70 years has been completely ignored. It appears we are back to the era of colonial historiography,” said Prof Syed Ali Nadeem Rezavi from AMU’s history department. Haider added, “Historians avoid chauvinism, glorification, nationalism, communalism … The past does not have heroes or villains … But the UGC is sending a signal that Indian history should be read as a continuous struggle between Hindus and Muslims … The syllabus has to be scrapped.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/new-history-for-varsities-flawed-communalised-has-to-be-scrapped-amu-jnu-profs/articleshow/84803893.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Ahmedabad||HC questions approval for causeways to transport minerals||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday questioned the state government about why it permits the construction of causeways by dumping of debris in riverbeds to ply trucks carrying minerals and sand and what action it proposes to take against violators of the law for this environmental damage.On the construction of causeways on rivers, the court insisted that the government framing proper rules or “the court will take it upon itself”. “We cannot countenance a situation where the environment is damaged with such impunity,” observed Justice Nikhil Kariel while dealing with a petition filed by a sand mining leaseholder.The HC sought a reply from the government on mining companies making causeways and bridges by blocking water streams without following the rules. It said that environmental clearance is required for mining lease areas, but dumping debris in the river and causing damage to the environment and depriving people downstream of water cannot be permitted.The case before the HC was from Vadodara district. The petition was filed by a sand mining lease holder, who wanted permission from the authorities to construct a bridge on a stream that falls on the way to the mining lease. He had constructed a bridge by pouring coal tar but without permission. When the authorities came to know about it, it was demolished.The petitioner’s advocate insisted that there is a provision in the Gujarat Minor Minerals Rules to construct such pathways on waterbodies to ply vehicles carrying minerals and sought permission to place on record an order of the National Green Tribunal to this effect. To this, the court said, “A proper bridge has to be made which does not interrupt flow of the river and damage the environment. You cannot dump debris in the river and say this is my bridge, accept it or leave it. This cannot be done.”With these comment, Justice Kariel called on the state government to inform it “how such permissions are being granted and what actions it is proposing to take against such kind of activity? Rules cannot be stretched to such an extent”.The court said that the photographs of the bridge were shocking and said that such blocking of water flow would not only cause a problem for the flora and fauna of the river, but also affect people living downstream. “In the interiors, you lay a bridge in connivance with officers saying that the application for permission is pending. You just do whatever you like. This is simply not permissible. The state will have to look into it and come out with a formula,” the court said and posted a further hearing for July 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-questions-approval-for-causeways-to-transport-minerals/articleshow/84806409.cms||---

The reports seem to have triggered off panic among the depositors and protests from rival political groups. According to the report of the assistant registrar of cooperatives, the bank had sanctioned loans in areas which fall beyond its area of jurisdiction to 124 people. The report also mentions that some loans were sanctioned by overestimating the value of the properties submitted as collateral. The report said that in one case, loans were sanctioned three times on one property submitted as collateral. The bank had a profit of Rs 38 lakh in 2014-15. Currently, the bank’s non-performing assets (NPA) stood at about Rs 45 crore, said bank sources. The audit report was submitted about eight months ago and there are allegations that no effective remedial measures have been taken so far. Bank president Joseph Maliyekkal said that steps are being taken to address the crisis at the bank and to protect the customers’ interests. The audit report does not mention any misappropriation of depositor’s funds by any of the bank staff or directors, he added. The bank currently has a deposit of Rs 240 crore and Rs 75 crore as investment while its loan burden was only Rs 150 crore, he said. The bank has enough resources to repay all depositors, though there may be some constraints in repayment at one go, he said. Maliyekkal said that the bank distributed tokens to depositors for repayment of Rs 4.5 crore on Monday and for Rs 7 crore on Tuesday. He said revenue recovery proceedings have been initiated in the case of NPAs and other pending loans. Youth Congress and BJP activists took out separate protest marches to the bank demanding action against those responsible for converting a profit-making institution into a loss-making entity. The protesters alleged that several manipulations with the connivance of CPM leadership led to the bank’s losses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/another-cpm-run-co-op-bank-in-thrissur-gets-into-trouble/articleshow/84806520.cms||---

According to STF, a joint team led by its sub-inspector Angad Yadav and Mumbai crime branch’s Nilesh Shivale arrested Sonu Chauhan and Munni Devi of Galafar Pakha village in Bansdih, Sudhir Kumar of Kusaurikala in Sahatwar area from Ballia railway station and Galafarpur area. The cops recovered Rs 2,520 cash, mobile phones, adhar card, pan cards, ATM and a cheque book of killed woman from their possession. During police investigation, it came to light that Suman lived in a house in a slum area of Bholanagar under the Bhayandar police station in Mumbai with her husband, who is a factory worker. Sonu and Sudhir, who were staying in Mumbai to earn livelihood by working in rubber factory, frequently visited the place of Suman.

STF found location of trio in Ballia after which raids were conducted and all three accused persons were arrested.

---||Delhi||Another security breach, Congmen stopped on way to Amit Shah’s residence||NEW DELHI: In a major security breach for the second consecutive day, senior Congress members, along with party workers, tried to proceed to the Union home minister Amit Shah’s residence on Tuesday. They were stopped near Sunehri Bagh Road and 130 people were detained. They were released later. The demonstrators were demanding a Supreme Court-monitored inquiry in the Pegasus snooping scandal and resignation of home minister Amit Shah. Some of them also protested outside Cabinet minister Smriti Irani’s house. On Monday, Rahul Gandhi had driven a tractor in the high-security Lutyens’ zone following which police registered a case. A separate investigation is being carried out to establish how this security breach had happened. On Tuesday morning, Congress workers led by Delhi unit president Anil Chaudhary reached near Shah’s residence and raised slogans demanding his resignation. Police officials were again caught off guard like Monday when Gandhi almost reached Parliament on a tractor. Since the protest was unscheduled, the cops weren’t aware and could remove the protesters only after they had almost reached Sunehri Bagh Road, a source said. Meanwhile, police have registered an FIR against unknown people to probe how the tractor was brought inside Lutyens’ zone and how protesters managed to drive it almost to Parliament. According to investigators, the tractor was brought in a container driven by a man identified as Sunil. The container was stopped near Dhaula Kuan, but was allowed to move after the driver showed a photocopy of an MP’s letterhead claiming to be carrying personal items. The tractor belongs to a man in Sonepat whom police have identified and who will be questioned soon to determine who had taken the vehicle from him. The container was later brought to Lutyens’ zone and parked at the residence of a Rajya Sabha member. Here, the tractor was modified, hoarding and banners were put, police said, adding it didn’t have a numberplate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/another-security-breach-congmen-stopped-on-way-to-shahs-residence/articleshow/84806511.cms||---

Even as the majority of cases continue to come in from medical colleges and other health science institutes, with classes having shifted to the virtual space, the national helpline has seen a rise in cases reported on online platforms too. In around 40-50% of the total cases reported, students have complained of online harassment. The highest number of cases were reported from Uttar Pradesh; Maharashtra recorded around 18 cases in this period. Harassment in medical colleges is reported from campuses whereas students from most non-medical colleges have complained of it on online platforms, said Chetna, manager, UGC national anti-ragging helpline. “It ranges from the use of abusive language on unofficial chat groups created for coordination during the pandemic to simply unsolicited sharing of numbers,” she said. Students are even reporting minor cases of harassment as there is more awareness, she said, adding almost 40-50% cases are related to online harassment. A student from a Navi Mumbai college had reported a similar case of harassment when she got calls from her classmates at odd hours. The case was taken up with the college and was resolved. A teacher from another college said with classes moving online, students coordinate on chat groups, where the phone numbers are made public and can be misused. In pre-Covid times, an average of 1,000 cases were reported annually on the helpline. While Uttar Pradesh has always seen the highest number of cases, it was on the top even in the pandemic, with 67 cases, followed by Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha, which had 23 cases each. More than half of the 18 cases from Maharashtra came from medical institutions, followed by two each from engineering, management, pharmacy and one from law. Most complaints in Maharashtra are from private colleges. The helpline was started by UGC to address ragging complaints in universities across the country and is monitored by the Aman Satya Kachroo Trust. Raj Kachroo, father of Aman who died by suicide after being ragged by his seniors in a medical college in Dharamshala in 2009, said that an increasing number of students are now aware of their rights. “Students are flagging complaints that were considered normal about 10 years ago. The overall complaints of ragging are gradually dropping, as more cases are getting reported,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ragging-moves-online-in-pandemic-40-complaints-from-e-classes/articleshow/84800320.cms||Yogita Rao

According to him, RDIF has so far sent over 3 million doses of the first dose component and 3 lakh doses of the second dose component, which the company has utilised to vaccinate over 2.5 lakh people in over 80 cities.  “We are waiting for more of the second dose to come to ensure that the remaining 2.7 million doses of the first dose is then distributed across these 80 cities. After the increase in Covid cases in Russia, in the last one week the vaccination demand has gone down by at least 20% as compared to the past. We are in discussions with RDIF and…in August we should start seeing a better flow of the imported product,” Ramana said. Meanwhile, RDIF has also started trials of Sputnik V on adolescents aged 12-18 years and Russian trials are expected to be completed by October, Sapra added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-19-surge-in-russia-hits-supplies-of-sputnik-v-in-india/articleshow/84808131.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Fake Aadhaar arrests foil stolen card data deal, 2 graduates from Raj held||Mumbai: Two graduates from Rajasthan were recently arrested after they submitted two Aadhaar cards with the same 12-digit number to book a room in a city hotel. The duo—Lokesh Kumar Meena (23), who has a BTech degree, and Bhursingh Yogi (22), an arts graduate— checked into the Sakinaka hotel from where they had allegedly planned to carry out an online banking fraud on July 23. They had flown into the city from Jaipur on July 22. The fraud was detected after the hotel staff posted about the Aadhaar cards on a WhatsApp group created by Sakinaka police’s anti-terror cell, where citizens are invited to share vital information about any suspicious activity. The duo was nabbed after the hotel management got suspicious and alerted the cops who then reportedly found out they had planned to use the 24-hour stay to purchase details of bank customers, including their CVV numbers and PINs, from an international website, Bingodumps. “We found out their actual purpose of visit to Mumbai after their mobile phones were seized. We found chats about bank customer details on their phones,” said the police. Cops also found the duo was allegedly part of a racket that sells bank customer details bought on the website to scammers. Based on the information received, DCP (Zone X) Maheshwar Reddy supervised a team comprising Sakinaka police senior inspector Balwant Deshmukh, inspector Dinkar Raut, sub-inspector Hanumant Dhavan and anti-terror cell staff. The team nabbed the duo who said they were tourists. “But they failed to answer why they had used two Aadhaar cards with the same number. The original Aadhaar card belonged to Lokesh, a BTech graduate, and he created a fake one,” said a police official. Police said they are finding out about the duo’s previous visit to Mumbai. “The duo was arrested for Aadhaar card forgery and during the process, we learnt about their role of supplying bank customer details that they purchase from the international website. They get hold of bank customers’ login IDs and passwords during an allotted period of time. In this time, they have to download the card details and sell these to scammers on demand,” said a police official. Senior inspector Deshmukh said they will add IT Act sections against the duo who were arrested under various Indian Penal Code sections for cheating and forgery. It was sub-inspector Dhavan from the anti-terror cell and his team who found out the duo’s identities. The two are in police custody till Wednesday. “A whole lot of card details are compromised and available for sale online. Banks should ideally reissue compromised cards,” said a banking expert. Meanwhile, the police said they thought it strange that airport authorities did not notice the same Aadhaar numbers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fake-aadhaar-arrests-foil-stolen-card-data-deal-2-graduates-from-raj-held/articleshow/84800578.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

---||Hyderabad||Liver treatment should be priority, especially during monsoon in Telangana: Doctors||HYDERABAD: Health experts have warned people to be extremely careful this monsoon season with cases of hepatitis pouring into city hospitals. Doctors estimate that 5 to 7 per cent of population is likely to be affected with hepatitis across the state. “If we consume food and water outside, chances of hepatitis infection are very high during this season. Hepatitis caused by these viruses is not life-threatening in most patients. The infection is usually self-limiting,” said consultant surgical gastroenterologist and director NIGL Hospitals, Dr RV Raghavendra Rao. Hyderabad city has a caseload of 3 lakh hepatitis B and 1.5 lakh cases of hepatitis C. Across Telangana, the health department said they have a caseload of 12 lakh cases of the more common hepatitis B and 5-6 lakh cases of hepatitis C. Doctors have stressed that liver treatment should be given utmost priority, especially during monsoon when hepatitis A and E become prevalent. Underlining this year’s World Hepatitis Day’s theme ‘Hepatitis Can’t Wait,’ doctors explained that liver care is essential during monsoon as hepatitis can reach epidemic proportions due to viruses which can be contracted through contaminated food and water. However, Hepatitis A and E viruses cause acute damage to the liver (acute hepatitis) if not treated in time. “It is important to seek medical help in case of symptoms as these can sometimes lead to acute liver failure. A transplant may be needed in such patients. Both these viruses are transmitted feco-orally,” said Dr Moka Praneet, consultant gastroenterologist at Medicover Hospitals. Doctors also explained that patients infected with hepatitis-B or C must take special care to prevent Covid-19 infection. In-charge head of department for critical care at Nizamabad Medical College, Dr Kiran Madala said, “It is better to take regular medicines without stopping them even for the sake of Covid-19, in anticipation of getting infection. Patients should consult a doctor if they test positive for Covid-19.” One of the problems with hepatitis is that in most cases, patients don’t even know they have contracted the virus and it often gets picked up in routine tests for other conditions. “Since the liver can cope until it is nearly 80 per cent damaged, it can be too late by the time the symptoms appear. r,” said senior consultant gastroenterologist and transplant hepatologist at Apollo Hospitals, Dr Naveen Polavarapu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/liver-treatment-should-be-priority-especially-during-monsoon-docs/articleshow/84807890.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Lucknow||Economy strategy of ‘rescue, recover, rebuild’ working for Uttar Pradesh||By: Atul GuptaUttar Pradesh, with state gross domestic product (SGDP) of Rs 12,88,700 crore in 2015-16, has emerged as the second largest economy in the country with an SGDP of Rs 17,05,593 crore today. This accounts for 8.7% of the country’s GDP and is second only to Maharashtra, long considered to be India’s powerhouse. The state has been recording a relentless growth on both the economic and social front as a result of the creation of a conducive atmosphere for businesses and business-friendly policies and no-nonsense push to social sector, which can fulfil the government’s aim of powering UP into a $1 trillion economy with an inclusive growth. Having long been at the forefront of BIMARU States, pulled down by the caste and religious denominators on the one hand and allegations of corruption and nepotism on the other, the state picked up economic momentum post-2017, due to syncing of practice and preach. Assertive decision making, follow-ups and performance reviews by the top leadership of the state has tried to break the shackles of politico-bureaucratic trappings. No wonder, this has successfully laid the foundation of growing confidence of investors in attracting investments and ensuring ‘Ease of Doing Business’. Concerns of investors at the stories of kidnapping and ransom industry were almost impossible to overcome. Kidnapping of Adobe India head’s son from Noida and lynching of Indian head of an Italian firm in Greater Noida, a decade back, were the darkest moments. Confidence shatters in a moment but takes time to rebuild. But the no-nonsense and hard task master approach at the top, has slowly and gradually, but most convincingly, been changing the perceptions. The improved safety and security, connectivity, law and order situation in the state has allured industry giants like Samsung and Microsoft to invest in the state. It is for this reason that UP has jumped 10 places — from 12th to 2nd —on ease of doing business ranking among states. To give a head start to attracting and confidence building among the industrial sector, the state hosted a first of its kind UP Investors’ Summit in February 2018 which was successful at breaking the ice and attracted 1,045 intents with investments worth Rs 4.28 lakh crore across various sectors like renewable energy (16.8%), infrastructure (15.4%), power (14.7%), IT & electronics manufacturing (10.2%) and tourism (10.1%), etc. MoUs in themselves are just as good as extra papers unless executed. But what’s remarkable is that the state kept the MoU conversion rate of over 50% whereas elsewhere it has not been more than 15%. This has been a result of the state proactively pursuing investors, hand-holding them, announcing investor-friendly policies, and transparency in the system. The government’s marquee initiatives like ‘one district, one product’ (ODOP) and robustness of small industries have resulted in a 36% jump in exports to Rs 1.21 lakh crore in 2020-21 compared to Rs 88,967 crore in 2017-18. Uttar Pradesh has also emerged as the top investment destination and has received 98 investment proposals worth Rs 13,408.19 crore in the manufacturing sector during the past four years. After the most severe global recession in decades due to the pandemic, it is being predicted by experts from the World Bank that the world output will recover strongly this year and thereafter. The focus of the government is now on overcoming pandemic-induced disruptions in ways that also emphasise the silver lining of the crisis. What matters is that activity is picking up and unemployment is coming down. Uttar Pradesh’s own tax revenues (OTRs) have shot up 92% on-year to Rs 30,157 crore in the first three months of the current financial year. In what could have been a nightmare, things are indeed brighter than expected and promising. A lot is due to the determination of the government in minimising corruption and black economy. The latest data as per the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) states that unemployment in the state stands at 4.3% which is much better when compared with Delhi (8.8%), Kerala (15.3%) and Maharashtra (4.4%). Prior to 2017, unemployment was above 18% and with the new baton holder and his commitment towards ensuring employment, the figures drastically came down and till 2020 remained well below 10%. The Uttar Pradesh story is one of leadership-driven strides in all the spheres of governance. Leading from the front has been the hallmark of Yogi Adityanath. Today, he has made a mark by his grit, determination and resolute decision making. Senior bureaucrats who have interacted with him rate his overall comprehension as phenomenal and his ability to dig into minutest details par excellence.

The society’s office bearers want to construct an underground tank and have got a no objection certificate (NoC) from Mhada for the purpose. The society has cited severe water shortage in the society of row houses as reason, and having to resort to calls for tankers or the use of borewells. Residents say the open space is divided into two plots which together measure around 1,459 square metre. The two plots are separated by a boundary wall. One plot houses a gymnasium and the other has children’s play apparatus. “As per rules, such construction of an underground water tank can’t be carried out in an open space that is meant for children. There were water supply-related issues till 2018 but now there are none. The open space will be lost and the underground tank will pose a danger to kids who play there,” said Priyanka Pandit, a resident. The New Dindoshi Royal Hills Society has 77 bungalows and around 350 residents. Right now, every row house has a separate BMC water connection and the bungalows have their own water storage tanks. Ajit Jathar, society secretary, though, said the water does not reach a majority of homes. “We had first received an NOC from Mhada in 2019 and we have already completed the work of laying the water lines. The society is spending all the money and everything has been done according to rules. If there was any violation, then Mhada would not have given us an NOC. We have been struggling to get enough water for the past 15 years,” Jathar said. “The BMC had asked us to get a fresh NOC from Mhada and we got one in July. Some of the bungalows are higher than the homes located at Malabar Hill and don’t get enough water. This is a genuine effort to get water for the members. There is nothing illegal and we are following all instructions from Mhada and BMC. We have no other place but the open space to build the tank. We are not aware of the NOC being cancelled by Mhada,” Jathar said. Anil Diggikar, vice-chairman and CEO, Mhada, said, “We are reviewing the issue. I have asked Mhada and BMC staff to do a site visit and actually measure the water supply. We will see if there is genuine water shortage and then take a call on the construction of the underground tank,” Diggikar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dindoshi-residents-fight-over-tank-under-kids-park/articleshow/84801036.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The health department team had organised a camp for vaccination against Covid-19 for the people of Karnai village. A large number of villagers had queued up to wait for their turn to get the vaccine. However, before the vaccination team staff could start their work some local musclemen reached there and stated that all other villagers would get vaccine administered only after them. People standing in queue raised objection followed by exchange of heated words. Despite the protest of other villagers, these local musclemen tried to force the health team to first vaccinate them which led to a scuffle. Both the groups indulged in manhandling and started throwing chairs on each other. Terrorised by this fight the health department team started winding up the vaccination process. In the meantime, some villagers informed the police after which the Sukhpura police reached there. The police arrested five persons and pacified the situation.

While many patients had to pay a hefty amount to hire private ambulances and taxis to reach hospitals, others borrowed vehicles from their friends and relatives, even as a few came to the hospitals without any medical support using their personal four-wheeler. Ravi Kaushik, 32, who suffered limb fractures in a road accident had to hire a private ambulance to reach KGMU after being referred from Pratapgarh district hospital. “We called 108 several times but the operator kept telling us that the vehicle is being arranged. However, when the ambulance did not arrive even after half-an-hour, we hired a private emergency vehicle after paying Rs 3,500 to reach KGMU,” said Ravi’s sister, Radha. TOI found that many patients from Lucknow and adjoining districts reached KGMU, RMLIMS and other city hospitals in taxis, auto-rickshaws, private ambulances, borrowed conveyance, personal vehicles and even motorcycles. Ram Verma of Balaganj brought her sister to KGMU while tripling on his motorcycle. “My sister has been suffering from acute stomach ache since morning. As no ambulance was available, I asked my brother to hold her while riding pillion and I drove the bike,” Verma said.

---||Delhi||Use of IMA platform for religious purpose: Delhi high court won’t intervene on its chief’s plea||NEW DELHI: Seeing no reason to intervene, Delhi high court on Tuesday dismissed Indian Medical Association (IMA) president J A Jayalal’s challenge to adverse findings against him by a trial court. Justice Asha Menon declined any relief to Jayalal against a trial court order asking him not to use the IMA platform to propagate any religion. It had also cautioned him against loose comments. The trial court’s order came on a plea filed against Jayalal accusing him of starting a defamatory campaign against the Hindu religion by way of promoting Christianity, in the garb of proving superiority of allopathic medicines over ayurveda in treatment of Covid-19 patients. Complainant Rohit Jha had alleged before the trial court that Jayalal was misusing his position and misleading the nation and its citizens in order to convert Hindus to Christianity. The complainant cited articles and interviews of the IMA president and had sought a direction from the court to restrain him from writing, speaking in media, or publishing any content which is defamatory to Hindu religion or ayurveda. While the trial court refused to grant any injunction against the IMA chief, it took on record the assurance given by Jayalal that he will not indulge in such kind of activity and had noted that the plea seemed to be an offshoot of a verbal duel with respect to allopathy vs ayurveda. It had, however, also asked the IMA chief not to indulge in any activity contrary to the principles enshrined in the Constitution of India and maintain the dignity of the position chaired by him. Challenging the trial court’s order, Jayalal claimed that he never gave such an assurance to the trial court since he had not done anything wrong. He had also sought to stay the observations made against him in the trial court order, saying they were affecting his reputation as he was heading a body which has 3.5 lakh doctors as its members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/use-of-ima-platform-for-religious-purpose-hc-wont-intervene-on-its-chiefs-plea/articleshow/84806576.cms||---

In 2018, the joint registrar of the cooperative department reported a scam of Rs 44 crore. However, there has been no further action or investigation into the fraud. The bank, run by CPM-controlled governing body for over three decades, had a capital of over Rs 100 crore. The joint registrar had found that more than one loan was issued on the same property as collateral. It was also found out that out of the way loans were issued to relatives of the bank staff. The investigation found irregularities during 1999-2018. The registrar of the cooperative department had issued an order to take action against the culprits by recovering Rs 44 crore from the governing body. Once the fraud was made public, the governing body was dismissed and the administrator took over the bank governance. There were 29 accused, including local CPM leaders, in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/no-action-yet-on-rs-44cr-fraud-of-2018/articleshow/84806578.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Over 26,000 govt primary schools fail to use infrastructure budget in Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: Over 26,000 government primary schools in 46 districts of Uttar Pradesh have made no expenditure on construction related projects despite the budget approved for the year 2020-21, shows an education department report. Of the total approved budget of Rs 748 crore for 37,878 schools, only Rs 6.7 crore has been spent by 439 schools till July 22, the report shows. Only two districts — Gautam Budh Nagar and Sonbhadra have spent over 50% of the funds. The Project Management Information System (PMIS) report, a copy of which is with TOI, generated from the Prerna portal by the basic education department, puts up a scenario where less than 1% funds have been spent by educational officials for infrastructural upgradation of primary schools in the state. While 24 districts have spent less than 25% of the funds approved for construction activities, three districts — Baghpat (26.3%), Muzaffarnagar (29.2%) and Hapur (29.5%) — have made below 30% expenditure of the approved budget. Officials reasoned out non-entry of the expenditure amount on the Prerna portal or no work taken up due to novel coronavirus pandemic behind poor utilisation as shown in the PMIS report. “Despite school closure for so long, the construction work in most schools couldn’t take off. Even where work was done, the entry on the expenditure is missing on the Prerna portal,” said an official. Upset with the July 22 report, then state project director Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Vijay Kiran Anand has asked all basic shiksha adhikaris to immediately upload the utilised amount for the year 2020-21 on the Prerna portal. “Even after repeated sessions of online training given to district coordinators responsible for construction activities, the situation is regrettable,’ Anand’s letter states, adding the unresponsiveness of officials shows their apathy towards government orders. Anand, however, has now been transferred from basic education. The report shows Lucknow, Varanasi, Kanpur, Mathura, Amethi, Meerut are among 46 districts that have shown zero expenditure against approved budget for construction projects. Shahjahanpur and Unnao are two districts with the highest number of schools 1,653 and 1,643 respectively, requiring construction works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/26k-govt-primary-schools-fail-to-use-infra-budget-in-up/articleshow/84808760.cms||Isha Jain

Roads in many parts of Calangute are sinking due to the shoddy work on the sewerage network, former Calangute sarpanch Joseph Sequeira had told TOI, recently. “This has resulted in a number of accidents involving tourists,” he had said. Social media had been abuzz over the last one week after the popular road thronged by tourists through the year developed huge cracks and craters. It even sank at many places posing a danger to commuters. The road was in such a bad condition that traffic police were deputed to direct two-wheelers to ride on pavements alongside. Four-wheelers could not access some of the areas, with the worst affected being the junctions at Ronil hotel and Tito’s lane. The Calangute sarpanch told TOI that the contractor has already carried out temporary repairs due to the monsoon but repairs at the Ronil and Tito’s junctions would take at least another week because the water pipeline and telephone cables have also been damaged. However, Calangute constituency forum (CCF) president Premanand Divkar said that the craters are being filled with waste material. “They’ve dumped garbage, building waste from some demolished site, broken toilet commodes and again it will sink. This is all happening because of the shoddy work on the sewerage pipeline network. It has been happening every monsoon for the last three-four years and it will continue to happen unless they find some permanent solution by getting expert engineers,” he said.  Work on the network, which began in 2013, has still not been completed, Sequeira had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sewerage-contractor-repairing-baga-road/articleshow/84808817.cms||---

However, the minister said there needs to be some more restraint by the people as infections have not died down altogether. “The state, at present, is witnessing around 7,000 cases on a daily basis. Even during peak time, there have been as many as 9,000 cases per day. It is acceptable that the restrictions have led to an economic impact on the general public. However, the health aspect also needs to be considered. The picture on a further decision will only be clear after Wednesday’s cabinet meeting,” the minister said. Wadettiwar said even as there have been demands from various quarters that the restrictions should be eased, a careful approach will be needed. Trade associations in Nagpur too have come together by forming a joint forum to press for lifting curbs for the market. Dipen Agrawal, president of the forum Sarkar Jagaon Vanijya Bachao Samiti, said even they would wait for the outcome of Wednesday’s cabinet meeting. “If the decision does not favour the traders, the agitation may be intensified,” he said. The Samiti had organized a march to the district collectorate and NMC on Monday. A car and bike rally was held on Tuesday as a mark of protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-end-of-covid-yet-restraint-must-wadettiwar/articleshow/84806603.cms||Shishir Arya

As of now, besides that, there is nothing against them on record,” the court said. During the hearing, the counsel for the accused had claimed that they had come to Delhi on January 26 only to attend a tractor rally and followed the route decided by police and the farmers’ union.

The court said such submission of the accused was devoid of any merit and completely misplaced. Additional sessions judge Ravinder Bedi stated in the order, “Ex facie, the submission of the applicant (Jagdeep) that the complainant falsely implicated him to extort money from him is devoid of any merit; the same being unsupported by anything. The complainant, a mature lady, cannot be expected to allege falsely and thereby to expose herself to be defamed at the cost of putting her reputation in jeopardy and as such, the submission of the applicant is completely misplaced one.” According to police, the woman and the accused came in contact on a matrimonial site, where he allegedly told her that he was unmarried and capable of taking the responsibility of marriage. In her complaint, she further alleged that the accused had made sexual relations with her without her consent. She also alleged that the accused blackmailed her to agree for a physical relationship with him or he would defame her. Jagdeep claimed the allegations against him were false and fabricated and the complaint was made to extort money from him. His lawyer further argued that she was already married and so there was no question of marrying her. “The contents of complaint prima facie reveal direct and serious allegations levelled against the applicant. In the light of the aforesaid and taking into consideration the nature and seriousness of what is alleged against the applicant, the present application seeking regular bail by the applicant deserves dismissal,” the court said.

Their joy, however, was short-lived as investigation by foresters revealed that wrong leopard was trapped. Half a dozen villages in Saoli range are reeling under leopard terror for a fortnight now. The problem feline is habitual of intruding into human habitations and has attacked two women in their house. The first victim was from Vyahad village, Gangubai Gedam, who was killed while she was sleeping in the front yard of her house on July 13 night. The very next day, the beast had mauled one Vithal Gedam of Samda village while he was working in his farm. Another woman Tulsabai Mashakhetri was mauled while she was sleeping inside her house in Wagholi Buti village on July 20. Villages including Vyahad, Samda, Wagholi Buti, Konapur, Kapsi etc are under the terror of the leopard, while foresters of Saoli range have laid over six cages to trap the feline. “Lured by the bait, a leopard walked into the cage placed near Samda village sometime during Monday night and got trapped. Soon after the foresters learnt about the caging, they removed the beast to safer location for examination. However, matching of camera trap pictures with that of the caged leopard proved that it was a wrong feline which had got trapped,” DFO, Chandrapur division, Sarita Jagtap said. Jagtap said leopards have overlapping territories and the wrong one that got trapped was also from the same area. The caged beast was later released back into the wild at undisclosed location after medical examination. The DFO maintained that operation to catch the problem leopard will continue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wrong-leopard-gets-trapped-in-saoli-released-into-the-wild/articleshow/84806674.cms||Mazhar Ali

The court observed that the absence of the special public prosecutor had held up the case for three years. Yunus was 27 years old when he was arrested in the 2002 Ghatkopar BEST bus blast case. The police had initially claimed that he escaped while being escorted to Aurangabad for investigation on January 7, 2003. However, following a CID investigation ordered by the Bombay high court, four officers were booked in a case of his alleged custodial death. In 2017, the first witness, an acquitted bomb blast accused, deposed in the case.

Fake currency worth Rs 7.57 lakh was seized along with a photostat machine, printers, ink and a currency-counting machine. The gang was functioning from a rented house in Painkutty at Elanji near Koothattukulam. The arrested were identified as Thankamuthu (60), Anand (24), from Manjumala in Vandiperiyar, Madhusoodanan (48) from Pazhavangadi in Ranni, Faisal (34) from Kiliroor in Kottayam, Sunil Kumar (40) from Nedumkandam in Udumbanchola, Jibi (34) from Peechi in Thrissur and Stephen from Vandiperiyar. A case was registered against the accused under IPC Sections 489A, 489C, 489D, 120B and 34. They will be produced in the court after undergoing Covid tests. Police said the raid was held based on the information received by ATS, and Koothattukulam police provided the requisite support. Sources said that the accused were staying at the house for eight months after taking it on rent under the guise of running an event management company. District police chief (Ernakulam rural) K Karthick said, “ATS received a tip-off on fake currency and police supported them in the raid. Though the gang had been staying there for months, we are yet to confirm how long they have been printing counterfeit currency. A detailed probe has begun to find more about the racket.” Police said that the seized fake currencies were in the denomination of Rs 500. Five printers, a photostat machine, screen-printing machine, a currency counting machine, ink, and papers were also seized from the house. Though the house is located on the side of the road, there are no immediate neighbours. Meanwhile, it is also learnt that officers from central agencies like intelligence bureau (IB) enforcement directorate (ED) and National Investigation Agency (NIA) have visited the spot and sought details about the case. Also, there were reports that it was IB who received the information about the racket after counterfeit currency was found in Elanji market. However, police denied the involvement of central agencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fake-notes-racket-busted-7-arrested/articleshow/84806742.cms||---

---||Guwahati||Blockade in Assam cuts off Mizoram||SILCHAR: Local residents staged a road blockade on National Highway 306 connecting Silchar with Aizawl at Kabuganj on Tuesday in protest against the killing of five security personnel in an attack by Mizos at Lailapur near the Assam-Mizoram border on Monday. Mizoram remained cut off because of the blockade, as the national highway is considered the lifeline of the northeastern state. The blockade, likely to continue throughout the night, will be turned into an indefinite one from Wednesday morning, the protesters said. On Tuesday morning, residents came out on the streets and blocked the Silchar-Aizawl road at Kabuganj, about 20km from Silchar, demanding stern action against those involved in the attack. The protesters vociferously condemned the attack by Mizos and appealed to the government for necessary measures to ensure protection of Assam's land and safety of the people living along the inter-state border areas. They also pitched for stern punishment to all the culprits involved in the attack on Assam's officials. Hundreds of vehicles remained stranded on either side of the busy highway because of the blockade. There is strong security arrangement in view of the blockade. However, no untoward incidents were reported, said a senior police official. Social activist Jabir Hussain Laskar said the people of border towns and village will also launch an indefinite ‘economic blockade’ from Wednesday and urged the Assam government to take steps to resolve the boundary dispute. The Barak Democratic Front too has called a 12-hour Barak Valley bandh on Wednesday, BDF Chief Convenor Pradip Dutta Roy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/blockade-in-assam-cuts-off-mizoram/articleshow/84811479.cms||B B Goswami

The TREA, which submitted a report to the CM, said that there were many lapses in the gazette notification. There were no project-wise allocations and guidelines, it said.

---||Lucknow||BJP MPs from Uttar Pradesh to meet high command in Delhi||LUCKNOW: In a politically significant development, the BJP brass has convened a meeting of party MPs from Uttar Pradesh in Delhi on Wednesday and Thursday. While the agenda of the meeting has not been made public, sources said that the leadership might take feedback from the MPs vis-a-vis prevailing political situation and performance of the sitting MLAs in the run-up to the UP assembly elections next year. The meeting is scheduled to be presided over by BJP national president JP Nadda in the presence of UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal. According to highly placed sources in the BJP, home minister Amit Shah is also expected to attend the meeting which is considered crucial even as an assertive opposition, mainly the SP and BSP, makes an aggressive Brahmin outreach to take on the mighty BJP in the 2022 state elections. A senior BJP MP confirmed that the meeting has been scheduled for a direct interaction with the party’s high command. He, however, refused to divulge any further details terming it as an “internal exercise of the party”. Sources said that the party leadership has called the MPs in batches according to their respective regions. The BJP divides UP into six regions: Paschim, Braj, Awadh, Kanpur-Bundelkhand, Kashi and Gorakhpur. While three regions would be covered on Wednesday, the party MPs of the other three regions have been called on Thursday. The development, not surprisingly, triggered speculations about the party leadership seeking feedback from MPs about the performance of sitting party MLAs in their respective constituencies, which could play a key role in distribution of tickets for 2022 assembly elections. Sources said that the party was keeping a close tab on the MLAs, many of whom have been opening a front against the state leadership.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ups-bjp-mps-called-to-delhi-for-key-meet/articleshow/84808919.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Ministry of road transport and highways extends validity yet motorists paying fines for lapsed documents||NAGPUR: The ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) has extended the validity of motor vehicle documents like driving licence (DL), registration certificate (RC), permits and fitness certificates till September 30, 2021, in view of the Covid pandemic. However, the RTOs are unable to implement the ministry’s directives. “The department is levying late fee for renewal of various documents, including fitness certificates and permits,” said transporters. This is because National Informatics Centre (NIC), which manages websites and software systems of the transport department, has not updated in the systems the extended validity of fitness, permit (all types), licence, registration or other relevant document(s). As a result, the holders of these documents are ending up paying huge fines. Vilas Bhalekar, autorickshaw union leader, said that even auto drivers are forced to pay late fees for renewal of permits. Kishore Somkuwar, an autorickshaw driver, claimed that the department collected late fees for renewal of his autorickshaw permit. TOI also received similar complaints from private bus operators. S Neha, a transporter, pointed out, “After the fitness certificate of our bus lapsed last week, we were unable to get a permit to operate a trip the next week.” The RTO staffers said the government has announced relaxation in case of such paperwork lapsing during Covid times, but the changes have not been made in their system, so they cannot allow exemption even for a day in case some paperwork has fallen behind, she pointed out. Several transporters claimed to have paid fines to RTO’s flying squad for operating with lapsed documents, which they could not renew due to Covid-19 induced lockdown. Clerical staff from all the three transport offices – city, east and rural – admit that their department website and systems do not consider documents expired from February 2020 till date. They claimed that due to this they are facing public wrath. “People come with the extended validity notification issued by MoRTH and we agree that they are not wrong. But we are helpless as the NIC-managed transport department website is not considering the expired documents. Hence we are levying late fees for various documents like renewal of permits, fitness certificates etc,” they claimed. A senior official from city RTO confirmed this and said that the department has raised the issue with the state transport commissioner and NIC. The official, however, said they are considering the validity of learning licences and all applicants are being considered for taking the permanent driving licence tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/morth-extends-validity-yet-motorists-paying-fines-for-lapsed-documents/articleshow/84806733.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The filmmaker, who was booked for commenting in a news channel debate that Covid-19 was used as a bioweapon by the central government against islanders, contends that her phone and laptop have not been produced before any court yet and have been sent to Gujarat for examination. While her phone was seized on June 25, it was not produced before any court in Lakshadweep until July 15. The investigation team seized the laptop belonging to her brother from her house at Kochi. The phone and laptop have been sent to Gujarat. Forensic examination in cases from Lakshadweep are usually conducted in laboratories in Chennai, Hyderabad, or in Kerala. The investigation team has not revealed where the laptop and phone were stored for over a month and before which court they were produced, she said. Denying the Lakshadweep Administration’s allegation that she deleted WhatsApp messages, she has informed the court that she did not receive any advice from anybody else to raise the allegation against the government. Her phone was switched off while participating in the TV discussion and the administration’s allegation that she received advice from somebody else is incorrect, she said in an affidavit. There is no conspiracy behind ‘bioweapon’ remark and the probe into her financial sources is baseless, Aisha said. An expatriate friend had donated Rs 4 lakh to help the flood victims of Chellanam in Kochi and it was out of compassion, she told the court in the plea to quash the case against her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/aisha-to-hc-false-evidence-may-be-planted-against-me/articleshow/84806790.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP’s cane productivity up 4 quintal per hectare||Lucknow: Sugarcane cultivation in Uttar Pradesh touched a new high with average cane production reaching 815 quintal per hectare in 2020-21. In the last fiscal, the average cane production was 811 quintal per hectare. Shamli in west UP has topped the chart by producing over 1,004 quintal per hectare of sugarcane followed by Muzaffarnagar which recorded 923.20 quintal per hectare. In fact, of the top 10 districts, nine are from the agriculturally rich west UP. The state has 45 cane producing zones. Additional chief secretary (cane development) Sanjay Bhoosreddy said that the higher cane production was a result of crop cutting practice which was intensely used in the 2020-21 cane cultivation season. He maintained that it was because of the timely payment of cane price and associating farmers with the new cropping techniques which have led to an increase in the sugar cane production. The high cane production happens to be directly linked to cane price payment which is scheduled to be done by the mills, essentially in the private sector, to the farmers. The farmer groups, as a matter of fact, are up in arms claiming that around Rs 12,000 crore of cane payment is due for the 2020-21 season. Cane department officials, however, maintained the department was committed to get the payment of cane prices done on a timely basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ups-cane-productivity-up-4-quintal-per-hectare/articleshow/84808945.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Nagpur||Pune: Finally, HAL lodges complaint about missing MAPL machines, loss Rs 76 lakh||NAGPUR: Finally, the Pune-based Hindustan Antibiotics Limited (HAL) has lodged a complaint at the MIDC police station over the alleged theft of machinery and other equipment from the Maharashtra Antibiotics and Pharmaceuticals Limited (MAPL) plant in MIDC Hingna. An offence has been registered against an unidentified thief, supervisor and guards of the security agency engaged by the HAL at the plant. Heavy medicine manufacturing machinery worth several crore was missing from the place since 2015. TOI had first reported about the mystery theft on June 13. The plant was shut in 2003 and the machinery intact till 2015 as per sources. They went missing soon after the announcement of its revival by some ministers in 2015. Bombay Security Services had lodged a complaint on April 14, 2016 pegging the loss at Rs 26,000. Police inspector Yuvraj Hande told TOI that two HAL officials (including Mita Ghosh who is working in its vigilance department) lodged the complaint on Monday. “The machinery was heavy and could not have been taken away easily. We suspect the involvement of the security agency staff,” he said. Offence has been registered under section 461, 380 and 34 of IPC. The total loss as per the complaint is Rs 75,74,100. HAL MD Nirja Saraf denied any delay in lodging the complaint. “Despite continuous follow-up, the police was not ready to accept an FIR on some pretext or other,” she said. The police action is due to TOI’s reports, according to Sudhir Paliwal, a representative of former nominee director in MAPL — Environmental Engineering Inc. “The cost of machinery cited by HAL is very less. The period of theft is also wrongly mentioned in the complaint,” he said. The MAPL board, including Paliwal, held a meeting in 2012 and “the machinery was intact then”. “I visited the plant along with ministers in 2015 and then too the machinery was there. But on May 17 this year, official of industries department, former union leader of the plant Suresh Gotmare and I found all missing,” said Paliwal. Paliwal wanted to know why HAL had not taken any action on the security agency so far and also not terminated its contract. “Police have booked staff of the security agency. Why is HAL shielding it,” he asked. The plant came into news after Gotmare filed an intervention in the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court seeking the revival of the plant for manufacturing oxygen, Covid-related vaccine and medicines. Even guardian minister Nitin Raut had wanted the state to revive the plant. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis too had urged the Centre to starting using the plant in pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/finally-hal-lodges-plaint-about-missing-mapl-machines-loss-rs-rs-76l/articleshow/84806780.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The construction company given the contract of widening the stretch initially constructed the twin service roads along the stretch of the highway so that the vehicular traffic of the highway could be diverted on these roads. While the work of widening the stretch of the highway is underway, the rain that have been lashing the city over the past few days has led to the potholes on the service roads constructed just a few months ago.  Neeta Jadhav, a resident of a residential colony near Sinnar Phata said, “The traffic is huge on the service roads as a large number of heavy vehicles ply on them. The fear of an accident while avoiding the potholes is constant as the service road is narrow also it is slippery due to the rain.”Other commuters said the heavy vehicles speed up before entering the service road. When motorists, mainly two-wheeler riders, have to apply sudden brakes after spotting the potholes, there is a fear of being run over by the speeding vehicle .Officials of the state Public Works Department’s highway division said the work of widening the highway would be completed within the next couple of months. Since all the machinery and equipment for the road widening are at the spot, the contractor would be told to take up the work of filling the potholes at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/potholes-on-new-service-roads-along-nashik-pune-highway/articleshow/84768364.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Their boat trip through the flooded Gavbhag locality of the city has now become the talk of the town. For many, the sight of the young couple celebrating a joyous occasion acted as a balm to soothe the frayed nerves. The couple’s muhurtmed (a pre-wedding ritual) was held on July 23. As per the tradition, once the muhurtmed is held, then the wedding too must take place on the fixed date. However, the Sangli city got flooded on the night of July 23. Rohit Suryawanshi told TOI: “Earlier, we had picked a wedding hall near my house. However, when the floodwater started entering many localities, evacuated people had to be relocated to the wedding hall. Since our muhurtmed was done, we had to proceed with the wedding anyhow. Therefore, we decided to get married at Sonali’s house with just a few guests. For the wedding, I left with few close relatives on a boat. As the bride’s gruhapravesh and varaat (the trip to bring the bride to her marital home) are important steps, we decided to take the boat back home too.” Rohit, who runs a salon, added: “We had planned a grand wedding with Covid-appropriate measures. The date was fixed much in advance and we had finished all the preparations and shopping. Usually, we have a grand procession after the wedding to take the bride home. However, most out plans had to be set aside. But we did not want to postpone the wedding date.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bride-on-boat-soothes-frayed-nerves-in-flooded-sangli/articleshow/84811480.cms||Abhijeet Patil
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh flags ‘rozgar sewak’ jobs to relatives of gram pradhan under MNREGS; missive to DMs||LUCKNOW: The Yogi Adityanath government has flagged employment of newly elected gram pradhan’s relatives as rozgar sewaks under Centre’s flagship Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS), calling it an “obstacle to transparent functioning of rural local bodies”. In a stern missive to district magistrates, additional chief secretary (rural development) Manoj Singh said, jobs to kin would be a deterrent to ensuring quality construction or meeting employment generation objectives of the scheme. Rozgar sewaks employed under MNREGS act as a catalyst in generation of employment at village level by forming labour groups, who could then be engaged in various activities and projects. “The department has come across instances where family members of rozgar sewaks were elected as gram pradhans. We will transfer such gram sewaks to other panchayats and make fresh recruitments for transparent and efficient working of central schemes,” Singh told TOI on Tuesday, a day after Panchayati Raj department cracked the whip on employment of gram pradhan’s relatives as panchayat assistants. While employment of assistants is scheduled from July 30, gram sewaks will be transferred to other panchayats after due clearance. Singh said a newly elected gram pradhan in Hamirpur turned out to be the daughter of a rozgar sewak. “There may be many such cases which need to be scrutinized,” he said. Official sources in the rural development department pointed out that the original government order issued on November 23, 2007, during the previous Mayawati too barred appointment of rozgar sewaks, who are relatives of pradhans. The move, sources said, stems from apprehensions that rozgar sewaks may misuse their affinity to gram pradhans in carrying out their responsibility. At the same time, the step would allow the state government to check fallacious gram pradhans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-flags-rozgar-sewak-jobs-to-relatives-of-gram-pradhan-under-mnregs-missive-to-dms/articleshow/84808983.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Nagpur||After IMA complaint, technician posing as MD pathologist under police scanner||NAGPUR: The police have started investigating a pathologist in Hasan Bagh following a complaint lodged by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) Nagpur branch. According to IMA, a laboratory technician is using fake degrees and certificates of MBBS and MD to operate, and does not have authority to sign pathology reports and run a full-fledged path lab. Police said they have found gross irregularities in the papers and certificates of the person, but are yet to file a first information report (FIR) and book him under relevant sections. IMA Nagpur president Dr Sanjay Deotale told TOI that a senior pathologist from the city noticed that a person who used to work in his laboratory as a technician has started his own lab in North Nagpur. The doctor informed the IMA headquarters that the person could be a bogus doctor. After initial inquiry, IMA lodged a complaint with Nagpur police. “On our complaint, the commissioner of police started an enquiry. It was revealed that the person has used fake certificates of the qualifications. As per rules, only MD pathologist can sign the reports in any lab. This person has signed the reports without being an MD pathologist, which is against the law,” said Dr Deotale. The investigating officer of the case told TOI that prima facie it appears that the person is a bogus doctor. “However, as the person has claimed that he has some degree in health sciences from a university in Chhattisgarh, we must inquire about it before filing an FIR,” said the officer. IMA members have claimed that the person does not have proper degree or qualification, and will face major legal action soon. TOI tried to contact the pathologist on all the numbers mentioned on his letterhead but there was no response. All three labs mentioned in the letterhead were closed on Tuesday. A senior pathologist from Sakkardara, who initiated the probe into this alleged forgery, said that the person does not have a degree in modern medicine, neither does he have any qualification to sign pathology reports. “He is a technician with DMLT diploma. Now, he has bogus MBBS degree certificate from Chhattisgarh. This case may reveal a major fraud and even a fake degree racket. With IMA support, we will pursue this matter,” said the doctor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-ima-complaint-technician-posing-as-md-pathologist-under-police-scanner/articleshow/84806834.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

On Monday, though varsity officials claimed that those were the missing ones, police did not confirm it as they waited for the forensic team to examine it. Police said that the probe will continue as a case was registered on July 22 based on a complaint filed by the varsity. Police also collected visuals from CCTV cameras in the campus. Kalady SI PA Davis said that the answer sheet will be handed over to the varsity as it is important for publishing the results. However, the varsity will have to produce them in court if need arises. Meanwhile, Sangamesan, a senior faculty member and the president of association, said that the group will continue its protest until the alleged conspiracy behind the missing answer sheets is unravelled. “Such an incident shouldn’t have happened at an academic institution. We demand to know the truth behind the incident and punish the guilty,” he said. The varsity is yet to decide on further course of action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sanskrit-univ-reinstates-suspended-faculty/articleshow/84806868.cms||---

With the new cases, the overall infection tally in the city climbed to 14,36,026. Of this, 14.10 lakh patients have recovered. The death toll stands at 25,046. On Monday, the city saw 39 cases with a positivity rate of 0.07% and one death. On Sunday, 66 Covid cases with a positivity rate of 0.09% and two deaths were reported. On Saturday, Delhi registered 66 cases with a positivity rate of 0.09% and no death. Currently, there are 570 active Covid cases in Delhi, while 154 of them are under home isolation. The number of containment zones stands at 299. The health bulletin issued on Tuesday said 70,248 tests, including 45,645 RT-PCR, were conducted in the past 24 hours. Delhi battled a brutal second wave of the pandemic that claimed a massive number of lives, with the shortage of oxygen in hospitals across the city adding to the woes. On April 20, the capital had reported 28,395 cases — the highest in the city since the beginning of the pandemic. On April 22, the case positivity rate was 36.2%, the highest so far. The maximum number of Covid deaths, 448, was reported on May 3. The capital has recorded 2,320 Covid cases in the past 30 days (since June 25) — averaging 77 cases a day. Experts said, while many people now have immunity against the virus due to previous infections and vaccination, a guarded approach was needed in terms of implementing restrictive measures to avoid a second wave-like crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/77-new-covid-cases-in-city-as-positivity-rate-up-a-tad-to-0-11/articleshow/84806831.cms||---

Some specialist doctors in the city have now been providing ‘can take vaccine’ stamp for such patients approaching them. They alleged that such ‘ignorance’ among rural vaccinators would further slow down the Covid vaccination programme in addition to hesitancy among people. Also, doctors are fielding a range of queries from their patients ranging from asthmatic, cardiac to impotency issues. Zilla parishad CEO Yogesh Kumbhejkar said if they come to know of specific places where vaccinators are seeking fitness certificates, they would take action. “There are no instructions to seek fitness certificate from any type of beneficiaries. PHC staff are not supposed to refer beneficiaries to private hospitals. They are supposed to do all the check-ups and there are very few contra-indications,” he said. Kumbhejkar added that Nagpur district has been smoothly carrying out vaccination with the rural centres crossing 10lakh doses on Tuesday. The zilla parishad has set a target of vaccinating 16lakh people. Dr Rajesh Swarnakar, chief pulmonologist and director of Getwell Hospital, said allergic and asthma patients are not getting vaccines in rural centres. “Exceptions are clearly mentioned and have to be asked to the beneficiary. If the responses are ‘no’, they can be easily vaccinated. But the vaccinators don’t ask these questions but tell them to get it in writing from your doctor. They come to city only to make me write ‘van take vaccine’,” he said. Dr Swarnakar added that vaccination must be done right away on the beneficiaries first visit itself. “Some patients prefer to get vaccinated at our centre instead of carrying back the certificate,” he said. Dr Rashmi Shinde, consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician at Alexis Hospital, too had to issue a fitness certificate to one of her ante-natal care patients. “She had gone to a city government vaccination centre where they asked her to consult treating doctor. She called me up and I spoke to the staff but they insisted on a certificate. She then came for a routine check up and took the certificate,” she said. Queries from people regarding vaccination to city doctors also indicate that government staff deployed in the task is either apathetic or themselves not sure. Cardiologist Dr Aziz Khan said a lot of his patients ask if they can take vaccine or not. “The other common question is which one to take. We tell them both are safe and they must take which ever is available,” he said. Pulmonologist Dr Ashok Arbat too said his asthma and COPD patients do come to get their doubts cleared. But he said no one among his patients has asked for a fitness certificate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rural-centres-seek-fitness-certificates-for-vax/articleshow/84806862.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Where are 70 lakh jobs promised in BJP Sankalp Patra, asks Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Targeting the ruling BJP for the increasing unemployment in the state, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday said the BJP government should release details of the 70 lakh jobs that the party had promised in their Sankalp Patra released in the runup to the 2017 assembly elections. The former UP CM said that the pandemic and the lockdown has only added to the number of jobless youth in the state and unemployment was at a record high in the country in general and the state in particular. “The ruling BJP will complete its five years in government very soon. In sharp contrast to the tall claims of the BJP government, neither any new investment has come to the state nor any new industry has come up. On the contrary, small and medium scale industries are in a bad shape and employment opportunities are shrinking by the day. In such a situation the government is claiming that it is giving jobs to lakhs of people while youths are facing police action for protesting against being deprived of employment opportunities,” Akhilesh said in a statement on Tuesday. Citing a survey report, the former UP CM said in 2018 the unemployment rate was 5.92. Within the next two years it shot up to 9.97 which was double that of the previous year. In 2020 a better part of the year remained under lockdown. “The chief minister must explain the basis on which he claims that the unemployment rate has come down in 2021,” he asked. In February 2020, the government had itself said that unemployment figures had reached 34 lakh. This was 54% more than figures quoted by the government in 2018. In February 2020, 12 lakh youth had got themselves registered as ‘unemployed” on the government website. “On the completion of four years in office, the chief minister announced that his government has given jobs to 4 lakh people which was nothing but an eyewash,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/where-are-70l-jobs-promised-in-bjp-sankalp-patra-asks-akhilesh/articleshow/84809015.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Screening debate spills on to social media||KOLKATA: Professors at several universities and colleges are trying to convince the authorities the merits of having a screening system for undergraduate admissions, though the higher education department is yet to change its decision against entrance tests or interviews. Presidency University and Jadavpur University have still not published their admission criteria, hoping for the government to allow a measure to check the candidates’ aptitude in subjects applied for. The debate has spilled over to social media with professors at reputable colleges and universities writing about the dispute on Facebook. The state government has so far ruled out any entrance test—online or physical—or virtual interview of UG as well as PG candidates, pointing out many students in districts may not have access to smart devices and strong internet connections. Colleges and universities have been told to admit undergraduate students on the basis of Class XII results but teachers said that since none of the boards could conduct the board exams, the results were “not the right reflection of the students’ aptitude” for subjects applied for. Professors at Jadavpur University, where admission tests were held till 2019, have written to the education department, requesting the officials to allow them to adopt some sort of a screening method by dint of the institue’s autonomous status so that the academic standards were not compromised. A professor at the university also took to the social media, pointing out the importance of a screening system. Members of both Arts and Science faculties have proposed different methods of screening, including online interaction, group discussions and weightage to Class X marks. “The formulae devised by the different boards and councils are not scientific and cannot assess a student’s aptitude for the subject he or she applies for. But for admission in a college or university, the authorities have to be sure that the candidate is keen to pursue that particular subject or both the student and the institute would suffer. JU is an autonomous institute and should be allowed to screen interested candidates,” said Partha Pratim Roy, secretary of Jadavpur University Teachers’ Association (JUTA). “We cannot ignore the point of view of the professors because they are ultimately going to teach the children,” said the principal of a south Kolkata college. In fact in many institutes, the assertion by professors has prompted principals and VCs to give a second thought and try to devise a formula. After the West Bengal Joint Entrance Examinations Board cancelled the Presidency entrance examinations for UG and PG courses, the university has not yet made public their criteria for admission. A meeting is scheduled later this week. A senior professor has written on Facebook that admissions should happen through an entrance test. “Presidency is an autonomous university and responsible for its high academic standards. No student should be denied admission but meritorious ones should get their due. The formulae of the boards do not have a scientific basis in evaluating the aptitude of students” said the professor. In colleges, like Lady Brabourne, Scottish Church and RKM Vidyamandira, HoDs have decided how much weightage they would give to the aggregate marks, Class X scores and subject marks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/screening-debate-spills-on-to-social-media/articleshow/84807072.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Delhi||Delhi: 20 Schools of Specialised Excellence to start on Independence Day||NEW DELHI: Twenty Schools of Specialised Excellence (SoSE) will be launched on August 15 catering to students in classes IX to XII. All these schools, which are part of the first phase of the project, will be affiliated to the Delhi Board of School Education (DBSE). Presiding over the second general body meeting of SoSE and DBSE on Tuesday, education minister Manish Sisodia made the announcement. TOI had first reported about the move on July 21, after the Delhi cabinet had, in March, approved the project. The schools will be for those with special aptitude and interest in specific domains of study such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), humanities, performing and visual arts, and high-end 21st-century skills. The government is partnering with Australian Council for Educational Research and Boston Consulting Group to implement the project. Among the 20, eight schools will specialise in science, technology, engineering and maths, five in humanities and high-end 21st-century skills, and two in performing and visual arts. In two years, around 100 such schools will be set up covering all domains in every educational zone in Delhi so that children from across the city can access specialised schools in their neighbourhood. “Students at SoSEs will receive excellent learning opportunities in the area of their interest, which will enable them to join some of the best universities and institutions in the country and abroad. It is important to identify and provide specialised education to students who have a specific aptitude and deep interest,” said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia. In the first year, admissions will be offered in Class IX in humanities, performing and visual arts, and high-end 21st century skills, while in the STEM schools, admissions will be given in classes IX and XI. Students seeking admission to SoSEs will have to take an aptitude test. The schedule will be announced later. “Delhi government is committed towards providing world-class education to the children of Delhi. In the past five years, we have worked to improve the basics of the education system. We are not stopping at this. We now aspire for the best in the world. Our vision is to create government schools in Delhi that would be at par with international schools in the coming years,” said Sisodia. He added, “To create progressive curriculum and assessment structures for Delhi schools, the board is partnering with the renowned research and assessment organisation, which is credited with designing the globally recognised Programme for International Student Assessment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/20-schools-of-excellence-to-start-on-i-day/articleshow/84806478.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi pharma varsity’s ayurvedic Covid drug awaits Ayush nod||NEW DELHI: Delhi Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research University, a state university, has developed a Covid drug called “Coroquil-Zn”. It is now waiting for the approval from Ministry of Ayush. It has already been granted a licence for manufacturing and sales by the Chennai state licensing authority. According to Ramesh K Goyal, vice-chancellor of the university, this is the first-of-its-kind repurposed ayurveda drug. “The drug has been developed by the university in collaboration with Remedium Therapeutics Pvt Ltd, Chennai. Coroquil-Zn has been granted the licence for manufacturing and sales by Jammi Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd, Chennai. Clinical trials phase-3 study for capsules got completed at Sri Lakshmi Super Specialty Hospital, Bengaluru in mild and moderate Covid-19 patients as per the Ayush and ICMR guidelines for pandemic trials,” said Goyal. The patients were in the age group of 23 to 75 years old. The drug is formulated using edible plant ingredients, which were identified by CR Babu, professor emeritus and head of the Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystem at Delhi University at Aravalli Biodiversity Park. “LG Anil Baijal, chancellor of the university, encouraged us to work towards this. Coroquil-Zn modulated ACE-2 receptors of SARS-COV-2 and can prevent and treat the patients of Covid-19 and prevent post-Covid complications,” said Goyal. A study carried out by Dr Kamlesh Singh at University of Missouri helped the varsity work towards developing the drug. The clinical trial was conducted in 120 patients to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug. “The results of clinical studies showed that Coroquil-Zn treatment produced a significant reduction in viral load. It showed 46%, 89% and 100% patients being RT-PCR negative on 5th, 7th and 14th day of treatment, as compared to 6%, 44% and 89%, respectively, in the standard care group. It highlighted a distinct clinical improvement in the severity of dyspnea and recovery rate,” added Goyal. According to the university, among those who had taken the drug, the oxygen saturation level was good throughout the treatment. The patients showed no adverse effects. “Patients also recovered their taste and smell within eight days of consuming the drug. They got discharged from the hospital sooner than standard care patients,” added Goyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-pharma-varsitys-ayurvedic-covid-drug-awaits-ayush-nod/articleshow/84806468.cms||Shradha Chettri

---||Delhi||Delhi: Drain rainwater into waterbodies, Dwarka residents write to officials||NEW DELHI: Residents of Dwarka have written to the authorities to tap rainwater from trunk drain number 2, which usually overflows during monsoon leading to waterlogging in adjacent areas. On Tuesday, too, severe waterlogging was seen across several sectors in Dwarka after overnight showers, which led to traffic snarls. Locals said the water could be diverted to around 40 waterbodies. They also made a request to allow water to flow into Bharat Vandana Park, which would not only utilise the excess runoff but also solve the waterlogging problem. Diwan Singh, an activist residing in Dwarka, who has worked on the revival of a waterbody in Sector 23 over the last five years by diverting stormwater, said runoff from the drain after Tuesday’s rain had reached a park in Sector 23. This rainwater could be put to use elsewhere. “If the waterbody was larger, its level would have risen. But in this case, water flows out and re-enters trunk drain number 2, ultimately going to waste,” said Singh. Singh added that the drain also made its way through Bharat Vandana Park, which was being made at a cost of Rs 530 crore. However, no water was being allowed inside the park, which could easily feed and rejuvenate a pond present within the 220-acre area. In a letter sent to Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on July 8, Singh and Captain SS Mann from citizens’ initiative group Sukh Dukh Ke Saathi (SDKS), raised attention to the problem of rainwater going to waste if it was not diverted in a timely manner. "We request you to open a pathway so that water can reach the waterbody. A breach in a bund also needs to be repaired, otherwise water will pass straight away instead of being diverted to the waterbody,” said the letter. Singh also shared photographs of the overflowing drain. Similar efforts are being made in Dwarka’s Sector 7, where residents from nearby apartments have been working to revive a waterbody. Dr Shikhar Ranjan, a resident of Sector 7, said water accumulates in the depression each time it rains, but tapping runoff from a nearby drain could sustain it through the year. “We believe this was a natural waterbody and migratory birds used to come here. It has dried up over the last few years in the race for development. We are now working hard to bring it back to how it was earlier,” said Ranjan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/drain-rainwater-into-waterbodies-dwarka-residents-write-to-officials/articleshow/84806928.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Police said that the deceased was identified to be Ajith, 25, a resident of Kuttichal near Kattakkada. The body was found under the railway overbridge near Thampanoor around 4pm. While the head was found on the track under the bridge, the body was found a little away towards the Trivandrum Central railway station. It was lying outside the track. An inquest revealed that there were injury marks on the body apparently after being dragged by the train. ‘’Based on the way the body parts were lying we suspect it to be a case of suicide. He might have placed his neck on the track when the train arrived,” said sub-inspector Shakeer Ahmed of Thampanoor government railway police station. Based on the time the body was found, police suspect that the train that was involved in the incident is the Guruvayur Express that conducts service between Trivandrum Central and Guruvayur. As per the schedule, it reaches the station here from Nagercoil around 3.30pm and starts the journey at 5.30pm. As per preliminary information, Ajith was an employee of a restaurant that functioned near Killipalam. The official statements of the relatives of Ajith are yet to be recorded. Following inquest procedures, the body was shifted to the mortuary of Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College Hospital. The post-mortem examination is expected to be conducted on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/decapitated-body-of-youth-found/articleshow/84804393.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The youth, a Chengannur native, received medical treatment at a private hospital in Thiruvalla and is out of danger, said police. Police received an anonymous call about the incident and took the youth’s statement. However, as none of the individuals involved have raised a complaint, no case has been registered. Since an air gun was used for the crime, police are not in a position to register suo moto case, said a police officer. The wife of the Kottayam native, who has a 17-year-old daughter, had eloped with the youth a few days ago. The Chengannur native was married twice earlier. The woman’s husband reached the youth’s house and fired at his private parts with the air gun, police said. “The injury was not grave,” said police. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/man-shoots-at-genitals-of-wifes-lover-in-chengannur/articleshow/84806939.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: ‘Disaster management unit’ for each traffic guard||KOLKATA: One hydraulic ladder, bullet chain saws, tree pruners, axes, insulator wire cutters, dragon lights, petrol driven circular saws, diesel pump sets, aluminium ladders, diesel pumps and high voltage electrical gloves. These are items each of the 25 traffic guards in the city will be procuring in an effort for enhanced disaster response and cut down delays in response to disasters. The tender for the massive procurements — ranging to around 25-30 pieces of each equipment save the lone hydraulic ladder — was floated on Monday. According to Lalbazar, once the items are procured — subject to final clearance from the finance department — cops will be trained to handle these equipment. “Once these items reach local cops, there will be less dependence on Kolkata police Disaster Management Group (DMG) personnel, who rush all the way from the PTS to the incident spot. The local police can begin basic rescue operations even as the DMG can concentrate on chalking out a plan, using their expertise for some challenging rescues and clearing the area quickly. No cop will be seen waiting impatiently for back-up to arrive to cut off tree branches blocking roads or asking for saws to rescue those trapped under partially fallen buildings,” explained an officer. Local police personnel are usually the first to reach any disaster site and the traffic police — the most visible on roads — are usually often the first respondents. But there is still no clarity about their role in such a scenario and it depends on individuals on how they respond. “The experience of Amphan and Yaas — and the death of a cop at a fire at Strand Road earlier this year — has established that there is no point in rushing to such spots without having basic equipment,” said an officer at Lalbazar. It has been suggested in various police studies across India that local police should be given specialised training in disaster management. Some studies have stated that the disaster management acts and policies, police acts and police manuals should be amended to include disaster management as “one of the core functions of police.” The local police must be trained, equipped and supported with legislation and logistics so that they find themselves capable to support the victims in the golden hour,” the studies stated. A senior cop stated that the idea was not to replace the DMG or break it into smaller units. “Instead, the cops will only augment the work of the DMG. They will help in effective disaster management as an added force, not as replacement. The thrust, thus, just like in case of the divisional forensic teams, is to ensure that emergency services are offered at the earliest,” said an officer. At present, three companies of DMG of Kolkata Police have been operating in the city with full equipment. The Kolkata Police Search and Rescue teams have been equipped with latest model equipment. They have three wings — water wing, CSSSR & MFR Wing and the tree cutting team and have 176 posts assigned to it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/disaster-mgmt-unit-for-each-traffic-guard/articleshow/84804427.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||Delhi rains: Vasant Kunj residents huff and puff as water gushes into homes||NEW DELHI: People in Pocket C Sector A of Vasant Kunj are exasperated by the flooding of internal roads and ground floors of the flats every time it rains. The residents claimed to have spoken to civic authorities about this problem for many years but had failed to get any relief. “For nine years, the residents have suffered from waterlogging. Around two month ago, a pipeline was laid to divert the water from low-lying areas in this pocket to a nearby baoli, the first rainfall showed that the pipe was choked and waterlogging was the result,” said Rahul Kumar, a resident of the area. “It was cleaned, but the heavy rainfall on Tuesday again inundated the area.” Residents also grumbled that the construction of ramps at the entrance of Smriti Van in 2019 had diverted water from the main roads towards the colony. “Rainwater can easily percolate in the forest area but the construction of the ramp made the water flow to our pocket,” said resident Syed Raza Iman. “After a few hours of rain, our houses get flooded and our furniture is damaged. Even our toilets and sewers backflow, probably because they can’t bear the pressure. We were expecting some relief this time as DDA had laid a pipeline for the water, but nothing changed.” The frustrated residents got South Delhi Municipal Corporation to desilt the stormwater drain during lockdown and also asked DA to clear other drains to avoid waterlogging. A Delhi Development Authority (DDA) official admitted to receiving information from the RWA about the waterlogging in the area. The official said this was not due to the new pipeline becoming choked, but only because of obstructions in the natural flow of water. “We are looking into the matter and trying to resolve it. We want to help the residents, which is why we laid the new pipeline from the area to the baoli.” An SDMC official added that the civic body was arranging pumps and would get all the drains properly unclogged. “However, since this is a low-lying area, the baoli backflows when it rains heavily and a lot of water accumulates in the pond,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vk-residents-huff-and-puff-as-water-gushes-into-homes/articleshow/84806404.cms||---

The three arrested accused -- Mohammed Noor, Rehmatullah and Shabiullah -- were involved in human trafficking, gold smuggling and helping other refugees, including women and children illegally sneak into India, the ATS claimed. Another member of the gang is absconding and likely to be in Hyderabad. “Mohammed Noor was a Bangladeshi and mastermind of gang, while Rehmatullah and Shabiullah were Rohingyas. They were involved in human trafficking, gold smuggling and helping refugees sneak into country via various channels,” said ADG (law and order), Prashant Kumar. Kumar also said that Noor used to lure women from Myanmar on the pretext of marriage and lure men with promises of jobs. "They would sneak illegally into India and be given jobs in factories," Kumar said, adding "the trio also prepared fake certificates of Indian identity for men to get jobs while the women were trafficked.” IG, ATS, GK Goswamy, said that based on electronic surveillance, the sleuths tracked the gang members along with the two girls at Ghaziabad railway station. They were going to Delhi on Brahmaputra Mail. “We arrested three and rescued the two girls who were sent to Asha Jyoti Kendra in Lucknow. We will question them later," said Goswamy. The ATS sources also said that Noor was residing in the state illegally since 2012 while his other accomplices would be questioned. The ATS sources also said that the two girls were about to be taken to Jammu by a local youth for marriage. The youth was also questioned and then let off. Sources privy to the probe also disclosed that Noor and his aides had boarded the train from Kamakhya in Assam.

There were massive traffic jams at ITO, Pragati Maidan, Rail Bhawan, Dhaula Kuan, Najafgarh Road, GT Karnal Road, Vikas Marg, Ring Road, Sangam Vihar, Kirari and Pul Prahladpur, among other places. After several parts of NCR received heavy rainfall on Tuesday morning, waterlogging affected vehicular movement in Gurgaon, Noida & Delhi. Parts of NCR witnessed morning showers, which offered some respite from the humidity. “Some areas witnessed waterlogging due to which there were heavy traffic jams as well. Our field staff are on the ground and we have been closely observing the situation,” a PWD official said. At 1.40 pm, the then Delhi Police commissioner Balaji Srivastava tweeted, “Daily heavy traffic jam en-route to Parliament near Rail Bhawan. Needs attention at senior levels of DTP (Delhi Traffic Police) and proper traffic management.” Visuals of autos stuck, and cars and buses partially submerged at Pragati Maidan and Mathura Road went viral. The stretches where jams were reported during the day were cleared for commuters by the evening. One of the commuters who was stuck in a traffic jam near Vikas Marg said that there was no alternate route to his office. “I got late by two hours and my half day’s salary will now be deducted,” said Gitanshu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/traffic-crawls-people-stuck-on-road-for-hrs/articleshow/84806408.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Probe underway for assault on goldsmiths, pitiable conditions||HYDERABAD: Days after a few goldsmiths were thrashed in Ghansi Bazaar on allegations of theft, police and activists widely condemned the incident and highlighted the pitiable condition of migrant workers in Old City. Laxmikanth, one of the stone fitting workers, who was also beaten along with others on July 21, told TOI that they were first thrashed mercilessly, forced to accept stealing the gold and were locked up in a dingy room. “I have been working for the last 5 years as a stone fitting worker. Some of us have not been paid for the last two years and during lockdown many were sent back with meagre amount and when we resumed work, the dues have not been cleared,” said Laxmikant. “On the basis of suspicion, not only me, but other workers were also beaten up black and blue in a locked room on charges of small amount of gold. But truth is we wanted our dues. Luckily, I managed to escape and rushed to the Charminar police station and registered a complaint,” said Laxmikanth. Many workers are brought to the Old City from the districts of West Bengal and are forced to carry out work on meagre pay without facilities in narrow rooms. Parveen Sultan, MIM corporator of Ghansi Bazaar division, protested on Tuesday in Chelapura area and urged the police to take stern action against the accused employers. “We have received some videos which showed how the employees’ hands were tied to gas cylinders and how they were beaten up mercilessly. We came to know that workers were beaten up on suspicion of stealing gold but my question is, who are they to take the law in their hands to decide the punishment? Such an attitude with the employees in the Old City will not be tolerated at all,” said Parveen Sultana. The labour department and child welfare departments were also urged to visit the Chelapura area to find out about the workers’ condition and rescue minor employees. There are at least 500 such establishments in the Old City where workers are put in dingy rooms to clean gold and prepare ornaments. A case has been registered against accused persons and investigation is on. “We have registered a case and investigation is on,” said SHO Charminar, Guru Naidu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/probe-underway-for-assault-on-goldsmiths-pitiable-conditions/articleshow/84806969.cms||Omar bin Taher

Considering a petition seeking a CBI probe, a division bench of Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly said those who suspect that the state government is aiding the accused cannot be found fault with. The accused not being arrested shows the inaction on the part of the government and delay in arrests may lead to destruction of evidence, the court said. Advocate general submitted that the delay in arrest is due to Covid-19. He also submitted that one of the accused was granted an interim anticipatory bail. However, the court asked why the arrest of the other accused in the remaining 700 cases were delayed for the reason that one accused was given bail. The court then directed the government to file a statement regarding the steps taken to arrest the accused, including details such as dates of registration of cases, offences charged, and circumstances preventing arrests. Though the government informed the court that the details can be furnished in a sealed cover, the petitioner’s counsel opposed this. The court then directed the government to file the details as a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/why-no-arrests-yet-hc-asks-govt/articleshow/84807002.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Fake call centre busted, 11 arrested||KOLKATA: The anti-rowdy section of the detective department has arrested 11 men from an office at the IT Park on Taratala Road for allegedly running a fake customer care service of an American e-commerce giant. The gang, claimed police, wanted to take advantage of the two-day sale offered by the e-commerce giant and targeted hundreds of customers. The usual targets for this gang were UK citizens whom they used to call as representatives of the e-commerce giant. “The accused would pose as employees of the company and make calls to the United Kingdom for conducting a lifestyle survey. They used VoIP calls each time,” a police officer said. The accused hail from Beniapukur, Tiljala and Watgunge areas (some are also from Budge Budge and Mahershtala). All the accused are aged between 19 and 36. “On July 26, a raid was conducted on the third floor of the IT Park. During the raid, it was established that an illegal call centre was running from there,” stated joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. “The usual modus operandi of these gangs is to send fake messages to phone numbers and email IDs of e-commerce customers, telling them that $1,000 had been credited to their accounts. When the customer calls back to know more about it, the accused threatens him or her, saying their security number has been hacked. The target would then be made to pay up in form of gift vouchers from the company store, which the accused would redeem later. We are ascertaining if a similar modus operandi was followed here or they employed a different plan,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fake-call-centre-busted-11-arrested/articleshow/84804448.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||34 held under UAPA in Delhi in 2020, Lok Sabha told||NEW DELHI: As many as nine cases were registered and 34 persons arrested in Delhi under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act during the year 2020, a significant increase over 2019 when just 2 cases were registered and 9 persons arrested here under the same law. In a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, minister of state for home Nityanand Rai declined to name the persons against whom UAPA charges had been slapped last year, saying that “disclosure of further details of cases may not be in larger public interest as the same may impact the cases”. While no further details were given, it can be safely assumed that the spike in number of UAPA cases and arrests last year was largely on account of riots that broke out in parts of the national Capital in February 2020. Interestingly, a look at NCRB data -- cited in a MHA reply to a Lok Sabha question dated March 9, 2021 -- regarding cases registered and persons arrested under UAPA in Delhi since 2015 shows that the numbers in 2020 were highest in past six years. While two cases were registered and 9 arrested under the anti-terror law in 2019, 2 cases and 8 arrests were recorded in 2018, six cases and 9 arrests in 2017, 4 cases and 12 arrests in 2016 and 3 cases and 3 arrests in 2015. While granting bail to three Delhi February 2020 riots case accused – Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and Asif Iqbal Tanha – last month, the Delhi high court had observed that right to protest is a fundamental right that could not be termed as a “terrorist act”. The high court said it was constrained to note that in its anxiety to suppress dissent and in the morbid fear that matters may get out of hand, “the state has blurred the line between the constitutionally guaranteed ‘right to protest’ and ‘terrorist activity’. “If such blurring gains traction, democracy would be in peril,” it had noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/34-held-under-uapa-in-delhi-in-2020-ls-told/articleshow/84806963.cms||Bharti Jain
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Fake IPS officer, two aides held after attempt to extort Rs 2 lakh from trader||KOLKATA: Police on Monday evening arrested a 45-year-old man for posing as an IPS officer with the National Investigation Agency. Two of his aides have also been picked up. The accused has been identified as Rajarshi Bhattacharya alias Babai, a resident of Belghoria. His aides have been identified as Abhijit Das (43), a resident of Jagacha in Howrah and Md Sikander (38), a resident of Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road in Taltala. Bhattacharya had a security guard constantly “protecting” him all through the day. He also had a full-time driver and a SUV “assigned to him by the government” . The car had a blue beacon, a police logo and the mandatory police flag. He ran out of luck after he demanded Rs 2 lakh from a trader residing in the Ekbalpore area. The victim — identified as Zakir Hossain — had approached Park Street police with the complaint of threat a couple of days ago and the anti-rowdy section of the detective department took up the investigation. “He had threatened to arrest Hossain as quickly as possible if the money was not paid up,” said and officer. “We came to know that his original job was to buy and sell paintings. He had started claiming himself as an IPS when his profits shrunk during the pandemic. Bhattacharya hired a car and kept moving around in various hotels where he kept repeating that he was an IPS officer. He had spent a lot to pass himself off as an IPS. He had gone to a studio and had made a portfolio with the “uniform”, which he began using indiscriminately. We are certain that he has duped and extorted others,” said an investigating officer. “We have booked the accused under IPC sections pertaining to impersonating a public servant, extortion, cheating and criminal conspiracy,” said joint CP (Crime) Murlidhar Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fake-ips-officer-two-aides-held-after-attempt-to-extort-rs-2l-from-trader/articleshow/84804455.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Patna||Sand mining case: Bihar govt suspends 2 IPS officers, 15 others||PATNA: The state government on Tuesday suspended two IPS officers and 15 others, including 4 sub-divisional police officers (SDPOs), for their alleged nexus with sand mining mafia in six districts. According to the mines and geology department minister Janak Ram, illegal sand mining in Sone river resulted in Rs700 crore annual loss to the state revenue. The IPS officers suspended are Sudheer Kumar Porika and Rakesh Kumar Dubey. Porika is a 2010 batch IPS officer while Dubey was promoted to the IPS cadre sometimes back. They had recently been removed as SP of Aurangabad and Bhojpur, respectively. Tanveer Ahmed, Pankaj Kumar Rawat, Anup Kumar and Sanjay Kumar, who were also removed reently as SDPO of Paliganj, Bhojpur, Aurangabad Sadar and Dehri, respectively, on similar charges, have also been suspended. The axe has also fallen on former Dehri SDO Sunil Kumar Singh, three circle officers, one motor vehicle inspector and six officers of the mines and geology department. All were removed from field posting hardly 13 days back after an internal inquiry by the Economic Offences Unit (EOU) of state police against 42 officers as they were found to be acting in connivance with the sand smugglers. As per the home department’s resolution, Porika and Dubey had been found to be allegedly not acting responsibly on illegal sand mining, storage and transportation, they were assisting those involved in such activities along with themselves, failed to keep effective control on their subordinates in respective districts and had been of suspected character. A decision has been taken to initiate departmental proceedings against them. The resolution also reads that they are being suspended with immediate effect, looking at the serious nature of allegations against them. It has been also mentioned in the resolution that the decision has been taken on the inquiry report of the EOU and recommendations made by the DGP. The fear of getting booked for amassing disproportionate assets is also looming over all these erring officers as the EOU is conducting preliminary inquiry against them to know how much (if any) illegal gratification they have taken and amassed properties from sand mafia to allow them illegal mining rampantly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/two-ips-officers-and-15-others-suspended-in-sand-mining-case/articleshow/84804522.cms||Debashish Karmakar

On Tuesday, chief secretary (CS) Somesh Kumar informed the high court that the state would allot a 475 square yard plot at Bharani layout in Jubilee Hills to Vadapalli Malathi Rao, the widow of slain IFS officer Venkateswara Rao who was killed in a terror attack on Indian Embassy in Kabul in July 2008. But when he sought three more months to transfer it to her, the bench said: “She has been patiently waiting for the plot for the last 12 years. It would be unfair on your part to seek a long time. Do it immediately.” The bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy, which had earlier converted a letter written by the widow to the CJ as a writ petition, told the CS to complete the registration of conveyance deed within three weeks. The bench also asked Malathi to visit the proposed site and check the measurements of the plot. The bench then told CV Bhaskar Reddy, the counsel for the revenue department, to convey this message to the widow. The government pleader also assured the court that he would ensure that the tahsildar accompanied her during her visit to the plot. When the state counsel insisted that they needed more time as they had to obtain approval of Telangana State Land Management Authority for allotting this plot, the bench said: “You make your efforts and let the authority take expeditious steps to accord the approval. Let the district collector and the tahsildar execute the conveyance deed by Aug 21.” The case has now been posted to Aug 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/12-yr-wait-for-plot-ends-for-ifs-officers-widow/articleshow/84806948.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh to stick with 12 lakh population to meet Covid vaccination target||CHANDIGARH: With no reply received from the Union health ministry regarding the census population, the health department will go with 12 lakh as the total population to meet its goal of vaccinating 7.12 lakh eligible beneficiaries by next month. The Census department also projects the same population. The Government of India however, has projected a target population of 15 lakh instead of 7.12 lakh. “The principal health secretary wrote several letters to GOI but we have not heard anything,” said director, health services, UT, Dr Amandeep Kang. Initially, the health department was adhering to electoral rolls but after officials in the Union ministry of health and family welfare informed the UT health department that they had followed census data for 15 lakh eligible beneficiaries, the department considered the census projected population in 2021. Therefore, they added 17.3% to the 2011 count of 10.55 lakh. “Then also, the eligible population was not more than 7 lakh. If we follow the 15 lakh eligible population, the total population of Chandigarh comes to 23 lakh,” said the director, health services. In May, the health secretary, in his letter to GoI, stated, “There is a vast difference between the projected population on the basis of census 2011data and the actual figures. The actual number as per electoral rolls in various categories duly updated in the current year is expected to be more close to the actual population than the projected population of 2011 census.” According to the census department in Chandigarh, the urban population in Chandigarh projected for 2021 is 12.08 lakh with an increase of urban population by 17.3%. Till date, over five lakh beneficiaries have received the first dose of the vaccine, while around 2 lakh have been fully immunised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-to-stick-with-12-lakh-population-to-meet-vaccination-target/articleshow/84804453.cms||Shimona Kanwar

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Rain recedes but Osman Nagar still under water||HYDERABAD: It has been about two weeks since heavy rains wreaked havoc in several parts of the city. However, even as the rains receded, and most areas recovered from inundation, residents of Osman Nagar, on the outskirts of Old City, are still reeling under the flood impact. With over 200 houses still submerged in surplus water from Osman Nagar Lake, algae and sewage, angry locals allege that their pleas to officials to drain out excess water have fallen on deaf ears. Officials, however, said that many houses have been built on lake FTL area which was why they were still under water. The entire locality had been under water for about six months after the floods of October 2020. Residents claim that closure of outlet channels to protect nearby colonies from getting flooded was one of the reasons for flooding last year. “After last year’s flood, education minister Sabita Indira Reddy had inspected the area and later officials of Jalpally municipality started constructing the bund to stop the surplus water from Osman Nagar Lake flooding the area. But that has not stopped the water from flooding the area,” said Summaya Begum, a resident of Osman Nagar. Waheed Ahmed (65), who has been sleeping in a nearby mosque since the recent rains, said, “My entire house is filled with rainwater. It is not true that we have encroached the lake FTL. These houses were sold to us by previous owners and have got them registered legally.” But officials of Jalpally municipality said that several affected houses were on the lake’s FTL area. “We cannot do anything about it as the case is pending in high court. We have arranged for temporary shelters and started reconstructing the bund to prevent flooding,” said G Praveen Kumar, commissioner, Jalpally municipality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rain-recedes-but-osman-nagar-still-under-water/articleshow/84807001.cms||Moulika.KV

NGT on May 25 had issued an order stating that the entire flood plain zone of Vishwamitri river should be mapped and demarcated. The order had also stated that unauthorized, illegal structures should be removed and river’s integrity should be maintained and restored. The order was issued in connection to the Vishwamitri River Action Plan. Last month, the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) had started cleaning up the river’s bank after which a group of concerned citizens led by environment activist Rohit Prajapati issued notices to all the authorities stating that the civic body was violating NGT’s order. Terming the entire exercise as utterly destructive, the group of citizens said that the activities are in violation of various orders, directions and acts specifically The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and NGT’s order of May 25. “GPCB being nodal agency requests to examine the suggestion given by the applicant and also to take necessary action for ensuring compliance to NGT order.

It was caused due to a bus breakdown and no effort was reportedly made to remove it. He directed joint commissioner (traffic) Sanjay Kumar to submit a report on the incident and possible corrective measures by the end of the day. “Today there was a heavy traffic jam from Sunehri Masjid roundabout to Rail Bhavan roundabout and towards Parliament… One of the reasons was that a bus broke down on Red Cross Road. This bus probably broke down around 7.30am on Tuesday. In the morning briefing, you did not mention this important issue to me. The control room also did not tell me this,” Chander wrote. The joint CP was asked to report about the efforts made by the traffic police to handle the situation apart from informing the transport authorities, DTC/DIMTS.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Crooks target senior cop, create fake FB profile to ask for money||KOLKATA: The director of security, Vivek Sahay, became the latest victim of cyber crooks who are increasingly targeting IPS officers by creating fake Facebook profiles in their names and then asking for monetary help using Messenger services. On Monday, Sahay himself took to Facebook to warn his contacts on social media not to be cheated by these crooks. He even shared a screenshot of such a cyber criminal seeking Rs 15,000 as a one-time help. “Someone had cloned my account and has been asking for money from the number below (the screen shared by the senior IPS officer). Please be careful. As per advice given by cyber experts, it has nothing to do with your password or your profile. This guy has created a spoofed Messenger box. Such gangs operate mainly from Ghaziabad or Patna. We will work out (the gang). Only request is to alert all people in your friend list. No one should end up paying something,” he posted in his first message. He then posted a second update on the same. “I have also changed my profile picture . So don’t accept any request coming in my name from a different profile picture,” he stated. Sahay received a number of messages from his contacts on social media — especially Facebook — stating they have received a fresh friend request. They said that now that they have been warned, they will not fall in the trap. The senior officer later locked his profile to stop any further attack on his account.  In March earlier this year, several senior Kolkata and Bengal police officers — including a senior IPS officer from central Kolkata and a divisional DCP — had fallen prey to similar cyber frauds. Both IPS officers had taken to social media to warn people from falling prey to such fake profiles. But this is the first time in recent memory that crooks targeted a top official like ADG Sahay who looks after the security of chief minister Mamata Banerjee.

---||Hyderabad||ACB fails to track Disproportionate Assets cases, blames Covid for poor show||HYDERABAD: The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has not registered a single Disproportionate Assets (DA) case this year. The DA cases are essential to catch corrupt officials in senior positions as they seldom take bribes directly. Last year, most of the major arrests done by ACB were in DA cases. So far, the ACB has registered 43 cases in the state but not a single corrupt official has been booked for possession of disproportionate assets. In 2020, ACB sleuths registered seven disproportionate assets cases, three less than what they had registered in 2019. Assets cases play a significant role in keeping a check on corrupt government officials as the bureau officials focus on those who have amassed massive wealth through corrupt practices while being careful to dodge the traps set by anti-corruption agencies. For example, in 2020, ACB registered DA cases against Medak additional collector G Nagesh, Malkajgiri ACP Y Narasimha Reddy, Mahbubnagar municipal commissioner V Surender, Kamareddy DSP T Laxmi Narayana, joint director and district veterinary and animal husbandry officer of Mancherial district T Yellanna, Shabad CI B Shankaraiah and Shaikpet tahsildar Ch Sujatha. The market value of the disproportionate assets unearthed from the accused officials was over Rs 100 crore and according to the investigating officers of the DA cases, it is very difficult to trap such officials red-handed as they often operate through middlemen. ACB sources said that the pandemic has had an effect on the performance of the bureau and that not enough work has gone into registration of DA cases in 2021 due to the lockdown. They said that about 15 senior inspectors working in the bureau, who are key to gathering background information on corrupt senior government officials, getting promoted as DSPs and moving out of ACB is also one of the reasons for the poor show. The ACB added that 25 recently-promoted inspectors joined the ACB and the lockdown was imposed just as they were about to undergo two months training. “We might see a few DA cases in the next five months,” said an ACB official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/acb-fails-to-track-da-cases-blames-covid-for-poor-show/articleshow/84806995.cms||Mahesh Buddi

Various law and order police teams along with crime teams have solved 176 cases of property crimes including burglaries, robberies, thefts and recovered Rs 1.5 crore worth stolen property. In the normal procedure to obtain lost property recovered by the police, a victim has to approach court after obtaining relevant documents from the police. “I have been thinking of helping the victims by directly handing over the lost property to them by coordinating with the judicial system. With a lot of effort from various wings of police department and their coordination with lawyers and judicial officers, today we could organise the recovery mela,” Cyberabad commissioner V C Sajjanar said. On Tuesday, under the supervision of Cyberabad commissioner VC Sajjanar, the recovered property was returned to the victims through proper legal procedure. Police returned 93.1 tola gold, 360.2 tola silver, Rs 30.6 lakh cash, 90 vehicles, 35 cell phones and 11 other articles to the victims, who thanked police while expressing their happiness at the event. “We had reported about theft at Pochamma temple in Bhudevi Colony of Alwal.

This is the first time BIS officials sealed a jewellery shop after the Union government made hallmarking of gold jewellery mandatory from June 16, 2021. On a tip off, the BIS officials conducted a raid on the jewellery shop at Mirylaguda on Monday and found the store owner was using the BIS hallmark on gold and silver jewellery without obtaining approval. “We have noticed that the shopkeeper was using a laser marking machine for using spurious BIS hallmark,” BIS, Hyderabad, head, and scientist-E KV Rao said in an official release issued here on Tuesday. Based on the evidence, action was being initiated against the offender under Section 29 of the BIS Act If convicted, the offender might be imprisoned up to two years or pay a fine of not less than Rs two lakh, it said. “In fact, BIS is the designated authority to implement hallmarking of gold jewellery to check purity, and BIS certified and granted licences to 35 assaying & hallmarking centres in Telangana and 48 centres in Andhra Pradesh,” Rao told TOI. “Consumers can check for certified jewellers using BIS Care (mobile app) or portal: http://www.bis.gov.in,” he appealed. The BIS official also said that consumers could register complaints, if they notice misuse of BIS hallmark, on mail: hhybo@bis.gov.in and the source of information would be kept confidential.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/illegal-bis-hallmark-centre-sealed/articleshow/84807048.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Beating Covid fears, visitors go ‘forest bathing’||NAGPUR: With Covid-19 cases drastically falling in the region, and restrictions on movement being relaxed, families stuck indoors for over 20 months are going in for ‘forest bathing’ in the buffer zones. Forest bathing is simply being in nature, with tiger sighting not on the minds of visitors. Many people have been going for pleasure trips apparently to de-stress and relax after going through a tormenting time during Covid-19 first and second wave. “The flow of visitors has increased in Tadoba buffer during monsoon, like never before. We have improved safari roads for 14 entry gates. From July 1, when tourism started, 1,922 vehicles have entered through these gates till July 27. This comes to 72 Gypsys per day. This is more than what we witnessed in 2019. Last year, tourism was closed due to Covid,” said G Guruprasad, deputy conservator of forests (buffer). Most of the visitors are entering from either Mohurli or Kolara. At a distance of 115km from Nagpur, both MP Pench, and Tadoba seem to be the preferred choice for visitors. “This month, almost all resorts were occupied at Kolara and Mohurli during weekends. This has helped meet our expenses and recover some losses from the closure,” said resort owner Nikhil Abhyankar, Kolara. “The situation is similar at MP Pench, where there is no room during weekends. People from entire Vidarbha and MP are flocking here. Instead of taking long tours fearing Covid, people are going for small budgeted forest trips. Such a crowd was never witnessed earlier. The RT-PCR test, which was mandatory in June, is also not being sought now,” said Robin Sonkar, one of the resort owners at Turia. MP Pench field director Vikram Singh Parihar said, “It is true that Telia and Rukhad gates in the buffer are witnessing local crowd. Barring the closure period of 52 days this tourism season, 20,000 tourists visited the buffer zone. This is 25% of total visitors entering the core zone. On one day this season, 52 vehicles entered buffer. Sighting of black panther and boating at Rukhad have become star attractions. The forest too has turned lush green. People are visiting forest areas as a safe destination after being indoors for long due to Covid.” “After being glued to computers for online exams and studies, my daughters just wanted a break and hence we visited Kolara on Saturday to simply spend time in nature and de-stress ourselves. Though tigers were not on our mind, it was a bonus as we sighted a full-grown male in Sirkada from five feet. Ours was the only vehicle to sight the tiger,” said Manoj Salpekar, an educationist from the city. Salpekar said the entire surroundings near the forest is enchanting due to green cover and water bodies filled to the brim. A relaxed, meandering walk amid the chirping of birds takes away all stressful thoughts. The resort owners serving onion pakodas with chai in the breezy monsoon made our trip delightful, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/beating-covid-fears-visitors-go-forest-bathing/articleshow/84807040.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Hyderabad||Groups pressure govt ahead of Huzurabad bypoll||HYDERABAD: The ensuing bypoll in Huzurabad has come in handy for various organisations to exert pressure on TRS government to concede to their demands. Chairman of national weavers united joint action committee, an umbrella of 24 weavers’ welfare associations, Dasu Suresh, said a round-table conference on Tuesday resolved that widows of weavers, who died by suicide due to lack of support from government, will file nominations from Huzurabad and campaign to defeat the ruling TRS if chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao did not respond to their demands by August 7. “After the formation of Telangana state, 360 handloom weavers ended their lives due to financial and health issues. The JAC is demanding Rs 10 lakh ex-gratia to each family and Rs 3,000 per month financial support to every weaver aged over 18 years,” Suresh said. The Arya Vysya Chaitanya Porata Samithi has decided 100 of its members will file nominations in Huzurabad. Likewise, the ousted field assistants of MGNREGS have decided to enter the fray. While the Vysyas are demanding KCR implement his long-pending promise of establishing a Vysya Corporation with Rs 1,000 crore budget, the field assistants want their jobs back and contracts renewed. Porata samithi national president Prem Gandhi told TOI they were aware that ruling parties did not succumb to pressure tactics. “But, filing of nominations is an attempt to bring it to the CM’s notice the seriousness of our issue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/groups-pressure-govt-ahead-of-bypoll/articleshow/84809152.cms||Roushan Ali

The petition was filed by Veerappan M of Nellichode near Vallangi in Palakkad against his sons 50-year-old Sivadasan, 47-year-old Radhakrishnan, and 46-year-old Ramachandran. As a good father, he had gifted one acre of land to each of his three sons and had also constructed a house. However, his sons have been harassing him with the demand to transfer rest of his properties to them. Instead of taking care of their parents, his sons have made their lives a living hell, the petition said. His wife has been suffering from chronic kidney ailments and blood clog in her skull and is bedridden. He has arranged for his wife’s treatment at Sai Hospital at Palakkad through his daughter, who is married and settled in Palakkad. However, his sons are not permitting him to take his wife out of the house to go to the hospital, said the plea. Even though a complaint was filed before the station house officer at Nenmara police station seeking protection, no action was taken, the petition filed through advocate Nireesh Mathew said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/88-yr-old-moves-hc-against-sons/articleshow/84807085.cms||---

The high court and district courts had shifted to virtual mode after the outbreak of Covid-19 last year. A Narasimha Reddy, state bar council chairman, reportedly suggested a phased reopening of both the high court and trial courts. “More caution needs to be exercised at the trial courts,” he said. He also referred to the experience of the courts at Karnataka that went physical. “At high court too, some hybrid work arrangements could be made allowing some courts to go virtual for a few days in a week,” he said. The norms related to mask, sanitisation and social distance should be ensured, the bar leaders said in an informal meet with Chief Justice Hima Kohli.

---||Lucknow||Less than 0.5% respondents oppose Uttar Pradesh population control bill||LUCKNOW: Debarring defaulters from even contesting Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections, confiscating their right to vote and relaxation in abortion rules are some of over 8,500 suggestions that the State Law Commission has received about the proposed Population Control Draft Bill. Less than 0.5% suggestions are against the bill. Those opposing the draft bill have expressed fear that the two-child norm would give rise to sex-determination tests during pregnancy and even female foeticide. Out of 8,500 recommendations that the commission has received, just around 40 are against the bill. The commission has prepared a 2,000-page document after collating all the suggestions from the general public. On the basis of their nature, the suggestions/recommendations have been divided into 53 categories. A large number of former bureaucrats, high court judges, lawyers and even NRIs have sent their views on the draft bill and suggested modifications, the commission sources told TOI. State Law Commission chairman Justice AN Mittal told TOI that the panel was considering all the suggestions, modifications and criticism in the light of the Constitution of India. He said that the Commission hoped to submit the draft bill with the state government latest by the second week of August. According to sources, the majority of people have suggested barring those violating the Population Control Act from contesting even MLA and MP elections, while the commission has already recommended debarring such violators from contesting local elections. Sources said that such suggestions cannot be entertained as the state government doesn’t have the right over Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha polls. Many people have suggested that there should be complete restriction on polygamy and the that right to vote of those having more than two children should be curtailed. A few suggested that those who are having two daughters should be permitted to have a third child in hope of male child. There are a few who have recommended not to count daughters; others want parents having more than two children to be kept away from government ration, contracts, tender or licences. Some of them have also suggested that the benefit of reservation should not be extended to couples who breach the two-child norm. Some are of the view that Abortion law should be relaxed because sometimes family planning methods fail. Some have even suggested honorarium to mothers having two or less children. A few of them also suggested that the law should be linked with Aadhaar while others expressed concern that the proposed law would increase sex determination tests during pregnancy which can lead to rise in case of foeticide. There are some who feel that the proposed law is a violation of the right to privacy. Some criticised the bill draft as it did not speak about single mothers or fathers. There were a few who wanted to know what would happen for divorced spouses, who remarry, widow or widower, etc. Some also suggested that there should be free Haj pilgrimage for Muslims who adhere to the two-child norm. One person has also suggested a break of at least five increments if a government servant violates the two-child norm. Some were of the view that by giving incentives for having one child, the Hindu community would become older after 20 years while others opined that the proposed law should not apply on SC/STs as is being done in Assam. There were opinions like either of the couple be given a government job for following the one-child norm. Suggestions were also given to exempt Armed Forces personnel from this law as there has been tradition in various families to send their children to the army.

Raju, however, denied the charges. YSRC Rajya Sabha MP V Vijaya Sai Reddy said AP police found evidence which, prime facie, prove money laundering and violation of provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act. “The CID, during the course of investigation of a case registered in Mangalagiri, conducted an FSL analysis on Raju’s phone which has revealed a hawala transaction of one million euros,” he alleged. The MPs said the proof of hawala transactions, referred to as ‘angadia,’ could be found in the phone messages which were exchanged between Raju and a Telugu TV channel. “The chats reveal transfer of one million euros proving money laundering and making a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and FEMA. There is a transaction of a certain ‘3’ which is the amount in crores through hawala with a promise to give the balance a day after,” alleged the MPs. They said the transaction was to the tune of Rs 11 crore. Enforcement Directorate sources said they have received the complaint and will look into it. Meanwhile, Raju has denied any hawala transaction taking place. He said: “The CID police led by PV Sunil Kumar forcibly took my phone and created messages to several people. I filed a complaint with Delhi police alleging that my phone was stolen and messages were sent.” Raju further alleged: “The CID is using the Pegasus spyware. Their allegations are vague.

Interviews began a week ago with 124 candidates applying. The post is open to Indian Ordnance Factories Service (IOFS) officers and senior officers from other departments. Sources said 84 candidates have already been interviewed and the process is ongoing. The selected candidates would constitute the interim chairperson and interim board of directors. The post is open for senior officials from the department of defence production, other defence PSUs, armed forces, and controller general of defence accounts (CGDA). The new board will do away with the existing structure of directorate general of Ordnance Factory Board (DGOFB) and members. The current DG is slated to retire in a couple of months with some of the members superannuating. The team will be replaced by chairpersons and board of directors for seven different PSUs. The selected candidates will be put under deemed deputation to the new organization with no change in their pay and other benefits, says the order. Even before the unions went ahead with their plans of indefinite strike, the government incorporated defence production into essential services through an ordinance. This makes the strike illegal. The Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) has filed a complaint with the International Labour Organization (ILO) against the ordinance. The CITU letter to ILO called it a “blatant violation of the workers’ fundamental right to strike and freedom of association”. The letter also cited the LO convention that workers’ representatives in all the undertakings shall enjoy effective protection from any act prejudicial to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/senior-management-selection-for-ofb-psus-already-under-way/articleshow/84807101.cms||Shishir Arya

The land has been allotted on 99 years lease basis. The development work will begin after the leather cluster gets the reserved gram samaj land. The land will be allotted to entrepreneurs on 99 years lease and a tripartite agreement will be signed between UPSIDA, the company and the allot tee. As soon as the company gets the reserved gram samaj land, the company will try to get sanction of the layout and the map, said a source. It is expected that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will lay the foundation stone of the project in September this year. For the Mega Leather cluster, the reserved 35.228 acre gram sabha land is scheduled to be exchanged. The UPSIDA had acquired 42.02 hectare land and gave it to UPSIDA which later allotted it to the company and handed over the relevant papers to it. Director of the company Ashraf Rizwan received the allotment letter, the source further said. The company had purchased around 22 hectare land directly from the farmers. Rizwan said the exchange of reserve gram samaj land would likely be held in the next month. “Once the exchange process is completed, the company will apply for sanction of the layout. After seeking objections, it will be sanctioned and thereafter development work of land and allotment of plots will begin”, he said. For this project, contiguous 105 acres purchased by (SPV) Mega Leather Cluster Development (UP) Ltd d from UPSIDA, 45 acres land was purchased directly by Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) from farmers ,85 acres of gram Sabha land to be notified by DM Kanpur Nagarunder section 132. The cluster would be developed in Kanpur Sadar tehsil while 85 acre of land was purchased at Narval tehsil. Since the land belongs to other tehsil, therefore, land transfer could not take place so far because as per rules, the land must be exchanged in the same tehsil. According to Ashraf Rizwan, the project would provide direct and indirect employment to 1.5 lakh people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/upsida-allots-42-2-hectare-land-to-mega-leather-cluster-project/articleshow/84807125.cms||Anant Shekher Misra
---||Kochi||Kerala church to give welfare aid to large families; free education from 4th child onwards||KOTTAYAM: The diocese of Pala which falls under the Syro-Malabar Catholic church has come up with welfare projects for the families under the diocese with four children or more. In a circular issued by Pala Bishop Mar Joseph Kallarangatt on Tuesday, it is said that the ‘offers’ are being done as part of the “year of the family” declaration by Pope Francis. The circular will be read out during Sunday mass in the churches under the diocese on August 1. The diocese will give job priority in the diocese-owned hospital as per the educational qualifications to one of the couple who have five or more children. Another attraction of the welfare scheme is the job priority in the diocese’s educational institutions for children born as the fourth or after that in a financially-struggling family. The diocese would extend a monthly financial aid of Rs 1,500 for all the couples married after 2000 with five or more children. Free medical care is also being offered for the expenses related to the birth from the fourth child onwards at the two hospitals owned by the diocese. The tuition fees at the engineering and hotel management colleges of the diocese will be free from the fourth child onwards in a family who gets admission to these institutions. Shyju Antony, official spokesperson of the Archdiocese movement for transparency said that officially the Catholic Church stood for responsible parenthood and not incentivised parenthood. “The parents alone should make the judgment about the number of children and nobody should interfere in this,” he said. The Catholic Church is panicky over the Muslim population and want to increase its population, he said. “If the church can’t attract anyone new to its fold and has to encourage child birth among its members instead, then it’s a failure of the church,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/syro-malabars-pala-diocese-launches-sops-for-large-families/articleshow/84807158.cms||---

---||Delhi||In deep waters, Rani Khera is wary of dipping its feet in DDA’s land pool||NEW DELHI: A 2-km detour off the congested Rohtak Road connecting the industrial estate of Mundka and the satellite town of Bahadurgarh ends in waterlogged fields and open pastures. One of the fortunate pockets in the capital with groundwater level as high as 0.8 metres, the small Jat-dominated village of Rani Khera has become part of the city’s discourse for successfully resisting being turned into a garbage dump. In 2017-18, the villagers of this relatively prosperous hamlet thwarted the creation of a landfill on their rustic expanses. While awareness about the adverse effect of a waste mound was high, there isn’t much that the villagers know about Delhi Development Authority’s land pooling scheme though Rani Khera figures among the 95 villages notified for the undertaking. It could be perhaps because the villagers are wary about urbanisation. “Nobody has come to explain the policy to us,” said 75-year-old Pratap Singh Bharadwaj, a retired school principal. “In any case, we don’t want to end up living as a crammed urbanised village. Quality of life has been destroyed in such villages and livelihood depends on renting rooms to migrant workers. That type of development is not desirable,” the old man grunted. Remaining non-urbanised, however, is not guaranteed in Rani Khera. Bharadwaj said the process of unplanned development was already in progress. This is visible in the large number of realty outlets on the lanes and boards on the Rani Khera main road promising “plots hi plots”. The village sits amid open fields, flanked by Rasulpur village and a series of unauthorised colonies like Bhagya Vihar and Neel Vihar. Ravindra Kumar lives near the only johad (pond) in Rani Khera and is dismayed by the mushrooming of new kacchi colonies. “There is no drainage in places like Bhagya Vihar,” he pointed out.  “And since our village is a low-lying location, water flows in from all around, causing inundation. The houses and the local school get regularly flooded and only the use of pumps helps restore some normalcy.” Abhishek,16, who lives on the edge of the johad said that his house is the first every year to get flooded when the water overflows. “The fields in our village are regularly affected by stagnating water and crops even get destroyed,” the teenager added. Roopchand Pradhan, the last to hold the village sarpanch’s post between 1972 and 1992 before the panchayats were abolished in Delhi, said the absence of local self-governance had allowed property dealers and constructors a free hand. “What did Rani Khera get out of the panchayat’s abolition?” the 94-year-old asked. “There is now no one to listen to us even when our crops get destroyed by flooding every year.” While no one knows when the village was founded, inhabitants say people of the Dabas caste settled in Rani Khera after migrating from Rajasthan around 700 years ago. Mohit Singh, a local activist, said the households, land-owning mostly, were government employees, with teaching much vied for.  Keeping their modern needs in mind, Singh said, “When MPD 2041 is being envisioned, planners must realise that each village also needs stadiums and playgrounds to encourage sports, sewerage and drainage and localised development.” In the past five years, North Delhi Municipal Corporation has variously announced plans at Rani Khera for a waste management plant, construction & demolition waste plant and the city's first pig slaughterhouse, none of which have materialised. But the outskirts of the village continue to get new concrete pillars as DDA and DSIIDC demarcate plots for development projects. Mahaveer Dabas, a grazier, pointed at one such row of grey pillars and wondered what his village would get out of the so-called development. It is something most rural villages too are speculating about as the city plans for its next two decades.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-deep-waters-rani-khera-is-wary-of-dipping-its-feet-in-ddas-land-pool/articleshow/84807306.cms||Paras Singh

Additional SP of Kharagpur, Rana Mukherjee, said they are trying to locate the criminals who had attempted the heist and fired from revolver injuring the armed guard of the van and the other staff who came to refill the ATM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/goons-raid-cash-van-shoot-at-two/articleshow/84804582.cms||Sujoy Khanra
---||Chandigarh||No FIR against builders without DA’s approval: HC||Mohali: Punjab and Haryana High Court, on Tuesday, directed the Punjab DGP not to register FIRs against any builder for commercial disputes at the instance of any commission without approval of the district attorney. He has been directed to issue necessary directions to all senior superintendents of police (SSP) in Punjab, with further direction to communicate to all deputy superintendents of police (DSPs) and all station house officers (SHOs) of the police stations concerned, that if any such direction is issued by any commission in a dispute making out commercial offences (other than in cases where a direction is issued by a magistrate under Section 156(3) CrPC or by high court), it will follow the judgment of the Supreme Court in Lalita Kumari's case (supra). Before registration of the FIR in a casual manner, police is directed to obtain the opinion of the district attorney (DA) or deputy district attorney (legal) on whether any offence is made out or not in cases arising out of commercial dispute, said the counsel, I P Singh. The decision came after counsel I P Singh moved the HC against registration of an FIR against a builder on the complaint of a Kharar- based resident by the NRI Commission. I P Singh said that on July 24, 2019, the NRI Commission marked an investigation to the SSP, Mohali, and during investigation, a compromise and settlement was arrived at between the builder and the complainant. It was further submitted that as per the memorandum of understanding (MoU), the builder had agreed to return the money to the complainant but as the NRI Commission had already directed the SSP to register a case of fraud against the builder, the FIR was registered, he said. After the counsel pleaded before the bench that the MoU had already been submitted and the builder was not at fault, the HC quashed the FIR and issued directions that no FIR shall be registered without the consent of DA and DDA on the instance of any commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-fir-against-builders-without-das-approval-hc/articleshow/84804551.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

Speaking to the media on Tuesday, Raut said he enjoys a cordial relationship with Thackeray since the last 45 years and both share a good rapport. “Uddhavji is a popular chief minister; people feel that he is a member of the family. Even the country has expectations from Uddhavji as he is good human being, determined, a hardcore patriot and follows Hindutva ideology. He can lead the country and I am confident that he will,” Raut said. While asked specifically if Thackeray would take over as the Prime Minister, Raut answered, “Let’s see.” Last year, on the occasion of Shiv Sena’s 54th foundation day too Raut had said that he sees Thackeray as the future Prime Minister of India. Then, replying to Raut’s remarks, Thackeray had said that he wouldn’t lead the nation, but would be “happy if a Shiv Sainik becomes Prime Minister one day”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/uddhav-can-be-pm-lead-nation-in-future-in-mumbai-raut/articleshow/84809349.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Goa||Goa: Three-day session set to be stormy as battle lines drawn||PANAJI: The three-day monsoon session of the Goa legislative assembly, which will begin from Wednesday, is likely to be stormy with the opposition all geared up to corner the state government on various crucial issues plaguing the state. While chief minister Pramod Sawant held a meeting with MLAs from his party, leader of opposition Digambar Kamat held a meeting with members of opposition parties, including independent MLAs, to chalk out the floor management plan for the assembly session. The monsoon session will see the passing of the full budget and the Goa Mining Corporation Bill, which will pave the way for the early resumption of mining activities in the state. During the session, the government will answer 605 questions, including 197 starred and 408 unstarred ones. As of now, nine government bills have been listed for introduction and passing. Five private member resolutions have also been listed. A government official said that more bills are likely to be introduced. The session is likely to be stormy with the opposition geared up to corner the state government on various crucial issues plaguing the state. Issues that are likely to be debated in the monsoon session include, Covid mismanagement and the deaths that occurred at the Goa Medical College due to oxygen shortage, poor connectivity for online classes, resumption of mining, Mhadei matter, coal handling, the three linear projects at Mollem, double tracking, strengthening of the anti-defection law and the draft Coastal Zone Management, among others. “We have listed out several issues to corner the government on the floor of the house, including calling attentions, but they should be allowed to come up in the House,” Kamat said. Due to the pandemic, the state government has restricted the assembly session to a very short span. The opposition said that they have pointed out that there is no general discussion on the budget. “The tokenism of the forthcoming three-day assembly session is another chapter of fraud and deceit by this Sawantawadi government. We have repeatedly demanded a full session to be held as there are many important and critical issues facing Goans today as also our future generations, which have to be debated and discussed,” president of Goa Forward, Vijai Sardesai said. While the opposition had demanded a 10-day monsoon session of the legislative assembly at the business advisory committee (BAC) meeting, the government was firm on a three-day one due to the pandemic but assured the opposition to summon the assembly in October. In May, the governor had prorogued the 14th budget session from May 12. Sardesai said that his party is committed to having a united opposition against the “corrupt and dysfunctional government”. “It is our duty to expose the deeds of this government,” he said. In March, the state legislative assembly session was cut short by over two weeks and adjourned till July 19 after the state election commission declared the schedule for the second phase of the municipal elections, bringing into force the model code of conduct.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/three-day-session-set-to-be-stormy-as-battle-lines-drawn/articleshow/84807152.cms||Murari Shetye

As many as 41 two-wheelers, stolen from across state and other states, have been recovered from them. The gang’s kingpin, who managed to flee, has been identified as Chotey Chandel of Tedha village, Hamirpur. The two aides of Chandel, who have been arrested, were identified as Bauwan and Mohit Chandel of Bidhnoo area of the district Kanpur. DCP South Raveena Tyagi said the Naubasta police arrested Bauwan near Samadhi Puliya during a vehicle checking drive on Monday night. He was riding a stolen two-wheeler. “On being questioned, the accused confessed to have stolen several vehicles along with his two-aides including king-pin Chotey Chandel and Mohit Chandel. He also said that the stolen vehicles are parked at their houses,” the DCP said. “During a raid at the king-pin Chotey Chandel’s house in Tedha village in Hamirpur, police recovered 20 stolen two-wheelers. Chotey, however, managed to give police a slip. Similarly, a police team recovered 15 stolen two-wheelers from Bauwan’s house and 6 stolen vehicles from Mohit’s house in Bidhnoo are of the district,”the police official said “They used to prepare fake documents to sell stolen vehicles. The involvement of employees of the transport departments of various cities cannot be ruled out,” added another police official.

Local Congress functionaries, however, said that they were unaware of any such development. “Dinesh Gundu Rao (AICC secretary in charge of Goa desk) spoke to me. He said that the Congress leadership has agreed to an alliance with GFP. Modalities, however, are yet to be discussed,” Sardesai said. He also said that GFP would contest 12 seats in the 2022 polls, and that the candidates would be selected after a “thorough survey and research”. GFP currently has 3 MLAs in the state assembly, next only to Congress, the principal opposition party that is left with 5 MLAs after 10 of its legislators deserted the party to join BJP in July 2019. Sardesai has for long been advocating a united political opposition against BJP, but his moves have been rebuffed by a faction within Congress. State Congress president Girish Chodankar too had in the past expressed his disinclination for any tie-up with GFP. While walking out of the NDA earlier this year, Sardesai had urged all anti-BJP parties to form an alliance under the banner of ‘Team Goa’ to take on the saffron party in the 2022 assembly elections. Speaking to TOI on Tuesday, Chodankar, however, said that he wasn’t aware of any discussion held between Sardesai and Rao as claimed by Sardesai, but stressed that talks on alliance hadn’t yet started at the local level. “The central leadership will first start a consultation process with local functionaries and the cadre before deciding on the proposal of an alliance,” Chodankar said. “As party president, I am not aware of any talks that have happened in that regard. The leadership has told us that local inputs will be taken from leaders and cadre on the alliance issue and that a call will be taken at an appropriate time. This was during the last talk I had with our party leadership on alliance.” Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat also denied having any knowledge of the alliance proposal finding favour with the Congress high command. “Dinesh Gundu Rao had made a statement (during his Goa visit) that the party was open for alliances, and that the party would take a right decision at the right time. On that basis, perhaps, Vijai may have made that statement,” Kamat told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-gfp-alliance-on-cards-says-vijai/articleshow/84807181.cms||---
---||Pune||Indian realty assets ‘stress-free’, says report||PUNE: A report on debt among real developers by observers Anarock has found that more than two-thirds (67%) of the nearly Rs7.5 lakh crore lent to developers is “stress-free”. Pune leads cities when it comes to stressed assets as a proportion of the total loan (40%) to the city’s developers. The report found that 15% of the accounts nationally needed monitoring, but have at least partial scope for recovery and resolution, while 18% are under “severe” stress and need to be attended to by lenders and regulators. Most of the debt under “stress” or “severe stress” is held by smaller, Grade B and C developers, who have suffered from poor visibility, high cost of land and the arrival of measures such as demonetization, GST and stringent measures under authorities such as RERA. Around 55% of the advances to Grade B developers are under “severe stress”, while the proportion goes up to around 73% for Grade C developers. In contrast, around 75% of advances to Grade A developers is “stress-free”, Anarock noted. Pune is followed by Delhi-NCR and Mumbai, at 39% and 37% respectively, when it comes to stressed assets as a proportion of the city’s pie in the real estate debt. Anarock noted that thouh Pune was still dependent on the housing market, its share of the debt pie was smaller than that of other markets. “Pune developers’ debt has more exposure towards residential projects than commercial ones as compared to the national average. Though the stress levels in Pune may be higher, the overall data indicates that out of the total Rs 7.5 lakh crore of loans given to developers across the country, Pune comprises a mere 4% share (approximately Rs 30,000 crore). Of this, only 40% (around Rs 12,000 crore) is under high stress,” said Shobhit Agarwal, MD and CEO of Anarock Capital, who compiled the report. Mumbai, on the other hand, commands 44% of the total loan book to real estate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/indian-realty-assets-stress-free-report/articleshow/84804585.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

According to the district agriculture department, kharif sowing in the district has increased from 34% to 79% in the just past 10-12 days. Vivek Sonawane, the Nashik district superintending agricultural officer, said the sowing would touch 90% within the next week. Plantation of paddy in the district’s tribal belt has also gained momentum following good rainfall in Igatpuri, Trimbakeshwar, Peth and Surgana areas. The normal kharif acreage in Nashik district is estimated at 6.6 lakh hectare. Sowing has now been completed on 5.3 lakh hectare. Maize, cotton, bajra, moong, urad, soyabean, jowar and bajra are the major kharif crops in the region. Maize sowing usually accounts for 35% of the acreage, while bajra and paddy share 17.4% and 14.6% of kharif sowing area, respectively. Normally, the area under maize cultivation in the district is little above 2 lakh hectare. This time, sowing has already been done on 2.2 lakh hectare. Roughly 106% of maize sowing has been done so far, and it is expected to increase over the next week. Of nearly 1 lakh hectare cultivation area, bajra has been sown on 69,350 hectares (59%). Paddy plantation is now picking and of the expected paddy cultivation on 78,613 hectare, plantation has been done on 48,786 hectare (62%).

The rate of sugarcane was increased by the Akhilesh and Mayawati governments. The Yogi government has not increased any rate in four years”. Tikait said that the farmers organization will put all its energy under the banner ‘Mission UP-Uttarakhand’ in both these states, so that every village becomes a hot spot of farmers’ movement. “In Modi-Yogi’s government, the farmer has suffered a lot.

Kejriwal alleged that Sawant insulted Goa’s political greats by comparing the current netas to them. "... the current BJP neither has the greatness of Bhausaheb Bandodkar, integrity of Dr Jack Sequeira or vision of Manohar Parrikar,” Kejriwal tweeted, adding that Bandodkar would have been “insulted by the way MLAs have been bought and sold”. He also said that Sequeira didn’t fight to see Goan votes being bought and sold, and that Parrikar didn’t work tirelessly to see Congress MLAs being bought wholesale. Sawant was quick to reply, and accused the Delhi CM of being selective. “You have ignored our present leaders whom I mentioned in my tweet (Rajendra Arlekar and Shripad Naik), who have risen from the grassroots. They are the epitome of integrity & humility.” He added that there are politicians from Goa with whom Kejriwal and his party are holding discussions and meetings. “There are also some politicians, including from Congress, who have joined your party. Are these Goan politicians third class?” Kejriwal’s tweets came in reply to Sawant's allegations that AAP has “always indulged in cheap politics through constant protests & theatrics”. “But to say Goans are third-class politicians is an insult to great sons of the soil like Bhausaheb Bandodkar, Jack Sequeira, Manohar Bhai Parrikar, Rajendra Arlekar or Shripad Naik,” Sawant had tweeted on Monday. “AAP is free to create hype for their political benefits but to come to Goa and insult our leaders is unacceptable,” Sawant had tweeted, hours after the power ministers of Goa and Delhi engaged in the heated debate on power. “My colleague and Goa’s power minister Nilesh Cabral represented the people of Goa today against the politics of falsehood, lies and misleading propaganda. He burst the myth of freebies and how it makes people lose out in the long run,” Sawant had tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-kejriwal-spar-on-twitter-over-great-netas/articleshow/84807236.cms||---

Although the aim of promoting e-vehicles is being supported, the civic body’s idea of renting these vehicles has raised eyebrows. More than Rs 23 crore is expected to be spent over the next eight years on renting the vehicles. After the contract period ends, PMC will have to buy the vehicles at 5% of the maximum retail price. Opposition parties have objected to the proposal stating that it will cause loss of public funds. The civic administration tabled the proposal before the standing committee on Tuesday. It stated that the expense on the proposal will be incurred even after the current financial year, so a policy decision is needed. Once the standing committee gives the proposal a go-ahead, it will be sent to the general body for final approval. “Drivers’ services will also be sought along with the vehicles. The contract will last for eight years,” stated the proposal. The opposition party leaders said that the project should be scrapped. “PMC has recruited drivers. This move has placed a question mark on their bread and butter. They have approached us with their concerns over their future,” said Nationalist Congress Party’s Deepali Dhumal, leader of the opposition in PMC. She added that the PMC already has vehicles in good condition and there is no urgency to buy the e-cars. Aba Bagul leader of Congress in PMC said that apart from undue hurry in procurement, the proposal also lacks due process. “The provisions of Municipal Act that have been invoked are not relevant. There is hardly any urgency to buy these vehicles,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/civic-body-considers-e-vehicles-for-daily-use/articleshow/84804645.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

This was announced by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday, while asking Delhiites to suggest names for the awards. The government has released an email address — padmaawards.delhi@gmail.com — for submitting the suggestions.  People can send in their recommendations by August 15 with a description of why they think the person named deserves the honour. The names would be checked by a “Search and Screening Committee” headed by deputy CM Manish Sisodia to decide the final list of nominations. Recently, Kejriwal had written to PM Narendra Modi seeking Bharat Ratna for doctors and healthcare workers. “This decision has been taken to honour the service and sacrifice of the medical community during the Covid-19 crisis. We have asked the people of Delhi for the nominations as they are the ones who actually know the most about the dedication and hard work of our doctors,” the CM said, while thanking doctors and healthcare workers for relentlessly giving everything they could to save lives during one of the biggest crises seen by humanity. Every year, the country honours a select few with Bharat Ratna and Padma awards. The central government gives these awards to people who have showcased excellent work in their field. For all three Padma awards, the Centre asks people to nominate figures who they think deserve the honour. State governments are also asked to nominate such personalities. Expressing his heartfelt gratitude, Kejriwal said, “During the pandemic, doctors, healthcare workers and paramedical staff helped save a lot of lives. They served humanity with impeccable commitment. I know many doctors and healthcare workers who did not go home for days. I also know many doctors and healthcare workers who got infected while tending to patients and were, unfortunately, martyred on duty.” “The entire humanity is indebted to such doctors. No matter how much we thank them, it won’t suffice for their sacrifice. Delhi government is the only government in the country that gave a Samman Rashi of Rs 1 crore to frontline workers who were martyred on duty,” added the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-asks-delhiites-to-suggest-names-for-padma-awards/articleshow/84807281.cms||AlokKNMishra

The arrested suspects were Shubham Phuge (26), the son of Datta Phuge, who was known as ‘gold man’; Prathamesh Waykar (19); and their 16-year-old accomplice. “The murder was the fallout of an argument that occurred while the friends were consuming liquor. This took place on Phuge’s terrace in Bhosari sometime during the night intervening July 25 and 26,” Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said. The victim, Aman Dangle, had slapped Phuge after the argument turned heated. “Angered, Phuge and Waykar took Dangle to Bhosarigaon. They also called the minor to the location and then brutally assaulted Dangle with sharp weapons. They damaged his face so that his identity could not be ascertained,” the police commissioner said. Dangle’s wife told the police that he had called her at night on July 25 and was drunk. “When a team of police reached Phuge’s home, they saw that he was about to escape and took him into custody,” Prakash said.

---||Gurgaon||Tree felling for construction: New rules on cards||Gurgaon: The Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG) has proposed a regulation for tree felling and pruning in the areas under its jurisdiction. The civic body has proposed that residents will have to seek permission to cut or prune a tree from the nodal officer of the MCG’s environment and sustainability wing. A team will then visit the site to ascertain whether it is necessary to cut the tree or not. The applicant will also have to compensate for the move by depositing charges to plant 10 times the number of trees felled and will also have to bear their maintenance cost for three years. The regulation will be tabled in the MCG House meeting to be held on July 31. The corporation proposed the regulation after the forest department asked it to first review applications for tree felling on the basis of environmental consequences before forwarding them. In a letter to the MCG commissioner on June 2, the department said more trees are being cut because of the recent increment in the floor area ratio and permission to build four floors on residential plots with a provision of stilt parking. “As per the proposed tree felling/pruning regulation, the applicant will have to first seek permission from the nodal officer. We will first check whether the tree is obstructing the entry of the main gate or construction of the house, besides other conditions set to grant permission for tree felling. Once the applicant deposits compensation charges, we will forward the application to the forest department for their final approval. Once the approval is granted, we will cut down the tree,” nodal officer Subhash Yadav said. MCG officials said that as per the existing practice, the forest department levies the compensatory charge of planting 10 times the number of trees felled only in case the applicant is a builder or an organisation. Since the application will now go from MCG to the forest department, the applicants or individuals applying for tree felling will have to deposit the charges to the corporation. The proposal also recommends a penalty on those engaged in illegal felling and pruning of trees. It has been proposed that tree felling without MCG’s permission shall be considered as an offence under the Municipal Act, 1994 and Environment Protection Act, 1986. The offender will have to deposit the cost of compensatory plantation of 20 times the number of trees felled illegally with three years' maintenance. For illegal pruning of trees in MCG areas, those pruning branches more than 25cm in diameter without permission will have to pay a fine of Rs 1,000 per branch. “If the offender fails to deposit the amount, the matter shall be filed in the special environment court, Faridabad for prosecution,” the proposed regulation states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/tree-felling-for-construction-new-rules-on-cards/articleshow/84809582.cms||Vishakha Chaman
---||Patna||No Covid patient in Bihar died due to oxygen shortage: State health minister Mangal Pandey||PATNA: State health minister Mangal Pandey on Tuesday said no Covid patient in Bihar died due to lack of oxygen or unavailability of equipment. He also denied any death due to delay in providing an ICU bed to any Covid patient. Pandey was replying to a starred question raised by Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra in the Vidhan Parishad on the seond day of the monsoon session. Mishra said a large number of Covid patients died in the second wave and over 30% of them due to infection in the ICU as the equipment were not properly sterilized and hygiene was not maintained. He also said lack of oxygen and failure to provide an ICU facility to the Covid patients were also the reasons behind many deaths. He further said these problems had been pointed out by the doctors of AIIMS-Patna during a training programme for the healthcare workers in which health minister Pandey and Union minister of state Ashwini Kumar Choubey were also present. However, the health minister clarified that the doctors in the training session raised such issues to make the healthcare workers aware of different problems which could occur. He further said the government was taking up all necessary steps to strengthen the health infrastructure. However, Mishra alleged that a large number of dead bodies were thrown in the Ganga. Earlier, RJD MLC Sunil Kumar Singh demanded discussion on Covid-19 and preparations for the third wave. He said over 5,000 people in Bihar lost their lives in the first and second wave and the government was not taking important steps to tackle the predicted third wave. “A large number of people had to sell their land to clear the hospital bills. Even though the third wave has been predicted, the government is not taking sufficient steps and the pace of vaccination is slow compared to the huge population of Bihar,” said Singh. Another RJD MLC, Ram Chandra Purbey, also made a request to the chair to immediately discuss this issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-covid-patient-in-state-died-due-to-oxygen-shortage-minister/articleshow/84804747.cms||Sheezan Nezami

They are checking copies of final year students as they have to apply for admission in other institutes or get placement offers. The Panjab University Teachers Association (Puta) is boycotting the evaluation under the banner of Punjab Federation of University and College Teachers Organisation (PFUCTO) to press their demand for sixth pay commission benefits according to UGC pay scale. They are also demanding the seventh pay commission benefit. The boycott has been going on for almost three weeks now and the teachers have chalked out the future strategy. In such a situation, results of students of the first and second year will be delayed and they will not be promoted to next year. However, the university is trying to find a way out. Puta secretary Amarjit Singh Naura said, “The demand of teachers is justified so the state government should accept it. Till the demand is not met, teachers will not check copies of first and second-year students.” He said they had planned a series of protests if their demands were not taken seriously. “We are not asking for something which cannot be done by authorities,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/for-now-pu-to-not-check-copies-of-first-second-year-students/articleshow/84804709.cms||---

Terming them as “real sharks” in a tweet earlier in the day, he sought a thorough investigation into builders who have not fulfilled their commitment to buyers, including those who did not start projects after taking money from people. He asked the special investigating team (SIT) to put up a public notice inviting complaints from aggrieved house/apartment owners. "To deal expeditiously with the erring builders and realtors it is a must that early and effective action be taken; let us not wait for people to come up one by one rather SIT should invite all complaints pro-actively through a Public Notice and take punitive action against the cunning builders,” Tewari said in a statement to the press. Non-provision of basic amenities, deficiency in services, delayed possession, false promises, failure to complete projects in stipulated period are a few violations by realtors robbing people of their hard earned money, said Tewari, adding that he would continue to flag the issue on all forums to ensure justice to gullible buyers. Tewari has been calling out the real estate mafia, leading to constitution of a special investigating team (SIT) by senior superintendent of police (SSP), Mohali. His efforts led to registration of FIRs against a number of builders carving unauthorised colonies in peripheral areas of the district. Tewari also urged Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to take strict action against the real estate mafia in Mohali, Kharar and New Chandigarh for failing to fulfil their obligations to the people to whom they have sold plots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sit-must-pro-actively-investigate-real-sharks-fleecing-people-mp/articleshow/84804746.cms||---

We have to stay indoors. Now, we are also left without any electricity,” said Baburao Bangare, the sarpanch of the Vavi Harsh village, in Trimbakeshwar taluka. Other village residents said that having no electricity at night can be dangerous for them, as wild animals, especially leopards, venture into the villages when it is dark. TheThe villagers are then forced to remain indoors after dusk. The villages that have been facing the extended power cut include Take Harsh, Vavi Harsh, Deogaon, Take Deogaon, Aswali Harsh, and others. The MSEDCL officials said the power issue came up because of the heavy rainfall that damaged the infrastructure that drew power from the Vaitarna sub-station for the various villages in the vicinity. “At least four electricity poles have tilted due to the very heavy rainfall and strong winds. The soil here has loosened,” said Mukund Prajapti, the deputy executive engineer at Igatpuri. The repair work is being carried out on a war-footing, but the continued rainfall has hindered the work to erect the poles and draw the wires on these poles. “We are likely to finish the work by Wednesday morning,” the officers have said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/no-electricity-in-8-rain-hit-villages-in-trimbakeshwar/articleshow/84807336.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The issue was discussed during a national-level meeting of travel agents held on Tuesday. Canada has banned all direct flights from India till August 21. During that period, passengers who travel to Canada from India via an indirect route will need to obtain a pre-departure negative Covid-19 test result from a third country before continuing their journey to Canada. Given these developments, a travel agents’ body, Travel Agents’ Federation of India (TAFI), Gujarat, made a representation to the external affairs ministry. “We demand that the Canadian government accept and validate Indian RT-PCR reports and allow Indian students, permanent residents, and work-permit and visitor visa holders to enter directly without any transit hassles,” states the representation. Manish Sharma, chairman, TAFI-Gujarat chapter, said: “Students have to bear an additional cost of at least Rs 2-2.5 lakh to get to Canada because they have to transit through another country.” Sharma went on to say: “Moreover, those travelling via different countries must also comply with all the restrictions and regulations of these countries, which frequently keep changing.” An estimated 15,000 students are set to travel to Canada this year, according to TAFI-Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/address-travails-of-canada-bound-students/articleshow/84807385.cms||---

The offence was committed in 2015 and Parmar was sentenced by a court in 2019. He has now been behind bars for more than four years and two and a half years remain of his sentence. When Parmar was produced before the court through video conferencing, he told the court, “When I got convicted, I filed the appeal. It has been two and a half years. I have spent nearly five years in your custody. Now two years are left. I have decided that I should complete my sentence in your custody. I want the court to dismiss my appeal.” The judges questioned whether he wanted dismissal of his appeal because his lawyer did not appear for last three hearings and his case was not being heard. The judges also remembered that his lawyer complained that Parmar’s father was pressuring him to withdraw the appeal. They told the convict that if he feels a financial burden, legal aid would take care of it and his family would not have to bear any expense. The court offered him help to solve his issues. To the court’s queries, Parmar said, “The case is not being heard. My financial condition is not good. My mother passed away in the fifth month of this year. My father is a driver with a private firm. With my mother’s demise, he is in depression. My father and I are tired now… I have accepted my punishment and I will serve the sentence. Please dismiss my appeal.” Parmar also denied seeking dismissal of his case under any pressure or fear. He told the court that his father also asked him to show some courage and spend the remaining years of his sentence in jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/weary-of-tareekh-pe-tareekh-convict-asks-hc-to-dismiss-plea/articleshow/84807381.cms||---

Purushottam and Manzar, both residents of Basant Vihar, Kalka, lodged a joint police complaint. They alleged that they were approached by Pooja Khachi, who claimed to be an agent of Arise Himgiri India Nidhi Limited, having its office in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh. They said it was owned by Nitin Srivastav, a resident of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. The complainants said that Pooja lured them citing various benefits. She assured them of good returns if they invested in the firm for one year. Thereafter, they said they started investing Rs 200 per day in the firm from March 15, 2019 to March 15, 2020. Due to Covid, Purushottam extended payment till May 2020 and paid Rs 1,21,230 while Manzar paid Rs 30,000. They said when they approached Pooja for the promised returns, she dithered citing Covid pandemic. When they went again, she made another excuse, they said, adding that when they asked her to refund the money they had spent, she threatened them. The victims told the police that when they inquired personally, they came to know that the accused and owner of the finance firm had made many other such firms and were taking money from people but not giving any returns nor returning the invested amount. Police registered a case under Section 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating) and 120-B (punishment for criminal conspiracy) of the IPC, Section 3 of Haryana Protection of Interest of depositors in Financial Establishment Act, 2013 at Kalka police station.

Pankaj Garg, the deputy conservator of forests, Nashik West, said the department was proposing works worth Rs 13 crore the funds that would be sought from the district planning committee. “The rockfall at Gangadwar on July 15, and that the one steps at the base of the Brahmagiri mountains are due to the weathering effect. Therefore, we have decided to take several measures to cut down such risk,” Garg said. He said various works that would be proposed in a couple of days to the district administration include putting up of wire mesh as locations where there are lose rocks as well as cementing the rocks that can be preserved. The department will also repair the railings and the steps that might have damaged. The officer said the movement of monkeys is also a major problem that needs to be addressed. “We have decided to plant fruit-bearing plants on the Brahmagiri mountains at locations that do not affect the movement of people. The monkeys would not need to come near people then,” Garg said. Falling of rocks is a common occurrence here and is not linked to any development activities as this is a forest conservation area.

---||Pune||Bangladeshi couple in Pune awaits travel papers for reunion with kids||PUNE: The wait for emergency travel documents from Bangladesh has compelled Mohammed (31) and his wife, Majida (28), to spend their days at the Faraskhana police station in the city for over one-and-a-half months now. The Bangladeshi couple had served their two-year term in the Yerawada jail for illegal stay in the city and were released in June. Police said the deportation orders of Mohammed were ready, but the Emergency Travel Certificate was yet to be issued by the Bangladesh Deputy High Commission in Mumbai. “We have three children — daughter Khadija (12) and sons Riyaz (10) and Bisti (8),” Majida told TOI, showing their photographs. “A police ‘bhaiya’ helps me make calls to my children, who are staying with my husband’s mother at Dumuria village near Khulna city in Bangladesh. I want to meet my children. They don’t have money and there is no one to look after them, apart from their aged grandmother” she said. Mohammed said, “My wife and I never went to school and we cannot read or write. I used to drive a threewheeler ‘tum-tum’ to earn a livelihood in Bangladesh. We were happy with our lives there. In January 2019, I came across a man, who identified himself as Azizul Shaikh, at Dumuria. He promised me a good job with a company in India. We crossed the international border one night and reached Kolkata. We boarded a train to Pune from Kolkata in February 2019.” He said, “In Pune, a local agent whose name I do not know, took me to a building in the red light district of Budhwar Peth and told me that my wife, and not me, would get a job. I then realized that they had sold my wife to a brothel. I resisted and did not allow my wife to work in the brothel. The agent and others then tipped off the police about our stay in Pune city.” Senior inspector Rajendra Landge of the Faraskhana police said, “The couple from Bangladesh is under restrictive orders and cannot leave the police station.” As of now, a police constable is looking after the couple by arranging their tea, breakfast, snacks, lunch and dinner free of cost. For Eid, the police bought Mohammed and Majida new clothes and ordered biryani for them. The staffers at the police station also share their lunch boxes with them. The couple sleeps on the benches or floor of the police station and uses the washroom facilities there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bdeshi-couple-awaits-travel-papers-for-reunion-with-kids/articleshow/84807443.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Trichy||Date for Cucet likely to be out in a week||Trichy: The date for the entrance test for integrated programmes offered by the Central University of Tamil Nadu (CUTN), Tiruvarur, is likely to be announced in a week, according to a university official. “The consortium of 13 newly formed central universities, of which CUTN Tiruvarur is a part of, may announce central university common entrance test (Cucet) in a few days for admission to this academic year (2021-22),” said a senior official from CUTN Tiruvarur. The announcement has been delayed this year over the pandemic due to which students are joining arts and science colleges. G Saranya, 18, who wanted to join the integrated BSc BEd Mathematics programme said that the university website says that the admission procedures for this academic year will be notified shortly. But other arts and science colleges in the state are on the verge of completing the admission process. “While these colleges started admitting students much ahead of the Class 12 state board examination results were announced, the admission picked up pace after the results. We cannot afford to lose our chance of getting a seat in a popular college,” she said. There are over 40 central universities in the country, a few are making admissions based on marks and some have their own entrance exam. Asked on the possibilities of having Class 12 marks a criterion for integrated programmes, the official said they received 90,000 applications for 700 seats in the university list year. It would not be feasible to shortlist students for admission based on this criterion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/date-for-cucet-likely-to-be-out-in-a-week/articleshow/84804860.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Kolkata||Porn rackets lure women with quick money, acting jobs||Kolkata: Luring women from lower-middle class families with quick money or threat of dire consequences, along with fake promises to aspiring models and actors for a break in web series industry, are ploys used to force women into pornography by multiple rackets in the city. The arrest of a cinematographer and a make-up artist in Salt Lake, who allegedly forced a woman into a steamy short video last week, followed by a similar complaint by two aspiring models in New Town on Sunday, has laid bare the tricks used by the porn industry. “They are approached by renowned photographers, videographers and make-up artists on social media to work in ad shoots or appear for web series auditions. They initially provide them with a plain script and later change it into a steamy and bold content. If the women refuse, they are either asked to pay for the shoot or are threatened with dire consequences,” said an officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate. The presence of guest houses in Salt Lake, New Town, Baguiati and Rajarhat area make it easier to shoot these porn sequences, that are later sold to sites outside India. “Earlier too we have busted a few rackets while they were shooting inside guest houses at New Town. We have started a fresh drive and have notified the guest houses accordingly,” said another senior official. Police said, a working professional from Sodepur had complained that a photographer and a make-up artist had called her at Central Park in March for a saree shoot. She was then allegedly asked to shoot a porn sequence with a male actor. “I needed work and they had promised the video wouldn’t be released in India. But in two weeks, it had gone viral,” said the complainants. Another model in New Town alleged that she and her friend were made to participate in a porn video in the garb of a saree shoot at a Ballygunge studio.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/porn-rackets-lure-women-with-quick-money-acting-jobs/articleshow/84804868.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolhapur||Maharashtra Deputy CM: Panel to study Panchaganga changes, debris & sand to be removed||KOLHAPUR: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who visited several flood-affected areas in Kolhapur district on Tuesday, held an extensive meeting with the authorities of various departments. He said that a one-member panel under a retired principal secretary of the irrigation department will be set up to study the changes in the Panchaganga river stretch that may be triggering frequent floods in the Kolhapur district. “Some experts have suggested the removal of debris and even sand from the Panchaganga riverbed. The debris brought down by the landslides may have reduced the depth of the river. Also, there are tree outgrowths along the stretch of the river. These trees are obstructing the natural flow of the river water. We are going to appoint a panel under Eknath Patil, who is a former principal secretary of the irrigation department. The high court and Supreme Court orders regarding the works to remove debris and sand will be taken into consideration. After the study, we will implement a river improvement programme for the Panchaganga,” said Pawar. The deputy CM pointed out that the Radhanagari dam gates are automatic and they open up only when the dam is 100% full. “Few officials and experts have said that manual gates should be installed so that the discharge can be regulated. The sudden discharge after 100% filling of the dam causes the river to swell. We will discuss this matter with the experts and find a solution,” he said. Pawar also said that he will speak to Union highways minister Nitin Gadkari to elevate the Pune-Bengaluru National Highway stretch, which often gets submerged. “The supply of essential goods was stopped to and from Kolhapur when the highway got submerged. Public representatives have sought the elevation of the highway as a permanent solution. Currently, the National Highway 48 is being six-laned. Local residents have said that the bridges should not obstruct the Panchaganga flow and the highway should be elevated on pillars and not on concrete bases. We will speak to Gadkari. In case of large capital requirement — to redevelop such highways and roads damaged due to landslides and floods — we will seek funds from the World Bank if needed.” Talking about encroachments along the natural streams and nullahs, Pawar said the local authorities have been asked to deal with such encroachments strictly. If any local authority is found allowing the encroachments to take place, action will be taken against the officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/dy-cm-panel-to-study-panchaganga-changes-debris-sand-to-be-removed/articleshow/84807427.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Poor maintenance throws cycling off track in city||Chandigarh: The pandemic-induced desire to attain peak health led many Tricity residents to take up cycling last year. However, they soon ran into obstacles like heaps of debris, unkempt grass, spreading roots of trees, bumps and patches on the roads and missing stones. Faced by such hurdles, cyclists are often forced on to the main road, where they run the risk of accidents and heightened stress. Cycle tracks are already narrow and in the absence of proper cleaning and maintenance, they have gotten narrower, restricting movement of cyclists. Broken pathways, bumps and uneven roads exacerbate the problem. Laying of pipes, construction or repair work in and around the track area leads to disjointed tracks. Fallen trees and wayward plants also make cycling difficult. While tracks in most parts of the city are in good if not perfect condition, some require repairs. A case in point is the cycle track in Sector 36, where there are heaps of debris. Another problem is car and cab drivers using cycle tracks as parking areas. A cycling enthusiast from Sector 2, Chandigarh said, “The condition of cycle tracks is appalling. Initially, I was happy that finally, cyclists had a safe place but the present condition of the tracks is worse than that of main roads. Invariably, they are dug up because of the services that go under them and regular maintenance is lacking.” Senior deputy mayor Mahesh Inder Singh said, “Introduction of cycling tracks is a good initiative and the first of its kind in the country. Problems pertaining to it fall under the domain of the administration. If transferred to the MC, we would do the needful to maintain the tracks.” When contacted, C B Ojha, chief engineer, UT, said, “We will try our best to give better facilities. The general public also must reach out to us to give requisite information.” Not all hassles are caused by poor condition of tracks. In areas like Sector 7, where the track on the route leading to Sukhna Lake is in good condition, cyclists still stray into the vehicle zone, which is dangerous.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/poor-maintenance-throws-cycling-off-track-in-city/articleshow/84804863.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 63% of vaccinated patients who died had comorbidities||Mumbai: Almost 95% Covid-19 deaths at state-run medical colleges in the past two months have been among those not vaccinated, a study by the medical education department showed. Of the 261 who died despite vaccination, 88% had taken a single shot and only 12% were fully vaccinated. The case fatality rate among the unvaccinated was as high as 35.2% compared to 13.7% in the vaccinated cohort.“The trend that emerges from the data echoes what healthcare authorities have been saying about the importance of vaccination,” said Saurabh Vijay, secretary, medical education. Echoing him, Dr Dilip Mhaisekar, director of medical education and research (DMER), said that people should no longer have inhibitions about the role of vaccination in preventing deaths. “It is important to get vaccinated. Ignorance can be the reason why some sections are still hesitating to get the shots,” he said.A further analysis of deaths among the vaccinated showed that 63% had comorbidities, while 68% were above the age of 68 years. The deaths occurred after an average of 33 days after receiving the last dose. Nearly 140 of these patients were brought dead, leaving no scope for any clinical intervention. Dr Rakesh Waghmare from the medical education department, who led the study, said that they had started tracking the vaccination status of hospitalised people from May since inoculation of common people had gathered steam only from March.About 12% of all vaccine-eligible people in the state—18 years and above—are fully vaccinated, and 25% have got one dose. A senior doctor from Sion Hospital said that deaths among elderly and even those with comorbidities have declined in the city since vaccination started. “At this stage, one can say that many Covid deaths are preventable with vaccination. It is, therefore, unfortunate that we are unable to vaccinate at a swifter pace,” the doctor added. Dr Abhijit More, convenor of Jan Arogya Abhiyan, said that it is imperative to protect those with comorbidities knowing the risk of death is higher. “People are somehow managing to get the second dose. The real challenge is to get the first dose now,” Dr More said. Soumitra Ghosh from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences’ School of Health Systems Studies said that vaccination unavailability amounts to violation of one’s right to life. “Now that we know vaccines can prevent premature deaths and serious hospitalisations, unavailability is a critical deprivation. A lot of Indians are struggling to get vaccines, including in the big cities,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-63-of-vaccinated-patients-who-died-had-comorbidities/articleshow/84807486.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Trichy||BDU to seek govt view on stopping award of degrees for BIM courses||Trichy: Bharathidasan University (BDU) has decided to seek the state government’s opinion on discontinuing the award of degrees to Bharathidasan Institute of Management (BIM) which had been an autonomous institution since 2003. More than 100 students pursuing MBA will be graduating this year from BIM which functions from Bharat Heavy Electrical Limited (BHEL) campus. The university had formed a syndicate sub-committee a few months ago to reconsider awarding degrees to BIM students. On Sunday, it decided to seek the opinion of the state government in the matter. “We are not able to determine what BIM is as of today – is it an affiliated college, a constituent college or a department within BDU to award degrees? This has happened because of change in bylaws of BIM,” said registrar in-charge G Gopinath.BIM was started as a society in 1984 with predefined bylaws under the chairmanship of former Union minister C Subramaniam. BDU vice-chancellor was the vice-chairman-cum-honorary member of the society. Its campus being in BHEL, students benefited from the industrial ecosystem.In 2003, the governing council of BIM made significant changes to the bylaws of the society which clearly said that they have got autonomy to award degrees by themselves to their students. They also got assent from the Tamil Nadu governor for the same. Changes to the bylaws virtually cut off BDU’s role in BIM since BDU vice-chancellor was removed from the governing council without any prior intimation.Asked about the issue being taken up every year during the convocation, the registrar in-charge said last year was an exception because of Covid-19. A committee has been formed to look into the issue and the state government will be consulted to arrive at a common solution, he said. A senior BIM official said they will be meeting the vice-chancellor on Wednesday to arrive at an amicable solution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/bdu-to-seek-govt-view-on-stopping-award-of-degrees-for-bim-courses/articleshow/84804913.cms||Sampath Kumar

While four were converted into government colleges in February 2019, the rest were converted in December last year to ease the financial burden on the university. The university has been paying salary to 536 guest faculty members out of which 331 are on consolidated pay and 205 on hourly basis. When the state government announced the conversion, it asked the university to pay the teachers until further orders while assuring reimbursement of the same.According to registrar in-charge G Gopinath, the university is spending about Rs 1.35 crore every month towards managing these colleges which include salary to teaching and non-teaching staff besides college maintenance. Since the university has spent Rs 194 crore in this regard over the last 12 years, it asked the state government to consider reimbursing the money besides paying the salary of staff from the ongoing academic year.Guest faculty members on consolidated pay get a monthly salary of Rs 15,000, which was revised by the previous AIADMK government to Rs 20,000 in February. It had also said that the announcement would be effective from January 2020 and the teachers would also be eligible for arrears. BDU has asked the state government to pay the arrears to the guest faculty members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/pay-salary-to-guest-faculty-of-converted-colleges-bdu-to-govt/articleshow/84804878.cms||Sampath Kumar

Her essay received an ‘outstanding essay’ award. It was a dream come true for Ankita, a space enthusiast, who wishes to work in the field of space science. The camp is named after Col. Alvin Drew, a retired US air force pilot and former NASA astronaut. It’s a seven-day camp that offers students an introduction to (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) STEM careers from the unique perspective of space. The camp is usually offered in the month of June to students in the 12-17 age group. This year the camp was held online. Students had to apply with an essay describing their interest in space and science. Students were selected for the camp based on their submissions and passion for space science. This camp has four basic features: classroom instruction, exposure to higher education environment, fully interactive science and engineering activities and tours of specialised space-related facilities conducted by experts in various scientific fields. The camp began on July 1 and ended on July 16 with a graduation ceremony attended by her parents online. Ankita said, “I had two sessions daily starting at 9pm till 12.30am with a break of 30 minutes. I got to work on many experiments and attend guest lecturers by eminent space engineers, scientists and astronauts. This was a lifetime opportunity for me. We could interact with them and ask questions related to space science and exploration. The speakers also had a lot of questions for me as I was the only Indian at this camp.” Talent competition for PCMC schools:The City Pride School, Nigdi, in collaboration with the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) education department organised an online competition. The idea was to give students of classes I to IX at municipal schools a chance to showcase their artistic talents. About 105 students participated in the online competition named Kalarang. Children explored current issues through painting, singing, oration and essay writing in the competition. The award ceremony was held on July 19 at City Pride School, in the presence of PCMC’s commissioner, Rajesh Patil. The organisers gave away prizes like, mobiles, synthesizers, scientific and intellectual games to 22 winners and their mentors. In his speech, Rajesh Patil assured special efforts to improve the standard of schools in the corporation area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-pupil-attends-virtual-intl-space-camp-bags-award-for-essay/articleshow/84807463.cms||---

One of the biggest malls in the region, Elante Mall, is receiving a bustling crowd going easy on Covid protocol. The mall management has put multi-layered security in place to guarantee visitor safety. Guards have been deployed on every floor, asking visitors to wear their masks but few follow their injunctions. Social distancing norms have been conveniently forgotten in other busy areas of the city like Shastri Market, Sector 22, Palika Bazar, Sector 19, and others. People can be seen roaming around in these markets without masks. Besides, lack of space makes social distancing difficult to implement. “After 4pm, rush increases but most people don’t wear a mask even after being asked to do so,” said Alisha Gupta, owner of a cosmetic shop in Sector 22. “People come to our shop and many do not follow Covid guidelines. They don’t even wear mask properly,” said Mayank Gautam, a shopkeeper in Sector 19. Such behaviour can be seen at Sukhna Lake as well, where people neglect wearing masks despite a challan drive conducted by police. A large number of people are seen in mini-adventure parks in Sukhna Lake throughout the day without a mask. The food court is also crowded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/covid-protocol-forgotten-in-citys-busiest-areas/articleshow/84804499.cms||---

Those arrested are related to a private company from Bhayander, which has supplied 289 conservancy staff to PCMC. “PCMC had fixed a salary of Rs17,000 per month for each staffer. But a probe revealed that company directors and office-bearers would only pay Rs9,000 to the workers. They would extort the remaining sum. Since 2017, the company had forcibly taken least Rs8 crore of these workers,” Pimpri-Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said. The fraud came to the light when some women approached the commissioner. Following this, PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil issued orders to conduct an inquiry, which revealed the company’s involvement. As per PCMC rules, workers’ salaries would be deposited in their bank accounts. “Those arrested are not company employees but were appointed to extort money. They had forcibly taken debit cards of workers and would withdraw Rs8,000 from their accounts,” Prakash said. Police have recovered 31 debit cards from the suspects but are yet to arrest the directors of the company. The police commissioner appealed to the contract workers to come forward and inform PCMC officials about their cases. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-seven-arrested-as-mumbai-firm-extorts-rs-8-crore-from-pune-staff/articleshow/84807600.cms||---

Meanwhile, the opposition Left councillors boycotted the council meeting on feeble grounds demanding the council meeting in offline mode. The dog killing issue had erupted in the Kakkanad division represented by a Congress party councillor. “As no opposition members attended the council meeting and the stray dog issue was not on the agenda, we have not discussed it,” said municipality chairperson Ajitha Thankappan. Meanwhile, animal rights activists staged a protest by covering eyes with black cloths, in front of the local body on Tuesday demanding action against the offenders. Some even brought dogs to the protest site. During the meeting, the council decided to implement a tourism project in the Kadambrayar river, which is facing pollution due to the discharge of waste from industrial units. Pedal boats, protective walls, footpaths, installing iron grills are some of the initiatives planned under the project at a cost of around Rs 95 lakhs. It also decided to issue notice to Thrikkakara Cooperative Hospital authorities asking them to vacate the building, where currently hospital medical shop is functioning.

---||Ahmedabad||Dholavira: Harappan-era time capsule||AHMEDABAD: Dholavira is not your usual tourist destination – located about 213km northeast of Bhuj, it has only one road connecting it to the mainland. Regular days do not witness much hustle-bustle except occasional buses or private vehicles. Add the hot and dry climate to the mix, and you get a site that is about 5,000 years at its oldest but is enticing only to those who are really interested in history and archaeology. However, once one is amidst the stone walls, a sense of awe descends. It was a bustling city that rose around 3000BC and went into decline around 1800BC, existing for more than 1,200 years, witnessing the rise and fall of the Harappan civilization. It had a drainage system, water reservoirs, obsessionlevel adherence to ratios and symmetry, trade in some of the finest carnelian and agate with faraway nations, and above all, an all-welcoming ‘sign board’ – literally! As the Harappan city got the coveted Unesco World Heritage Site tag on Tuesday, many at the Archaeological Survey of India and from the history and archaeology fraternity celebrated. India had presented the site for the first time in 2014 to Unesco, which culminated after seven years of meticulous documentation and representation of the site and its unique features. Dr Y S Rawat, who was associated with the site’s excavation for 13 years, said the site in a way gave a peek into interconnected cities of Harappa, but also served as a time capsule for the era. “We see one of the first pieces of evidence of pulley block system at the well in the lower town area here. We know that they had trade overseas when the conditions were favourable, in carnelian and ivory, among other things. The drainage system and toilets outside their homes indicate an elevated level of engineering,” he said.  “Several traditions – the use of ivory bangles and home design, an open area between the home and the gate – have been carried forward in communities living in the region for a long time.” Experts point out that it’s one of the Harappan-era sites that can give a ‘feel’ of a site due to a large part still being intact. Right from the entrance to elevation of the ‘upper town,’ and boundary wall to water reservoirs, majority of features can be experienced, making it a unique site from the Harappan era.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dholavira-from-harappan-time-capsule-to-a-world-heritage-site/articleshow/84807546.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Chandigarh||Haryana cancelled 2.91 lakh ration cards in last 3 yrs, Punjab 2.87 lakh||Chandigarh: Haryana has cancelled 2.91 lakh ration cards of ineligible beneficiaries in the region in the last three years. Its neighbour Punjab has annulled 2.87 lakh such ration cards while the hill state of Himachal Pradesh found 59,435 ration card holders not entitled to enjoy the benefits of the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) from 2018 to 2020. Minister of state in the ministry of rural development and consumer affairs, food and public distribution Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti shared this information during the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament on Tuesday. She said that under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), Aadhaar seeding of ration cards ensures uniqueness of beneficiaries in the public distribution system, avoiding duplicate or bogus ration cards. So far, more than 92% ration cards, at least one member of household, have been Aadhaar seeded at the national level. A total of 30 states and Union territories have completed the Aadhaar seeding of ration cards under NFSA, said the minister. Punjab government has nearly 1.41 crore beneficiaries under the NFSA out of its total population of 2.77 crore, as per the 2011 census. These beneficiaries are being distributed wheat and rice under the TPDS from nearly 17,360 fair price shops through electronic point of sale (e-PoS) machines. After the Congress came to power in the state in 2017, the SAD has been accusing the Punjab government of cancelling ration cards or blue cards of many eligible SAD workers. As nearly 3.94 lakh ration card holders in Punjab did not draw wheat after introduction of the biometric system in the fair price shops for TPDS, the government had ordered a probe in October 2018 and cancelled ration cards of those found ineligible. Responding to another question, the minister informed that the department has received 4,483 complaints regarding irregularities and corruption in the public distribution system from 2018 to June 30 this year in 36 states and UTs. Out of these, 174 complaints pertained to Haryana, 127 to Punjab, about 10 to UT Chandigarh and five to Himachal. The TPDS is operated under the joint responsibilities of the central and the state/UT governments in which the operational responsibilities, such as identification of beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act, issuance of ration cards to them, allocation of foodgrains to all fair price shops, distribution to beneficiaries, licensing and monitoring of fair price shops, grievance redressal of beneficiaries lies with the concerned state or UT government.

---||Trichy||Retrieving AIADMK is V K Sasikala’s mission: T T V Dhinakaran||TRICHY: With V K Sasikala on an aggressive political course to woo AIADMK cadres to her side in a bid to take over the party, AMMK leader T T V Dhinakaran on Tuesday said “retrieving the AIADMK” was clearly his aunt’s mission. The AMMK, he said, was launched to retrieve the AIADMK. Dhinakaran pointed out that the AIADMK was founded by M G Ramachandran and later led by J Jayalalithaa. Sasikala then led the party until she went to prison in the disproportionate assets case. “Things changed after that. Everything will be set right,” he told reporters in Trichy on Tuesday evening. On the spate of phone conversations between Sasikala and AIADMK cadres months after she announced she was stepping back from politics, ahead of the Tamil Nadu assembly election, Dhinakaran said, “She (Sasikala) will tell you. You can ask her when you meet her.” Dhinakaran said the electoral setback suffered by his party in the recently concluded assembly election would not come in the way of their efforts to take over the AIADMK reins. “Chinnamma’s (Sasikala) efforts and mine are aimed at getting back the party,” he said. On the recent searches by the directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption (DVAC) on the premises of former AIADMK minister M R Vijayabaskar, Dhinakaran said those who commit mistakes should endure the pain. He criticised the DMK government for 'forgetting' all the poll promises made by party president M K Stalin. “They forgot whatever they protested for after coming to power,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/everything-will-be-set-right-in-aiadmk-t-t-v-dhinakaran/articleshow/84805012.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Help finally reaches for animals in distress||Kolhapur: While most people have managed to leave on their own or have been evacuated from the flood-ravaged areas, many helpless animals are struggling to survive the deadly deluge. The forest department and several social groups in the city are now carrying out rescue and relief operations for the animals in distress in the flood-hit areas. Around 25 to 30 langurs have been stranded on two trees, surrounded by floodwaters at Vaghwe in Panhala tehsil. These animals have been starving for nearly four days. Avinash Taynak, the range forest officer of Panhala, said: “Using a district disaster management boat, we are trying to help these animals. As the floodwater was gushing, we had to make sure that no animal got scared and jumped into the river. We first hung a bucket of bananas to the tree. Later, we tied a 200m rope from the tree they were stuck in — all the way to the nearest landmass. We created a ropeway for their safe passage. We hung food for them at equal intervals along the rope. A few langurs have slowly started coming to the other side using this ropeway. Few villagers and forest officials are keeping an eye.” Clement Ben, the chief conservator of forests, said, “An eight-foot crocodile had washed into a nullah near the Banda Sherle village. The villagers informed the RFO Dodamarg after which the animal was rescued and released into its natural habitat. An injured turtle was found at Padavne beach at Devbag. The turtle has been given treatment and it will be released into the sea on Wednesday. Our foresters are carrying out day and night operations to rescue birds, dogs, snakes, and other animals.” Several youths have also joined hands to provide food and shelter to stray dogs and cats. Kshitija Bhat, of a Kolhapur-based animal welfare group, said, “Our team of five is providing rescue and adoption opportunities for cats and dogs. Currently, we have 10 dogs and nine cats in our shelter.” Malhar Jadhav, of the Prani Kalyan NGO, said, “We are conducting relief activities for street dogs. We are providing food and soon will start with a medical camp and mobile hospitals for these stray dogs.” Karan Yadav in the Belbaug area is providing a free hostel for cats of the flood-affected people. He said, “I am providing free food, shelter and medication for the cats till the floodwaters recede.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/help-finally-reaches-for-animals-in-distress/articleshow/84807508.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
